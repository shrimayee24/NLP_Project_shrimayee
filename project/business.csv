Supreme Court rejects plea for review of January 3 order on Adani-Hindenburg,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-rejects-plea-for-review-of-january-3-order-on-adani-hindenburg/articleshow/111767739.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has refused to revisit its January 3 judgement that had rejected an SIT or CBI probe into short-seller Hindenburg’s Jan 2022 report, which sharply eroded the share value of Adani group companies and caused a stock market meltdown.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra had disposed of a bunch of PILs on Jan 3 on finding lack of merit in their allegations about market regulator Sebi not doing its job to investigate Hindenburg’s charge of stock market manipulation by Adani group companies and a demand for a thorough probe by the CBI or a special investigation team.The court had ordered central agencies to probe Hindenburg’s role in causing loss to Indian investors.PIL petitioner Anamika Jaiswal, through advocate Prashant Bhushan, had filed a review petition in Feb alleging glaring errors in the judgment. The petition said the verdict did not take into account lapses on Sebi’s part to investigate Adani group, and disregarding Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) inputs on alleged wrongdoings by the group.During the review, the bench held that its judgment had specifically dealt with these two allegations and rejected the review petition. The order, passed on May 8 but uploaded recently on the SC website, said, “Having perused the review petition, there is no error apparent on the face of the record. No case for review under the Supreme Court Rules 2013 (is made out). The review petition is, therefore, dismissed.”In its Jan 3 order, the SC had discarded as unauthentic a report by Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which is linked to controversial billionaire George Soros, and which was relied upon by media to lend credence to Hindenburg Research’s claim of stock manipulations by Adani group companies and failure of Sebi to probe the short seller’s charges.It had said the petitioners rested their cases solely on inferences drawn from the report by OCCRP, a third-party organisation involved in investigative reporting. “The facts of this case do not warrant a transfer of investigation from Sebi. In an appropriate case, this court does have the power to transfer an investigation being carried out by the authorised agency to an SIT or CBI. Such power is exercised in extraordinary circumstances when the competent authority portrays a glaring, wilful and deliberate inaction in carrying out the investigation. The threshold for the transfer of investigation has not been demonstrated to exist (in this case),” the bench had said.",Supreme Court refused to revisit its January 3 judgement that had rejected an SIT or CBI probe into short-seller Hindenburg’s Jan 2022 report. A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra had disposed of a bunch of PILs on Jan 3.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111767764,imgsize-668081,width-400,resizemode-4/111767764.jpg"

New Delhi responded earlier this year with its own offer amid security concerns about Chinese engineers working close to its borders.“China has made an offer to us, they did a feasibility study. India has also made an offer, and will do a feasibility study,” Hasina said added, “But I would give greater priority to this being done by India because India has held up the Teesta’s waters.”",China and India both want to execute the Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration.

Interestingly, there is hardly any additional expenditure involved. It is the savings on power, canal waters, and fertiliser subsidies that need to be given back to farmers in a different form. If this is done, India can save the most fertile plains of Punjab-Haryana from potential desertification,"" it said.The paper comes months after farmer unions from Punjab were offered a package by a team of central ministers assuring govt procurement for five years to tillers who diversify into pulses, maize and oilseeds.The paper titled 'Saving Punjab and Haryana from Ecological Disaster: Re-aligning Agri-Food Policies' has concluded that the current regime is unsustainable and results in massive groundwater extraction for paddy cultivation and the two northern states accounted for a substantial part of the fertiliser subsidy as they consumed more fertiliser that their counterparts during kharif season that starts in June.""Taking Punjab as an example, the combined subsidies from the govt of Punjab and the govt of India amounted to a staggering Rs 38,973 per hectare during 2023-24. When considering additional subsidies for managing crop residues both in the field and after harvest, the financial support for paddy cultivation would easily go beyond Rs 40,000 per hectare,"" it said.With subsidies contributing to nearly one-third of the profitability for paddy, the gains from the crop are far higher than others grown during the season - as much as Rs 68,849 a hectare when compared with bajra.What has encouraged the cultivation of paddy is assured procurement at the minimum support price, something that is not available to other crops grown during the season.As a result, the paper has proposed diversification of 12-14 lakh hectare from paddy cultivation in Punjab and Haryana with govt offering upfront incentive of Rs 30,000-40,000 a hectare by repurposing power subsidy, offered by the state, and fertiliser subsidy, given by the Centre.There are other recommendations such as public-private partnership for carbon credits for diversifying away from paddy, which emits five tonnes of carbon dioxide per hectare.","A paper by ICRIER economists led by Ashok Gulati has suggested a transfer of Rs 35,000 a hectare to farmers who shift from paddy to pulses, oilseeds, millets, and maize.

Of these 523 of them are lodged in Jharkhand (282) and West Bengal (241).NALSA in its report said that these figures about convicts not filing appeals against their convictions were also due to jail authorities not ascertaining the views of inmates. NALSA counsel Rashmi Nandkumar told the bench that state legal services authorities of major states like Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, Assam, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat have not filed their responses in this regard. SC sought their responses in three weeks.Hansaria pointed out that the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee received 503 applications for legal aid from prisoners to file appeals against their conviction being upheld by the concerned high courts . In many cases, the application for legal aid has been received to file an appeal in the SC after a long lapse of time, in some cases after 20 years.Interestingly, in Meghalaya 150 of 308 convicts have filed appeals. But as many as 79 of them do not want to file appeals because they are reconciled to their punishment or have almost completed their sentences.

Maharashtra government to give pension for Warkaris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-government-to-give-pension-for-warkaris/articleshow/111762248.cms,"MUMBAI: In a bid to woo the Warkari community ahead of the assembly polls the state government has announced that it will give pensions to senior citizens who walk in traditional month-long waris (an annual pilgrimage dedicated to Lord Vithal in Solapur) to Pandharpur .In the budget, the state government announced that Mukhya Mantri Varkari Sampradaya Mahamandal will be established to provide facilities to Kirtankars, Warkaris, Bhajani Mandals as well as to manage the Palkhi routes.The pension move is being seen as significant ahead of the state assembly polls likely to be held in October especially as the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) looks to woo the community with NCP (SP) supremo Sharad Pawar and Congress’s Rahul Gandhi likely to participate in the wari.In a recent Government Resolution (GR) the state government has allocated Rs 50 crore as start-up capital to the new Warkari corporation that will be headquartered in Pandharpur. However the exact details of the pension amount are not mentioned in the GR and the new corporation will finalise the details on eligibility and amount.The government has decided to provide a fund of Rs 20,000 rupees per Dindi (group of devotees) from this year. Rs 36.71 crores has been made available for “Nirmal Vari”, a drive for providing portable toilets on the pilgrimage routes.Lakhs of Warkaris undertake a 21-day foot journey to Pandharpur. “The Warkari community has a significant following in rural areas. It is reported that senior Congress functionaries have asked Rahul Gandhi to walk with the warkaris. Even Sharad Pawar may join the pilgrimage. So the MahaYuti doesn’t want to be seen as leaving the community out. The Warkari movement has its roots in the Bhakti tradition. It can be traced back to the 17th-century saint Sant Tukaram Maharaj from Dehu. Every year lakhs of Warkaris walk to the Vithoba temple in Pandharpur from Alandi and Dehu before Ashadi Ekadashi. The wari attracts people from all communities and castes,” said a political observer.“Devotees from all over Maharashtra flock together to bow before Shri Vitthala, the deity of Maharashtra. Palkhi of Jagadguru Sant Tukaram Maharaj is departing from Dehu today. Palkhi of Dnyaneshwar Mauli will leave from Alandi on Saturday. This government is aware that the umbilical cord of Maharashtra is connected with this Vaari of Varkari Bhaktimarga, which has a tradition of about thousand years, therefore we are sending a proposal to UNESCO for the World Heritage nomination of Pandharpur wari, which is recognized worldwide as the identity of Maharashtra. The government has decided to provide a fund of 20,000 rupees per Dindi from this year, in gratitude to the lakhs of Varkaris who carry the flag of our tradition on their shoulders,” DCM Ajit Pawar had said in his budget speech.",The pension move is being seen as significant ahead of the state assembly polls likely to be held in October.

But the discom subsequently proposed several deviations in the standard bidding format and moved the regulator on June 25 for ""urgent"" approval.The regulator questioned several aspects of the tender, notably why the changes were not incorporated before starting the bidding process and how the combined purchase of thermal and solar power will benefit consumers.In its July 12 final order, the regulator accepted that awarding a combined bid with a weighted average tariff for thermal and solar projects will help achieve lower effective tariff since the entire capacity will be tied up in one process with an eligible bidder offering the lowest tariff.The discom said the projects would be awarded based on the lowest weighted average tariff after reverse e-auction, during which the bidders are expected to lower tariffs quoted in their financial bid. The freedom to lower any tariff (solar or thermal) to become competitive will further encourage tariff reduction for success during the auction, directly benefiting consumers.Separate power purchase agreements will be executed for solar and thermal projects. However, the aggregate power procurement will be complied in spirit even after that. Under the PPA, the developer has to ensure that the operations are maintained in a way that the weighted average tariff achieved for both projects is lower than the weighted average tariff calculated as per the formula used for evaluation.In case of violation, the developer has to provide adequate compensation to bring down the weighted average tariff to the desired level.Also, under a combined deal, developers have to complete the thermal and solar projects on time since failure in one can result in the termination of both PPAs, the discom said.Other benefits of combined purchase listed by the discom include meeting renewable purchase and generation obligations and supporting generation companies in carbon mitigation.","The Maharashtra power regulator has cleared the decks for state distribution company (discom) MSEDCL's proposed combo offer to purchase 1,600 MW thermal and 5,000 MW renewable power.

"World population to peak at 10.3b by 2080s, life expectancy returns to pre-Covid levels : UN report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/world-population-to-peak-at-10-3b-by-2080s-life-expectancy-returns-to-pre-covid-levels-un-report/articleshow/111669844.cms,"NEW DELHI: The world’s population is expected to peak within the current century to reach around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s, up from 8.2 billion in 2024. After peaking, it is projected to start declining, gradually falling to 10.2 billion by the end of the century.While in 63 countries, like China and Japan, population peaked before 2024, India and the US are placed among 126 countries where the peak is expected in the second half of the century or beyond 2100.Significantly, one in four people live in a country whose population has already peaked.These findings, part of the ‘ World Population Prospects 2024’ report released by the UN on Thursday, also highlight that since 2022, life expectancy has returned to pre-Covid levels in nearly all countries and areas. After a brief decline during the pandemic, global life expectancy at birth has reached 73.3 years in 2024 (an increase of 8.4 years since 1995) up from 70.9 years during the pandemic.“Further reductions in mortality are projected to result in an average longevity of around 77.4 years globally in 2054. By the late 2050s, more than half of all global deaths will occur at age 80 or higher, a substantial increase from 17% in 1995,” the report shows.By the late 2070s, the number of persons at ages 65 years and higher globally is projected to reach 2.2 billion, surpassing the number of children (under age 18). By the mid-2030s, it is projected that there will be 265 million persons aged 80 years or older, more than the number of infants (1 year of age or less).Even in countries that are still growing rapidly and have relatively youthful populations, the number of persons aged 65 or older is expected to rise over the next 30 years.According to a press statement released from New York, the analysis in the report prepared by the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) shows that the size of the world’s population in 2100 is now expected to be 6% lower — or 700 million fewer — than anticipated a decade ago according to the ‘World Population Prospects 2024’ report released by the UN on Thursday.In 63 countries and areas, containing 28% of the world’s population in 2024, the size of the population peaked before 2024. This category includes countries like China, Germany, Japan and the Russian Federation, and the total population of this group is projected to decline by 14% over the next thirty years.For another 48 countries with 10% of the world’s population, including Brazil, Iran, Türkiye and Vietnam, the population is projected to peak between 2025 and 2054.In the remaining 126 countries, including India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the United States of America, the population is expected to increase through 2054 and, potentially, to peak in the second half of the century or beyond 2100.In nine countries of this last group, including Angola, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger and Somalia, very rapid growth is projected, with their total population doubling between 2024 and 2054.The report highlights that rapid fertility declines in populous countries is a likely cause for the global population to peak within this century (80%), contrasting with a decade ago when the probability was around 30%.“The demographic landscape has evolved greatly in recent years,"" said Li Junhua, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. ""In some countries, the birth rate is now even lower than previously anticipated, and we are also seeing slightly faster declines in some high-fertility regions. The earlier and lower peak is a hopeful sign. This could mean reduced environmental pressures from human impacts due to lower aggregate consumption,” Junhua added.“The earlier population peak is due to several factors, including lower levels of fertility in some of the world’s largest countries, especially China. Globally, women are having one child fewer, on average, than they did around 1990,” the analysis shows.The data brings into focus that in more than half of all countries, the average number of live births per woman is below 2.1—the level required for a population to maintain a constant size over the long term without migration—and nearly a fifth of all countries and areas, including China, Italy, the Republic of Korea and Spain, now have “ultra-low” fertility, with fewer than 1.4 live births per woman over a lifetime.On what the journey onwards is expected to look like, the report states that the main driver of global population increase through mid-century will be the momentum created by growth in the past. ""The number of women at ages 15–49 is projected to grow from nearly 2 billion in 2024 to a peak of around 2.2 billion in the late 2050s, driving continued growth even if the number of births per woman falls to the replacement level."" Moreover, today’s youthful age structure, which is a product of past growth, will account for 79% of the population increase through 2054, adding about 1.4 billion people.The analysis also shows that the countries with youthful populations and declining fertility have a limited time to benefit economically from an increasing concentration of population in the working ages. ""In about 100 countries or areas, the working-age population (between 20 and 64 years) will grow through 2054, offering a window of opportunity known as the demographic dividend,"" the UN report states and recommends that to capitalize on this opportunity, countries must invest in education, health, and infrastructure, and implement reforms to create jobs and improve government efficiency.For some populations, immigration will be the main driver of future growth. ""In 50 countries and areas, immigration is projected to attenuate the decline in population size due to sustained low levels of fertility and an older age structure. However, in 14 countries and areas already experiencing ultra-low fertility, emigration is likely to contribute to reducing population size through 2054,"" the report states.The data also shows that early pregnancies remain a challenge, particularly in low-income countries. In 2024, 4.7 million babies, or about 3.5% of the total worldwide, were born to mothers under age 18 – and some 340,000, to girls under age 15 – with serious consequences for the health and well-being of both the young mothers and their children.The UN calls for investing in the education of youth, especially girls, and increasing the ages at marriage and first childbearing in countries where these milestone events tend to occur early will have positive effects on women’s health, educational attainment and labour force participation. ""These efforts will also contribute to slowing population growth and reducing the scale of the investments required to achieve sustainable development while ensuring that no one is left behind,"" the report asserts.","The world’s population is expected to peak within the current century to reach around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s. After peaking, it is projected to start declining, gradually falling to 10.2 billion by the end of the century.

World’s first city where non-veg is illegal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/worlds-first-city-where-non-veg-is-illegal/articleshow/111689287.cms,"Non-veg is illegal in Gujarat’s Palitana

Also Read |

Situated in Gujarat's Bhavnagar district, Palitana has become the world's first city to outlaw non-vegetarian food. This historic decision, making the killing of animals for meat and the sale and consumption of meat illegal and punishable by law, followed a protest by about 200 Jain monks demanding the closure of approximately 250 butcher shops. Palitana is renowned as a significant pilgrimage site for Jains and is also known as the Jain Temple Town, situated around the Shatrunjaya Hills.The Palitana city boasts more than 800 temples, with the Adinath Temple being the most famous and is now recognised as the world's first city where non-veg is illegal.Orders to regulate the selling of non-vegetarian food have also been imposed in Rajkot, another city in Gujarat, where the preparation and display of non-vegetarian food in public spaces have been banned. Similar regulations were enacted in Vadodara, Junagadh, and Ahmedabad. Opponents of public meat displays argue that it can offend people's sensitivities and have a negative impact.The series of orders regulating the selling of non-vegetarian food began in Rajkot. These orders prohibited the preparation and display of non-vegetarian food in public spaces. Vadodara soon followed this example, with Junagadh and Ahmedabad implementing similar regulations. Opponents of non-vegetarian food argued that the display of meat hurt their sensitivities and negatively impacted people, especially children. Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel also linked these regulations to reducing traffic congestion.However, the push against non-vegetarian food is not new in Gujarat or globally. In Gujarat, Mahatma Gandhi epitomised vegetarianism, and following his example has been considered a pious duty by millions.Mahatma Gandhi was a lifelong advocate of vegetarianism, although he experimented with meat during his school days. A friend of his elder brother convinced him to eat mutton. However, Gandhi largely avoided non-vegetarian food out of respect for his parents, who were devout Vaishnavites—followers of a Hindu belief system that prescribes strict vegetarianism.In his autobiography, Gandhi wrote about having ""meat fests"" over a year, but this led to a situation where he had to lie to his parents. He promised himself that he would abstain from meat during their lifetime. When leaving for England to study law in 1888, his mother took a vow from him to maintain vegetarianism, a promise Gandhi honoured throughout his life. In later years, Gandhi experimented with veganism, giving up cow milk and milk products, although he did consume goat milk as a substitute.Vegetarianism in Gujarat is largely influenced by the dominant Vaishnav Hindu culture. Hindus constitute 88.5% of Gujarat's population, with Jains forming about 1%, and Muslims and Christians making up about 10%. Vaishnavism is the predominant religious culture in the state.The shift towards vegetarianism in Gujarat, epitomised by cities like Palitana and policies in Ahmedabad, reflects deep cultural and religious roots. Yet, the state's evolving dynamics show a complex relationship with dietary practices, balancing tradition with changing consumption patterns. As Gujarat navigates this terrain, the influence of historical figures like Mahatma Gandhi and contemporary regulations continue to shape its culinary landscape and made Palitana as the first city where non-veg is banned.",Palitana has become the world's first city to outlaw non-vegetarian food.

The overseas collection of the film is estimated to be around Rs 20 crore from the 3-day opening weekend, and it made the film successfully surpass the 100 crore mark at the end of the first weekend.In Tamil Nadu, 'Indian 2' has grossed around Rs 30 crore in 3 days, and Kamal Haasan's film has got major support from the home state audience. Despite average reviews, 'Indian 2' got great support from family audiences and fans during the weekend. But the highly-anticipated sequel might fall deep at the box office in the upcoming days as the buzz for the film looks weak., and the film is to face a strong battle at the box office.Directed by Shankar , 'Indian 2' is a sequel to the 1996 release 'Indian', and the film marks the director's reunion with Kamal Haasan. The successful duo failed to impress the audience as the film's screenplay looked outdated, and the sequel can't match the legacy of the prequel.","'Indian 2' is a sequel to the 1996 release 'Indian', and the film marks the director's reunion with Kamal Haasan.

Her selection under the benchmark disabilities category is also under review.According to Bhore, it was the medical college’s first batch when Khedkar joined. “Khedkar had also attempted the Maharashtra common entrance test for medical admissions. But her AMUPMDC score was higher than the state CET. She had provided a non-creamy layer certificate of the NT-3 category of the Vanjari community at the time of admission. We checked all the documents at the time of submission and found them to be authentic govt records,” Bhore said.Khedkar’s non-creamy layer certificate was issued by Pathardi sub-divisional office in Ahmednagar in 2007. Her caste and validity certificates were also issued by the same office, according to college records.

The $7.5 billion deal that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella 'sealed' in 20 minutes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-7-5-billion-deal-that-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-sealed-in-20-minutes/articleshow/111712411.cms,"Microsoft's $7.5 billion GitHub deal

Earlier this year, Satya Nadella completed 10 years as Microsoft CEO. Nadella took over as Microsoft CEO in February 2014. Soon after taking over the helm, Nadella is said to have rapidly overhauled the almost 40-year-old company. Nadella is reported to have ""pushed Microsoft to embrace cloud computing and open-source software that customers could freely adapt to."" Nadella introduced a wave of open-source technologies, supercharging Microsoft’s cloud business.Over the years, under Nadella's leadership Microsoft has doubled its market share in cloud computing, cementing its role as the No. 2 behind Amazon , a position it continues to hold -- followed by search giant Google.A recent report in New York Times talks about various deals that the company has made under CEO Nadella including the $7.5 billion acquisition of developers platform GitHub . Nadella reportedly 'sealed' the deal in 20 minutes.""In 2018, he needed only 20 minutes to greenlight the acquisition of the world’s most important open-source company: GitHub, the site where developers shared and collaborated on software code,"" said the report.After executives spent years debating whether to buy GitHub, Nat Friedman, a former Microsoft executive who worked for Nadella for five years, told New York Times that he pitched the idea to Nadella and other senior leaders at an annual executive retreat at the Suncadia Resort in the Cascade Mountains.“Do we have the right to do this?” Nadella reportedly asked. ""In other words: Would people still use GitHub if it was run by Microsoft?"" The executives are said to have debated the question for 20 minutes, Friedman said. ""Then Nadella slapped his hand on the table and said, “We should do it.” Report adds that within weeks, Nadella agreed to buy GitHub for $7.5 billion in June 2018.“We will accelerate enterprise developers’ use of GitHub, with our direct sales and partner channels and access to Microsoft’s global cloud infrastructure and services,” Nadella had said on the acquisition.","Satya Nadella took over as Microsoft CEO in February 2014.

Porvorim:

River navigation minister Subhash Phal Dessai on Monday said that the former Captain of Ports (CoP) had noted in his remarks on the file that “the solar ferry boat is uneconomical” for Goa.The minister’s statement came as a response to an unstarred legislative assembly question tabled by leader of opposition Yuri Alemao. A solar boat called St Pedro was commissioned on April 4, 2022, with a capacity to carry 60 passengers to operate on the Chorao–Panaji route for three months.The ferry service was free of cost and introduced on a trial basis.An inspection report was submitted to govt for consideration, prompting officials to advise the initiation of an expression of interest (EOI) to construct solar electric boats for the state. Govt also decided to engage the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Goa, to evaluate the technical specifications of the proposals. On recommendations from IIT, the state finance department would approve the lowest bid which was by Aquarius Shipyard pvt ltd, at a cost Rs 4 crore.The LAQ response revealed that govt opted not to construct separate jetties for the solar boats, but used the existing floating jetties at Panaji and Chorao. Govt then decided to lease the boat to a private agency. “It is now decided to ‘offload’ the same boat for tourism purposes to generate revenue,” the LAQ response reads.","River navigation minister Subhash Phal Dessai on Monday said that the former Captain of Ports (CoP) had noted in his remarks on the file that “the solar ferry boat is uneconomical’ A solar boat called St Pedro was commissioned on April 4, 2022, with a capacity to carry 60 passengers to operate on the Chorao–Panaji route.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111763391,imgsize-29870,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/111763391.jpg"

It is also aligned with parent Unilever 's decision to sell the broader Pureit business to AO Smith.Pureit sells a range of water purifiers across India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Mexico, among others.HUL had first launched Pureit in Chennai in 2004 before introducing it nationally in 2008.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

All four individuals are employed at the same poultry facility and are farm workers.The recent cases are part of a worrisome outbreak of the virus among cattle, which has also resulted in human infections.A fifth case is suspected but requires further analysis for confirmation.According to the CDC, the risk to the American public remains ""low."" The infected workers reported symptoms such as conjunctivitis and ""flu-like symptoms.""In the spring, an unusual bird flu epidemic was detected in the United States, with the disease primarily affecting poultry and birds but now also found in cows. The first human infection via a cow was reported on April 1 in Texas, followed by two cases in Michigan and another in Colorado in early July.Colorado, a western US state, is currently experiencing the spread of the disease among both livestock and poultry. Experts are worried about the increasing number of infected mammals, although human cases remain uncommon. They are concerned that high circulation of the virus could facilitate a mutation that would enable human-to-human transmission.The CDC reiterated its call for precautionary measures for workers who come into contact with infected cows or poultry.","The CDC reported four new human cases of bird flu on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to eight.
