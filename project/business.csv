India opposes EU plan for border tax on carbon-intensive goods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-opposes-eu-plan-for-border-tax-on-carbon-intensive-goods/articleshow/115433158.cms,"BAKU: With COP29 negotiations entering second week, India Monday opposed any unilateral trade barrier and pitched for “four important aspects of global climate action”, saying the ambitious, action-oriented approach hinges on bold actions from countries (developed nations whose high historical emissions led to climate change) obligated to lead economy-wide emission reductions.In a clear reference to EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), New Delhi pointed out how some countries are shifting to “unilateral measures” resulting in shifting of financial burden of mitigation actions to developing nations. CBAM is a tool to put a price through imposing border tax on carbon intensive goods, like iron & steel, aluminium and cement, that are entering EU. Once it is implemented from 2026, it will put a tariff burden on such products of developing countries, including India and China, and impact their trade.“There is a need to recognise the negative impacts on developing nations due to such unilateral trade measures in the context of climate change,” said India’s environment secretary and deputy leader of the country’s delegation, Leena Nandan, while intervening during the high-level ministerial roundtable on pre-2030 ambition.The four aspects of global climate action highlighted by India include the need for scaling up innovative actions through “barrier and restrictions free” technology transfer; climate finance for enabling and implementing climate actions; enhancing international cooperation; and mutual trust.India also underlined that the developing nations should not be burdened with the rich nations’ failures on their pre-2020 mitigation targets, and developed countries should not put Intellectual Property Rights barriers to scal ing and transfer of technologies to the developing nations.“New technologies and solutions are needed to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. However, innovation in areas like clean energy, carbon removal, etc, is still in early stages and there are barriers to scaling and transfer to the developing nations,” said the environment secretary.Putting the responsibility of making COP29 a success on rich nations, Nandan said it is an opportunity for the developed countries to foster trust and realise important milestones in climate ambitions by 2030. “Achieving net-zero by the developed countries would set the foundation for a more sustainable and resilient world in this critical decade and the decades to come,” she said.On a critical issue of finance which is considered as the core of the ongoing negotiation process, the secretary said, “COP29 is a milestone COP for climate finance. It should ensure the long pending commitments from developed nations for providing substantial financial resources are made and that such climate finance is equitable and accessible.”",India opposed any unilateral trade barrier and pitched for ‘four important aspects of global climate action’ New Delhi pointed out how some countries are shifting to ‘unilateral measures’ resulting in shifting of financial burden of mitigation actions to developing nations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115433155,imgsize-1018580,width-400,resizemode-4/115433155.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In its first action of this kind against a social media platform, Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Monday ordered WhatsApp to stop sharing user data with other companies within the fold of its parent Meta, which has been slapped a fine of Rs 213 crore for abusing its “dominant position” following changes to the messaging platform's privacy policy in 2021.WhatsApp, which can challenge the order, has been directed to change its policies and ensure users are given the choice to opt out of the datasharing arrangement. It has also been asked to give users an option — through a prominent tab — to review and modify their choice.“The commission has concluded the 2021 policy update by WhatsApp on a ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ basis constitutes an imposition of unfair condition under the (Competition) Act, as it compels all users to accept expanded data collection terms & sharing of data within Meta Group without any opt out,” CCI said in a statement.Three years ago, WhatsApp, the dominant player among over-the-top (OTT) messaging platforms in the country, changed its 2016 policy on sharing data with Facebook, and removed the earlier option to opt out.CCI said that the updated privacy policy was an abuse of dominant position by Meta, given its network effects, and lack of effective alternatives.It also said that sharing of WhatsApp user data by the social media giant — whose offerings include the hugely popular Facebook and Instagram — for purposes other than providing the messaging platform’s services created an entry barrier for rivals, denying them access to the market for display advertisements.Over the years, WhatsApp has argued that messages on its platform were encrypted and it denied access to govts even in cases of crises or law and order situations, but the CCI probe indicates that certain user information was being used to throw up ads while using Facebook.The watchdog concluded further violations of the Competition Act as Meta was leveraging its dominant position among OTT messaging apps through smartphones to protect its hold over the online display advertising market.Earlier, CCI imposed penalty on Google in two cases, Rs 1,300 crore related to anti-competitive practices related to Android phones & Rs 936 crore for Play Store-related policies.",Competition Commission of India (CCI) orders WhatsApp to stop sharing user data with other companies within the fold of its parent Meta.

Delhi Airport issues advisory for passengers as smog reduces visibility

Despite Delhi's air quality index (AQI) hitting a severe level of 428, Delhi Airport assures passengers that flight operations remain normal. Low visibility procedures are in effect, and travelers are encouraged to contact their airlines for the latest flight updates. The India Meteorological Department predicts stronger winds will improve air quality to a 'very poor' level.

Watch: Ghazipur landfill vanishes! Season's first fog deepens smog in Delhi, lowering visibility

Delhi woke to its first thick fog of the season, reducing visibility to zero in some areas and shrouding landmarks like the Ghazipur landfill. This severely impacted air travel, with flights diverted from Delhi Airport due to near-zero visibility. The fog also aggravated respiratory issues for residents already grappling with 'severe' air quality, as reported by the IMD and CPCB.

BATHINDA: There was little respite in air quality in Punjab on Friday as compared to the previous day — amid visibility at the lowest ebb — even as smog and fog remained comparatively for less time in the morning.The India Meteorological Department has issued a yellow alert for fog on Saturday.Though it was less hazy than Thursday, the sun was not visible throughout the day.For most part of the day, the AQI stayed under the ‘poor’ category and ‘moderate’ at times.Zero visibility was recorded at Amritsar and Chandigarh airports till 8.30 am.The visibility was recorded at 10 metres in Patiala, 50 metres in Halwara and Faridkot, 100 metres in Pathankot, Adampur, Bathinda and Ludhiana.The worsening air quality is forcing people to remain indoors which is also impacting the election campaigning in Barnala and Gidderbaha.A number of functionaries, belonging to different political parties, said they had to reach out to people at their doorsteps or business establishments with very few people attending public meetings amid worsening air quality.The activity time in the day has shortened as the day starts after 9am and thick smog or fog starts descending early in the evening especially in the rural and outer areas.Advisories have been issued asking older people to avoid venturing out.Commuters have been asked to travel during the day and reach their destinations early in the evening.","Air quality index (AQI) hits a severe level of 428 in Delhi.

Why some families are returning adopted kids in Tamil Nadu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/why-some-families-are-returning-adopted-kids-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/115363248.cms,"As soon as they heard from the nursing home that their surrogate had delivered a healthy baby, the adoptive parents (name withheld) informed the adoption agency of their decision to return the 8and 10-year-old siblings they had adopted a few months earlier. The children, who are now back in the adoption home, will be counselled for foster care or placement in a govt home where they may grow up as orphans.Since 2020, about 12 parents in Tamil Nadu have returned children – less than 10 years old – who they legally adopted through various govt-certified agencies for different reasons. Four parents quoted “adjustment issues” as a reason for returning children. While one parent thought the toddler did not make enough eye contact during conversation another felt the child had anger issues. Some parents quoted marital or financial problems within the family, and others cited the child’s poor health. In one case it was the death of a parent. Officials confirmed that while three of them have been re-adopted, one is in foster care and the remaining still in govt homes.The social welfare department has recorded three dissolutions of adoption in 2020, four in 2021 and five in 2023. Protocols , however, are now being implemented to ensure they don’t happen again. “We counsel parents at least twice to see if we can help them retain the child. In some cases, we know parents may not have a choice. The adoption process is then dissolved to declare the adoption void,” says social welfare secretary Jayashree Muralidharan .An authorised agency applies for dissolution to the district magistrate through the district child protection unit. Once the process is completed, the child is back on the list of those “legally free” for adoption. “Considering the long wait list, most children get another chance quickly,” says Muralidharan . “In general, most adoptions are successful. Dissolutions, however, have become unavoidable due to various reasons in some cases.”Psychiatrists say parents who surrender adopted children cannot be villainised as they are seeing a rise in “adaptive challenges” for different reasons. First, as adopted children identified with early stressful childhood, many parents seek consultations for “behaviour issues” after complaints from siblings, neighbours and schools. “It’s tough on the child as well as the parent. Until some years ago, most adoptions happened within the family. A couple who do not have children will adopt their nephews or nieces, or from families known to them. The joint family system monitored the upbringing of the adopted child,” says child psychiatrist Dr V Jayanthini.Today, information about biological parents is unknown in most cases, she says. “Mothers may not have had a happy pregnancy period. They may have neglected their diet and medical care, resulting in little bonding between the mother and the child after birth. All this can be stressful for the child. When they come to new homes the process of adapting themselves may add to this stress. While in many cases they tend to settle in with love and care, some children and parents just don’t get along.”In such cases, children show pat terns of uncooperative and defiant behaviour (disruptive disorder), or they are always angry, irritable, argumentative or defiant (oppositional defiant disorder) or may express disregard for others (conduct disorders). In some cases, children may be diagnosed with neurodevelopment disorders such as autism. “I have seen such children in my clinics. They show less interest in education, pick up habits such as use of tobacco and alcohol in early teens. Some are at risk of self-harm too,” she says.Genetics also plays a role. Studies have shown adoptees have a small but known risk for depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders, says psychiatrist Dr R Thara, vice-chairman of Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF). “It is not easy for parents to return the child too. We have seen cases where they do after making several attempts to build the family,” she says.The social welfare department says it ensures all adoptive parents return the child without legal battles. “Our focus is on the child. The child should not feel unwanted or grow up in a place where he or she is not loved enough,” says Muralidharan.Every year, about 400 children are adopted from nearly 4,000 waiting at homes authorised by Child Adoption Resource Authority (Cara) in Tamil Nadu. “The average waiting time for parents is three to five years,” says a caretaker at an adoption home. Every resident Indian prospective adoptive parent (PAP), who intends to adopt a child must register online in the Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance System by applying in a prescribed format with relevant documents. “It is an intensive process. There is a home study report to evaluate parents,” says a govt social worker.The physical and mental health conditions of the parents are evaluated as a part of the pre-adoption checklist. The govt also ensures adoptive parents are financially capable and have not been convicted in criminal cases. “There are stringent age regulations,” says the social worker. While couples must be married at least for two years, single men are allowed to adopt only boys. The age of the child allotted to a parent depends on the composite age of the parent. For instance, to adopt a child less than two years of age, the composite age of the parent must be 85 years and for children between two and four composite ages of parents must be 90 years.Parents also get to see three children before they make a choice. “They may reject children who are unhealthy or disabled. Sometimes parents feel the child does not resemble them. If they don’t choose to be shown three options, they may go behind in the waiting list,” says a social welfare official.Experts feel the state must consider introducing changes to bring down cases of dissolution. For instance, Dr Thara says it is important to screen children before giving them up for adoption. “Screening should include a detailed history such as heart disease, epilepsy and diabetes in the family so that they can be detected early and treated. A proper history of mental health conditions such as alcoholism, personality issues, and schizophrenia in the family is equally critical for the new families to be vigilant about symptoms. Disparity in educational and socio-economic status can also make the child uneasy and maladjusted,” she says. This may be difficult to do as the state may often have very little family history about abandoned or surrendered children. “So, those sent for read option must have details of the problems faced by the first adoptive parents. This is to ensure children do go through trauma again and parents know what they are going to face,” says Dr Thara.","Since 2020, about 12 parents in Tamil Nadu have returned children – less than 10 years old – who they legally adopted through various govt-certified agencies.

NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has imposed GRAP Stage 4 in Delhi NCR from 8 am today, after the Air Quality Index (AQI) reached to ‘severe plus’ category.This decision was made after an urgent meeting of the GRAP sub-committee on November 17, where they analysed current air quality measurements, meteorological conditions, and forecasts from the IMD and IITM. The sub-committee had previously activated Stage-I, Stage-II, and Stage-III protocols on October 14, October 21, and November 14, respectively.The air pollution crisis in NCR worsened on Sunday, with Delhi's average Air Quality Index reaching a critical level of 441 at 4pm, falling in the 'severe' category, compared to 419 the previous day.CPCB data indicates a steady deterioration in air quality throughout the day. Delhi's AQI rose from 421 at 9am to 468 by 10pm, marking the fourth 'severe' day this month. The previous 'severe plus' reading occurred on November 13 at 454. The 4pm reading of 441 represents the second-highest measurement this year after January 14's 447.In a statement shared on X, Delhi chief minister Atishi announced the suspension of in-person classes for all students except those in Class 10 and 12, effective Monday. Schools will continue instruction through virtual platforms until further notice.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai, has scheduled a meeting at the Delhi Secretariat today at 12 noon. The session will involve Heads of Departments from all relevant departments to ensure proper execution of GRAP-IV measures in the capital city.GRAP-IV measures supplement existing restrictions from stages 1-3. The commission has now withdrawn exemptions for construction activities in public infrastructure projects. The restrictions include prohibiting non-emergency trucks and non-BS 6 compliant light commercial vehicles from entering Delhi, alongside BS-4 and older diesel-operated medium and heavy goods vehicles.Authorities predict continued poor air quality due to heavy fog and unfavourable weather conditions. CAQM indicates the likelihood of AQI remaining in the severe/severe+ category. CAQM has advised governments to consider 50% office attendance and implement work-from-home policies.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Research and Advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, “This is happening because of the combined impact of the deepening of winter inversion and trapping of high local and regional pollution. We need urgent measures to slow down further loading of pollution from the key sources.”The Decision Support System indicated that stubble burning activities contributed to 25.2% of Delhi's PM2.5 levels on that particular day.","The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has imposed GRAP Stage 4 in Delhi NCR from 8 am today, after the Air Quality Index (AQI) reached to ‘severe plus’ category.

NEW DELHI: After a 15-year gap, India has reclaimed its position as the leading source of international students in the United States for the 2023-24 academic year, surpassing China. According to the Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange 2024 report released on Monday, India registered a 23% year-over-year increase, sending over 3.3 lakh students to the US.The development mirrors India's performance in UK, where it became the top source of non-European Union students in 2022-23, with a 39% increase to 1.7 lakh students, surpassing China. The growth in Indian students in the US is most notable in graduate programmes, which saw a 19% increase to almost two lakh students, and in optional practical training participation, which surged by 41% to over 97,000.Most Indian students (64.5%) enrolled in public institutions, while the remaining 35.5% attended private universities.As per the global trends in international enrolment, US hosted an all-time high of over 11 lakh international students in 2023-24, a seven percent increase from the previous year.India and China together accounted for over half (54%) of this total. However, while India's numbers surged, China's enrolment declined by four percent to 2.7 lakh students.Indian students' contribution to the US economy in 2023 was significant, generating $11.8 billion, as per the International Student Economic Impact 2023.The percentage of Indian students pursuing mathematics/computer science as per the latest report is 42.9%, followed by 24.5% studying engineering, and 11.2% studying business/management.There are 5.4% of Indian students pursuing physical/life science programmes.Across all international students in the US, 56% pursued STEM fields, with mathematics and computer science (25%) and engineering (19%) being the most popular disciplines. Business and management (14%) and physical and life sciences (8%) follow.International students were distributed across 44 states, with the largest populations in California, New York and Texas. States like Missouri (+35%), Michigan (+14%), and Illinois (+13%) saw the highest growth in student numbers. For Indian students, Texas, New York, California, Massachusetts and Illinois were the top destinations.In 2023, international students made up six percent of the total US higher education population and contributed over $50 billion to the US economy.Sub-Saharan Africa recorded the highest growth rate among all regions, increasing by 13% for the second consecutive year. Among the top 25 countries sending students to US, eight reached record highs - Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, India, Italy, Nepal, Pakistan and Spain.Scott Weinhold, senior bureau official for the US state department's bureau of educational and cultural affairs, emphasised the broader impact of international education: ""The experience of studying in the United States not only shapes the lives of individuals but also the future of our interconnected world.""""The ties formed between the US and international students today are the basis for future business, trade, science, innovation and govt relations.""In 2023-24, over half a million graduate students (5,02,291) studied in the US, marking an eight percent increase. Additionally, 2,42,782 students engaged in OPT programmes, a 22% increase, highlighting the growing trend of students seeking practical work experience post-study.","India registered a 23% year-over-year increase, sending over 3.3 lakh students to the US.

SpaceX’s Falcon-9 places India’s Gsat-20 in orbit; satellite to boost communications infrastructure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spacexs-falcon-9-lifts-off-with-indias-gsat-20/articleshow/115426181.cms,"BENGALURU: SpaceX’s Falcon-9 rocket early Tuesday lifted off smoothly from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, and placed India’s Gsat-20 or Gsat-N2, a high-throughput satellite that is designed to elevate communication infrastructure into a desired orbit.The launch happened at 12.01 as planned, the satellite separated some 34 minutes thereafter, and was then placed in the orbit.Weighing 4,700kg and engineered for a 14-year mission, the Gsat-20 represents a significant leap in satellite communication technology and as per Isro, the cutting-edge Ka-band high-throughput satellite is designed to transform broadband and in-flight connectivity across the region.TOI had reported in the first week of Jan that India’s Space PSU NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) will launch Gsat-20 on Elon Musk’s SpaceX rocket later this year.This is NSIL’s second demand-driven communications satellite and is primarily aimed at meeting India’s growing broadband connectivity needs.NSIL will fully own, operate and fund the satellite, which can provide up to 48Gbps of capacity across 32 beams covering all of India including the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep Islands.NSIL CMD Radhakrishnan D had told TOI earlier: “SpaceX was selected against an RFP we had floated last year. There were other bidders too. This marks a new beginning as we launch on a US rocket from their soil. The present agreement is only for this launch and we will look at future requirements as and when we need.”This is the first time that NSIL used a US launcher. The PSU has earlier made use of the services of France’s Arianespace. NSIL looks for services abroad when the weight of the satellite is higher than the capacity of Indian launch vehicles.As part of the Indian govt’s space sector reforms announced in 2020, NSIL is mandated to build, launch, own and operate satellites that address service needs on demand.In June 2022, NSIL successfully launched its first demand-driven satellite mission, GSAT-24 (now called GSAT-N1), which is fully leased by TataPlay. “While this is also a dedicated satellite, it is not meant for a single company. There are multiple players in the fray,” an official told TOI.","SpaceX’s Falcon-9 rocket early Tuesday lifted off smoothly from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

"Delhi's 2nd-worst air day on record, SC says Grap-4 to go on till further orders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/citys-2nd-worst-air-day-on-record-sc-says-grap-4-to-go-on-till-further-orders/articleshow/115430775.cms,"'Provide for more stringent actions under

GRAP III

, IV'

New Delhi: With air pollution in Delhi reaching life-threatening 'severe plus' levels, Supreme Court on Monday directed Delhi and NCR states - UP, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab - to strictly enforce stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) and immediately take a call on measures such as closing schools for all classes, allowing govt and private employees to work from home and shutting industries.It also ordered that these restrictions would continue till further orders from the court, even if AQI drops below 401, the 'severe' category threshold.The judicial crackdown came on a day when Delhi suffered a dystopian nightmare with a thick layer of pungent smoke filling the air. The day's average AQI was 494 at the highest end of 'severe-plus', the worst in eight years and the second-worst on record. The 24-hour average AQI maxed out at 500 at 15 stations at 5pm and citizens were left coughing and teary-eyed even on short exposures to the toxic fumes.The bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih slammed the ""wait and watch"" approach of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in enforcing Grap measures. Noting that grade III measures were enforced 48 hours after AQI level crossed 400 level, it directed that commensurate measures must be enforced immediately after the AQI level crosses the threshold and the commission should not wait for improvement in quality of air on the basis of the met department's forecast. SC administration also issued a circular in the evening advising all, including lawyers and judges to wear masks.Pleading for closure of all classes in schools, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan brought to court's notice that Delhi govt was allowing physical classes for classes 10 and 12, and contended that same number of school buses were running on roads to ferry them. The court, thereafter, ordered, ""States should take an immediate call to stop physical classes of all standards up to class 12.""Meanwhile, UP govt told the SC that it had invoked Grap-4 measures from 8am onwards on Monday.We direct all govts of NCR to strictly implement stage 4 of Grap. All states will immediately constitute teams for monitoring implementations of actions required under stage 4. NCR governments and the Centre will have to immediately take a call on actions provided in clauses 6 (allowing public, municipal and private offices to work on 50% strength and the rest to work from home), 7 (decision on permitting Central govt employee work from home) and 8 (closure of educational institutions, non-emergency commercial activities and plying of vehicles on odd-even basis etc) of stage 4 and place the decision taken on the record before the next date,"" the bench said.The bench also directed CAQM to incorporate more stringent actions in stages 3 and 4 of Grap, and not leave its implementation to the discretion of the government or local authorities. SC said that CAQM's should be preemptive and it should not wait to enforce measures, after senior advocate Aprajita Singh, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, said that AQI had breached 400 in November 12 itself but Grap 3 measures were enforced after 48 hours.""From the submissions made across the bar and from minutes of the meeting dated November 13, 2024, we find that the approach adopted by the sub-committee of the commission is contrary to what is observed in paragraph three of this court's order dated October 29, 2018. The direction was to EPCA to take preemptive steps under Grap. The approach adopted by the commission seems to be that they have decided to wait for improvement of AQI and therefore implementation of stage 3 and stage 4 was delayed. This is completely a wrong approach,"" the court said.It also directed the states to create grievance redressal mechanisms to enable the citizens to lodge complaints of violation of actions under stage 4 and ordered them to file an affidavit on compliance of all its directions by Thursday and posted the case for further hearing on November 22.","Air pollution in Delhi reaches life-threatening'severe plus' levels.

"Take VRS or transfer, Tirumala trust tells non-Hindu staffers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/take-vrs-or-transfer-tirumala-trust-tells-non-hindu-staffers/articleshow/115427685.cms,"TIRUPATI: The newly-formed Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) passed Monday a resolution requiring non-Hindus employed by the board to either take voluntary retirement or opt for a transfer to other government departments in Andhra Pradesh.TTD is an independent government trust that manages Tirumala Venkateswara temple in Tirupati - the world's richest Hindu shrine.TTD chairman BR Naidu confirmed the decision but declined to reveal the exact number of non-Hindu employees. Sources said the move will affect about 300 of the board's 7,000 permanent employees. TTD also employs around 14,000 contract workers.The decision has drawn support from various employee unions, which have stated that it aligns with the Andhra Pradesh Endowments Act and TTD Act . ""This should be enforced in totality,"" a union representative said. Upon his appointment as TTD chairman on October 31, Naidu had expressed his stand that only Hindus should run the temple.Over the years, the TTD Act has been amended three times to stipulate that only Hindus should be employed by the temple board and its affiliated institutions. A government order issued in 1989 also mandated that appointments to TTD-administered posts would be restricted to Hindus.Despite these provisions, sources claimed that non-Hindus have continued to work within the organisation. Since the Chandrababu Naidu-led government assumed office in June, complaints were reportedly received from Hindu employees identifying their colleagues from other faiths.TTD's decision comes shortly after Naidu's government alleged that the previous YSRCP administration had permitted the use of ghee with animal fat in the preparation of the temple's iconic Tirupati laddu, sparking a major controversy.The decision is supported by Article 16(5) of the Constitution, which allows institutions of a religious or denominational nature to employ members of their own religion. Similarly, Rule 3 of the AP Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowments Subordinate Service Rules states that employees of religious institutions must profess the Hindu faith.This legal backing was reinforced in November 2023 by Andhra Pradesh high court when it upheld Rule 3, confirming that trust boards are empowered to mandate service conditions, including the requirement that employees follow the Hindu religion.","TTD chairman BR Naidu confirmed the decision but declined to reveal the exact number of non-Hindu employees.

Agnipath shadow over Army chief's visit to Nepal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agnipath-shadow-over-army-chiefs-visit-to-nepal/articleshow/115428469.cms,"NEW DELHI: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi will be on a four-day visit to Nepal this week to reinforce the deep-rooted bilateral military ties, which have come under a cloud after Kathmandu refused to allow its youth to join the Indian armed forces under the Agnipath scheme , even as China assiduously continues to make deep strategic inroads into the landlocked Himalayan country.Gen Dwivedi, during his visit from Nov 20 to 24, will focus on further cranking up the long-standing close military collaboration between the two armies, ranging from combat exercises and training programmes to modernization and capacity-building.This year alone, for instance, over 300 Nepal Army personnel have been trained in Indian military establishments, while New Delhi has also been supporting Kathmandu in its military modernization by supplying hardware and software, including small arms, vehicles, and advanced training simulators.The scope and complexity of the annual Surya Kiran joint military exercise, the 18th edition of which will be held in Nepal next month, is also being expanded to enhance the interoperability and synergy between the two armies.Gen Dwivedi will also be conferred with the honorary rank of General of Nepal Army during the visit, as per a long-standing tradition. The elephant in the room, however, will be the intractable differences over the recruitment of soldiers for just four years, without pension or ex-servicemen benefits, under the Agnipath scheme rolled out in June 2022.“Taking the Covid-19 pandemic also into account, Nepal-domicile Gorkhas have not been recruited into the Indian Army, including the seven illustrious regiments of the Gorkha Rifles, for almost five years now. This does not augur well for bilateral relations. The two govts must work out a mutually acceptable solution,” a senior officer told TOI.This becomes especially important given China’s fast-expanding arc of influence in Nepal, which has also hopped onto the former’s Belt and Road Initiative. Moreover, Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli is slated to head for China early next month on his first bilateral foreign visit, in yet another break from long-standing tradition of visiting India first.It was in 1947 that the Indian Army began recruiting Nepalese Gorkhas under the Tripartite Agreement signed with Nepal and the UK. There are currently around 30,000 Nepali citizens serving in the Indian Army, with another 90,000 ex-servicemen also drawing their pensions from the force.The Gorkha Rifles are now trying to step-up recruitment of Indian-domicile Gorkhas from Darjeeling, Dehradun, Dharamshala and other places, who are supposed to constitute 40% of the troops, as well as some Garhwalis and Kumaonis but are finding it extremely difficult to meet the shortfall.“The future looks bleak. In another 10-11 years, the last of the Nepali Gorkhas will retire from our Army,” another officer said. That will end the rich legacy and strong ties that originally began when Maharaja Ranjit Singh first raised a battalion of Gorkhas to serve in his Army around 1809-1814, with the British Army following suit soon after.","Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi will be on a four-day visit to Nepal this week.

Gandhi, however, stressed that a fresh caste census is a prerequisite to decide the future paradigm of the nation and its progress while brushing aside BJP charges against him and Congress that they divide people on caste lines for ""vote-bank politics"".He also blamed BJP for the violence in Manipur and criticised PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah for not talking about the northeastern state and failing to rein in the violence.Responding to a TOI query during a press conference here, Gandhi said, ""A fresh caste census is vital for the right preparation of plans and policies besides making equitable distribution of the country's resources among the deserving.""On BJP's charge that Congress has no blueprint for such a census, he said, ""We have a blueprint ready on ways to conduct the caste census and implement its findings. Today, data is everything... call it a goldmine. Through the caste census, our idea is to conduct an X-ray of all those inhabiting the country to work towards their better inclusion in all streams and not just restrict the country's resources to a few capitalists, which is happening currently under the NDA regime."" Gandhi said, ""I personally believe that the UPA government should have implemented its brainchild - a caste census. It was indeed a mistake on our part then.""He added, ""BJP is propagating a wrong narrative against me and Congress, but when we say we would end the 50% ceiling of quota, we mean to re-evaluate the quota based on the representation of that particular caste. This can only happen when we conduct a caste census, which is a beautiful idea for the country.""Rahul said they are committed to breaking the 50% reservation ceiling based on caste census data while BJP is trying to end reservation.Gandhi also said two Congress-governed states - Telangana and Karnataka - have already started work in this regard.

NEW DELHI: Anmol Bishnoi , younger brother of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi , is learnt to have been detained in Sacramento, US, early on Sunday. The FBI is learnt to be in the process of verifying his identity, possibly through a voice sample or a DNA match, sources said.US agency officials, who earlier this month confirmed his presence in America, are in touch with Indian agencies for the follow-up processes including his deportation. Anmol, who has a red notice issued against him by Interpol, is accused in several high-profile cases, including the recent murder of Baba Siddique and the firing outside Salman Khan's residence.A Facebook account purportedly belonging to Anmol's had in April this year claimed responsibility for the shooting incident outside Salman Khan's residence. Subsequently, cops chanced upon an audio recording of a conversation purportedly between Anmol and Vicky Gupta, one of the shooters involved in the incident.

Anmol had left the country on a forged passport in April, 2022, a month before the singer was targeted. He had since been living in California along with his associates Goldy Brar and others.National Investigation Agency (NIA) had in Oct announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh on Anmol, shortly after his alleged role emerged in Baba Siddique's murder. Mumbai police has approached the court to initiate the process for Anmol's extradition and also sent a communication to ministry of external affairs through MHA.Anmol's notoriety extends to a litany of crimes, with a staggering 18 cases registered against him for a range of offenses, including extortion - the long sheet underscoring his reputation as a formidable figure in the underworld.Anmol aka Bhanu, a resident of Fazilka in Punjab, is named in two chargesheets filed by NIA in cases registered in 2022. Last year, NIA had filed a chargesheet against almost a dozen individuals, including Lawrence and Anmol.

NEW DELHI: Delhi NCR on Monday continued to grapple with alarmingly high pollution levels, worsened by stubble burning in the neighbouring states. The AQI level in the city remained dangerously high. Notable readings included 919 in Mundka, 762 in ITI Jahangirpuri, and 624 in Anand Vihar, placing these areas in the 'severe-plus' category.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) imposed the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) Stage 4 in Delhi NCR from Monday after the city's daily average AQI rose sharply to 441 by 4 PM on Sunday, and further escalated to 457 by 7 PM, prompting an emergency meeting of the GRAP Sub-Committee.The Stage-IV response encompasses an 8-point action plan designed to mitigate the pollution crisis. Key measures include banning the entry of trucks into Delhi, except for those carrying essential commodities or providing essential services.A bench comprising Justices Abhay S. Oka and Augustine George Masih, in its order, said, ""We direct all governments of the NCR area to strictly implement Stage 4 of GRAP.

But, water sprinkling is used to reduce the impact of pollution. We focus on winter management to ensure that the wild animals do not face any problems during the winter season,"" Kumar said""A special vehicle sprays small droplets of water in an attempt to reduce the impact of air pollution...The wild animals are given a winter diet that includes foods rich in fat...heaters have also been installed,"" he added.","Supreme Court orders GRAP 4 curbs to be in force across NCR even if AQI drops below 400.

"Farmers in distress, allow them to survive, SC tells Karnataka",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farmers-in-distress-allow-them-to-survive-sc-tells-karnataka/articleshow/115428420.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday reprimanded Karnataka govt for challenging a high court decision to enhance the rate compensation for acquisition of farmers' lands, dismissed its appeal and said the state, where thousands of farmers die by suicide annually, must allow the distressed community to survive.The case related to the acquisition of lands of farmers in October 2005 for construction of Hipparagi major irrigation project on Krishna River. The Special Land Acquisition Officer determined the compensation at the rate of Rs 59,000 per acre of irrigated land and Rs 24,557 per acre of dry land.The reference court enhanced it to Rs 1,70,00 per acre in Aug 2009. When the appeal against the determination was pending before the Karnataka HC, the irrigation department decided to settle the pending cases by awarding compensation at the rate of Rs 3,69,000 per acre for acquisition of land in the year 2004-05, with 5% escalation for subsequent year acquisitions.But the HC enhanced it to Rs 5 lakh per acre in March 2021 and in December 2022, and later extended the enhanced rate of compensation to other farmers whose lands were acquired saying they all fall in the same category of persons whose lands were acquired for the Hipparagi project.Finding that the state was ready to argue despite the SC expressing its disinclination to entertain the appeal, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan said, ""You (the state) acquire their lands but are not ready to pay them a fair compensation. The farmers are a distressed lot.""""If you do not want to pay the enhanced compensation, why don't you return the lands to them in exercise of your eminent domain powers,"" the bench said before dismissing the state's appeal.The SC's observation that the farmers in the state are a distressed lot is borne out from the state revenue department's statistics, which recently said that between April 1, 2023, and August 4, 2024, as many as 1,216 farmers have died by suicide.Statistics also reveal that between 2013 and 2022 as many as 8,245 farmers have died by suicide, worst hit districts being Belagavi, Haveri, Dharwad, Chikkamagaluru and Kalaburgi. The reasons behind the farmers distress are drought, crop damage and the menace of debt. The state had argued before the SC that the HC erred in condoning a delay of 11 years in filing of the petition seeking parity and entitlement to enhanced compensation, without the petitioners showing sufficient cause for delay in approaching the HC.The state had also said that the petitioners before HC had already received enhanced compensation as decided by the reference court and could not be entitled to the rate of compensation which was fixed after passage of almost a decade.""Judgments of this nature (from the HC) would entitle parties a right to approach the court at any point of time to seek enhanced compensation. Such an exercise would set at naught the principle that there must be quietus to litigation,"" the state had said arguing that such entitlement to enhanced compensation would cast a huge financial liability on the project proponent.",The Supreme Court reprimanded Karnataka govt for challenging a high court decision to enhance the rate compensation for acquisition of farmers' lands.

Piyush Goyal: People have made up their mind for Mahayuti,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/people-have-made-up-their-mind-for-mahayuti-piyush-goyal/articleshow/115428516.cms,"In an interview with TOI's Sidhartha, Union commerce & industry minister

, MP from Mumbai and a key BJP functionary, is confident of the

Mahayuti

alliance winning the Maharashtra polls, arguing people will vote for a coalition that has delivered. Excerpts:

How do you see the prospects in the election? Given the churn isn't the voter confused between

MVA

and Mahayuti and their candidates?

There is a feeling among voters that a local party which was in power was ousted.

Given the stand taken by Ajit Pawar on some of the issues, including the ""batenge to kitenge"" slogan, doesn't that make him sound like not such a reliable partner?

So the statements, including the one on the meeting between Sharad Pawar and Amit Shah in 2019...

There is a controversy over the meeting at Adani's place...

Ladli Bahin allowance will be increased to Rs 2,100. How feasible is it to sustain this expense without impacting other development expenditure and isn't this dole or a revadi?

Who will be your CM face after the election should Mahayuti emerge victorious?

There is a feeling that a lot of projects which would have come to Maharashtra have gone to Gujarat.

The writing on the wall is very clear, voters have made up their mind for continuity, whether it is in Marathwada, western Maharashtra, Mumbai. The mood is for a govt that delivers. They recognise that they want to have a govt that works closely in alignment with the central govt. They have experienced two and a half years of a non-performing govt under Mr Uddhav Thackeray ... the CM didn't even go to office. They have seen the way PM Modi, in the first term Fadnavis govt, and then the Shinde-Fadnavis-Ajit Dada govt delivered on infrastructure, slum rehabilitation, and on providing a better quality of life.That was the problem of Congress and not of BJP or Mahayuti. Mahayuti is united very strongly, we had no issues with seat transfer, save a few minor issues. But MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi) seems to be a pretty discontent grouping, with no ideological moorings. Mr. Uddhav Thackeray, who once stood for Hindutva, has completely given up the ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray and gone and sat in the lap of of Sharad Pawar and Congress. Here, we see the pitiable state in which Mr. Uddhav Thackeray is in, having to even accept in writing conditionalities of support demanded by the Ulemas. The shameful demands have been accepted even by Sharad Pawar and Congress, which has hurt the people of Maharashtra, and they have made up their mind to teach a lesson to MVA.Not at all, the understanding among coalition partners is very strong. His line is no different from the line of all the partners. We may have differences on one or two candidates.I don't think so. The PM is on record to say that ""hum ek hain to safe hain"". He has given a strong message that Congress and MVA, which is trying to divide society on the basis of religion, caste, language has to be defeated, otherwise neither is Maharashtra safe, nor is the country.It's a non-issue. Location hardly matters, substance is important. Mr Sharad Pawar, who is today opposing Mr Ajit Pawar and Mahayuti, himself was desirous and all MLAs were desirous of joining Mahayuti.It's a recognition of the wonderful work our sisters and daughters are doing. It is in the interest of making them self-reliant, empowering them and making sure they don't have to depend on someone for their small day to day needs. This is an empowerment tool and not a dole.It has already been clarified by Amit Shah. Today, the CM is Mr Eknath Shinde and after the election as is the normal process, all three parties will sit down and decide.It is a completely unfounded allegation, and baseless. Maharashtra is number 1 in FDI, infrastructure investments and will continue to be number 1. Toyota is investing in a township... India's largest port is coming up at Wadhawan, a new airport is coming up in Mumbai. We are working in all areas.","Union commerce & industry minister is confident of Mahayuti winning the Maharashtra polls. He argues people will vote for a coalition that has delivered.

"Amid global race, India tests its first hypersonic missile",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-global-race-india-tests-its-first-hypersonic-missile/articleshow/115394765.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a significant development amid the frenetic race among China, Russia and the US to develop and deploy hypersonic weapons, India has tested its first long-range missile that is manoeuvrable mid-flight and flies over five times the speed of sound to evade enemy missile defence systems.The hypersonic missile, designed to carry various payloads for ranges over 1,500km, was ""successfully flight-tested"" from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Odisha at 6.55pm on Saturday, a defence ministry official said.The missile, which flew at Mach 6 speed, was tracked by various range systems deployed in multiple domains. ""The flight data obtained from down range ship stations confirmed the successful terminal manoeuvres and impact with high degree of accuracy,"" the official added.Describing it as ""a historic moment and stupendous achievement"", defence minister Rajnath Singh said the flight-trial has propelled India into a group of select nations that has the capability to develop such ""critical and advanced military technologies"".Former DRDO chairman G Satheesh Reddy told TOI the missile is ""a gamechanger"" with multiple applications in Army, Navy and IAF. ""A missile of this range with hypersonic velocities will provide a decisive edge to India.""The missile, with the speed of a ballistic missile as well as the manoeuvring capability of a cruise missile, of course, will have to be fine-tuned with several tests over the next few years before it is ready for production and deployment. The naval version will be geared towards destroying enemy warships at long ranges with pinpoint precision, an official said.With their capability to defeat existing missile and air defence systems due to super-fast speeds, high-manoeuvrability and low altitudes of flight, hypersonic weapons have become a major focus area for major military powers. The two main types of hypersonic weapons are cruise missiles that are powered by air-breathing engines or ""scramjets"" during their entire flight and ""glide vehicles"" that are launched atop ballistic missiles before gliding to their targets at speeds over Mach 5.China and Russia are ahead of the US in designing aerodynamically manoeuvrable hypersonic weapons for use with nuclear warheads. In July 2021, for instance, China's test of a nuclear-capable missile carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle and warhead had sent shockwaves around the globe.In June 2019, DRDO for the first time tested a hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV), which was to serve as a crucial building block in the development of long-range hypersonic weapons. But the flight trial failed.A second test in September 2020 was successful to the extent that the scramjet-powered ""cruise vehicle"" or HSTDV flew for 22-23 seconds at Mach 6 speed after separation from the ""launch vehicle"" of solid rocket motor of an Agni-I ballistic missile at 30km altitude. While another HSTDV test was conducted in Jan last year, trials of a much longer duration are needed on this front, as reported by TOI earlier.Parallelly, there was a plan to develop a hypersonic version of the already-inducted conventional (non-nuclear) ramjet-powered BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, which fly at Mach 2.8 speed with a 450-km strike range, developed with Russia. But this will be an expensive proposition and is not on the cards at present, an official said.","India has tested its first long-range missile that is manoeuvrable mid-flight and flies over five times the speed of sound.

NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Sunday announced the enforcement of Stage-IV (Severe+) actions under the revised Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR. The measures will take effect from 8 am on Monday (November 18), stepping up efforts to tackle the worsening air quality in the region. As part of the measures, Delhi CM Atishi tweeted that physical classes will be suspended for all students, except those in Class 10 and 12, with schools switching to online lessons until further notice.This decision was made after an urgent meeting of the GRAP sub-committee on November 17, which reviewed the current air quality, meteorological conditions, and forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM). The sub-committee had previously invoked Stage-I, Stage-II, and Stage-III actions on October 14, October 21, and November 14, respectively.As part of the Stage-IV measures, Delhi government (GNCTD) have been advised to consider transitioning physical classes for grades VI to IX and XI to online mode. Authorities are also urged to implement a 50% workforce policy for public, municipal, and private offices, allowing the remaining employees to work remotely.As per the new order, only trucks carrying essential items or using clean fuel (LNG/CNG/BS-VI diesel/electric) will be allowed entry into Delhi. Non-essential light commercial vehicles registered outside Delhi, excluding EVs and CNG or BS-VI diesel vehicles, will also be prohibited.Additionally, Delhi-registered BS-IV or older diesel medium and heavy goods vehicles are banned, except for those involved in essential services. All construction activities, including those related to highways, roads, flyovers, power lines, pipelines, and other public projects, have been suspended.The decision came after a high-level review meeting chaired by CAQM Member Sujit Kumar Bajpayee on Saturday. Officials stressed the critical need for strict enforcement of GRAP measures, particularly as winter months, typically associated with higher pollution levels, approach.Stage-IV actions build upon the measures implemented under Stages I, II, and III, which remain in force. Daily reports from implementing authorities have been monitored through the GRAP Monitoring Control Room, underscoring the need for immediate, coordinated action to curb air pollution.In a bid to ensure the effective implementation of Stage-IV measures under the GRAP-IV in Delhi, environment minister Gopal Rai is set to hold a crucial meeting with Heads of Departments (HoDs) from all concerned departments.The meeting will take place tomorrow at 12 noon at the Delhi Secretariat, according to a statement from the Delhi environment minister's Office.The CAQM has reiterated the importance of strict adherence to GRAP guidelines, available on its official website, urging enforcement agencies to take decisive steps to mitigate pollution.","The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) announced the enforcement of Stage-IV (Severe+) actions under the revised Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) The measures will take effect from 8 am on Monday (November 18) Delhi CM Atishi tweeted that physical classes will be suspended for all students, except those in Class 10 and 12, with schools switching to online lessons.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115389636,imgsize-268874,width-400,resizemode-4/115389636.jpg"

US President-elect and MAGA supremo Donald Trump confirmed on Monday that his administration will declare a national emergency and use military assets in a mass deportation program to ""reverse the Biden invasion.""Trump responded with a single-word response (""True!"") to a week-old post from a rightwing commentator who said there are reports to this effect, even as the President-elect's putative border czar Tom Homan warned Democratic-governed states that have said they will not cooperate with the deportation program to ""get the hell out of our way.""""All this crap ends on January 20...Federal law trumps state law every single time,"" Homan said in a podcast in a warning to Democrat governors of California, Illinois, and Massachusetts who have suggested they will resist the incoming administration's mass deportation plans.Promising ""shock and awe"" from day one, Homan said the Trump administration will prioritize public safety and national security to first deport 425,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records. Asserting that there were millions of deserving immigrants and asylum seekers who had been pushed to the back of the line by the invasion of illegals, he said immigrants will get due process in court of law, and if they lose, they will have to return to their country. In a separate appearance on Fox Business, Homan said “legal immigrants are perfectly safe.”Describing his personal experience on the border, Homan said he resented the fact that border patrol agents who are mandated to stop the illegal invasion has been turned into ""travel agents' tasked with processing illegal immigrants and putting them on onward flights into the US, giving them free airline tickets, free hotel stay, and free health care at tax payer expense while millions of Americans were suffering.Illegal immigration , along with inflation and price rise, were among the key factors that powered Trump's return to the White House for a second term, and the President-elect appears on track to make good his mass deportation pledge amid doubts about the feasibility of sending back upwards of 10 million illegals, many of whom are seasonal agricultural workers.Liberal activists have warned that turfing them out result in a hike in grocery prices. More extreme scenarios paint a picture of economic collapse even as some think tanks have estimated it would cost upward of $ 300 billion to nearly $ 1 trillion to get all the illegal immigrants out of the country -- which is considered impossible.""Mass deportations would cause significant labor shocks across multiple key industries, with especially acute impacts on construction, agriculture, and the hospitality sector,"" the American Immigration Council has warned, estimating that nearly 14 percent of people employed in the construction industry are undocumented. ""Removing that labor would disrupt all forms of construction across the nation, from homes to businesses to basic infrastructure. As industries suffer, hundreds of thousands of U.S.-born workers could lose their jobs,"" it said.In an October 2024 report, the AIC estimated that mass deportation would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by 4.2 to 6.8 percent. It would also result in significant reduction in tax revenues for the U.S. government. In 2022 alone, undocumented immigrant households paid $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes, and contributed $22.6 billion to Social Security and $5.7 billion to Medicare.These numbers, the AIC said, do not even come close to capturing the human cost of mass deportation: About 5.1 million US citizen children live with an undocumented family member. ""Separating family members would lead to tremendous emotional stress and could also cause economic hardship for many of these mixed-status families who might lose their breadwinners, jeopardizing their economic and social well-being,"" it cautioned.","US President-elect and MAGA supremo Donald Trump confirmed on Monday that his administration will declare a national emergency and use military assets in a mass deportation program.

"Trudeau explains cap on immigration: 'We made mistakes, system exploited by bad actors'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/trudeau-explains-cap-on-immigration-we-made-mistakes-system-exploited-by-bad-actors/articleshow/115403697.cms,"'Immigration is based on demand'

Why Canada’s changing its immigration system

What the new plan looks like

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday explained the rationale behind Canada's new immigration cap, acknowledging past mistakes in how the system was managed. ""We made some mistakes,"" Trudeau in a 7-minute YouTube video referred to how certain actors in the immigration system exploited vulnerable people. ""Really bad actors who outright exploit people, who target vulnerable immigrants with promises of jobs, diplomas, and easy pathways to citizenship. Promises that would never come true.""The new policy, which aims to address these issues, introduces significant reductions in the number of both permanent and temporary residents entering Canada over the next three years.The Trudeau government is currently facing major scrutiny in Canada, and are currently trailing the Conservative party in polls ahead of elections scheduled next year.Trudeau further discussed how Canada's immigration system had been influenced by these ""bad actors,"" such as fake colleges and large corporations that capitalised on the post-pandemic demand for workers. He explained that while the immigration system was designed to bring in workers and students, it became clear that some were abusing the system to make a profit. ""Far too many colleges and universities used international students to raise their bottom line,"" Trudeau pointed out.""Temporary foreign workers became such a significant part of our workforce that it’d be a mistake not to include them when we plan our immigration levels,"" he explained, adding that ""immigration is based on demand"".Trudeau’s remarks also centred on the need to balance immigration levels with Canada’s existing infrastructure. He noted that while businesses and various sectors were eager to welcome workers, the country’s housing, healthcare, and social services had not kept pace. The new cap, therefore, aims to allow the economy and communities some time to adjust. ""This pause is going to give our economy and our communities the chance to catch up with things like our plan to build millions more homes,"" Trudeau stated.Trudeau highlighted how the cap on international students had already led to rental prices in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver starting to decline. ""Rents will keep coming down,"" Trudeau added, reinforcing that the immigration changes are intended to make the system work for both newcomers and Canadians.The new immigration levels plan for 2025-2027 reflects these adjustments, with a 21% reduction in the number of permanent residents expected to be admitted. The target for permanent residents has been cut from 500,000 to 395,000 in 2025.The new immigration plan will see a sharp decrease in the number of new temporary residents entering Canada. By 2026, the number of temporary workers is expected to drop by over 40%, and the target for international students will also decrease by 10%. The overall number of temporary residents in 2025 is projected at 673,650, with temporary workers and students making up the majority.","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday explained the rationale behind Canada's new immigration cap.

How the day is celebrated?

Every year on November 19 , International Men's Day is celebrated to recognise and honour the significant contributions of men to society, families, and communities.This day focuses on bringing attention to the health, well-being, and positive role models among men while promoting conversations around gender equality and men’s issues.The celebration was first introduced in 1999 by Dr Jerome Teelucksingh in Trinidad and Tobago, aiming to highlight the achievements of men and address issues impacting their lives.The day serves as an opportunity to appreciate the men in our lives—whether fathers, brothers, partners, or friends—who contribute to society in meaningful ways.Beyond celebration, it also sheds light on the challenges men face, such as mental health struggles, high rates of suicide, and societal pressures. International Men's Day aims to break down stereotypes, encourage open conversations, and build support systems for men to lead healthier and happier lives.The idea for International Men's Day was first proposed in 1992, but it was not widely recognised until Dr Jerome Teelucksingh revived the initiative in 1999.He envisioned a day to celebrate men’s achievements while also focusing on critical issues like male health, the impact of toxic masculinity , and the importance of nurturing positive male role models .Since its inception, the observance has grown into an international movement, with celebrations, discussions, and awareness campaigns held in various countries.The theme for this year's International Men's Day is ""Men's health champions.""It is a call to action focusing on improving men's overall health and well-being, celebrating individuals and organisations committed to reducing health challenges faced by boys and men. The theme emphasises physical, social, emotional, and spiritual wellness while encouraging communities to support men's health initiatives .The 2024 observance encourages actions like promoting healthier lifestyles, providing better access to healthcare, and fostering supportive environments where men can thrive.Under the broader theme, four key areas are highlighted:International Men's Day is guided by six pillars designed to create awareness and foster a supportive environment for men. These pillars include:International Men's Day is marked by a wide range of activities, including workshops and seminars addressing mental health, gender roles, and social expectations.Community events, public campaigns, and volunteer activities are also organised to honour men’s contributions. Health initiatives are a key part of the celebration, with wellness campaigns offering free health check-ups and promoting healthier lifestyles.Educational programs highlight positive male role models, inspiring young boys to adopt values that support well-being and community engagement.By celebrating International Men's Day, societies can build awareness, reduce stigma around men's health issues, and foster a more inclusive environment where men are encouraged to seek help and thrive.The 2024 theme and focus areas remind us all of the importance of promoting men’s health and supporting positive role models who inspire us to build healthier, more connected communities.","International Men's Day is celebrated every year on November 19.

Germany Skilled Worker Visas: Germany approves more professional visas amid labour shortage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/germany-approves-more-professional-visas-amid-labour-shortage/articleshow/115404603.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

How have the reforms worked out?

How does the Opportunity Card work?

The number of skilled worker visas issued by Germany is on course to rise 10 per cent in 2024 compared to last year, the government said on Sunday, a year after immigration rules were eased to boost the labour market.Germany continues to face chronic labour shortages, with around 1.34 million jobs currently vacant.Berlin last year adopted a points-based system inspired by Canada known as the Opportunity Card, which makes it easier for professionals and university graduates to enter the country, study and search for work.Skilled workers from non-European Union states are now allowed to enter Germany without first having their qualifications recognized.A joint statement from three German government ministries said by the end of the year, some 200,000 professional visas will have been awarded.""This represents an increase of over 10 per cent"" compared to 2023, the statement said.The statement added that there was ""great interest"" in visas to study in Germany, complete vocational training here, or have foreign qualifications recognized.The number of visas issued to students from non-EU states rose by over 20 per cent. For vocational trainees, the rise was even steeper — around two-thirds — and the number of people seeking to have their foreign professional qualifications recognized jumped by almost one-half.""Talented young people can more easily complete their training and studies in Germany,"" interior minister Nancy Faeser said. ""Thanks to the Opportunity Card, people with experience and potential can now find a suitable job more quickly and easily,"" she added.The reforms were also hailed by foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, who highlighted the country's continued labour shortages.""Every year, Germany lacks 400,000 bright minds and even more hands that make our country strong ... This is slowing down our economy ... With the Skilled Immigration Act, we have created the most modern immigration law in Europe and finally turned the visa process on its head.""A points system is used to determine whether someone is eligible for the Opportunity Card, based on qualifications, knowledge and experience.There are extra points for qualifying for an occupation listed as having a shortage of workers, partial recognition of foreign qualifications, age, German and English language skills and a previous connection to Germany.Those applying must show funds of about €1,000 ($1,050) per month for the duration of their stay.Germany has created around 1.6 million jobs over the past five years — with 89 per cent of positions taken by foreigners.But immigration remains a hot-button issue, with critics complaining that the country has struggled to integrate more than a million migrants, many fleeing the Syrian civil war, who were welcomed in 2015/6 by then-Chancellor Angela Merkel. Another wave of immigration has also reached Germany since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine in early 2022.Currently polling with about 19 per cent support nationwide, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is hoping to boost its following in the snap election scheduled for February by focusing on curbing immigration.","Germany last year adopted a points-based system inspired by Canada known as the Opportunity Card.

Stage 4 will continue till court permits,"" the bench said.A bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih said, “The moment the AQI reaches between 300 and 400, stage 4 has to be invoked. How can you take risk in these matters by delaying applicability of stage 4 of GRAP?”The CAQM had earlier announced stricter pollution control protocols for Delhi-NCR under GRAP Stage 4, which came into effect from 8 am on Monday. These include a ban on the entry of trucks and halting construction activities for public projects.Delhi continues to grapple with alarmingly high pollution levels, exacerbated by stubble burning in neighbouring states. The Supreme Court has previously criticised the lack of coordination among the Centre, CAQM, and state governments, including Punjab and Haryana, calling their responses inadequate and ineffective.On Monday morning, AQI levels in the city remained dangerously high. Notable readings included 919 in Mundka, 762 in ITI Jahangirpuri, and 624 in Anand Vihar, placing these areas in the 'severe-plus' category.Despite measures such as the Delhi Pollution Control Committee’s ban on firecrackers until January 2025, enforcement challenges persist.On November 11, the bench had criticised the lack of enforcement during Diwali, observing that no religion condones activities harmful to public health.Reprimanding the Delhi Police, the court stated their actions had been insufficient, with only raw materials being confiscated. The bench directed the Delhi Police Commissioner to establish a specialised cell to enforce the ban across the National Capital Region (NCR) and file a personal affidavit on the steps taken.“The right to live in a pollution-free environment is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution,” the bench had said. It also directed the Delhi government to decide by November 25 on imposing a permanent firecracker ban.","Delhi continues to grapple with alarmingly high pollution levels, exacerbated by stubble burning in neighbouring states.

“...100% Nvidia's fault”: CEO Jensen Huang

Nvidia 's highly anticipated Blackwell AI chips have run into another hurdle, a report has said, adding that the AI chip is experiencing overheating issues in the accompanying servers. According to a report by The Information, these problems have caused concerns among some customers who fear delays in getting their new data centres operational.The report by The Information (via news agency Reuters) reveals that the Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs), – dubbed 'superchip' and will be available by 2024-end – overheat when deployed in high-density server racks designed to accommodate up to 72 chips.Citing sources, the report also notes that Nvidia has repeatedly requested design modifications from its suppliers to address the overheating, but a definitive solution has not been found.Nvidia acknowledged the challenges but downplayed the issue.“Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected,” a company spokesperson was quoted as saying.The ongoing problems may add to delays in the Blackwell rollout, potentially impacting major customers like Meta, Google, and Microsoft who are eager to leverage the chip's capabilities for AI applications, the report highlighted.Last month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that a design flaw that impacted the Blackwell chips’ production and caused delays has been fixed.“It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low. It was 100% Nvidia's fault. In order to make a Blackwell computer work, seven different types of chips were designed from scratch and had to be ramped into production at the same time,” he said.""What TSMC did was to help us recover from that yield difficulty and resume the manufacturing of Blackwell at an incredible place,"" the CEO added.Despite these setbacks, the Blackwell chip represents a significant leap forward in AI processing power. By combining two silicon squares into a single component, Nvidia claims it delivers a 30-fold increase in speed for tasks like generating chatbot responses.","Blackwell AI chip is experiencing overheating issues in the accompanying servers, a report has said.

Ashneer Grover on Salman Khan



Internet responds

BharatPe co-founder Ashneer Grover was recently called out by Bollywood actor Salman Khan for his ‘doglapan’ (double standards) - a word often used by Grover on Shark Tank India. Grover recently appeared on reality show Bigg Boss 18 where Salman asked “Maine aapko mere baare mein kehte huye suna hai kuch. Aapne kaha ki, 'Humne toh isko itne mein sign kardiya'. Uska figure bhi aapne galat de diya. Toh phir yeh dogalapan kya hai”. (I heard you talking about me. You said, ‘We have signed him for this much’. You also gave the wrong figure.)Ashneer replied, saying “Aapko jo humne brand ambassador dia (The decision to make you brand ambassador), I think that was one of the smartest moves I made.”Salman continued saying, “Lekin jis hisaab se ab aap baat kar ahe hani, woh jo maine aapka video dekha hai, yeh aapka attitude wahan par nahi tha (The way you are talking now, the video of yours that I saw earlier, this attitude wasn’t apparent back then),”.The video has also been shared by X user Salman Ki Sena @Salman_ki_sena. “Here’s the full conversation between #SalmanKhan & #AshneerGrover. It’s an absolute treat to watch, considering how Ashneer demeaned Salman Khan in that podcast. Ashneer absolutely deserved this belt treatment!,” the post is captioned.In the video, Khan can be seen denying having a personal meeting with Grover, adding ""na wo numbers sahi the, na wo conversation sahi thi"" (Neither were those numbers right, nor was that conversation right).In an old video, Ashneer Grover revealed how, in 2019, he aspired to have Salman Khan as the brand ambassador for his business but faced financial constraints to afford the superstar's endorsement fees. During the same, Grover shared that Salman’s team initially demanded Rs 7.5 crore, adding that the team eventually agreed to a significantly reduced fee of Rs 4.5 crore, making the collaboration possible.Reacting to the online videos, one user said “Wow!!!!! Yeh kya hain. I can't believe Ashneer is losing all his respect by coming on to such shows. He said Salman ko humne itna paisa diya tha pata nahin kya kya. Lol Salman never forgets nor forgives”. A second user said, “I have never seen Ashneer so humble so 'haanji' 'sir'. This is actually hilarious.

Department of Government Efficiency co-leader Vivek Ramaswamy Sunday said entire agencies are at the risk of being axed by their newly set up department if those agencies are doing nothing. ""We want to go right in through executive action...the dirty little secret is that the people we elect to run the government, they are not the one who actually run the government. It's the unelected bureaucrats in the administrative state that was created through executive action-- it's going to be fixed through executive action.

""Over half a trillion dollars that's spent every year right now was not even authorized by Congress in the first place. The Pentagon has just failed its seventh consecutive audit, nearly a trillion dollars of budget. They can't even tell you where it goes,"" he said.Are you expecting to close down entire agencies like education department? To this question, Ramaswamy said, ""We expect mass reductions, we expect certain agencies to be deleted outright.""On whether some departments like energy, agriculture, education would be moved out of Washington, Vivek Ramaswamy said that would be done to make these bureaucrats more accountable. ""Here's a dirty little secret in the federal bureaucracy today: most people don't even show up to work,"" he said adding that if they are asked to come to work like most hardworking Americans five days a week, they won't do that.""That creates the logic of many of these agencies being outside of DC in the first place. These are just examples,"" Vivek said.
