Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is set to make history as the first Indian astronaut to travel to the International Space Station (ISS). He has been selected as the pilot for Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), a private astronaut mission launching aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft no earlier than spring 2025.Shukla, a Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot, will join a crew led by former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who will serve as mission commander. He will be accompanied by two mission specialists—Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary. This mission will not only send the first ISRO astronaut to the ISS but will also mark the first stay aboard the station for astronauts from Poland and Hungary.Expressing his excitement about the mission, Shukla said he hopes to share his experience with the people of India. He plans to carry cultural items from different parts of the country and even intends to perform yoga poses aboard the ISS. “Even as an individual travelling to space, this is the journey of 1.4 billion people,” he said. The mission will last up to 14 days, during which the crew will conduct scientific experiments, outreach programmes, and commercial activities in microgravity.The Ax-4 mission is part of a broader effort to expand private astronaut access to low Earth orbit. According to Dana Weigel, manager of Nasa’s ISS programme, private missions like Ax-4 help pave the way for a sustainable low Earth orbit economy, enabling future deep space exploration. Whitson also praised the dedication of the Ax-4 crew, calling their commitment to space exploration “truly remarkable.”","Shubhanshu Shukla is set to make history as the first Indian astronaut to travel to the International Space Station (ISS) He has been selected as the pilot for Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), a private astronaut mission launching aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft no earlier than spring 2025.

Representatives from three venture capital firms - Anand Daniel, partner at Accel Partners, Vishal Gupta, partner at Bessemer, and Gaurav Kothari, principal at Prosus Ventures - stepped down from the company's board in Dec.The board exits come amid financial challenges at Good Glamm, including fund constraints, delayed salary payments, and layoffs. ""Cheque bounces, defaults in salaries, provident funds, and TDS are all massive risks for anyone on the board of a company. In such a scenario, it is common for board members to step down to absolve themselves of legal liabilities,"" Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD of proxy advisory firm InGovern, told TOI.The company, which owns a portfolio of direct-to-commerce beauty and personal care brands, had planned an IPO last year, which did not materialise. While IPO can get delayed due to market conditions, Good Glamm has been in the spotlight for its financial difficulties.Good Glamm said the board exits are part of an ongoing restructuring effort. ""At Good Glamm Group, we are in the midst of restructuring and a subsequent fundraise. As a part of our restructuring, our board is also being reconstituted and new members will be joining our board,"" the company said in a LinkedIn post on Thursday.Investor resignations from startup boards are rare and often signal governance concerns. The developments at Good Glamm mirror those at Byju's, where a series of board exits by key investors highlighted deeper structural and financial issues. This has reignited discussions on the role of investors in ensuring transparency and financial discipline in high-growth startups. As governance challenges persist, industry experts continue to debate the extent of investor responsibility in overseeing business practices and ensuring ethical leadership in India's startup landscape.","Good Glamm Group became the latest startup to witness investor exits from its board.

People should reduce intake of edible oil by 10% to cut obesity risk: PM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/people-should-reduce-intake-of-edible-oil-by-10-to-cut-obesity-risk-pm/articleshow/117763507.cms,"NEW DELHI: While physical inactivity, junk food and other factors have drawn a lot of attention for their role in causing lifestyle disorders, and rightly so, edible oil has mostly escaped scrutiny. PM Modi, in his address at the 38th National Games opening ceremony, focused on it and called its excessive use a key factor for rising obesity, while urging for reduced oil intake in all households.Excess consumption of cooking oil, he said, was a key factor behind the rising incidence of obesity. ""Every age group of the country, and even the youth, are being badly affected by it. And this is also a matter of concern because obesity increases the risk of diseases like diabetes, heart disease,"" the PM said.PM Modi appealed to people to reduce oil intake, in addition to working out daily and focusing on a balanced and nutritious diet, leading many to wonder if it was a precursor to a plan focused on tackling obesity by, among other things, discouraging high consumption of edible oil.“In our homes, ration comes at the beginning of the month. Till now, if you used to bring home two litres of cooking oil every month, then reduce it by at least 10%. Reduce the amount of oil we use every day by 10%,” Modi said.He is not alone in sounding the alarm. According to Dr Vineet Kumar Surana, consultant diabetes and endocrinology at Manipal Hospital-Dwarka, when you add excess oil in cooking, it can add hidden calories without causing fullness leading to weight gain and obesity. “One should not consume more than 600-700 ml per month, which translates to approximately 20 ml/day (equivalent to roughly four teaspoons),” he said.Fortis C-Doc chairperson Dr Anoop Misra said, “Normally, people tend to consume double the recom mended amount of oil or more.” To make matters worse, he added, many people tend to reuse oil which is dangerous. “Re-using oil for frying food items leads to an increase in trans-fats that are known to increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke among others,” he said.Apart from quantity, the quality of oil is equally important. The ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (ICMRNIN), says though mustard oil and groundnut oil are very good for cooking, it is best to use a combination of oils either blended or by rotation. e.g. groundnut oil, soya bean oil, sunflower oil, rice bran oil so that one can get the benefit of all. The PM’s call, sources said, suggests the govt is looking to initiate dedicated programmes to tackle and prevent a potential crisis posed by it.The Economic Survey 2023-24 has warned that unhealthy food and sedentary habits don’t just raise the risk of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases and certain types of cancer but they also pose a threat to the country’s economic potential.“For India’s working-age population to be gainfully employed, they need skills and good health. Social media, screen time, sedentary habits and unhealthy food are a lethal mix that can undermine public health and productivity and diminish India’s economic potential,” the survey report said. It adds that the private sector has made substantial contributions to this toxic mix of habits, and that is myopic.It recommended Indian businesses to embrace traditional lifestyle, food and recipes. These have shown how to live healthily and in harmony with nature and the environment for centuries. It makes commercial sense for Indian businesses to learn about and embrace them, for they have a global market waiting to be led rather than tapped, the report said.","Excess consumption of cooking oil, he said, was a key factor behind the rising incidence of obesity.

'Poisoned' Yamuna Row

NEW DELHI: AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday hit back at the Election Commission of India after they provided him with an opportunity to present evidence supporting his claims that the Yamuna river water was intentionally poisoned.Speaking to reporters, Kejriwal said, ""I want to respectfully tell the ECI that while the open distribution of money in Delhi goes unnoticed, they are indulging in politics. Why? Because Rajeev Kumar is seeking a post-retirement job. I want to remind him — history will never forgive him.""He continued, ""I don’t believe the Election Commission has ever been as discredited as it is now. I know they’ll imprison me in two days.

The Commission has set a deadline of 11 am on Friday for Kejriwal to submit the required details.The ECI’s response comes after Kejriwal alleged that the elevated ammonia levels in the Yamuna were part of a deliberate poisoning plot, which he equated to an act of war.The commission has urged him to distinguish between the issue of ammonia contamination and the poisoning allegations, advising against conflating the two.It also warned Kejriwal against making inflammatory remarks that could incite public unrest or foster discord between communities.The ECI underscored that ensuring water availability and cleanliness is a fundamental governance responsibility, with all governments accountable for providing safe drinking water.Additionally, it reiterated that it would not intervene in long-standing water-sharing disputes, particularly those with established legal resolutions from the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal.","AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal hit back at the Election Commission of India after they provided him with an opportunity to present evidence supporting his claims that the Yamuna river water was intentionally poisoned.

Taking exception to his conduct, the court directed the Centre to take steps to get him arrested to bring him back and also find out who helped him escape.The court had charged Manish Chhokar, the NRI, with contempt for not complying with its order to hand over custody of his 10-year-old son to his former wife which was part of the settlement arrived between them to put an end to all disputes after getting divorced.On the last hearing of contempt proceedings on Jan 22, Chhokar was not present in court which was in violation of the court's order but senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing him, assured the bench that he would be present on the next date of hearing.

"With government nod, Supreme Court orders reappointment of retired high court judges to cut pendency",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-government-nod-supreme-court-orders-reappointment-of-retired-high-court-judges-to-cut-pendency/articleshow/117759388.cms,"Retired judges to be part of benches led by sitting judges

NEW DELHI: To reduce pendency of 62 lakh cases and counting in high courts, Supreme Court on Thursday, with the Centre's agreement, ordered that a maximum of five retired HC judges could be reappointed to each HC to hear criminal cases, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. It added that their number should not exceed 10% of the HC's sanctioned strength.With attorney general R Venkataramani recording no objection from the Union govt, a CJI-headed bench set in motion the reappointment process under the dormant Article 224A of the Constitution, used only thrice in last 75 years.The move will enable HC collegiums to recommend names of retired judges, with proven record of efficient disposal of cases, to the Supreme Court collegium, which will then select suitable persons and recommend their names for appointment as ad hoc judges of HCs for a fixed tenure or for specific purpose.A bench of the top three SC judges, CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, clarified that the retired judges, after being appointed as ad hoc judges, would be part of a bench headed by a sitting judge of the HC, who may be junior to the ad hoc judge, and decide pending cases. This means, no fresh cases would be listed before a bench which has an ad hoc judge.Till 1970, some retired SC judges were reappointed to the top court. But the practice was rare in HCs. Instances of reappointment of retired HC judges were for specific purposes - Justice Suraj Bhan to Madhya Pradesh HC in Nov 1972, nearly nine months after his retirement, for disposal of election petitions; Justice P Venugopal for two years in Madras HC in Aug 1983; and Justice O P Srivastava as ad hoc judge of Allahabad HC in 2007 as he was part of the special bench hearing the Ayodhya suits.The Allahabad high court, with a sanctioned strength of 160 judges but functioning at 50% strength, has the highest pendency of more than 11.5 lakh cases - 6 lakh civil cases and 5.5 lakh criminal cases.Of the total pendency of over 62 lakh cases in HCs, 18.2 lakh are criminal cases and 44 lakh civil. Total pendency in Bombay HC is 6.5 lakh, Calcutta HC 2 lakh, Madras HC 5.2 lakh, Delhi HC 1.3 lakh, Punjab and Haryana HC 4.3 lakh and Karnataka HC 3 lakh.To facilitate early reappointment of retired HC judges under Article 224A, the bench kept in abeyance certain impractical conditions a three-judge bench of the SC had imposed in its April 20, 2021, judgment. These include the rider that ad hoc judges can be appointed only when there is less than 20% vacancy in a HC; and if 10% of pending cases are more than five years old.Supreme Court had reasoned that if retired judges were allowed to be appointed without any caveat, then HC collegiums would be lax in recommending names for filling the vacancies with regular appointments.Article 224 provides that though such retired judges on being appointed as ad hoc judges would draw a salary and enjoy powers and privileges of an HC judge, they would not be deemed to be a judge of the HC. This means, they will not have any say in the administrative affairs of the high court, nor will they head a division bench.","Supreme Court on Thursday, with the Centre's agreement, ordered that a maximum of five retired HC judges could be reappointed to each HC to hear criminal cases.

NEW DELHI: The Budget session of Parliament, which starts on Friday with President Droupadi Murmu's address, is once again likely to be contentious. The first signs of it emerged at Thursday's all-party meeting attended by representatives from 36 parties, where opposition vowed to raise issues, such as the Maha Kumbh stampede and waqf bill.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju sought cooperation from all parties for a productive session, saying that the business advisory committee would decide which issues would be taken up for discussion.The winter session witnessed severe disruption, leading to a scuffle in which two MPs were injured.When asked about the stampede at Maha Kumbh, Rijiju said the issue was also mentioned for discussion.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, who chaired the meeting on Thursday, informed parties about the legislative agenda and sought their inputs. According to sources, Singh mentioned that Uttar Pradesh govt had ordered a probe into the tragedy in Prayagraj.Opposition parties, including Congress and Samajwadi Party, protested the functioning of Joint Parliamentary Committee on waqf bill.

The decision affects nine of the 11 scholarship programmes - originally allocated Rs 13.6 crore - offered by the department of minority welfare.Govt insists that the reduction in plan size is being adjusted on a priority basis but the disproportionate cutback in educational assistance for minority students raises questions about policy priorities and social justice.The hardest hit is the Prof Joseph Mundassery Scholarship, which was allocated Rs 5.2 crore this year. It has been a lifeline for high-achieving students from the Muslim, Sikh, Jain and Parsi communities, offering Rs 10,000 to those securing A-Plus in all subjects in the SSLC examination and Rs 15,000 to those scoring 80% in higher secondary or 75% in vocational higher secondary courses. With priority given to students from below-poverty-line (BPL) families and provisions extended to those from economically weaker sections of the above-poverty-line (APL) category, it ensured that bright students from underprivileged backgrounds were not forced to abandon their education due to financial constraints.The APJ Abdul Kalam Scholarship, another critical support for minority students, has also been halved. The scholarship, of Rs 6,000, is offered to those securing admission in govt-approved institutions on merit, with priority for those from BPL families. It also reserves 30% of funds for female students, meaning the cuts could affect young women from disadvantaged backgrounds who already face hurdles in accessing higher education.The Mother Teresa Scholarship, which supports students from Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi communities pursuing diploma courses in govt nursing and paramedical institutions, is another scheme affected. Many aspiring nurses and paramedics, whose families struggle to afford the cost of professional training, now face the grim prospect of discontinuing their studies.The decision has also affected scholarships for those studying abroad, financial assistance for civil service coaching and reimbursement for UGC coaching.When education remains the most powerful tool for social mobility, slashing financial assistance for students from historically marginalised communities only widens the gap between privilege and disadvantage, IUML leader M K Muneer said. ""The LDF govt always speaks about the younger generation and knowledge economy. This is contradictory to that stance. They justify the Plan cuts citing a financial crisis and claim they are prioritising essential expenditures. If this so-called prioritisation results in slashing scholarships meant for underprivileged students, it clearly exposes where the govt's real priorities lie,"" he said.Many families from minority communities rely on these scholarships for their children's education. The selective austerity measures also raise the question of who bears the real cost of the financial crisis.","The decision affects nine of the 11 scholarship programmes offered by the department of minority welfare.

Haryana bid to drop 'irrelevant' caste names reveals 2013 'illegality',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/haryana-bid-to-drop-irrelevant-caste-names-reveals-2013-illegality/articleshow/117761936.cms,"NEW DELHI: Haryana govt's proposal seeking deletion of three caste names from the its Scheduled Caste list for being ""objectionable and irrelevant"" has brought to light an ""illegality"" committed more than a decade ago by the state.The state had in 2013 issued administrative orders announcing that caste certificates to 'Chura' and 'Bhangi', and 'Mochi', will in future be issued as ' Balmiki ' and 'Chamar' respectively, since Haryana had decided to delete the three names from the SC list.Haryana's 2013 instructions to its field officers and institutions about issuing certificates to these communities in the name of two synonymous castes inadvertently came to light only now - the state is learnt to have reportedly enclosed it as supporting evidence to press its plea to the Centre for dropping of the names from the list.According to sources, the 2013 order is ""blatantly unconstitutional"" as the state has no power to tinker with the SC list or decide the fate of the names. According to Article 341, the mandate to make any change to the SC list rests with Centre and Parliament through legislative amendment. Also, there is a laid down process of consultation to arrive at a decision on such issues.In what is viewed as an attempt to remove from public parlance the community names that are widely deployed as pejoratives, Haryana has urged the Union ministry for social justice and empowerment to drop 'Chura', 'Bhangi' and 'Mochi' from the SC list, arguing that the words are ""not only objectionable"" but have also ""lost relevance"", as reported by TOI.Since the Centre has come to know about Haryana's decision after 12 years, there is a lack of clarity if the state had, in pursuance of its 2013 instructions, stopped issuing certificates in the names of three communities, and replaced them with two others. ""Any such action would be illegal and will have to be nixed retrospectively,"" it is argued.There is a possibility that the Centre may seek more information from Haryana if its 2013 instructions were followed, and if the three communities in question are no longer issued certificates on their own names.Oblivious, Haryana seems to have enclosed the 2013 order to add weight to its proposal for deletion of the three names. Sources said the Centre had in the past, after consultation, advised Delhi govt to withdraw a move similar to Haryana's, while in 2005-06, it had overruled a decision of UP govt to transfer some OBC communities to the SC list.","Haryana govt's proposal seeking deletion of three caste names from the its Scheduled Caste list has brought to light an ""illegality"" committed more than a decade ago.

LUCKNOW: The Yogi Adityanath government in UP cancelled Thursday all VIP protocols in Prayagraj - pilot cars, police escort and direct entry, among other privileges - for the three remaining special snan days of Maha Kumbh following the Mauni Amavasya stampede.The curbs will kick in on the eve of Amrit Snan on Basant Panchami (Feb 3), Maghi Purnima (Feb 12) and Shivratri (Feb 26), and remain in force for a day each after these events. The administration has also clamped a blanket ban on vehicles entering the mela zone till Feb 4. A three-member judicial commission has begun its probe into the stampede in which 30 pilgrims died.Additional DGP (Prayagraj) Bhanu Bhaskar said: ""Between Feb 5 and 26, excluding Maghi Purnima and Shivratri, vehicular movement within the city will be restricted.""A govt spokesperson said CM Adityanath reviewed security and crowd management with senior officials late Wednesday and directed them to ""strictly enforce"" measures that were announced even before Maha Kumbh started.""Droves of pilgrims are arriving to bathe at Triveni Sangam . The state govt has notified that VIPs planning to be a part of Maha Kumbh even on days other than the main snan events would need to intimate the mela administration a week in advance. This will ensure that last-minute VIP movement doesn't inconvenience pilgrims,"" the spokesperson said.DGP Prashant Kumar, who took stock of arrangements at the Maha Kumbh zone with chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh, said the administration would do whatever it takes to ensure a hitch-free Basant Panchami.The DGP and chief secretary also visited Moti Lal Nehru Medical College to meet some of those injured in the stampede.Adityanath deputed Ashish Goyal, who was divisional commissioner of Prayagraj during the 2019 Kumbh, and Bhanu Goswami, former vice-chairperson of Allahabad Development Authority, to oversee the mela administration.Five officers of the rank of special secretary have been posted in Prayagraj until Feb 12 to assist him in managing the event. More SP-level officers have been deployed to handle security duties.Steps to regulate pedestrian movement and prevent overcrowding include creating one-way pathways at several places. This is meant to prevent bottlenecks, reduce the risk of stampede, and enable emergency services to operate efficiently if and when needed.Movement through the pontoon bridges has been eased. Some bridges were shut on Mauni Amavasya to stop pilgrims from crowding the Sangam area, but it apparently proved counter-productive. The Prayagraj administration urged all pilgrims and visitors to strictly adhere to the new regulations.","VIP protocols in Prayagraj cancelled for three remaining special snan days of Maha Kumbh.

The models are designed to adapt and can be further fine-tuned for specific applications making them versatile.Vaishnaw said the number of high-tech GPUs being procured - as part of the Rs 10,372 crore IndiaAI mission - are sufficient for now to power India's AI quest, pointing out that DeepSeek was built with around 2,000 GPUs.Dismissing apprehensions over India being late in its AI quest, he said, being a trusted partner, it enjoys the support of countries such as the US. ""We are well in time. The most important thing is getting the compute facility. And this is now being made available. We are in very good shape. Getting the compute facility was very, very, very critical to the mission.""He said India is confident of a regular supply of GPUs by companies such as Nvidia, despite restrictions by the US govt against certain countries.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Stock market recommendations:The Nifty index experienced a pullback for the third consecutive session on Thursday, closing the monthly expiry sessions with a gain of 0.37% at 23,249,50. Following a 13% correction from its all-time high of 26,277 over the past four months, Nifty appears to be forming a base within the 22,800-23,450 range in the last three weeks. This consolidation is happening ahead of major events like the Union Budget 2025, Delhi Election, and the RBI monetary policy outcome. Volatility is expected to stay elevated as these events approach.Dips in the index are seen as potential buying opportunities, with strong support in the 23,000-22,800 range, which aligns with the current week’s low and a key trendline support. On the upside, resistance is located between 23,400-23,600 being the confluence of the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), the previous major breakdown area and the almost identical highs from the past two weeks. A breakout above this resistance could shift sentiment and open up a move towards 24,000-24,200 in the coming weeks.The market breadth indicator, measured by the percentage of stocks above the 50-day EMA in the Nifty 500, is recovering from oversold conditions. It reached a low of 8% last Tuesday and is now at 13%. Historically, the 5%-8% range has marked a rebound point for the Nifty, further supporting the potential for a pullback in the index.Bank Nifty gained for the 3rd session in a row on Thursday to close higher by 0.3% at 49,311.95 levels. The index has witnessed a strong pullback during this week from the lower band of the last 3 weeks range (47,800-50,300) after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced measures to inject over Rs 1.5 lakh crore into the money markets, marking the largest monetary easing since the pandemic. This move aims to address the liquidity shortfall caused by the RBI’s efforts to stabilize the rupee through dollar sales.We expect the index to extend the consolidation in the range of 47,800-50,300. With key resistance placed around 50,300 levels being the confluence of multiple moving averages and previous major breakdown areas. Only a breakout above 50,300 will signal a shift in sentiment and open up a move towards 51,600-52,000 in the coming weeks.The stock has been consolidating near the 200-week EMA for the past three weeks after a sharp 33% decline over the last seven months. Currently the stock is in oversold territory, it presents an attractive risk-reward setup. Strong support is seen around 122-123, which is expected to hold, providing a foundation for a potential bounce towards 146, a key retracement level and the 200-day EMA.Bharat Electronics has been an outperformer in the Defense sector, with buying interest emerging over the last two sessions after forming a base above the 52-week EMA (currently at 264).The stock has taken six months to retrace just 50% of its previous six-month up move (172-340), which indicates a positive bias. We expect the stock to continue its upward momentum and head towards 307 levels being the 80% retracement of the previous decline (320-253).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Tata Steel and Bharat Electronics are the top stock picks for today.

Florida artist Kimberly Marasco has taken legal action against Taylor Swift and her production company

Taylor Swift's international Eras Tour finally came to an end. It began in March of 2023 in Glendale, Arizona and ended last December in Vancouver, Canada, marking the greatest-selling tour of all time by reaching $2 billion in sales. However, she was dragged to court immediately after a performance in Florida after a singer asserted that several Swift songs were written by her, thus taken from her work, and sought damages totaling $7 million.A Florida artist named, Kimberly Marasco, has filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Taylor Swift and her production company, claiming that Swift's songs and music videos were copied without her permission or credit, resulting in a demand for over $7 million in damages. Marasco has accused them of copyright infringement. The lawsuit, filed in April 2024, originally sought just US$100 in compensation.The case was transferred in May 2024 from the small claims court to the Southern District of Florida, where a Judge Aileen Cannon, a Donald Trump appointee, serves. In October 2024, Marasco amended her complaint to seek damages exceeding $7 million for what she claimed is the unauthorized use of creative elements used in Taylor Swift songs and music videos.Marasco claimed that she has identified more than a dozen tracks from Swift's albums Lover, Folklore, Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department-which incorporate themes and text from her poems Fallen from Grace and Dealing with Chronic Illness: Vestibular Neuritis,"" Thompson notes.However, according to the latest reports, Taylor Swift has been temporarily dropped from the legal filing by the concerned Judge Aileen Cannon after the Florida woman was unable to serve the case on time last month. However, she still faces her claims against her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, and her ruling allows Marasco to refile the lawsuit in the future.Swift's lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss the case against Marasco, stating that over 50% of her claims are ""time-barred."" Marasco plans to appeal or refile the suit and has called for all parties involved to meet and seek a resolution. Lawyers Aaron S. Blynn and Katherine Wright Morrone argued that Kimberly Marasco's claims are unfounded and her last chance to present a valid claim has failed.Also Read: Taylor Swift's most exuberant hug after the Chiefs win over the Bills went to a different man, not boyfriend Travis Kelce Marasco, though not a celebrated nation author, stood up for her original works, saying that she wants to preserve her creations and hopes to be accorded the same protections as any individual, regardless of fame or status.","A Florida artist named, Kimberly Marasco, has filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Taylor Swift and her production company.

Contrary to rumors, Alonso will remain with his agent Scott Boras, dismissing any plans to switch agencies. Despite interest from the Toronto Blue Jays, it remains uncertain if Alonso will rejoin the Mets.

Pete Boras Will Be Staying With Scott Boras And Wont Be Looking For A New Agent, As Per Ben Nicholson Smith



Pete Alonso’s Situation Continues To Be Messy And Mysterious With The New York Mets And The Toronto Blue Jays



Pete Alonso , one of the most talented players in Major League Baseball, has been the topic of news and debate lately as he continues to be a free agent. As per Joel Sherman of the New York Post, Pete reportedly turned down a three year deal with the New York Mets for $68 million to $70 million. Many fans and experts believe it was under Pete Alonso’s agent, Scott Boras ’ influence that led him to make such a decision and Pete would fire Scott soon. But turns out, that is not the case at all.According to Ben Nicholson Smith of Sportsnet, Pete Alonso is probably not even thinking of taking a step towards firing his agency, the Boras Corporation, which is led by Scott Boras. As per Ben Nicholson Smith’s recent post on X, a source has revealed that Pete Alonso “cannot be contacted by any other agent” and he will carry on working with Scott Boras.The source has also revealed that it will be Pete Alonso who will be reaching out to MLB agents if he absolutely has to but not the other way around.This news has shocked everyone as nobody expected this of Pete Alonso. Recently, at the Amazin’ Day FanFest event, Steve Cohen, New York Mets’ owner had revealed being “exhausted” over negotiating with Pete Alonso.

The fan wrote, “What's the MLB rule on this? Agents can try and pry players from their current agent? So basically the reverse of the above; if a player is signed to a lesser known agent, Boras can swoop in and woo them as much as he wants?”Many poked fun at the situation as fans wrote about Pete Alonso being held “hostage” by Scott Boras.

DeepSeek: How a nerd with ‘terrible haircut’ shook up Silicon Valley's AI race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/deepseek-how-a-nerd-with-terrible-haircut-shook-up-silicon-valleys-ai-race/articleshow/117693138.cms,"The independent research group envisioned by High-Flyer took shape as DeepSeek. High-Flyer's founder and controlling shareholder, Liang Wenfeng, also serves as DeepSeek's discreet leader.

Poll Do You Believe DeepSeek's Success Will Lead to More Global AI Competition? No, Nvidia Will Continue to Lead Yes, It Could Disrupt the Current AI Market

Why it matters

DeepSeek’s AI is more than just another chatbot—it’s a symbol of China’s growing technological self-sufficiency. Its breakthrough challenges the long-standing assumption that the US holds an insurmountable lead in artificial intelligence.

At the core of US confidence was the belief that China needed American technology—particularly advanced semiconductors from Nvidia—to train competitive AI models. To maintain its dominance, Washington banned the export of high-end AI chips to China in 2022 and further tightened restrictions in 2023. Many assumed these moves would kneecap China’s AI ambitions.

Yet, DeepSeek has shattered that certainty. The company claims it trained its AI model using only 2,000 Nvidia chips , whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models. Even more astonishingly, OpenAI reportedly spent $1 billion on training ChatGPT, while DeepSeek did it with just about $6 million.

, whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models. Even more astonishingly, OpenAI reportedly spent $1 billion on training ChatGPT, while DeepSeek did it with just about $6 million. If these claims hold true, it could fundamentally reshape the AI industry. The assumption that cutting-edge AI requires enormous computing power, billion-dollar investments, and thousands of advanced chips may no longer be valid. Instead, DeepSeek has demonstrated that a highly efficient approach to AI training could level the playing field—allowing smaller players, and even adversarial nations, to catch up quickly.

Between the lines: How did DeepSeek pull this off?

1. A different approach to AI training:

This is akin to a search engine librarian:

2. A strategic stockpile of Nvidia chips

3. China’s ‘AI super geeks’ approach

A Trojan horse?

The rise of DeepSeek raises a troubling question for Washington: Could this technology be a Trojan horse? Under Chinese law, all tech companies are required to “cooperate with national intelligence efforts.” This means that any data fed into DeepSeek’s chatbot could, in theory, be accessible to the Chinese state.

Some analysts fear that DeepSeek’s chatbot could function as an AI-powered intelligence-gathering tool, subtly siphoning off user information under the guise of casual interactions. Others point to its built-in political censorship—when asked about topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre or China’s treatment of Uyghurs, DeepSeek either refuses to answer or echoes the Chinese government’s official stance.

With TikTok already under scrutiny in the US for alleged data harvesting, DeepSeek’s explosive rise is triggering similar concerns. The White House’s AI task force is reportedly investigating whether the platform poses a national security risk. “We should be alarmed,” said Ross Burley, co-founder of the Centre for Information Resilience. “Beijing has repeatedly weaponized its tech dominance for surveillance, control, and coercion,” Burley told Guardian.

What they’re saying

DeepSeek’s sudden rise has sparked polarizing reactions across the tech world:

President Donald Trump: Called DeepSeek a ""wake-up call"" for US industries, warning that China’s AI leap could threaten American economic and national security.

Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO): Praised DeepSeek as “impressive” and welcomed the competition, despite previously framing AI development as a battle between democracy and authoritarianism.

Elon Musk: Expressed doubts, suggesting that DeepSeek downplayed its use of banned US chips.

US National Security Officials: Are now investigating potential data security risks, given that DeepSeek stores user data on servers in China—raising concerns about state surveillance.

What’s next?

DeepSeek’s rise throws a wrench into Washington’s AI strategy. The US has aggressively restricted China’s access to advanced AI chips, believing that these controls would slow Beijing’s progress. But DeepSeek’s breakthrough suggests that China has found ways to innovate despite these restrictions.

Stronger US export controls : The Trump administrations will likely tighten AI-related export bans.

: The Trump administrations will likely tighten AI-related export bans. Restrictions may expand beyond hardware, targeting software and cloud-based AI services to further limit China’s progress.

Increased scrutiny of Chinese AI companies: US and European regulators may investigate DeepSeek’s funding sources to determine whether the Chinese government played a role.

US and European regulators may investigate DeepSeek’s funding sources to determine whether the Chinese government played a role. Concerns over data security could lead to bans on DeepSeek’s AI in Western markets, similar to TikTok’s ongoing legal battles.

US push for AI supremacy: The DeepSeek shock may accelerate government funding for AI innovation.

The DeepSeek shock may accelerate government funding for AI innovation. Trump’s $500 billion ""Stargate"" AI initiative could gain bipartisan support as Washington scrambles to ensure US leadership in AI.

Bottom line

China’s AI industry has delivered a seismic shock to the world. DeepSeek , a little-known startup, has unveiled a generative AI model that is reportedly as powerful as OpenAI’s ChatGPT—but developed at a fraction of the cost. This breakthrough, described by Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen as a ""Sputnik moment,"" has rattled global tech markets.The fallout was immediate. US tech stocks suffered a bloodbath, losing nearly $1 trillion in value in a single day. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, saw $589 billion wiped off its market capitalization in what is now the largest one-day loss for any company in US history. The panic was fueled by fears that China’s AI could compete—and even surpass—US advancements while circumventing Washington’s chip restrictions.DeepSeek’s rise represents a stunning reversal of expectations. Just two years ago, China’s AI scene was seen as lagging behind the US. Beijing’s early attempts at ChatGPT-like models, such as Baidu’s Ernie and Tencent’s Hunyuan, were dismissed as inferior copies. Now, DeepSeek has positioned itself as a real contender, proving that China’s AI talent and research ecosystem are capable of groundbreaking innovation.DeepSeek’s success hinges on an unconventional training method. Traditional AI models process vast amounts of data, requiring massive computational resources. DeepSeek’s approach is different—it prioritizes knowing where to look for answers rather than memorizing everything.Traditional AI models behave like a librarian who has read every book in the library and pulls from memory to answer questions. DeepSeek’s model doesn’t read every book in advance. Instead, it quickly finds the right book when asked a question—a more efficient and cost-effective approach. This technique, combined with a “mixture of experts” strategy—which assigns specialized AI models to different types of questions—dramatically reduces the computing power needed to train AI.While the US tried to block China from accessing advanced AI chips, DeepSeek found a loophole. Before Washington closed the door in 2023, DeepSeek and other Chinese firms stockpiled tens of thousands of Nvidia’s A100 and H800 chips.These chips, though slightly less powerful than Nvidia’s cutting-edge H100, were still good enough for training DeepSeek’s AI. Some experts, including Elon Musk, have speculated that DeepSeek may have secretly acquired more high-end chips than disclosed.The brains behind DeepSeek is a 39-year-old Chinese hedge funder named Liang Wenfeng . As per a CNN report, in interviews with the state-linked financial outlet Yicai, early business associates described the future DeepSeek founder as somewhat “nerdy” and recalled “a terrible haircut” he once had.Liang Wenfeng believes in hiring fresh graduates over experienced professionals. His rationale?Experienced engineers follow conventional approaches. Young engineers are more willing to experiment and think outside the box. This philosophy appears to have worked. Liang’s team of under 140 researchers—mostly graduates from China’s elite universities—designed a breakthrough AI system in record time. Their success has boosted morale in China’s tech industry, with Liang now celebrated as one of China’s ""AI heroes.""DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough signals a shift in the global AI landscape. While it’s unclear if China will ultimately overtake the US in AI, one thing is certain: Silicon Valley’s AI monopoly is no longer guaranteed.(With inputs from agencies)","DeepSeek claims it trained its AI model using only 2,000 Nvidia chips, whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models.

Ever wonder if a college degree is the secret to billions? The world's richest people broke not only the bank but also quite some interesting educational paths. Here are the educational journeys of elite Ivy League dropouts and people who followed rather odd routes to great wealth.Did Jeff Bezos dream of e-commerce while studying engineering? What did Elon Musk learn before targeting Mars? Does Mark Zuckerberg regret leaving Harvard? Their answers might shock you! Whether they earned fancy diplomas or dropped class to join startups, these 10 billionaires show that the road to riches is as varied as it is inspiring. So get ready to dive into their educational stories and find out how they turned unconventional choices into world-changing fortunes!Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Motors, attended Queen's University in Canada but would later move to the United States to attend the University of Pennsylvania to pursue degrees in business and physics. His desire was thus fulfilled where he could be more entrepreneurial and up-to-date with the world of technology. His quest for deeper knowledge led him to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, after being at Stanford for only two days, he decided to pursue his entrepreneurial pursuits and left college. Although Musk never completed that program, this educational background largely molded his revolutionary ideas in matters related to technology and business.Jeff Bezos, the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, graduated from Princeton University, where he earned degrees in electrical engineering and computer science. His time at Princeton was pivotal in shaping his future, as the knowledge he gained in these fields laid the groundwork for his innovative work in technology and e-commerce. With a strong foundation in both engineering and computer science, Bezos combined technical expertise with a visionary mindset to revolutionize the retail industry. He founded Amazon, which is today the global powerhouse it is.Larry Ellison initially started as a pre-med student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign but later left before completion of his studies. He thereafter enrolled in the University of Chicago where he majored in physics and mathematics. But he did not graduate. Even though he dropped out from both high school and the University of Illinois early in his academic life, Ellison had become passionate about technology and innovation, which led to co-founding Oracle as it revolutionized the soft-ware industry. It is an enlightening reminder of how educational pathways are not the definitive route to success; rather, passion sometimes leads to incredible feats.Mark Zuckerberg first went to Harvard University to study psychology and computer science. Yet, after only two years, he quit college and took up the entrepreneurial career to pursue his goals. Focusing on Facebook was much more important to him than any college where he might have spent most of his time developing the social media platform that would change the course of connectivity among online users. Although he did not graduate from Harvard, dropping out marked the beginning of an incredible journey that made him one of the most influential figures in the tech world and one of the wealthiest individuals in the world.Bernard Arnault is the man behind the LVMH empire, which comprises brands such as Louis Vuitton and cosmetics giant Sephora. He graduated from École Polytechnique in Paris with a Bachelor of Arts and Science. This institution formed the basis for Arnault's incredible journey into the world of high-end fashion and cosmetics. His education was well-equipped with the analytical skills and business acumen that would later help him build one of the most influential luxury conglomerates in the world. Arnault's success story shows how a strong academic background can blend with entrepreneurial vision to create global dominance.Larry Page, the co-founder of Google, graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in computer engineering from the University of Michigan. While studying at Michigan, he established a strong background in computer science that eventually made him interested in search engine technology. Page later continued his studies for a PhD in computer science at Stanford University, where he met Sergey Brin. Together, they worked on a research project that eventually became Google. Page left his PhD program to focus on developing Google, but his academic background played a crucial role in shaping the innovative approach that led to the creation of one of the world's most successful tech companies.Sergey Brin graduated with honors from the University of Maryland, College Park, with a Bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science. He later acquired his Master's degree in computer science from Stanford University. At this time, he was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, an award that recognizes potential to grow into new talent in technology. This is where Larry Page came into his life, and he and Page started on a journeythat transformed the tech industry itself, making him the man behind Google, the world's leading search engine.Warren Buffett studied business at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Economics in 1950. After that, he studied economics at Columbia Business School, earning a Master of Science in Economics in 1951. At Columbia, he was under the mentorship of Benjamin Graham, one of the most important economists and investors, whose value investing principles Buffett used to great effect in his investment strategies.Steve Ballmer graduated from Harvard University in 1977, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics. He later attended Stanford Graduate School of Business, graduating with an MBA in 1980. His academic exposure to applied mathematics, economics, and business paved the way for his professional life at Microsoft. After joining the company in 1980, he became very close to Bill Gates, eventually taking on the position of CEO from 2000-2014 and steering the company through growth that turned it into one of the world's most valuable tech companies.The founder and CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang, has impressive academic credentials. He earned his Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Oregon State University. He further went on to obtain his Master's degree in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. Huang's education in electrical engineering laid a foundation for his future career in technology and semiconductor industries. In 1993, he founded NVIDIA which he co-founded and made a leader in graphics processing units and AI technology that creates innovations in gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence.","The world's richest people are not all Ivy League dropouts.

Budget 2025 income tax expectations : Ever since the last Union Budget was presented in July 2024, the world has seen significant changes ranging from various elections, global economic slowdown, geopolitical developments, volatile Indian stock markets, etc. Having witnessed all of this, the common man awaits with eager anticipation from the Hon'ble Finance Minister as she gears up to unveil her eighth straight budget. Some of the key expectations that individual taxpayers may have are discussed below.It is anticipated that with the thrust of the Government on the adoption of the new tax regime, there may be no changes to the old tax regime. The basic tax exemption limit under the new tax regime is currently at Rs 3 lakh. It is hoped that this limit may be increased to Rs 5 lakh, providing more disposable income for individuals to either spend or save, thereby boosting the overall economy.The full rebate of tax is available up to income limit of Rs 7 lakh currently under the new tax regime.

This increase will help combat inflation and address the higher personal expenses incurred due to changes in work culture, such as working from home, hybrid work, and work from anywhere.n line with the Government's objective of ""Housing for All"" and fostering home ownership, it is suggested that the Government reconsider allowing deductions for interest on self-occupied housing loans under the new default tax regime.To reduce the carbon footprint and move towards clean energy, the Government should reintroduce the deduction provided under section 80EEB (deduction for interest on loan taken to purchase an electric vehicle) and extend it to the new regime as well.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Individual taxpayers want FM Sitharaman to lower tax rates, make new tax regime more attractive, says survey Currently, if a property seller is a resident, buyers must deduct tax at 1% of the consideration if the property value is Rs 50 lakh or more and file a challan-cum-statement, which is a simple and convenient process. However, if the seller is a non-resident, the buyer must obtain a TAN for this one-off transaction, deduct tax at a higher rate, and file a TDS return, which is a cumbersome process.

Tourism minister Rohan Khaunte has instructed the tourism director to initiate an enforcement drive to regulate the operations of shacks, water sports, adventure activities, and other tourism-related activities. Khaunte said the department will not tolerate Goans subletting their shacks to “Delhiwallahs” and outsiders.“Using technology, we will go to the next level and ensure each shack is monitored. From Mandrem to Calangute to the south, mapping has started,” said Khaunte.He said that shack operation was a traditional business of locals and that it “must remain with Goans”. He said the tourism department simplified the allotment process, agreed to all the demands of the Shack Owners Welfare Society , and issued permissions for shacks well in advance with the “belief that a Goan will not give away his own business” to a “Delhiwallah come here to make money”.The minister said that enforcement drives will be continuous. He also said Goan shack operators finding it unviable to operate the allotted shacks should surrender them so that those on the waiting list get a chance. “These Delhiwallahs come here to make money and these incidents happen. We have been very clear that these businesses cannot be allowed to be taken over by outsiders,” said Khaunte.Speaking about paragliding activities, Khaunte said extreme adventure sports are fraught with risks, which tourists and enthusiasts need to understand and accept. “Adventure activities come under extreme sports and such extreme sports will always have some danger.

The decision affects nine of the 11 scholarship programmes, originally allocated Rs 13.62 crore, offered by the department of minority welfare.Govt insists that the reduction in Plan size is being adjusted on a priority basis, but the disproportionate cutback in educational assistance for minority students raises questions about policy priorities and social justice. The hardest hit is the Prof Joseph Mundassery Scholarship , which was allocated Rs 5.24 crore this year. It has been a lifeline for high-achieving students from Muslim, Sikh, Jain and Parsi communities, offering Rs 10,000 to those securing A-Plus in all subjects in the SSLC examination and Rs 15,000 to those scoring 80% in higher secondary or 75% in vocational higher secondary courses.With priority given to students from below-poverty line (BPL) families and provisions extended to those from economically weaker sections of the above-poverty line (APL) category, it ensured that bright students from underprivileged backgrounds are not forced to abandon their education due to financial constraints.The APJ Abdul Kalam Scholarship , another critical support for minority students, has also been halved. The scholarship of Rs 6,000 is offered to those securing admission in govt-approved institutions on merit, with priority for those from BPL families. It also reserves 30% of funds for female students, meaning the cuts could affect young women from disadvantaged backgrounds who already face hurdles in accessing higher education.The Mother Teresa Scholarship, which supports students from Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi communities pursuing diploma courses in govt nursing and paramedical institutions, is another scheme affected. Many aspiring nurses and paramedics, whose families struggle to afford the cost of professional training, now face the grim prospect of discontinuing their studies.The decision has also affected scholarships for those studying abroad, financial assistance for civil service coaching and reimbursement for UGC coaching.When education remains the most powerful tool for social mobility, slashing financial assistance for students from his torically marginalised communities only widens the gap between privilege and disadvantage, IUML leader M K Muneer said.“The LDF govt always speaks about the younger generation and knowledge economy. This is contradictory to that stance. They justify the Plan cuts citing financial crisis and claim they are prioritising essential expenditures. If this so-called prioritisation results in slashing scholarships meant for underprivileged students, it clearly exposes where the govt’s real priorities lie,” he said.Many families from minority communities rely on these scholarships for their children’s education and they are now punished for no fault of their own. The selective austerity measures also raise the question as to who bears the real cost of the financial crisis.","The decision affects nine of the 11 scholarship programmes, originally allocated Rs 13.62 crore.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Donald Trump's foreign aid suspension hits Pakistan: How it will impact key sectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-foreign-aid-suspension-hits-pakistan-how-it-will-impact-key-sectors/articleshow/117733040.cms,"Immediate impact on key sectors



US policy shift and review timeline



Economic and social consequences for Pakistan



Geopolitical ramifications



Uncertain future for development initiatives



NEW DELHI: Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan, for re-evaluation, putting several critical development projects on hold.The decision follows an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, directing a comprehensive review of US foreign aid spending.The US aid suspension is set to impact several key sectors in Pakistan, including energy, economic growth, agriculture, governance, education, health, and cultural preservation. Projects such as the Power Sector Improvement Activity, Pakistan Private Sector Energy Initiative, and Clean Energy Loan Portfolio Guarantee Program face disruptions in the energy sector, as per a Geo news report.Economic growth initiatives, including the Social Protection Activity and Pakistan Private Investment Initiative, may also suffer setbacks. In agriculture, programmes like Water Management for Enhanced Productivity and Recharge Pakistan risk losing funding.The suspension has stalled numerous USAID-funded projects across various sectors, including health, education, agriculture, energy, and governance. The move halts initiatives such as the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP), the Power Sector Improvement Activity, and the Pakistan Private Sector Energy Activity. Economic growth initiatives, such as the Social Protection Activity and Investment Promotion Activity, are also affected.In the education sector, projects aimed at improving girls' education, strengthening higher education systems, and enhancing resilience in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been disrupted. The health sector has also taken a hit, with the suspension of tuberculosis treatment programmes, family health initiatives, and global health security efforts.Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the US Department of State, confirmed that all foreign aid funded by the State Department and USAID is under review. Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified the move, stating that every aid dollar must contribute to American security, strength, and prosperity.The White House has clarified that the suspension is temporary, with a 90-day review period. The final decision will be made by the relevant departments in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).The suspension of aid threatens Pakistan’s development trajectory, particularly in regions relying on US-funded initiatives for stability and growth. The decision could delay infrastructural advancements, limit economic opportunities, and disrupt healthcare access for vulnerable populations.Pakistan’s governance and democracy-building programmes are also affected, including projects on electoral reforms, land registration, and local governance. The decision may weaken institutional development efforts and impede progress in human rights and civic participation.The suspension highlights a shift in US-Pakistan relations , with Washington reassessing its financial commitments to Islamabad. Analysts believe this could push Pakistan to seek alternative funding sources, possibly from China or Gulf nations, altering its geopolitical alliances.While the pause in aid does not signify a complete severance of US-Pakistan ties, it raises concerns about future diplomatic engagements and financial support from Washington. The upcoming review will determine whether these programmes will resume, be modified, or face permanent cuts.With crucial projects now in limbo, Pakistani officials and aid-dependent communities await the US review’s outcome. The next three months will be critical in determining whether Washington reinstates its financial commitments or signals a long-term reduction in aid to Pakistan.For now, the suspension leaves Pakistan navigating an uncertain future, with potential setbacks in economic growth, infrastructure development, and humanitarian assistance.","Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan. The decision follows an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, directing a comprehensive review of US foreign aid spending. The suspension has stalled numerous USAID-funded projects across various sectors, including health, education, agriculture, energy, and governance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117736815,imgsize-785910,width-400,resizemode-4/117736815.jpg"

Trump raised millions from crypto firms for his inauguration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-raised-millions-from-crypto-firms-for-his-inauguration/articleshow/117764876.cms,"US President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee received millions of dollars in donations from firms in the cryptocurrency industry that’s already seeing special attention from his administration, disclosures filed with the Senate Office of Public Records show.Coinbase Inc, Crypto.com, Galaxy Digital, Paradigm Operations and Payward Inc, better known as Kraken, each gave $1 million. Robinhood Markets, Inc, which offers a trading platform for digital currencies, contributed $2 million, according to the reports.Once a crypto skeptic, Trump enthusiastically embraced the industry as an investor, entrepreneur and source of political fundraising. Among large donors to his campaign and super political action committee were venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz and billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.In his first week in office, the president tapped David Sacks, the venture capitalist he named as his crypto czar, to head a task force that includes top cabinet officials to promote US digital financial technology. They’re to consider regulatory reform and creating a digital asset stockpile.Trump, who’s expected to easily surpass the $107 million he raised for his 2017 inauguration, received donations from other industries expecting more favorable policies from his administration. Chevron Corp. gave $2 million, a much heftier gift than the $525,000 it contributed for his first inauguration. Oklo Inc., which makes fission reactors that can run on nuclear waste, gave $250,000. Chris Wright, Trump’s pick to run the Energy department, sat on its board.Companies in the renewable energy business also donated. Hanwha Q Cells America Inc., the US subsidiary of the German solar panel maker, gave $500,000, as did GE Vernova, a General Electric spinoff that manufactures everything from gas turbines to blades for wind power. The American Clean Power Association, a trade group that represents wind, solar, clean hydrogen and transmission companies, gave $100,000.Among the flurry of executive orders he issued to start his term, Trump froze permits to new offshore wind power installations, a major setback for the industry, and invoked emergency powers in a bid to bolster domestic energy production.His inaugural committee also received money from many donors who didn’t give the first time around. They include some who had earlier acknowledged they were doing so, such as Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., who each gave $1 million. Other new donors that gave that amount include health-care companies Bayer Corporation and Johnson & Johnson.The disclosures offer a partial glimpse into some of the moneyed interests who paid hefty sums to help welcome Trump back to Washington. Organizations with in-house lobbyists are required to semiannually disclose their political contributions.Trump’s inaugural committee isn’t due to release its complete list of donors to the Federal Election Commission until April 19.","Coinbase Inc, Crypto.com, Galaxy Digital, Paradigm Operations and Payward Inc, better known as Kraken, each gave $1 million.

Cash-strapped Sri Lanka ends ban on vehicle imports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/cash-strapped-sri-lanka-ends-ban-on-vehicle-imports/articleshow/117628103.cms,"Representative image

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka announced the lifting of a five-year ban on vehicle imports Tuesday as the country showed further signs of emerging from its worst economic meltdown.Information minister Nalinda Jayatissa said buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.""We are moving very cautiously because we don't want a surge of imports that will deplete our foreign reserves,"" Jayatissa told reporters in Colombo.""Depending on the demand, we will open imports of other categories of vehicles such as cars, motorcycles and three-wheelers.""He said the imports were necessary to generate much-needed tax revenue, and the government hoped to cap imports at about $1.2 billion this year.Current tax rates on vehicles are over 300 per cent.Sri Lanka spent $1.4 billion on vehicle imports in 2019, the last full year before the import ban was imposed in March 2020.The island nation earlier attempted to end the ban on commercial vehicle imports in August 2023, but importers were unable to open letters of credit while the country was still in default on its foreign debt.Sri Lanka formally ended its status as a bankrupt nation in December after securing debt restructuring deals with both bilateral and private creditors.Sri Lanka defaulted on its $46 billion external debt in April 2022 as the country ran out of foreign exchange to finance imports, causing painful shortages of food, fuel and medicines.Months of street protests led to the toppling of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was accused of corruption and mismanagement.His successor secured a bailout loan from the international monetary fund , which has said that the South Asian nation is making a recovery but is still not out of the woods.","Buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.
