India to begin testing new long-range interceptor missiles for defence shield next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-begin-testing-new-long-range-interceptor-missiles-for-defence-shield-next-year/articleshow/123536547.cms,"NEW DELHI: India will next year begin testing new interceptor missiles for an indigenous air and missile defence shield under Project Kusha, which will be a critical element of the ambitious `Mission Sudarshan Chakra (MSC)’ announced by PM Modi to provide security cover to strategic as well as vital civilian areas in the country by 2035.The plan is to test the M1 missile, with an interception range of 150-km against incoming enemy aircraft, stealth fighters, cruise missiles, drones and precision-guided munitions, in 2026. It will be followed by M2 (250-km range) in 2027 and M3 (350-km range) in 2028 for the missile-based layered defence system being developed by DRDO, top sources told TOI.The aim is to complete the development of these three long-range surface-to-air missiles (LR-SAMs) and related systems under Project Kusha by 2028 to, hopefully, pave the way for their induction from 2030 onwards, the sources added.This fully-automated LR-SAM system, which will rival the expensive Russian-origin S-400 Triumf air defence system deployed by the IAF in limited numbers, will be a part of the overall MSC plan to build a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield around key locations.In this, it will be somewhat similar to the proposed `Golden Dome’ missile defence initiative of the US or the deployed Israeli `Iron Dome’, which only has to protect a very small country.It is estimated the expansive Golden Dome, with the capability to also shoot down missiles in space, will cost around $500 billion over the next 20 years.Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, at the `Ran Samwad’ conclave at Mhow on Tuesday, said he was sure India could build its own “Iron or Golden Dome” under the MSC at “an affordable cost” with a whole-of-nation approach.“It will act both as a shield and sword,” the CDS said, in tune with the PM’s statement that the defence shield will not only thwart aerial threats but also launch counter-strikes to hit the adversary “many times more”.This clearly implies India will go in for a major expansion of its conventional (non-nuclear) arsenal of missiles like Pralay (500-km strike range), BrahMos (increased range from 450-km to 800-km) and land-attack cruise missiles (1,000-km range).Gen Chauhan, on his part, acknowledged the proposed defence shield will require “a colossal amount of integration” of myriad capabilities as well as development of infrastructure and processes for “detection, acquisition and neutralisation of enemy air vectors, using soft and hard kill options, including kinetic and directed energy weapons (like lasers)”.The shield, of course, will require multi-domain ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) through an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors deployed on land, air, sea, undersea and space.Then, robust land and sea-based batteries of a wide array of short to long range SAM missiles, high-power lasers and other weapons will be needed. Finally, reliable command and control posts to manage the sensors and weapons with an integrated air picture to effectively respond in real-time.A small beginning was made with DRDO’s maiden test of an integrated air defence weapon system (IADWS) on Aug 23. It included quick reaction surface-to-air missiles (QRSAMS, with 30-km interception range), very short-range air defence system (VSHORADS, with 6-km range) missiles and a 30-kilowatt laser-based directed energy weapon (DEW, with 3.5-km range).“Many of the building blocks for the MSC defence shield have either been developed or are being developed. The real challenge will be to integrate them all. It will cost a lot of money for a large country like India,” a source said.A comprehensive defence shield will also include the operational deployment of Phase-I of the indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which has been developed by DRDO to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, at different altitudes both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere for “a higher kill probability”.In July last year, DRDO also successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of the BMD system, with the defence ministry proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.","India will next year begin testing new interceptor missiles for an indigenous air and missile defence shield under Project Kusha. The plan is to test the M1 missile, with an interception range of 150-km against incoming enemy aircraft, stealth fighters, cruise missiles, drones and precision-guided munitions.

Gadget tips for monsoon: What to do and what to avoid this rainy season

NEW DELHI: At 21% above normal, north India has so far recorded its wettest monsoon since 2013, the year of the cataclysmic Kedarnath flash flood. Worryingly, in Aug, the region has experienced by far the highest number of 'extremely heavy' rain events since the India Meteorological Department (IMD) began collating this data in 2021.Till Aug 25, north India had logged 21 extremely heavy rain events, a 50% rise over the previous highest of 14 recorded last year, even though that month had registered higher rainfall. The number of such events is likely to rise further by the end of the month, making this Aug's monsoon among the most destructive in the region in recent years.'Extremely heavy' is IMD's highest category of daily rainfall recorded at a weather station, defined as over 204.5mm in 24 hours.This monsoon, north India is the only one among India's four regions to register a rain surplus in all three months (June, July, Aug) of the season so far - another first for the North since 2013.""In the last two months, northwest India (IMD nomenclature for north India) has seen high rainfall activity mainly because of frequent interactions between western disturbances and monsoon currents from Bay of Bengal and sometimes from Arabian Sea.When these two currents meet over the region, a lot of rain takes place,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, IMD chief.North India (or northwest India) is a meteorological region comprising states/UTs of J&K, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, UP and Rajasthan. Mohapatra said most of the extreme rain events in north India had taken place in the two hill states and the UT of J&K.The extreme rainfall data for the region reveals that while Aug last year had more 'heavy' (64.4-115.5mm) and 'very heavy' (115.5-204.4mm) rain events, it recorded far less number of 'extremely heavy' rainfall episodes than Aug this year. Last year, north India had reported its wettest month of Aug in 28 years since 1996, with the region as a whole logging 256.4mm of rain. The current month has so far (till Aug 26) reported 209.4mm, with five days still to go.""Due to formation of a trough in eastern Pakistan, the region has received a lot of rain in the past four days. The spell is likely to continue for one or two more days,"" Mohapatra said.The last three days have been the wettest in north India this monsoon season, with August 25 alone logging 21.8mm of rain, four times higher than the normal of 5.6mm for the day.","At 21% above normal, north India has so far recorded its wettest monsoon since 2013.

NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Tuesday cautioned against rushing the rollout of theatre commands, stressing that India must adopt its own model instead of copying others. He suggested setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to prepare for ""future wars.""Speaking at the Army War College, the Chief of Air Staff, cautioned against rushing into the creation of new theatre commands, warning that creating a new structure while disrupting everything is not a very good idea at this point of time.Instead, he proposed setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, placed under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to issue directions jointly saying, ""I personally feel that having a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi is what is required.""Responding to questions on the proposed theatre commands, Singh said, ""yes, we can start with this first, implement it and see how it pans out. If we need any more structure, we can think about it. But disrupting everything and making one structure now at this time, I do not think it is a very good idea.""The Air Chief Marshal's remarks came three-and-a-half months after Operation Sindoor, which showcased strong coordination among the Army, Navy and Air Force.Citing the recent Operation Sindoor, a tri-service simulation held from May 7 to 10 against Pakistan, Singh underlined how the three service chiefs worked closely in planning and execution.The exercise, he said, reinforced both the primacy of air power and the value of coordination. He further noted that ""centrally planned"" decisions could still be executed in a decentralised framework, which in his view ""will work out the best.""He also cautioned against blindly following international models saying India should not be inspired by any other country, like the US, in rolling out theatre commands, stressing that the nation must design a framework suited to its own requirements.""Everybody has their own requirements. We need to think about what we need there, and then only we should go about it. Otherwise, we will go wrong,"" he said.""We should not just come under any pressure and say we have to implement it now. Somehow, we have to do it. It should not be done this way. I think we can stand our ground and discuss things,"" he added.The Air Force chief also underlined the need to focus on preparing for tomorrow's wars, where clarity in the chain of command will be critical.""You cannot have a theatre commander sitting somewhere... now whom they talk to, where do they get directions from. Phones are available but generally that does not work like that,"" he said.""I feel having joint planning and coordination at the apex level is what is required. If directions go from it, things will work out. We don't actually need another structure at the lower level,"" Singh added.The government’s proposed theaterisation model aims to bring the three services under unified commands to better integrate capabilities and use resources more effectively.Under the plan, each theatre command would combine units of the Army, Navy and Air Force to handle security challenges in a specific region. Currently, the three services operate under separate commands.","Air Chief Marshal A P Singh says India must adopt its own model instead of copying others.

New Delhi: Govt Tuesday directed telecommunications service providers (TSP) to “implement exclusion zones in and around airports for installation and operation of C band 5G international mobile telecom stations” to avoid potentially catastrophic interference from 5G signals to aircraft systems — including radio altimeters that measure a plane’s aircraft's height above the terrain directly below it. This essentially means TSPs will have to install low power 5G antennae near runways to avoid string signals causing interference with aircraft systems.The Union aviation ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had last Nov suggested revised exclusion zones for ensuring safe landings and take offs. “The matter has been under deliberation of the department of telecommunications (DoT), civil aviation (ministry or MoCA) and DGCA.. the revised exclusion zones recommended (by) MoCA have been agreed as an interim measure till the upgradation or retrofitting of radio altimeters,” a DoT order issued Tuesday said.People in the know said aviation agencies in India had objected to rollout of 5G near airports due to aviation safety reasons. A radio altimeter giving a wrong reading can even lead to a crash. A paper by Boeing titled “5G radio altimeter interference” says: “Governments around the world are implementing 5G cellular systems in frequency ranges adjacent to or near the radio frequency band used by radio altimeters.The aviation industry and aviation regulators are concerned these 5G deployments will cause interference to radio altimeters… Concerns are based on a study done by industry and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (which) concluded 5G transmissions can interfere with radio altimeters. ” As a result of this study, alerts for 5G interference were issued by the Civil Aviation Authorities of France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Czech Republic, Saudi Arabia, Oman and UAE.Several advanced countries have safeguards for this with rules from the US Federal Aviation Administration and the European and European Union Aviation Safety Agency. India will also have similar safeguards and as an interim measure there will not be high powered 5G antennae near runways,” they said.The aviation authorities in India suggested an “envelope” near runways and prescribed the minimum distance at which certain low powered 5G antennae can be installed. The DoT order issued Tuesday to Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone and BSNL added, “Hence, (an earlier) DoT letter is suppressed and the exclusion zones (no C band and buffer zones) stands revised. TSPs are permitted to install and operate C band 5G/IMT services in frequency band 3300- 3670 MHz in and around airport areas as per the revised exclusion zone and technical conditions. ”",Government orders telecom service providers to install low power 5G antennae near runways to avoid string signals causing interference with aircraft systems.

NEW DELHI: Soon after the Centre cleared a Rs 62,000 crore deal to buy 97 more LCA Mark 1A fighter aircraft, India is close to signing a deal of around USD one billion with the American firm GE for supplying 113 more GE-404 engines for the indigenous combat aircraft.Indian state-owned firm Hindustan Aeronautics Limited has already inked a deal for 99 GE-404 engines with the American firm for the initial 83 LCA Mark 1A fighter jets ordered by the Indian Air Force and these 113 would be in addition to that.The negotiations are almost finalised for buying 113 more GE-404 engines from the American firm GE for the 97 LCAs. The deal is likely to be finalised by September this year, defence officials told ANI.The deal is expected to help HAL to get its complete requirement of 212 GE-404 engines in continuity, avoiding any types of delays in engine supplies.The HAL is working to supply the first 83 aircraft by the end of 2029-30 and the next batch of 97 LCA Mark 1As by 2033-34, they said.American GE is expected to supply two engines per month from now on to fulfill its commitment for the Indian programme.The HAL is also negotiating a deal with GE for buying its GE-414 engines with 80 per cent transfer of technology.The Indian side requires 200 GE-414 engines for its LCA Mark 2 and Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA).The around USD 1.5 billion deal is likely to be signed in the next few months, and negotiations for it have been going on for a long time now, the officials said.The Indian side requires 162 engines for the LCA Mark 2 aircraft and 10 others for the five prototypes of the AMCA.The programme will help the IAF to replace its fleet of MiG-21s, which are finally being phased out by the government in the next few weeks.The indigenous fighter jet project is fully backed by the Defence Ministry, and Air Headquarters and is set to be a big boost for promoting indigenisation as well as give major business to the small and medium enterprises engaged in defence business across the country, defence officials said.India is already working on an indigenous fighter aircraft engine project and will be working with the French firm Safran for it.India aims to achieve self-reliance in the defence sector through indigenisation and is also acquiring technologies from various global sources.",Indian state-owned firm Hindustan Aeronautics Limited has already inked a deal for 99 GE-404 engines for the initial 83 LCA Mark 1A fighter jets.

India Had Planes Before Wright Brothers: Shivraj Sparks Debate After Anurag's 'Astronaut' Hanuman

NEW DELHI: Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday sidestepped questions about the possibility of him becoming the next BJP president, saying his focus in entirely on boosting agricultural production and improving farmers' income.When asked about his reported meeting with RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in New Delhi over the past weekend sparking speculation about a potential BJP president candidacy, Chouhan reiterated that he was focused on his ministerial duties, news agency PTI reported.""I want to say one thing -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi has entrusted me with the responsibility of looking after ministries of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and Rural Development. At this moment, agriculture is in every pore of my body and farmers are in my breath,” Chouhan said.He added that, like the eyes of a bird, he had only one goal: to increase agricultural production, boost farmers’ income, develop rural areas and create more Lakhpati Didis.A Lakhpati Didi refers to a member of a self-help group (SHG) whose household earns over Rs 1 lakh annually.When pressed further about the BJP president post, Chouhan said, “Neither have I ever thought of it, nor has anyone told me. I can't even think of it.I am the Agriculture and Rural Development Minister. I am doing this work like worship. Serving farmers is worship of God for me and I want to keep doing this worship.”Chouhan, 66, a prominent OBC leader, has served as chief minister of Madhya Pradesh four times and is known for his strong grassroots connect.After leading the BJP to a decisive victory in the November 2023 Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, he resigned from the state assembly and won the 2024 Lok Sabha polls from Vidisha, subsequently joining Prime Minister Modi’s third-term Cabinet.The three-year term of the current BJP president, JP Nadda, had ended around two years ago. His tenure was extended later.","Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan sidestepped questions about the possibility of him becoming the next BJP president.

In the last 24 hours, India witnessed a series of major developments — from heavy rains in Jammu and Kashmir triggering a landslide on the route to the Vaishno Devi shrine atop Trikuta hill, to the Noida dowry case where the victim’s father alleged he gave Rs 1.5 lakh for setting up a beauty parlour, but her in-laws “did not even allow her to put up a signboard. ” On the global front, US tariffs have posed a significant trade challenge for India, impacting nearly 66% of Indian exports to the US, worth around $86.5 billion. Meanwhile, the Indian Navy marked a key milestone, and in sports, Cheteshwar Pujara, the former Indian Test cricket stalwart, announced his retirement after a distinguished career of 103 matches.Here are top 5 stories:At least five people died and 14 were injured after a landslide struck the Vaishno Devi shrine route near Adhkwari in Jammu and Kashmir’s Reasi district on Tuesday. The incident, triggered by relentless rainfall, occurred midway on the 12-km trek, leading to suspension of the yatra. Rescue operations with manpower and machinery are underway.

This is the first time two frontline warships built at different shipyards—Udaygiri at Mazagon Dock (Mumbai) and Himgiri at GRSE (Kolkata)—were inducted together.Part of the advanced Project 17A class, the frigates enhance Blue Water combat capabilities with stealth features, upgraded weapons, sensors, and propulsion systems. The event also marked Udaygiri as the 100th warship designed by the Navy’s Warship Design Bureau, underscoring India’s growing indigenous shipbuilding expertise. Read more The Donald Trump administration’s decision to impose 50% tariffs on Indian goods from August 27, 2025, is set to hit India’s export sector hard. A draft notification from the US Department of Homeland Security confirmed the move, impacting $60.2 billion worth of Indian exports—including textiles, jewellery, shrimp, carpets, and furniture.

HCs yet to comply with SC's timeline on reserved verdicts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hcs-yet-to-comply-with-scs-timeline-on-reserved-verdicts/articleshow/123534915.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court may have fixed timeline for the President and the governors for taking a decision on bills passed by state assemblies, but has not been able over nearly 24 years to get high courts to comply with its 2001 judgment laying guidelines on speedier pronouncement of verdicts reserved in cases.In 2001, SC in Anil Rai case noticed the troubling practice among HC judges reserving verdicts only to forget to pronounce judgments or pronounce only operating portions of the verdict with a promise to provide detailed reasons later, which in some cases went abegging.To eradicate the anomaly of keeping judgments reserved for months and in some cases years, SC laid down five-point guidelines that mandated the chief justices of HCs to remind the judges if they had not pronounced decisions within two months of reserving the verdict. SC also allowed the litigants to apply for early pronouncement of a judgment, if it was not delivered within three months of reserving it.The non-implementation of the guidelines was noticed on Monday by a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Prashant Kumar Mishra, who were shocked to discover that an Allahabad HC bench has not delivered judgment for almost a year.Justice Mishra said, ""In most of HCs, there is no mechanism where the litigant can approach the concerned bench or the chief justice bringing to its notice the delay in delivery of judgment.In such a situation, the litigant loses his faith in the judicial process defeating the ends of justice.""While reiterating the guidelines for expeditious pronouncement of judgment by HCs as laid down in 2001, the bench said, ""If the judgment is not delivered within three months, Registrar General shall place the matters before the CJ for orders and the CJ shall bring it to the notice of the concerned bench for pronouncing the order within two weeks thereafter, failing which the matter be assigned to another bench.""Significantly, the problem is not restricted to HCs. SC has been unable to find the cure for the same problem within its own houses, with too many instances of judgments having been reserved for months.

Shadow schooling booming as 33% of kids take private coaching: Government report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shadow-schooling-booming-as-33-of-kids-take-private-coaching-government-report/articleshow/123534882.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Nearly one in three school students in India now takes private coaching, with the practice far more common in urban areas, according to latest Comprehensive Modular Survey (CMS) on education released by govt. The findings sketch a system where government schools remain central in rural India while urban families increasingly prefer private schools and supplement classroom learning with paid coaching.The survey, carried out by ministry of statistics and programme implementation as part of 80th round of the National Sample Survey, covered over 52,000 households and nearly 58,000 students to assess household expenditure on schooling and tutoring.Govt schools still dominate nationally, accounting for 55.9% of enrolments, but their reach is stronger in villages, where two-thirds of children study. In cities, only 30.1% attend govt schools, with parents showing a clear preference for private unaided institutions. Private schools account for almost a third of enrolments nationwide, with their share particularly significant in urban areas, where higher incomes and aspirations drive choice.The financial gap is stark. Families with children in govt schools spend on average Rs 2,863 per student annually, while those in non-govt schools spend nearly nine times more at Rs 25,002. Only a quarter of govt school students reported paying course fees, compared to 95.7% in private schools, rising to 98% in urban unaided institutions. Across categories - fees, uniforms and books - urban families spend far more, with average course fees at Rs 15,143 per student against Rs 3,979 in rural households.Private coaching has become a major burden. The survey found 27% of students took coaching this year, rising to 30.7% in urban areas and 25.5% in rural. City households spend an average Rs 3,988 per child annually, rural families Rs 1,793. At higher secondary, city families spend Rs 9,950 per student, twice rural average of Rs 4,548. Coaching costs climb steadily, from Rs 525 at pre-primary to Rs 6,384 at higher secondary.The survey also highlighted how education is financed. Across India, 95% of students said the main source of funding was household members. Govt scholarships were cited by just 1.2%.What emerges is a dual narrative - government schools remain backbone of rural education, while urban parents lean toward private institutions and coaching. This twin trend of private schooling and shadow education reflects both aspirations and inequalities at a time when NEP seeks equitable & affordable access to quality education.","Government schools still dominate nationally, accounting for 55.9% of enrolments.

Elevating Patna HC CJ will be counter-productive: SC judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/elevating-patna-hc-cj-will-be-counter-productive-sc-judge/articleshow/123534855.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court judge Justice B V Nagarathna has strongly dissented against the collegium's decision to elevate Patna high court chief justice Vipul Manubhai Pancholi to the top court, saying the move would be ""counter-productive"" to the judiciary.The five-member collegium, comprising CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, J K Maheshwari and Nagarathna, had on Aug 25 recommended names of Bombay HC chief justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Pancholi for elevation as SC judges. Justice Pancholi, if appointed, would be in line to become CJI in Oct 2031 after Justice Joymalya Bagchi's retirement.Justice Nagarathna, the sole woman judge in SC, opposed the move citing Pancholi's lower seniority and circumstances surrounding his transfer from Gujarat HC to Patna HC in July 2023. She noted that the transfer was ""not a routine one, but a carefully considered decision taken after consultation with several senior judges, all of whom concurred"".According to sources, she also underlined concerns about regional representation in SC and warned that going ahead with Pancholi's elevation could erode ""whatever credibility collegium system still holds"". Her dissent reportedly traces back to May when Pancholi's name was first considered.At that stage, Justice N V Anjaria was elevated ahead of him. When Pancholi's name resurfaced three months later, Nagarathna recorded her dissent.The development has triggered sharp reactions outside the court as well. NGO Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms (CJAR) issued a statement saying the August 25 resolution ""makes a mockery of the earlier standards of transparency in judicial appointments"". It noted that the collegium had taken a 4-1 split decision in recommending Pancholi and questioned why he was chosen despite being only 57th in the all-India seniority list of HC judges.The CJAR statement also pointed out that Pancholi would be the third judge from Gujarat to be elevated to Supreme Court, which it said was ""disproportionate to the size of Gujarat HC"" while several other HCs remain unrepresented.Justice Nagarathna's dissent, the first against a proposed CJI-designate in recent years, has once again brought the collegium system and its credibility under sharp public focus.

New Delhi: From relaxation in loan repayment to loans backed by govt guarantees, interest subsidy and provident fund and ESIC support for employees, exporters are ready with a Covid-style wishlist that they are presenting to govt and RBI to tackle the challenge posed by the US tariffs.""This is an earthquake which will impact the workforce. Relief must be given to the industry,"" said Kirit Bhansali, chairman of Gems & Jewellery Export Promotion Council after a meeting with RBI on Tuesday. With payments likely to be delayed, he wants banks to go easy on loan repayment.Fieo is seeking a one-year moratorium on loan repayment, both principal and interest, arguing that it will enable exporters to direct resources towards market diversification & manage cash flows better at a time when they will be hit by fewer orders and extended payment cycles. Besides, it wants automatic 30% enhancement of credit limits to streamline working capital flows.""We are staring at a crisis which will force shutdowns and cause unemployment. Govt is asking us to sell in the domestic market, how do we do that with goods that were meant for the US?"" said Fieo president S C Ralhan, ahead of his meetings with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal.Multiple agencies are also pitching for support from the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation.Apparel Export Promotion Council's (AEPC) asks are from multiple agencies - RBI and different ministries, from textiles to commerce, finance, labour and environment.Citing ""high interest rates"" of 8-12% in India, compared with 3% in China and Malaysia, it wants the interest subvention scheme to be revived and the pre-shipment rupee export credit be reintroduced immediately for five years.It is demanding a concessional corporate tax rate of 15% for new companies, support for expansion of garment units through a Textile Upgradation Fund Scheme-type facility and warehouses to store inventory overseas.Besides, it has made a case for govt to bear the employers' share of PF and ESIC contribution for workers in apparel units between Aug 2025 and March, 2026.Further, AEPC and Fieo have proposed skilling assistance for workers in export units. While RBI, as reported by TOI on Tuesday, is holding consultations on possible forbearance, govt is unwilling to offer major fiscal support, at least immediately and is exploring if domestic retailers and overseas buyers can assist exporters. The Centre also believes that reforms and steps such as GST cut will help bolster domestic demand and come to the rescue of Indian players hit by US tariffs.","Fieo is seeking a one-year moratorium on loan repayment, both principal and interest.

New Delhi: Recalling PM Narendra Modi's 2025 I-Day speech that flagged demographic changes in border villages caused by illegal immigration ""as part of a deliberate design"", home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday urged the collectors of districts covered under the Vibrant Village Programme (VVP), chief secretaries of border states and central armed police forces (CAPFs) to pay attention to the problem and address it suitably.Addressing the inaugural session of the two-day VVP workshop being organised by Union home ministry here, Shah urged the collectors/district magistrates of border districts to take appropriate action to remove illegal encroachments within a 30-km radius of the border, including religious structures that often come up as ""part of a deliberate design"" to alter demography of surrounding areas. He cited the example of Gujarat, saying it had cleared numerous encroachments along both maritime and land borders.""Demographic changes in border areas directly impact security of the country and its borders. It should not be assumed that this is happening due to geographical conditions; rather, it is occurring as part of a deliberate design,"" Shah told the conference attended by junior home minister Bandi Sanjay Kumar, senior MHA officials, the Intelligence Bureau director, chief secretary of border states covered under VVP, DG of border forces and collectors of border districts.The minister exhorted DMs of VVP districts to address the illegal immigration and encroachment issue ""with seriousness and attention to detail"". The same suggestion was made to state chief secretaries and CAPF chiefs.Stating that VVP had led to infrastructure development in target villages, preservation and enhancement of culture, and employment generation through tourism, making village life vibrant, Shah said it was the responsibility of chief secretaries, district authorities and CAPFs to consider what additional steps can be taken, beyond VVP, to transform border villages into significant tools of security.He said it was the responsibility of CAPFs and district collectors to establish dairy cooperatives to meet the milk requirements of CAPFs and the Army directly from the villages, thus aiding in employment generation.Commending the population rise in Arunachal's border villages since VVP's launch, Shah said locals would not seek to migrate if they got facilities and employment opportunities in their own village. He said if initiatives like homestays were extended to border villages and state tourism departments made proper arrangements for bookings, every household would have employment.Shah said to achieve 100% saturation of govt schemes, district collectors should consider coordinating with CAPFs. He said CAPFs could provide assistance in areas of health, sports and education.",PM Narendra Modi's 2025 I-Day speech flagged demographic changes in border villages caused by illegal immigration.

New Delhi: Supreme Court ordered on Tuesday an inquiry into the disclosure by a judicial member of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma, that he was approached by ""one of the most revered members of the higher judiciary of this country"" to decide a case in favour of a particular litigant.Sources told TOI that the inquiry would be conducted by the secretary general of the apex court to find out who was the judge, from HCs or SC, who allegedly attempted to influence the outcome of a case. The revelation came after a bench headed by Justice Sharma passed a brief order recusing himself from the case as ""someone from higher judiciary tried to influence him"".

This year, Sadhguru, founder of the Isha Foundation, undertook the Yatra in a historic first — on a motorbike — demonstrating resilience after undergoing two major brain surgeries last year.On his 17-day journey, Sadhguru engaged with actors, cricketer Varun Chakravarthy, and filmmaker Nag Ashwin, sharing insights on life, spirituality, and recovery. He credited yoga for his physical endurance and recounted completing a Trans-Canada motorcycle ride to prepare for the Himalayan terrain, promising doctors “No jerks, no bumps, no falls.”During conversations en route, Kangana Ranaut asked about Shiva, to which Sadhguru replied, “I sit on his shoulders, so everything is fine,” highlighting experiential spirituality. To R. Madhavan , he described Kailash as “the greatest mystical library on the planet and in the known universe,” emphasising its spiritual significance.Sadhguru also reflected on the broader role of regional cooperation: “Geographically congruent nations must come together… function geographically as one unit though politically and otherwise we are separate.” Speaking to Nag Ashwin, he urged young people to embrace spiritual growth early, noting it should not be reserved for later in life.","The reopening of the Kailash Yatra route through Tibet has allowed Indian pilgrims to undertake the spiritual journey.

US Tech Jobs Under Fire? Marjorie Greene Demand Ban On Indian Work Visas Amid Tariff Tensions

The Donald Trump administration is planning a major overhaul of the United States’ H-1B visa and green card systems, signalling a shift towards wage-based immigration and merit-driven selection.US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Monday said he is involved in the proposed reforms, which aim to replace the current lottery-based system with a more selective model.“We're going to change the Green Card. We give green cards - the average American makes $75,000 a year and the average green card recipient $66,000 a year,” Lutnick told Fox News, questioning, “Why are we doing that? It’s like picking the bottom core.”He added, “That’s why Donald Trump is going to change it - that’s where the Gold Card is coming, and with that we’re going to start picking the best people, and it’s time for that.”In a post on X, Lutnick called the current H-1B system “a scam that lets foreign workers fill American job opportunities” and said “hiring American workers should be the priority of all great American businesses.”The proposed changes are expected to include eliminating the H-1B lottery system and introducing a wage-based allocation, where visas are given to higher-earning applicants first.A draft rule to this effect was approved by the US office of information and regulatory affairs earlier this month.The “Gold Card” initiative, still in early stages, is positioned as an alternative to the current green card process, with a focus on attracting high-skilled, high-earning individuals. While details remain under discussion, the shift aligns with Trump's broader “America First” immigration approach.The move has drawn attention from Indian professionals, who form the majority of H-1B recipients. According to US immigration data, Indian nationals have consistently accounted for over 70% of new H-1B allocations annually.The proposed changes around suspending or ending the H-1B visa programme have also sparked online debate, with several users on social media arguing that such a move could backfire. Critics point out that restricting access to skilled foreign talent may lead to jobs shifting to countries like India through remote hiring or outsourcing, rather than resulting in American workers filling those roles.","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Monday said he is involved in the proposed reforms.

Significance of the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal

Who was Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)?

The UAE has officially declared a public holiday for government employees to mark the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), which falls on Friday, September 5, 2025, according to the Islamic (Hijri) calendar.As this year’s observance coincides with a Friday, UAE residents may benefit from a long weekend (Friday to Sunday), providing a time for spiritual reflection and rest.The Islamic calendar follows the lunar cycle, and key religious dates, such as the Prophet’s birthday, are determined by the sighting of the new moon.On Saturday, August 23, 2025, the International Astronomy Center in the UAE confirmed that the crescent moon marking the start of Rabi Al Awwal (the third month of the Islamic calendar) was not sighted anywhere in the Arab world.Due to this, the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal— the date traditionally recognised as the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday— will be observed on Friday, September 5, 2025, in the UAE and several other countries.The 12th day of Rabi Al Awwal holds profound significance in Islam as it commemorates the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Across the Muslim world, this day is marked with prayers, religious lectures, and community gatherings that celebrate the Prophet’s life, character, and teachings.It is a moment to reflect on the Prophet’s message of compassion, justice, and unity, which remains central to the Islamic faith.Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is regarded as the final messenger of Islam, following prophets such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. He was born in Mecca in the year 570 CE, known as the Year of the Elephant, and passed away in 632 CE in Medina.Throughout his life, the Prophet played a transformative role— not only as a spiritual leader but also as a unifier and reformer of Arabian society. His teachings, preserved in the Qur'an and Hadith, form the foundation of Islamic belief and practice, continuing to influence over a billion Muslims worldwide","The UAE has declared a public holiday on Friday, September 5, 2025, for Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) birthday.

‘Not good for explaining to people’: Donald Trump ditches ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ name; GOP seeks fresh rebrand after polls show voter backlash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-good-for-explaining-to-people-donald-trump-ditches-one-big-beautiful-bill-name-gop-seeks-fresh-rebrand-after-polls-show-voter-backlash/articleshow/123536109.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump signalled on Tuesday that he wants to drop the name “One Big Beautiful Bill” for his signature domestic legislation, admitting the label that helped rally Republican support does little to explain its contents.Speaking at a Cabinet meeting, Trump said, “Last month, in a landmark achievement, I also proudly signed the largest working-class tax cuts in American history. So the bill that, I’m not going to use the term ‘great, big, beautiful’, that was good for getting it approved, but it’s not good for explaining to people what it’s all about. It’s a massive tax cut for the middle class,” according to NBC News.The legislation, passed without Democratic support, extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, creates new tax deductions such as exemptions on tips, increases spending on immigration enforcement and the military, while offsetting costs through deep cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and clean energy funding.The Congressional Budget Office has projected it will add $3.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, while potentially stripping millions of health coverage. As per USA Today, Senate estimates suggest 12 to 20 million Americans could lose insurance due to nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts.Despite the White House pitch, polling shows public resistance. A Pew Research Center survey earlier this month found 46% disapprove of the law, with just 32% in support.A CNN-SSRS poll in July put opposition at 61%.Democrats have branded it a giveaway to the wealthy “funded on the backs of the working class.”Even Republicans acknowledge branding woes. As per Politico, Trump had pressed GOP leaders to name the measure “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” but strategists are now urging a rebrand under titles such as the “Working Family Tax Cuts Bill.”Sen Katie Britt recently adopted that phrasing in a social media post, crediting Trump with delivering “much-needed funding, technology, and support for rural hospitals.”Vice President JD Vance has toured battleground states including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin to promote the tax provisions, while GOP lawmakers held August town halls to push back against constituent anger.However, many admit that the challenge extends beyond the name. “We have to do better at selling the megabill,” one House Republican was quoted as saying by Politico.Democrats, meanwhile, have seized on the law’s vulnerabilities. Former Rep Abigail Spanberger, running for Virginia governor, launched an ad blasting it as legislation that “raises health care costs, raises mortgages, raises the price of electricity and gas.”For Trump, the pivot is clear: the “beautiful” branding that carried the bill through Congress may have run its course. Now, he and Republicans are racing to convince voters that the package delivers more than it takes away.","US President Donald Trump wants to drop the name ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ for his signature domestic legislation.

Ethel Caterham: The world’s oldest living person witnessing a century of change



Ethel Caterham: Family, lifestyle, and what her longevity inspiring the world

Ethel Caterham, a British centenarian residing in Lightwater, Surrey, has officially become the world’s oldest living person at 116 years old. Born on 21 August 1909, Caterham has lived through some of the most transformative events in modern history, including the Titanic disaster, the Russian Revolution, and both World Wars. She is also the last surviving subject of King Edward VII, representing a living connection to early 20th-century British monarchy. Recognised by King Charles III with a birthday card in 2024, Caterham’s milestone has captured global attention. Her story highlights the remarkable combination of longevity, resilience, and historical perspective, inspiring people worldwide to reflect on the extraordinary possibilities of human life, the evolution of society, and the enduring spirit of individuals who witness over a century of change.Ethel Caterham was born in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, as the second youngest of eight siblings. Growing up in a large family in early 20th-century England meant learning responsibility, cooperation, and resilience from an early age. Raised in Tidworth, Wiltshire, she witnessed a rural way of life during a time of social change and industrial expansion. Her childhood coincided with technological advances like the spread of electricity and the automobile, shaping the early experiences of a girl who would live through over a century of innovation.These formative years likely influenced her adaptability and endurance—traits that contribute significantly to longevity.As a teenager, Caterham worked as an au pair in India, an experience that not only broadened her cultural understanding but also introduced her to independence and responsibility at a young age. As reported by BBC, later in life, she moved to Hong Kong and Gibraltar, accompanying her husband Norman, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the British Army. These postings exposed her to diverse climates, cuisines, languages, and social customs, fostering mental agility and adaptability—qualities that studies suggest are linked to longer life expectancy. Living abroad during politically and socially dynamic periods also provided her with firsthand knowledge of global events, enriching her personal and historical perspective.Ethel Caterham’s life spans some of the most significant events of the last century. Born three years before the Titanic sank in 1912, she experienced the societal upheaval of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and lived through both World Wars. As reported, she has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the advent of commercial aviation, the digital revolution, and major advances in medicine. Caterham’s personal story reflects the resilience and adaptability of individuals living through periods of profound uncertainty and change. Being a living archive of these events, she offers a unique perspective on how human society evolves over time.Caterham’s extraordinary longevity has been officially recognized by the British royal family. King Charles III sent her a birthday card to celebrate her 115th birthday in 2024, a gesture highlighting both her personal achievements and her historical significance. Such recognition is rare and symbolic, connecting Caterham to a lineage that stretches back to King Edward VII. The acknowledgment of her life by the monarchy underscores the cultural and historical importance of longevity and demonstrates society’s admiration for those who live exceptionally long lives.Now living in a care home in Lightwater, Surrey, Caterham enjoys her days surrounded by family and close friends. According to her care home, she prefers to celebrate birthdays quietly, at her own pace, reflecting a peaceful and stress-free lifestyle that research shows can support longevity. Her family has expressed gratitude for the outpouring of public interest and kind messages, emphasizing the role of emotional support, social connection, and family bonding in maintaining mental and physical health in extreme old age.While Caterham is the oldest living person today, the record for the verified oldest human remains with Frenchwoman Jeanne Louise Calment, who lived to 122 years and 164 days. Caterham’s age, however, is still remarkable, placing her among the very few documented centenarians to surpass 115. Her life contributes valuable insights into the factors associated with longevity, including genetics, lifestyle, adaptability, and mental resilience. Researchers studying supercentenarians like Caterham aim to understand how humans can live longer, healthier lives, offering inspiration and guidance for aging populations worldwide.","Ethel Caterham, a British centenarian residing in Lightwater, Surrey, has officially become the world’s oldest living person at 116 years old.

Poll What is your favorite aspect of cultural festivals like Pacu Jalur? The traditional performances. The community spirit.

Western Indonesia’s centuries-old Pacu Jalur boat race has taken on a new life this year after an 11-year-old boy’s viral dance moves helped attract record crowds and international attention to the traditional river festival.This weekend, rowers paddled vigorously down the Kuantan River in Riau Province, cheered on by spectators drawn by the online fame of young Rayyan Arkan Dikha.A short clip of him dancing at the bow of one of the long wooden boats, swirling his hands and swinging his arms to rally the oarsmen, has racked up millions of views, drawing visitors from across the country and abroad.According to news agency AFP, international sports stars, including Formula One driver Alex Albon and MotoGP champion Marc Marquez even copied Rayyan’s routine in videos of their own, fuelling the craze further. “I came to watch Pacu Jalur because I wanted to film and show the festival to the world,” Australian tourist Duncan McNaught was quoted as saying by AFP, calling the event “awesome.”Tourism officials estimate the race could see 1.5 million spectators this year, up from 1.4 million last year, with revenue possibly rising to $4.6 million. “Compared to previous years, there weren’t any foreigners watching Pacu Jalur.Now there are,” said local tourism chief Roni Rakhmat, as cited by AFP.The festival, dating back to the 17th century, was once rooted in river transport but has since evolved into an annual August race featuring more than 220 teams. Prizes worth about 900 million rupiah ($55,000) are on offer, according to organisers.Residents said they were delighted by the boy’s unexpected role in globalising the event. “I think it’s super cool that a kid his age managed to create a personal branding through Pacu Jalur,” 18-year-old student Naysila Ayunita Sari was quoted as saying by AFP. “Through his dances, he has introduced Pacu Jalur to the entire world.”For long-time locals like Frima, the transformation of their riverbank into an international attraction is astonishing. “I never would have thought that all eyes are on this small place on the western side of Riau,” he said.“I’m grateful Pacu Jalur is now known worldwide”, he added.","Rayyan Arkan Dikha, 11, went viral for his calm dance on the bow of a traditional longboat, during the Pacu Jalur longboat race festival.

Canada scrapped Digital Tax in June under US pressure

Donald Trump is again threatening tariffs. In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump announced that he would impose new, ""substantial"" tariffs and restrict US chip exports on any country that does not drop its digital services taxes (DSTs) and related regulations. Writing on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump declared that these taxes, implemented by dozens of nations worldwide, are ""designed to harm, or discriminate against, American Technology."" He put all such countries ""on notice,"" stating that as president, he would impose ""substantial additional Tariffs on that Country’s Exports to the U.S.A."" if these measures are not rescinded.In a further move, he threatened to ""institute Export restrictions on our Highly Protected Technology and Chips,"" adding, ""Show respect to America and our amazing Tech Companies or, consider the consequences!""""America, and American Technology Companies , are neither the 'piggy bank' nor the 'doormat' of the World any longer,"" Trump wrote.Trump has long been a vocal opponent of these taxes, which are typically structured to apply to the world's largest and most profitable tech companies, including American giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon. He has used them as a point of leverage in past trade negotiations. Earlier this year, for example, Trump briefly threatened to halt all trade talks with Canada over its proposed DST. The White House later hailed Canada's decision to scrap the tax as a victory, claiming Ottawa had ""caved"" to pressure.The digital taxes have drawn some bipartisan criticism in the U.S. In 2023, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee jointly warned the U.S. trade representative that Canada's tax would subject ""innovative American companies to arbitrary discrimination.""However, countries that have enacted these taxes argue that massive tech companies operate within their borders and generate significant profits from their citizens while paying little to no taxes to the host governments.","Donald Trump says he will impose ""substantial"" tariffs and restrict US chip exports on any country that does not drop its digital services taxes. Trump has long been a vocal opponent of these taxes, which are typically structured to apply to the world's largest and most profitable tech companies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123518359,imgsize-973242,width-400,resizemode-4/Donald-Trump-AP.jpg"

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

‘Somebody is not very happy’: Fiji PM Rabuka backs India amid 50% US tariffs; calls PM Modi ‘big enough to weather discomforts’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/somebody-is-not-very-happy-fiji-pm-rabuka-backs-india-amid-50-us-tariffs-calls-pm-modi-big-enough-to-weather-discomforts/articleshow/123537189.cms,"Fiji PM (ANI photo)

50% tariffs on India

Following Washington's imposition of a 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods set to take effect Wednesday (9.30am IST), Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka expressed confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ability to handle such challenges.In his statement, Rabuka said, ""...The recent announcements of the tariffs (by the United States)...I told him (PM Modi) the other day, somebody is not very happy with you, but then you are big enough to weather those discomforts,"" as quoted by ANI.Rabuka shared these thoughts during an audience discussion after his lecture on 'Ocean of Peace' at Sapru House, an event organised by the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA).The discussion was part of his four-day New Delhi visit, which commenced on Sunday. His spouse, Suluweti Rabuka, accompanied him during the trip.Upon arrival in New Delhi, Prime Minister Rabuka was welcomed at IGI Airport and subsequently met with a cabinet minister. On August 25, he paid respects at Rajghat before his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Hyderabad House, which included MoU exchanges and press statements.Later, he met President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan.His schedule on August 26 included delivering a lecture at Sapru House, organised by the Indian Council of World Affairs. The visit is scheduled to conclude on August 27 with his departure from Delhi.This visit builds upon recent diplomatic exchanges between both nations.The historical connection between India and Fiji began in 1879 with the arrival of Indian labourers ('Girmitiyas') under the indenture system to work in sugarcane plantations. Approximately 60,553 Indians were transported to Fiji between 1879 and 1916. Indian traders began establishing themselves in Fiji in the early 20th century. The indenture system ended in 1920. India maintained diplomatic presence through a Commissioner since 1948, which was elevated to High Commissioner following Fiji's independence in 1970.India is preparing for 50% tariffs on its goods exported to the US, following notification by the Donald Trump administration of an additional 25% tariff rate effective August 27. The US Department of Homeland Security has published a draft order stating that the 25% additional tariff would apply on Indian goods “entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 am eastern daylight time on August 27, 2025”.The cumulative tariffs of 25% plus 25% result from the ongoing stalemate in trade negotiations between India and the US, coupled with America's accusations that India's crude oil trade with Russia is indirectly financing the war against Ukraine. India has established red lines for the trade agreement and emphasised the importance of its energy security, thereby refusing to allow the US to dictate its sources for crude oil purchases. The imposition of 50% US tariffs is expected to impact the Indian economy and its exports.","Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka expressed confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ability to handle such challenges.
