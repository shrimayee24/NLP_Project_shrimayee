NEW DELHI: Actor and politician Kamal Haasan on Friday emphasised the linguistic pride among Tamilians and warned those who might take language issues lightly.Amid the ongoing row between state government and Centre National Education Policy (NEP), Hassan referred to the state's historic struggle against the imposition of Hindi and said that people of Tamil Nadu have the knowledge to choose which language they need.""Tamilians have lost their lives for a language. Don't play with those things. Tamilians, even children, know what language they need. They have the knowledge to choose which language they need,"" Haasan said while addressing party cadres in Chennai on the 8th foundation day of his party, Makkal Needhi Maiyam (MNM).This comes after Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan responded to Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalis's letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, clarifying that the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 does not mandate any language.He targeted the Tamil Nadu CM for interpreting NEP 2020 with a ""myopic vision"" and for portraying progressive educational reforms as political threats. Pradhan also stated that the chief minister's letter to PM contradicted the spirit of cooperative federalism.In his letter to the Prime Minister on Thursday, Stalin expressed concerns over Union education minister Pradhan's statement that Tamil Nadu's 'Samagra Shiksha' funds would not be released unless the state implements the 'three-language' policy outlined in NEP 2020.Meanwhile, BJP's Tamil Nadu chief Annamalai supported the three-language policy, saying that learning a third language is beneficial for Tamil Nadu. He also accused the DMK and its allies of misleading the public by claiming that Hindi would be mandatory under the new education policy.Deputy CM Udhayanidhi Stalin argued that “Hindi will destroy Tamil like it did many North Indian languages.”The INDIA bloc parties united to protest against the BJP-led central government, accusing it of encroaching on state rights, denying funds in the Union Budget, and withholding educational funds for Tamil Nadu.""Hindi destroyed the local languages of states in the north such as Rajasthani, Haryanvi, Bhojpuri, and other Bihari languages and has become the primary local language. The same will happen if Hindi is implemented in Tamil Nadu too. Almost 99% of Tamils who are now working abroad and in prestigious organisations such as Isro were from govt schools who did not study Hindi,"" Udhayanidhi said at the protest.","Hassan referred to the state's historic struggle against the imposition of Hindi.

PRAYAGRAJ: With the rush of devotees for Maha Kumbh leading to the 'unofficial' closure of the wholesale medicine market in Prayagraj, the city is facing a severe crisis of medicines, including essential and life-saving drugs. Despite repeated pleas from traders and pharmaceutical suppliers, the authorities have so far ignored the SOS messages, leading to growing concerns among residents and medical professionals, reports Kapil Dixit.Leader Road, which serves as the largest wholesale medicines hub in the city, is situated on the busiest path from Sangam towards the railway station. Due to this, the entry of trucks carrying medical supplies has been strictly prohibited. Since mid-January, the market has struggled to operate efficiently, primarily due to the uninterrupted flow of devotees in the area. As a direct consequence, medicine stocks, particularly for blood pressure, heart diseases, and diabetes, have nearly run out at both wholesale and retail levels, leaving patients and hospitals in distress.Anil Dubey, who heads the Allahabad Chemist and Druggist Association, told TOI, ""Since January 24, traders engaged in the wholesale drug business have not been able to function properly. This has created a massive gap between demand and supply, which is worsening every passing day.""Traders have repeatedly complained that the supply chain has been severely disrupted as trucks carrying medicines are not permitted to enter city limits. ""Association members have made several attempts to convey the severity of the drug shortage to the concerned district authorities, but their appeals have fallen on deaf ears,"" Dubey said. No transporter is willing to book medicine consignments to Leader Road due to the strict enforcement measures imposed by the police and district authorities.Government officials, however, have dismissed the concerns, stating that there has been no official order for the closure of the market.","Prayagraj's wholesale medicine market faces a shutdown amid the Maha Kumbh rush, causing a severe shortage of essential medications.

BSP's impact despite zero wins

The BSP dilemma: Ally or adversary?

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reignited political debates by questioning Bahujan Samaj Party ( BSP ) chief Mayawati 's current electoral approach. Addressing Dalit students in Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi asked,Behenji aajkal chunaav theek se kyun nahi lad rahi (Why is Mayawati not fighting polls properly these days)?Reflecting on the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Gandhi revealed that Congress had invited Mayawati to join the INDIA bloc alliance but she declined.If Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP), and BSP had come together, BJP would have lost,"" he asserted.Mayawati responded swiftly, accusing Congress of harboring amalicious and casteist” attitude toward the BSP. She further criticised Congress’s strategy in Delhi, where the party contested alone against both BJP and INDIA bloc ally Aam Aadmi Party, leading to a significant BJP victory .In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh’s first Dalit chief minister, chose to stay neutral by neither joining INDIA bloc not NDA. While the SP-Congress alliance secured 43 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, the INDIA bloc overall couldn’t unseat the NDA, paving the way for Narendra Modi’s historic third term as Prime Minister.Though BSP failed to win a single seat, its influence on poll outcome in Uttar Pradesh was undeniable. BSP candidates significantly affected INDIA bloc prospects in at least 16 constituencies, including Hardoi, Aligarh, Meerut, Unnao, and Mirzapur. This is on the assumption that all votes that Mayawati's party polled would have been transferred to its alliance partner. If Mayawati had joined hands with Rahul and Akhilesh and assuming her supporters would have backed the INDIA bloc, the opposition coalition could have clinched 59 seats in Uttar Pradesh, cutting the NDA’s tally to 20.On a national scale, this would have raised the INDIA bloc’s count to 250 seats against NDA’s 277 — still short of power but significantly closer.Interestingly, however, BSP’s presence as a neutral player prevented potential losses for the INDIA bloc. Of the 43 seats won by the Congress-SP alliance, there were 31 seats where Mayawati got considerable vote resulting in BJP's defeat. In seats like Azamgarh, Lalganj, Jaunpur, Muzaffarnagar, Kairana, and Saharanpur, INDIA bloc could beat BJP because Mayawati was neutral and polled significant votes. On these seats, if Mayawati was with INDIA bloc, its victory margin over the BJP would have increased.Now let's assume the opposite. If Mayawati had decided to join hands with the NDA, then it would have won all these 31 seats and decimated the INDIA bloc. So while Rahul Gandhi may have been partially correct in critisising Mayawati for not joining INDIA bloc, he should be thankful to the BSF chief for staying neutral and not joining the BJP-led NDA.The BSP secured 9.39 per cent of Uttar Pradesh’s total vote share — just shy of Congress’s 9.46 per cent —yet remained third in nearly all 80 constituencies.This complex electoral math, which is obviously based on the assumption of a complete transfer of votes, highlights the importance of BSP in Uttar Pradesh politics despite its losing sheen over the years. The unpredictable leader that Mayawati is, both NDA and INDIA bloc would be closely watching her next steps.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reignited political debates by questioning Bahujan Samaj Party ( BSP ) chief Mayawati's current electoral approach.

While some victims have been rescued, the embassy warns that the true scale of the scam is far larger, with many still unaware of the dangers they face.While consular officials are working to evacuate Indian citizens, the embassy has warned that those willingly participating in these scams are not victims but criminals. Indian authorities have urged job-seekers to verify employment offers in Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand before travelling, as those involved in scams may face legal consequences.Myawaddy has become a notorious hub for cyber crime, where workers are coerced into participating in online fraud operations , often under duress. Many of the victims, who have fallen prey to false job promises, are trapped in scam centres with no means of escape, unless they pay large ransoms. With the region controlled by warlords and militia groups, efforts to intervene have been complicated, though Indian consular officials are working to evacuate those who have sought help.Thai authorities, responding to global pressure, have taken action by cutting electricity, internet, and fuel supplies to key areas in Myanmar where these operations are based. In addition, China has urged Thailand to clamp down on the cross-border power supply networks that support these cyber scam syndicates. Despite these measures, the situation remains dire, with many Indian nationals caught in a perilous trap.While at least 150 individuals have been identified as victims, officials suspect the actual number is much higher as many are reportedly working voluntarily without notifying Indian authorities. Sources in ministry of external affairs said efforts are underway to assist those who have sought help.On Feb 18, three Indians managed to escape from a scam centre in Myawaddy and were helped by the embassy to reach Yangon. They are now being processed for repatriation to India. However, officials caution that the lawless nature of Myawaddy complicates large-scale rescue efforts.Since June 2022, over 600 Indians have been rescued from scam operations across Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.","Nearly 2,000 Indians are currently involved in cyber scam operations in Myawaddy, a lawless region near the Myanmar-Thailand border controlled by armed militia groups.

NASA’s New Update RevealsThe Truth About Asteroid 2024 YR4

An asteroid that is likely to hit Earth in the year 2032 has major Indian cities at risk according to the assessment by astronomers.Asteroid 2024 YR4, 130 to 300 feet long, is expected to make a very close pass of the planet in 2032. Although much of the object’s estimated track passes over an empty ocean, it includes mega Indian cities Mumbai and Kolkata.Based on the trajectory, towns in the state of Maharashtra, Northern Telangana, Southern Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal are also at risk. The impact, however, depends on several factors like entry angle, speed, and atmospheric effects.Other probable impact locations in the world include Bogotá, Colombia; Lagos and Nigeria.Although the asteroid is not large, especially when compared to a much larger asteroid Apophis discovered in 2004, its potential impact is nevertheless capable of creating extensive destruction. Nasa , however, has lowered the probability of the asteroid striking the Earth to 1.5%.The speed of the asteroid will be approximately 40,000 miles per hour, which will generate an energy outflow 500 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, and the explosion could very well annihilate a whole city.The kinetic energy of an asteroid is a proxy for how destructive its impact would be. And as asteroids mostly move at the same speed — about 38,000 mph — the key variable is its mass. The composition is also important. 2024 YR4 is statistically likelier to be a stony asteroid, which is more prone to fragment into smaller pieces as it is heated during its atmospheric descent.While the thought of an asteroid hitting Earth is undoubtedly unsettling, the probability of 2024 YR4 making contact in 2032 is extremely low. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are closely monitoring the asteroid’s path.The asteroid was initially discovered on December 27, 2023, by Chilean El Sauce Observatory, 2024 YR4.","Asteroid 2024 YR4, 130 to 300 feet long, is expected to make a very close pass of the planet in 2032.

NEP row: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin talks of not paying central taxes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nep-row-tamil-nadu-chief-minister-m-k-stalin-talks-of-not-paying-central-taxes/articleshow/118462495.cms,"Ditch politics for students’ sake, Pradhan tells Stalin on NEP



CUDDALORE: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin upped the ante on Friday in his run-in with the Modi govt over National Education Policy and devolution of funds, saying it would take DMK ""just one second to say we won't pay tax that Union govt is collecting from the state,"" reports Bosco Dominique. ""Federalism is about give-and-take,"" Stalin said here.Referring to Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan's statement that TN stood to lose Rs 5,000 crore for not rolling out PM Shri scheme linked to NEP, Stalin said Centre was jealous of states' growth and was trying to impede their development.Accusing the Centre of not giving states their rightful share of resources, Stalin said: “After sucking out all state taxes through the GST regime, the Union govt is refusing to disburse the dues of states. They are refusing to announce new schemes or release funds even for joint projects of the state and Union govts.”Stalin warned: “Don’t hurl stones at a beehive. Don’t provoke the unique spirit of Tamil people. Don’t seek to witness resurgence of Tamil defiance. As long as I am here, as long as DMK is here, no anti-Tamil, anti-Tamil Nadu, or anti-Tamilian agenda will succeed.”Pradhan countered Stalin’s opposition to NEP, saying TN’s stance was politically motivated and harmful to students. He shared a letter addressed to Stalin on his X handle, mentioning that it was “highly inappropriate” for a state to oppose NEP with a “narrow-minded approach”. Pradhan accused the TN govt of using “intimidation for political reasons”. He said the Modi govt was fully committed to promoting Tamil culture globally and urged TN to “not politicise education” and instead work “beyond political differences in the best interest of our students”. Pradhan argued NE was a transformative policy aimed at modernising India’s education system while preserving linguistic and cultural diversity. Rejecting allegations of Hindi being imposed on southern states, he said, “Let me unequivocally state there is no question of imposing any language on any state or community.” Stalin told the gathering in Cuddalore that the “real disaster for India” was the Union govt’s alleged failure to understand the fundamental principle of federalism. “NEP is not designed to promote education but to advance the agenda of making India a homogenous nation,” he said.","Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin upped the ante on Friday in his run-in with the Modi govt over National Education Policy and devolution of funds.

NEW DELHI: PM Modi Friday linked his political journey and ideology to Marathi language, expressing pride in the fact that a Marathi (Keshav Baliram Hedgewar) had planted the seed of RSS, which is celebrating its centenary year, on Maharashtra's soil.At the inauguration of the 98th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan here, while sharing the dais with Sharad Pawar, Modi said, ""It has been my privilege, along with millions of others, to be inspired by RSS to live for the country.""The remarks acquire significance because of speculation in certain quarters about cooling of vibes between BJP and Sangh.Saying that it was through Sangh that he connected with Marathi language and its traditions, Modi said RSS has been running a ‘sanskar yagya’ for the last 100 years to transmit the great tradition and culture of India to the new generation. RSS was founded in 1925 in Nagpur by Hedgewar.The decision of the organisers, who included Pawar, president of the 98th session of Marathi Sahitya Sabha, to get Modi to inaugurate the Marathi literature festival raised eyebrows in many quarters, besides attracting criticism from NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar)’s INDIA bloc allies.The 148-year-old Marathi literary festival was last held in Delhi in 1954, with renowned lexicographer Tarkatirtha Laxmanshastri Joshi as president. On that occasion, the conference was inaugurated by then-PM Jawaharlal Nehru. The trigger for hosting the event in Delhi was the Modi govt’s decision to confer classical language status on Marathi.On Friday, Modi reciprocated Pawar’s gesture as they shared the dais at the inauguration ceremony. “Today, on the invitation of Sharad Pawar , I am getting the opportunity to join this proud tradition,” Modi said.The audience burst into applause as Modi helped Pawar take his seat and offered him a glass of water. Modi, who was to start the function by lighting the ceremonial lamp, requested Pawar, chairman of the event’s reception committee, to come forward and do the honours with him.Modi highlighted that a few months ago, Marathi was granted the status of classical language — a recognition that over 12 crore Marathi speakers in India and worldwide had awaited for decades. He described it as a great fortune to have had the opportunity to fulfil this long-cherished aspiration.The Prime Minister said the event was taking place at a significant time when the nation was witnessing the 350th anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s coronation, the 300th birth anniversary of Punyashlok Ahilyabai Holkar, and the 75th anniversary of the Constitution, drafted through the efforts of Babasaheb Ambedkar.Modi said the event was not confined to a single language or region, embodying both the essence of the freedom struggle and the cultural heritage of Maharashtra and the nation.Noting that the day coincided with International Mother Language Day, he recited a verse by Sant Dnyaneshwar and explained that the Marathi language inspired his deep love and affection for its culture.The PM said the Marathi language became a proclamation of liberation from invaders, recalling the valour of Maratha warriors like Chhatrapati Shivaji, Sambhaji Maharaj and Bajirao Peshwa, who fiercely opposed their enemies. He noted that during the freedom struggle, figures like Vasudev Balwant Phadke, Lokmanya Tilak and Veer Savarkar disrupted British rule.Modi said Mumbai had emerged as the economic capital not only of Maharashtra but of the entire country. “When speaking of Mumbai, one cannot complete the discussion without mentioning films. It is Maharashtra and Mumbai that have elevated both Marathi films and Hindi cinema,” he said, citing the current popularity of the movie ‘Chhava’, which has brought the valour of Sambhaji Maharaj to the forefront, inspired by Shivaji Sawant’s Marathi novel.","PM Modi: ""It has been my privilege, along with millions of others, to be inspired by RSS to live for the country"" The 148-year-old Marathi literary festival was last held in Delhi in 1954, with renowned lexicographer Tarkatirtha Laxmanshastri Joshi as president.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118462307,imgsize-612079,width-400,resizemode-4/118462307.jpg"

Even as the US Secretary of State, Marcio Rubio, skipped the event, Jaishankar backed South Africa’s presidency at the event saying its priorities sit well with India’s own G20 focus.Jaishankar told Wang in his opening remarks in a formal bilateral meeting that in a polarized global situation, India and China have worked hard to preserve and protect the G20 as an institution. “This in itself testifies to the importance of international cooperation,’’ said the minister, adding platforms like G20 provided an opportunity for interaction between India and China even when ties were going through a difficult phase.This was the latest in a series of high-level engagements between India and China, including visits to Beijing by NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Vikram Misri, since the October 21 agreement last year to complete the military disengagement process in eastern Ladakh and the meeting between PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping 2 days later in Kazan.Significantly, China said in its readout that exchanges at all levels between the two countries have been restored in an “orderly manner, and the Special Representatives on the border issue have reached a consensus on properly handling specific differences. “It is in line with the common expectations of the two peoples for China and India to restore mutual trust and achieve win-win cooperation,” said Beijing.Apart from maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the border, issues like resumption of Kailash Mansarovar yatra, direct air services, trans-border river cooperation and travel facilitation were discussed. During Misri’s visit, India and China had agreed to resume the pilgrimage and direct flights between the 2 countries.Underlining India and China’s membership of G20, SCO and BRICS, Jaishankar also said that there are also “regional and global issues of mutual interest, where an exchange of perspectives will be to our mutual benefit”. Jaishankar is expected to visit China for a meeting of the SCO foreign ministers later this year, which will be followed by the summit that Beijing expects Modi to attend.The Chinese readout quoted Jaishankar as saying that India is willing to speed up the restoration of cooperation mechanisms with China, enhance cultural exchanges, facilitation of personnel exchanges, and joint maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas.“Since our last meeting in Rio during the G20 Summit in November 2024, there have been some notable developments. Our NSA and Foreign Secretary have visited China and there have been discussions about various aspects of our relationship,’’ said Jaishankar, in his opening remarks before the meeting.“These have included management of peace and tranquility in the border areas as well as other dimensions of our ties.

Watershed moment for inclusive medicine: Doctors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/watershed-moment-for-inclusive-medicine-doctors/articleshow/118461237.cms,"Doctors TOI spoke to hailed the Supreme Court judgment allowing a student with upper limb disability to get admission for MBBS course. They argued that it was important to have greater diversity among doctors and that it was unfair to pre-judge who could do what.Dr Shah Alam, a senior orthopaedic surgeon at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said he welcomed the judgment as it was important for diversity and because it was wrong to limit the professional options of those with disability. ""Some might say that medicine is about skill, but MBBS is also about theoretical knowledge and learning. The kind of dexterity needed in 'MBBS skills' is easily trainable even for those who have significant physical disabilities. There is a lot of expansion in medicine with many fields not requiring manual skills. Previously, dissection was considered a big part of medicine, especially in early 20th century. Now there are many simulations to learn what was learnt through dissection. Moreover, if the student is managing the chores of his daily life, he surely has enough skills to learn MBBS. The question is what he will do in the future after MBBS. Some fields like interventional cardiology might not be open to him. But not every MBBS doctor becomes an interventional cardiologist or surgeon. With the advancement of science, we don't know what the future holds for this kind of disability,"" said Dr Alam.Dr RS Sindhu, head of department of surgical gastroenterology in Government Medical College Kottayam became the first female surgical gastroenterologist in Kerala despite both her legs being polio affected. ""The medical board pegged my disability at 50%. In my MBBS internship, during the rotation in surgery, I was fascinated by it. I did a further one year in surgery posting and became even more sure that I wanted to be a surgeon. Today, I do liver transplants and all kinds of gastro surgery and I am just completing 23 years as a gastroenterological surgeon, which entails standing for long hours. This student too has the right to study what he feels passionate about,"" said Dr Sindhu.""This is a watershed moment for inclusive medicine in India, as it explicitly challenges the glorified ableism prevalent among medical professionals, whose conscious biases often distort disability assessments. This ruling is a landmark for disability justice in India and a powerful affirmation of the human mind's ability over mere psychomotor skills,"" said Dr Satendra Singh, a professor of physiology in University College of Medical Sciences in Delhi and disability rights activist.","Supreme Court judgment allows a student with upper limb disability to get admission for MBBS course.

Back to the 60s? Congress mulls making district units great again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/back-to-the-60s-congress-mulls-making-district-units-great-again/articleshow/118430292.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Adopting a back-to-basics approach in the face of prolonged political slump, Congress is mulling leaving major decision-making functions to its district units, the building blocks of the party organisation which have been marginalised in the recent decades.Sources said the idea of reorganising the party around District Congress Committees (DCCs) was discussed in the Wednesday meeting of the party brass, with office-bearers managing state units. While president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi are learnt to have spoken about focusing on district units, ranging from strengthening its structure to promoting loyal workers, sources said the future decision on the issue may revolve around giving greater importance to DCCs.Sources said the party may make district units crucial in selection of candidates for elections. While the present process involves recommendations starting from DCCs and then moving to state units and then to the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the leadership believes there is greater centralisation, with marginalisation of the first recommending authority. Some said the party was organised around the districts in the 1960s, before the shift towards the AICC happened. Also, the leadership of district units may get greater say in strategy and campaign, with the party building on their inputs. While Congress mulls returning the political primacy to districts, the lesson has been learnt at a big cost. As an insider said, the party did not have its DCCs constituted in Haryana for over seven years, a key reason behind the failure to manage better in the recent assembly elections. The same has been true for many other states.""The idea is to give greater responsibility, along with accountability, to DCCs in decision making,"" a party manager said.With the recent assembly defeats providing a reality check to Congress after the euphoria of Lok Sabha results in which the opposition did better than expected, Rahul has urged the states' managers to strategise better to take on the resource-rich BJP. Sources said he warned that the party had become predictable, which was providing an advantage to the rivals. Rahul is said to have stressed the importance of being unpredictable, citing the example of Bharat Jodo Yatra, and urged them to come up with out-of-the-box ideas in states. The importance of unpredictability was likened by a neta to that of Shivaji's guerrilla warfare.",Congress is mulling leaving major decision-making functions to its district units. The building blocks of the party organisation have been marginalised in the recent decades.

NEW DELHI: Indian Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi recently opened up about his multi-religious upbringing and illustrious military career.In an exclusive interview with ANI, he shared his thoughts on being multi-religious, citing his exposure to diverse faiths during his time in the 18th battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir rifles .This regiment uniquely had a mosque, gurdwara, Durga Mata temple, and Mahakal temple all under one roof, fostering an environment of interfaith harmony.When asked about his recent visit to Mahakaleshwar Temple in Madhya Pradesh's Ujjain with defence minister Rajnath Singh, the Army chief said, ""I am multi-religious. I have been commissioned into the 18th battalion, the Jammu and Kashmir rifles, where you have a Masjid, Gurdwara, Durga Mata, and Mahakal, all under one roof.""General Dwivedi recounted how his subedar major, a Maulvi, would perform Durga Mata Puja without any issues, demonstrating the regiment's spirit of mutual respect. When asked about his own spiritual journey, general Dwivedi said after taking over, he first sought blessings from his unit, Bhakti Dhaam, where he received blessings from his Maulvi, Pandit, and Granthi.""My subedar major, who may be a Maulvi, is able to do Durga Mata Puja, which is not an issue at all. Now, if you see, have I visited any Mashoor (famous) place, Golden Temple or Mahakaal or Vaishno Devi, in the initial stages? No. The first thing I went to was to my unit, Bhakti Dham. And once I got the blessings there from my Maulvi, my Pandit, my Granthi, thereafter I started going to all the places,"" said the Army chief.General Dwivedi recalled how his father would tell him stories of freedom fighters and World War II heroes, inspiring him to join the army.In a candid revelation, Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi shared the story of how his childhood experiences shaped his decision to join the Indian Army.One particular memory that stood out was when his uncle would bring home copies with photographs of soldiers. These images sparked a sense of curiosity and admiration in young Dwivedi. As he grew older, he began to explore various career options, considering medicine and engineering, just like his brothers.However, the allure of the Army ultimately won him over. General Dwivedi recalled how he initially wanted to become an intelligence officer, but after gaining more exposure, he decided to join the Army first and then explore opportunities in intelligence.""I remember my uncle when he used to ask him, So the copy which he used to bring used to have a soldier's photo. Okay. My father used to always give me the story of freedom fighters or the story of World War II, where we won Vera, who escaped as a pilot. I remember. So all these stories I used to keep reading. And my one brother was a doctor. So I said, no, this is closed. My second brother was an engineer. I said, this is closed. Okay. So third was the army, which was there. I wanted to become an intelligence officer if I can say that. But when I went to school and saw everything, then I said, okay, let me join the Army first, thereafter look at intelligence,"" the Army chief said.He also shared his experience of flying the LCA with air marshal AP Singh during Aero India 2025, praising Singh's leadership and straightforward qualities.

He shared that it was simply fate that led him to join the Army.""See, when we were in school, we used to look at all three services. We used to love all three, if I can say that. It just so happened that I came into the army. Let me tell you about AP first. As far as AP is concerned, from NDA days, he is a gold torch. And he is, everybody has a natural liking towards him. He is a man who can collect people together. He is a natural leader. And he takes ownership of a crowd. But he is a very straightforward man. So, I say in the lighter moment, he should have been in the infantry,"" said the Army chief.The Army chief highlighted Air Marshal Singh's ability to bring people together, his natural leadership skills, and his willingness to take ownership of responsibilities.

Gleyber Torres Ditches the Yankees for Beard: Team Finally Lets Players ‘Grow’ Up!



🚨 BREAKING 🚨 Yankees trim tradition, allow facial hair after 49 years 💈 | Get Up

Yankees Remove the Facial Hair Policy INSTANT REACTION | 1172

Well, Gleyber Torres has officially left the Bronx for Motor City, trading in his Yankees pinstripes for a shiny new Tigers uniform. But while his exit may have caused some tears among the fans, perhaps the real news is in his beard — and the loser, finally, with the new management — Yankees policy on facial hair.Torres apparently signed a one-year $15 million contract with the Detroit Tigers and was one of the first to announce the Yankees' sudden and shockingly open-minded move regarding their long-held famous hair policy. GM Brian Cashman having his opinions on positional changes, Torres just stood there, shrugged his shoulders, and had that magnificent ""I'm not mad, just disappointed"" look. ""To be honest, I don't know what's going on over there,"" he said, dissolving any chance of lingering animosity. ""I was believing everything was good, but I think not. I don't want to give any comments, just turn the page. Whatever they have, they have.""And here comes the funny part: as soon as Torres posted a fresh picture of himself with a luscious beard — his personal ""team spirit"" — in the most shocking of coups, the Yankees announced they were reversing their infamous facial hair policy. Beard rules, baby!In case you have been living under a rock (or maybe, a clean-shaven rock), for quite some time now, Yankees' rules have long been relegated to legend: no facial hair below the upper lip. Mustache? Sure. Any resemblance to a full beard? Not a chance. Well, now? It's 2025, and there are winds of change...or rather, beard style.On Friday, Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner dispensed some wisdom about the matter ""allow well-groomed beards."" Yes, you read it right. Not a stray hair from the chin, not even two days of growth — they are talking about a well-groomed beard.""I've spoken to a large number of former and current Yankees... and ultimately, the decision rests with me,"" Steinbrenner said. ""We have decided to allow well-groomed beards moving forward. It is appropriate to break from the familiar comfort of our former policy.""So, as Gleyber Torres ventures into a new era in Detroit with his new beard, it looks like the Yankees are becoming accustomed to letting some hair down. Perhaps, Torres wasn't just moving on from the team — he was helping them 'turn the page' in every way possible. Cheers to a bearded future for the Bronx Bombers... who'd have known?","Gleyber Torres signed a one-year $15 million contract with the Detroit Tigers.

A blood clot in shoulder marked the end of Victor Wembanyama's remaining 2025 NBA season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/a-blood-clot-in-shoulder-marked-the-end-of-victor-wembanyamas-remaining-2025-nba-season/articleshow/118460441.cms,"(Image Via Getty)

The 21-year-old NBA star Victor Wembanyama has been ruled out of the remaining 2024-2025 NBA season due to his DVT diagnosis

You can't replace Vic. I can't stand on a guy's shoulders and block every shot that comes to the rim. Aside from his basketball ability, his charisma and what he brings into the locker room, I think, is what we'll miss the most.

DVT is common in taller people like NBA star Victor Wembanyama

""If your blood moves too slowly through your veins, it can cause a clump of blood cells called a clot. When a

blood clot

forms in a vein deep inside your body, it causes what doctors call deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This is most likely to happen in your lower leg, thigh, or pelvis. But it can occur in other parts of your body, too.""

DVT, or deep vein thrombosis , is the formation of a clot in the vein. The clot is usually localized to one location. For the San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama, it is his right shoulder. Spurs' star Victor Wembanyama was diagnosed with DVT after his return from an All-Star weekend to San Antonio.When the clot (thrombus) moves, it becomes an embolus, and the condition is called an embolism. That's a serious condition because then the clot can move and lodge itself into one of the important veins of the brain, lungs, heart, or other organs, thereby causing grave problems like pulmonary embolism.The 7 feet 2 inches tall French professional basketball player and center for the San Antonio Spurs, Victor Wembanyama, will be missed by his teammates. """" says Spurs guard Chris Paul.As per WebMD,One of the causes of DVT is injury. Risk factors include injury to a vein from a broken bone, surgery, or other trauma. DVT can happen at any age, but your risk is greater after 40 years of age. Symptoms include heaviness, swelling, pain, weakness, tingling sensation, and blue or darker skin in the affected body part (in Victor Wembanyama's case, it is the shoulder).NIH says, ""Taller people are more prone to develop DVT.""We suppose that's one of the reasons why Victor Wembanyama was diagnosed with DVT. Why are taller people more prone? Because taller people have increased demands for blood supply to their body parts, it becomes difficult for their upper body parts to receive more blood from their tall lower body parts.The clot can be dissolved by blood thinners. Victor Wembanyana may be away from the NBA court for months. The Rookie of the Year may be back for the European Championships in the middle of the year.Also Read: JJ Redick cracks hilarious $1 billion joke on LeBron James after another 40-point showdown against Portland Trail Blazers",The 21-year-old NBA star Victor Wembanyama has been ruled out of the remaining 2024-2025 NBA season due to his DVT diagnosis.

So, therefore, that's the contract,” he said.Replying to a question on what he is doing to retain the future Satya Nadellas, the CEO said “the way to think about it is, longevity is not a goal; relevance is.”“The thing that I have to do and all 200,000 of us have to do every day is: Are we doing things that are useful and relevant for the world as we see it evolving, not just today, but tomorrow?,” he said.Nadella also touched upon the ideal employee-employer relationship and what it means to be a “company person”. He stressed the importance of fostering a work culture that allows employees to become integral to the company, highlighting Microsoft's success in cultivating such an environment.“So I think companies have to create a culture that allows people to come in and become company people like me. And Microsoft got it more right than wrong, at least in my case. I hope that remains the case,” Nadella stated.Reflecting on his own 34-year tenure at Microsoft, Nadella expressed his enduring enthusiasm for the company.“Through my 34 years now of Microsoft, it has basically been, each year, I felt more excited about being at Microsoft versus thinking that 'I'm a company person',” he explained.Nadella also discussed topics such as artificial general intelligence (AGI) and quantum computing breakthroughs during the podcast interview.",Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has some advice for new employees.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
