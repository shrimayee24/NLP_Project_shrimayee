Proposes to operate

fly-ash brick kiln

and a petrol pump by inmates

NEW DELHI: A more than a century-old circle jail in Odisha’s tribal-dominated Koraput district is synchronizing ‘crime and punishment’ with ‘reforms and income’ to enable prisoners to sale various items produced by using their skills in handicrafts, agriculture, tailoring, weaving and by operating fabrication and pulverizing units.Established in 1908 and having a capacity of 1003 prisoners, a surprise visit by Justice Sanjeeb Panigrahi of Orissa HC and his suggestions opened a new chapter for the prison and its inmates – upgrading of sanitation infrastructure, hygienic condition and establishment of small-scale industrial infrastructure.Jail authorities also started honing and imparting skills and crafts to inmates in weaving, growing vegetables, tailoring, and fabricating metal products. “These products and vegetables are sold regularly in specially organized markets. The sale of these products, including for the current financial year, is expected to touch Rs 80 lakhs by March 31, 2025,” Jailor L B Dash told TOI.The Jail has already deposited around 50 lakhs as revenue receipts with the state government. Rest of the amount is paid directly into the bank accounts of the inmates at the rate of Rs 145 per day for skilled labour, Rs 110 for semi-skilled, and Rs 95 for unskilled ones, senior Jail superintendent Kuanr Marandi said.Of around 500 inmates, 128 have chosen to engage in various activities run by the jail. On completing their prison term, they return home with a good amount of money. But the thrust of the initiative is to enable them to self-sustain by engaging in a vocation in which they got trained during their imprisonment period, the jail officials said.The officials said DG (Prison) Arun Kumar Roy has in principle agreed with the proposal to set up a fly-ash brick industry and a petrol pump, in collaboration with Indian Oil Corporation Ltd , in the land owned by the jail to engage inmates after their release as a measure of rehabilitation.Inmates engaged in fabrication unit are making various household items like almirah, rice containers, utensils stands, wall hangers and steel trunks of different sizes, while those working in the weaving unit produce handloom items like shirt pieces, bed sheets, curtains, towels, doormats, handkerchiefs, aprons, salwar suits, saris etc.In the pulverizing units, the prisoners produce turmeric and millet powders, while others make different varieties of bamboo crafts using bamboo grown in the jail garden, which also grows organic vegetables which are sold to the public through the jail's retail counter.The Jail authorities have moved the Koraput District Magistrate for training inmates under PM Viswakarma Yojana which could offer a better rehabilitation platform for inmates after their release.","A circle jail in Odisha’s tribal-dominated Koraput district is synchronizing ‘crime and punishment’ with ‘reforms and income’ Jail authorities also started honing and imparting skills and crafts to inmates in weaving, growing vegetables, tailoring, and fabricating metal products.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116813621,imgsize-570149,width-400,resizemode-4/116813621.jpg"
ISRO set to mark 100th launch with GSLV mission after successful SpaDeX experiment: Isro chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-set-to-mark-100th-launch-with-gslv-mission-after-successful-spadex-experiment-isro-chief/articleshow/116812953.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to reach a historic milestone with its 100th rocket launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in January, ISRO Chairman S Somanath announced.This achievement will be highlighted by a Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle (GSLV) mission, following Monday’s successful PSLV-C60 mission, which marked the 99th launch from the Sriharikota spaceport.India on Monday took a major step towards joining an exclusive group of nations with space-docking technology — the ability to mate two spacecraft in space. ISRO successfully placed two small satellites, each weighing 220 kg, into orbit as part of the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission.The PSLV-C60 rocket, which lifted off just after 10 PM from the first launchpad at Sriharikota, placed the satellites into a 475-km circular orbit about 15 minutes later. The first satellite separated 15.1 minutes after launch, followed by the second at 15.2 minutes.M Sankaran, Director of the UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), explained that the 'chaser' and 'target' spacecraft were launched with a small relative velocity, allowing them to move towards each other for potential future docking operations.Speaking after the successful PSLV-C60 launch, Somanath highlighted the significance of the milestone: ""So, all of you have seen the majestic lift-off and the launch of the SpaDeX (Space Docking Experiment) rocket, and for us, this is the 99th launch of any vehicle from Satish Dhawan Space Centre. That is also a very important number. So, we are going for the 100th launch at the beginning of the next year.""Monday’s PSLV-C60 mission paves the way for more complex docking experiments, with Somanath noting, ""There will be many more SpaDeX varieties, including complex missions of docking systems in the coming days.""ISRO’s ambitious plans continue into 2025, with the NVS-02 navigation satellite scheduled for launch in January using a GSLV rocket. This follows the successful deployment of the NVS-01 satellite in May 2023, marking the first of the second-generation satellites for the Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) services.The PSLV-C60 launch was initially scheduled for 9:58 PM on December 30 but was rescheduled to 10 PM following a ""conjunction study"" to ensure no close proximity between satellites in orbit. Somanath explained the process: ""If you find there is any close proximity between satellites, then we have to move the current satellite a little bit. Either, we delay it or make it early, so that this proximity condition does not occur.""","Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to reach a historic milestone with its 100th rocket launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in January.

Kota sees 38% dip in student suicides as initiatives bear fruit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kota-sees-38-dip-in-student-suicides-as-initiatives-bear-fruit/articleshow/116812375.cms,"KOTA: Rajasthan's Kota, the coaching hub for medical and engineering aspirants that has been in headlines for student suicides in recent years, saw a 38% decline in such cases in 2024 compared to the previous year, with 16 cases documented this year as against 26 in 2023.The district administration attributed the dip in student suicides to strict implementation of protocol and guidelines for coaching centres and hostels, and several additional initiatives to ensure a stress-free academic environment under its direct supervision this year. Among the other initiatives credited are WHO-protocol gate-keeper training for hostel wardens, SOS Help, student engagement programmes like 'Dinner with Collector' and 'Samwad', and the police's Kalika Squad to ensure the safety for female students.Speaking to TOI on Monday, Kota district collector Dr Ravindra Goswami said, ""The reduction in suicides is substantial and our efforts (to curb them) are yielding results, and we expect this trend to continue.""Goswami mentioned his personal interaction with over 25,000 coaching students throughout the year through various initiatives, providing career guidance and addressing their concerns.The district administration, alongside coaching stakeholders, also introduced 'Kota Cares' during the three-day Kota Mahotsav that concluded last Wednesday. ""KotaCares emphasises that the city has provided coaching to over one crore students nationwide, significantly influencing their careers. The initiative reaffirms, through coaching alumni collaboration, that Kota maintains its standards with enhanced facilities and environment,"" the district collector said.Coaching industry stakeholders note that Kota suffered in 2024 due to the negative publicity over the coaching students' deaths, despite not being among the top 30 cities in India as per NCRB's suicide data.

"In Bastar, battle for hearts & minds via bijli-sadak-paani",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-bastar-battle-for-hearts-minds-via-bijli-sadak-paani/articleshow/116812333.cms,"RAIPUR: No network, no roads but hope is being built, brick by brick, in a very remote part of Abujhmarh in Bastar. More used to the crack of gunshots, tribals in Rekavaya village now hear the hum of cement mixers where a school is coming up. The first since Independence.Like Rekavaya, some 300km from Raipur, all of Bastar is seeing a resurgence. 2024 will go down as the year when the 'battle for hearts and minds' was no longer a cliche in this battleground.And like Rekavaya, change is coming to Bastar at the cost of human lives. Eight Maoists were shot dead in Rekavaya earlier this year and security camps were set up in the vicinity. Only then could boats ply down River Indravati, carrying bricks and cement needed to build the school that once Maoists ran.Where Mao's Little Red Book was once part of syllabus, today children read the tables. And that's much the same story in rest of Bastar.At least 222 Maoists have been gunned down by security forces in Bastar since the Vishnu Deo Sai-led BJP govt took over - more than the previous five years combined. This aggressive campaign has pushed Maoists out of their erstwhile strongholds - including the once-impregnable Abujhmarh - and cleared a path for bijli, sadak and paani.Nearly 50 schools that were closed down two decades ago due to Maoist violence have been reopened - some of them rebuilt by the very Maoists who had demolished them, now on this side of society, having ditched their guns in the jungle and seeking to pick up life afresh.The force of the campaign this year can be gauged from the body count - 20 Maoists were eliminated in 2023, nearly 11 times as many have been neutralised this year, with 31 gunned down in Narayanpur in a single operation.Chhattisgarh govt has been swift in following up security success with development projects. And Puwarti, the native village of dreaded Maoist commander Hidma, has come up as a symbol of Bastar's resurrection. In Nov this year, a cluster of villages near Puwarti got electricity for first time since Independence. A road is being built.A security camp, established earlier this year, proved to be a game-changer. Thanks to this camp, tricolour was raised for first time in decades in Puwarti this Republic Day.It's thus that Union home minister Amit Shah has promised that Maoists will be eradicated by March 2026.Crucially, govt seems to be winning over hearts and minds not only among Bastar's population, but also among Maoist cadres. This year has seen the highest number of surrenders in seven years - 802 cadres, carrying a combined bounty of over Rs 8.2 crore. The only time more Maoists surrendered was in 2016, when 1,210 cadres had given up arms.Govt recently revamped its rehab policy, by approving 15,000 houses for surrendered cadres and victims of Naxal violence, and including a skill development stipend of Rs 10,000 per month.""The year 2024 was significant for troops in Bastar range on all fronts. We made vital inroads even in those areas that were considered to be impenetrable Maoist strongholds. Unprecedented breakthroughs in Abujhmarh and south Bastar have not only boosted the morale of security forces but also given a hope to the native population that the Naxal menace would come to an end sooner than expected. It is not only the numerical counts of the Naxal dead bodies recovered, but also the grade of the cadres, like state committee-level cadres, who got removed from the Naxal ecosystem that has provided us the operational edge in this season,"" Bastar Range IG P Sundarraj told TOI.""Increasing our operational and development reach in otherwise deprived parts of south Bastar, west Bastar and Maad region have turned the tables. Providing basic amenities like PDS shops, anganwadi, centres and household electrification in villages has bridged the development deficit and increased the trust between the native population and govt. We are hopeful of much better outcomes in the forthcoming season,"" he added.The solution to Naxal insurgency is being executed from three directions - development, intensified operations and surrenders. The fourth dimension is missing this far - peace talks. CM Sai and state home minister Vijay Sharma had hinted at talks with Maoists earlier in the year, but there is no sign of it being formalised.Some officials said with nearly 20 Maoists being eliminated on average every month, govt doesn't need to get into peace talks, but there are already cries from Bastar that the sustained military campaign is leading to bloodshed of the innocent.Maoists are venting out their fury at civilians, killing even teachers, women and children in ever-increasing savagery. Less than a fortnight ago, at least four children were injured in ""crossfire"" during an encounter in Abujhmarh. One of them, a 16-year-old, had a bullet lodged in her throat. Her father claims she was shot by police.There have been repeated allegations that police ended up killing innocent villagers as Maoists. So far, Sai govt hasn't faced the kind of protests that erupted from time to time during the tenures of BJP's Raman Singh and Congress's Bhupesh Baghel. Perhaps it helps that Sai is a tribal and understands Bastar better. Perhaps it's fitting that Bastar's new chapter will be written by a tribal.","At least 222 Maoists have been gunned down by security forces in Bastar since the Vishnu Deo Sai-led BJP govt took over.

2025 likely to be one of the 3 warmest years on record: WMO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2025-likely-to-be-one-of-the-3-warmest-years-on-record-wmo/articleshow/116812269.cms,"NEW DELHI: The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) on Monday warned that the record-breaking temperatures of 2024 will likely continue next year with the greenhouse gas (GHG) levels growing to record “observed highs, locking in even more heat for the future”.The warning factored in the UK Met office outlook for 2025, suggesting that it is likely to be one of the three warmest years for global average temperature, falling in line just behind 2024 and 2023.It has already been observed by the WMO that 2024 is set to be the warmest year on record, now almost certain to exceed the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degree celsius above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels for the first time. This follows on from the record-breaking 1.45 degree C in 2023, the previous warmest year on record.“Today I can officially report that we have just endured a decade of deadly heat. The top ten hottest years on record have happened in the last ten years, including 2024,” said UN secretary-general António Guterres in his New Year message on Monday.Referring to the WMO’s observation that 2015-2024 will be the warmest ten years on record, Guterres said, “This is climate breakdown — in real time. We must exit this road to ruin — and we have no time to lose. In 2025, countries must put the world on a safer path by dramatically slashing emissions, and supporting the transition to a renewable future”.As global temperatures rise and extreme heat events become more frequent and severe, the WMO also stressed the growing need for enhanced international cooperation to address extreme heat risks.Referring to a new report from World Weather Attribution and Climate Central, it noted that climate change intensified 26 of the 29 extreme weather events that killed at least 3,700 people and displaced millions in 2024.“Every fraction of a degree of warming matters, and increases climate extremes, impacts and risks. Temperatures are only part of the picture. Climate change plays out before our eyes on an almost daily basis in the form of increased occurrence and impact of extreme weather events,” said WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo.The global met body, however, time and again clarified that one or more individual years exceeding 1.5 degree C does not necessarily mean that “pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels” as stated in the Paris Agreement is out of reach.“The exceedance of warming levels referred to in the Paris Agreement should be understood as an exceedance over an extended period, typically decades or longer, although the Agreement itself does not provide a specific definition,” the WMO said.","The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) warned that the record-breaking temperatures of 2024 will likely continue next year. The warning factored in the UK Met office outlook for 2025, suggesting that it is likely to be one of the three warmest years for global average temperature.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116812329,imgsize-456623,width-400,resizemode-4/116812329.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a year where diplomacy danced on a tightrope and every handshake bore the weight of history, India navigated complex diplomatic waters amidst significant regional tensions. The icy thaw in its long-standing border dispute with China and emerging discord with Bangladesh required skilful diplomatic manoeuvring across the subcontinent.The relationship with Canada remained complicated, with Prime Minister Trudeau's leadership continuing for at least another ten months. Additionally, India faced the task of establishing diplomatic rapport with Sri Lanka's new Marxist leadership, despite their previous anti-India stance.India's diplomatic endeavours in 2024 presented both successes and significant hurdles. The nation's diplomatic capabilities were tested as it addressed historical conflicts whilst adapting to evolving global relationships.Here are some key moments that shaped the year’s diplomatic narrative:The ouster of Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh’s politics in August was a shift that altered the dynamics of India-Bangladesh ties. A student-initiated movement resulted in violent clashes, leading to over 1,000 casualties. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus subsequently assumed leadership of an interim government.Bangladesh experienced substantial social upheaval following this political transition. The arrest of spiritual preacher Chinmoy Krishna Das sparked controversy, whilst increased attacks on minorities led to unrest in Chattogram, resulting in a lawyer's death. India expressed serious concerns regarding minority safety, particularly of Hindus, though Bangladesh consistently maintained this was an ""internal matter"".India’s relations with Canada plunged to new depths following accusations linking Indian officials to the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a designated terrorist in India. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegations of Indian involvement sparked a chain reaction: tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats, suspension of visa services, and a chilling of trade discussions. India recalled high commissioner Sanjay Verma along with other diplomats.In November, the rift intensified after pro-Khalistani supporters allegedly attacked attendees of an Indian consular event at a Hindu temple in Toronto. The ministry of external affairs called out Canada for failing to protect Indian citizens and institutions, while Canada maintained its stance, claiming a “targeted campaign” by Indian agents against Canadian citizens.The winter session of the Parliament saw the government reiterate that Trudeau’s accusations were baseless, with no evidence being provided by the Trudeau administration to the Indian government.The United States charged Indian national Nikhil Gupta in connection with a foiled assassination attempt on Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. Gupta was alleged to have acted on orders from a senior Indian official.A subsequent Washington Post report implicated Vikram Yadav, a former operative of India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), in orchestrating the plot. The Indian government dismissed the claims as ""unwarranted and unsubstantial."" Despite India’s denials, the US demanded “meaningful accountability,” signaling that the case was far from over.India’s relations with Iran also faced turbulence when Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei named India as a place where Muslims are ""suffering,"" calling for global solidarity among the Islamic community. The comment, made on the Prophet Mohammed’s birth anniversary, drew sharp criticism from the ministry of external affairs, which termed it ""misinformed and unacceptable.""In a major breakthrough, India and China resolved their 54-month eastern Ladakh military standoff in October, reinstating pre-2020 LAC patrolling arrangements. The disengagement process, finalized in October, restored pre-2020 patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Alongside the agreement, both nations explored ways to rebuild ties through cross-border cooperation, including the resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra and data-sharing on trans-border rivers.Eight former Indian Navy personnel, previously facing death sentences in Qatar, were freed following intensive diplomatic efforts. The successful resolution highlighted effective negotiations led by Indian officials, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledging this achievement as evidence of strengthening bilateral relations between India and Qatar.Subsequently, Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and PM Modi engaged in discussions about potential partnerships in advanced sectors.The political landscape in Sri Lanka shifted with Anura Kumara Dissanayake's presidential victory. His leadership of the Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), traditionally known for its opposition to Indian influence since the 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord, initially raised diplomatic concerns.Nevertheless, Dissanayake chose India for his first international visit after assuming office.India bolstered its regional influence by signing a 10-year agreement with Iran to manage and develop the strategic Chabahar port. This investment, worth $370 million, made India a key player in enhancing connectivity with Central Asia and Afghanistan. The deal represents a significant milestone as India takes charge of managing an overseas port for the first time.Prime Minister Modi’s diplomatic outreach extended to regions often overlooked in India’s foreign policy narrative. PM Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Kuwait in 43 years, with the trip focused on strengthening energy ties and boosting trade.PM Modi visited Nigeria after 17 years, with the focus being on expanding cooperation in sectors like agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and defense. The Prime Minister’s visit to Guyana, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 56 years, sought to deepen ties with the Indian diaspora and explore avenues for collaboration in natural resources and infrastructure.India’s relationship with Russia demonstrated renewed vigour, with President Vladimir Putin describing the ties as ""specially privileged."" The Prime Minister's diplomatic expertise was evident in his unprecedented visit to Ukraine, where he pursued peace initiatives during the current conflict.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested India host a summit to discuss resolution pathways for the Russian conflict, highlighting India's potential diplomatic role.Relations between India and Maldives, which experienced tensions under President Mohamed Muizzu's China-friendly administration, showed positive progress.During Muizzu’s first state visit to India, he reassured New Delhi that his government would prioritize India’s security interests.India extended financial aid worth $400 million, including a Rs 3,000 crore bilateral currency swap agreement, demonstrating its support for the Maldives’ economic recovery.India’s humanitarian instincts were on display through ""Operation Sadbhav,"" an initiative to deliver emergency relief supplies to Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam in the wake of Typhoon Yagi. The storm, deemed Asia’s most powerful of the year, caused widespread devastation, displacing thousands.",India's diplomatic endeavours in 2024 presented both successes and significant hurdles.

NEW DELHI: Lieutenant Governor of Delhi VK Saxena on Monday wrote a letter to Delhi CM Atishi conveying his objections over ex-CM Arvind Kejriwal calling her 'temporary CM'.""I found it deeply objectionable and was personally hurt when your predecessor, Shri Arvind Kejriwal, recently declared you in the media as merely a temporary and stopgap Chief Minister,"" said the LG in his letter. ""It was not only an insult to you, but also to your appointee, the President of India and to me as her representative,"" he added.Saxena further slammed the AAP supremo and said, ""The public characterisation of a temporary or stopgap chief minister, as articulated by Shri Kejriwal, has no constitutional basis. It is also a deplorable violation of the democratic spirit and values enshrined in the Constitution authored by Babasaheb Ambedkar.""The LG lauded Atishi for her approach in governance, contrasting it with her predecessor's alleged reluctance to take on administrative responsibilities. “For the first time during my tenure, I have seen a Chief Minister actively performing the duties of the office,” he wrote.The LG further outlined the challenges faced by the Delhi government, including the Yamuna pollution crisis , garbage management, and the poor state of infrastructure in industrial and slum areas. ""It is well known under what circumstances you were made Chief Minister. Whether it be the worsening state of the Yamuna over the past ten years, the severe shortage of drinking water, the issue of garbage mountains, the lack of basic amenities in industrial areas, the disrepair of roads and sewer lines, the crumbling healthcare system, the dire lack of facilities in unauthorized colonies, or the abysmal living conditions in slum areas—everyone understands how impossible it is for a Chief Minister, already declared temporary and stopgap, to address these issues in three to four months,"" the LG said adding, ""as chief minister, the responsibility for these failures will now rest on your shoulders"".The letter also took aim at Kejriwal for making unilateral announcements on government schemes during public events claiming, “Unauthorized announcements such as schemes for senior citizens and women have undermined the dignity of the chief minister’s office and the Cabinet.”Additionally, the LG condemned Kejriwal’s claims of alleged investigations against Atishi, including suggestions that she could face jail time. He referred to official communications from the Transport Department and the Vigilance Department, which have categorically denied any such probes, calling Kejriwal’s allegations ""baseless and misleading"".The letter also saw LG expressing his concern about the level of political discourse in the capital. “I am concerned about the level of public discourse and am deeply hurt by the narrative presenting the full-time chief minister of my government as a temporary Chief Minister,” he wrote.Atishi responded to the letter letter with a sharp critique, urging him to prioritise governance over politics. ""It is a testimony to the democratic principles of our country that all elected members of the government are in fact temporary and remain in office only till the duration of their term. I am amused by you taking offence at any statement highlighting this reality of an active democracy,"" she said.Addressing the LG, she added, ""As the Lieutenant Governor, though a nominated member, you are also a part of the Delhi government. It is disheartening to note that your letter focuses on criticism rather than constructive cooperation. I strongly believe that governance should remain above petty politics, and I urge you to work alongside us in this spirit.""She defended the legacy of her predecessor, Arvind Kejriwal, stating that his governance model has become a benchmark not just in Delhi but across India. ""The elected government led by the former CM Shri Arvind Kejriwal managed to do more work in its tenure of nine and a half years than collectively done by the previous governments. I respectfully request your office to play a facilitative role rather than one that creates impediments,"" she said. Further praising Kejriwal the Delhi CM added, ""The current work of the Delhi government is deeply rooted in the vision and legacy of former Chief Minister Shri Arvind Kejriwal. Be it the educational reforms, healthcare revolution, or infrastructural advancements, his model of governance has become a benchmark not just in Delhi but across India. The progress we are making today is a continuation of this legacy, and we remain committed to fulfilling this vision.""Accusing the LG of being aligned with BJP, she claimed, ""It is evident that the office of the Lieutenant Governor is now working as a proxy of the BJP, and in its enthusiasm to protect the interest of the BJP, is causing damage to the lives of ordinary Delhites,""adding that she ""do not see how anyone can be so caught up in politics that they do not care for the people at all.""Atishi then called for for a collective effort to respect the people's mandate and work towards the betterment of Delhi. She expressed hope that 2025 would mark a shift towards constructive governance, leaving behind the ""baggage of politics.""","Lieutenant Governor of Delhi VK Saxena wrote a letter to Delhi CM Atishi conveying his objections over ex-CM Arvind Kejriwal calling her 'temporary CM'Saxena further slammed the AAP supremo and said, ""The public characterisation of a temporary or stopgap chief minister, as articulated by Shri Kejriwal, has no constitutional basis""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116801892,imgsize-1072624,width-400,resizemode-4/116801892.jpg"

Trump trumps pollsters

NEW DELHI: Caution and embarrassment may not be the most searched words on the internet in 2024, but are quite certainly the most haunted takeaways for the pollsters , who in pursuit of the bullseye, missed the entire electoral dartboard this year.While one can beat around the bush with the intricacies of data and hindsight interpretations of poll outcomes, the psephology fully faltered when presenting the larger picture of the elections in 2024.The insufficient sample size, tight deadline, competition, geographical challenges, linguistic barriers and monetary stake could possibly be attributed to factors that led to a perpetual miscalculation of the voters' perceptions.In big polls like the Lok Sabha elections and the US presidential elections or small ones like the assembly polls in Haryana, Maharashtra, and Jharkhand, the actual outcomes of the elections were inverse to what exit polls had predicted, with Jammu & Kashmir being the exception.The first crucial election that the country faced in 2024 was the humongous Lok Sabha elections, which covered all the Indian states and Union territories, with over eight thousand candidates in the fray, 10 lakh polling booths, and 97 crore registered voters.The magnanimity of the general elections makes it nearly impossible to predict the outcomes with precision, however, pollsters somehow manage to pull off the larger picture, which was not the case this year.After the dust settled following the high-octane campaign for the second-longest Lok Sabha election and seven phases of voting on June 1, the pollsters took charge and predicted a landslide victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP )-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).The poll of polls, comprising the seven major pollsters, predicted 361 seats for the ruling NDA and 145 for the opposition INDIA bloc in the 543-member Lok Sabha. The numbers were nearly in sync with the BJP's expectations of. However, three days later, it turned out that predictions were averse to reality as the actual outcome threw up a shocking mandate in front of the pollsters.On June 4, the BJP got the shock of the election season as it not only missed its expected target but also failed to secure a majority on its own for the first time since 2014. The party won only 240 seats.The BJP's failure to win 272 seats in the Lok Sabha elections made Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) and Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) key players in the NDA, which was dominated until then by the saffron party. The NDAalso gave a new lease of life to the opposition that was almost relegated to the margins.With no party with a brute majority in Parliament and the revival of the opposition, the competency of pollsters was one of the relevant topics at the centre of political discourse.Along with the Lok Sabha results, the pollsters also failed to read the mood of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, where electors voted simultaneously for the new assembly during the summer elections. In Andhra, the exit polls claimed a hung assembly, with 84-91 seats for Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and 83-90 seats for Jagan Mohan Reddy's YSRCP in the 175-member Andhra Pradesh assembly.When the results were declared, the TDP steamrolled the Jagan's YSRCP as Chandrababu's party won the lion's share by bagging 135 assembly seats. Another key figure who emerged invincible was Pawan Kalyan , whose Janasena Party achieved its first significant victory in its decade-long political journey. The party won all the 21 assembly and two Parliament seats it contested, marking a 100% success rate.In Odisha, the fight was interesting in a way that BJP and Naveen Patnaik's BJD weren't cut-throat rivals but still made fierce attempts to win the coastal state. The numbers given by the pollsters showed a close contest between BJP and BJD, which again was not the case when results started to pour in as the BJP scripted history and halted Patnaik's 24-year juggernaut.For the first time, the BJP made inroads in the state on its own by winning 78 seats in the 147-member Odisha assembly. Naveen Patnaik's BJD won 51 seats, down from the 112 seats it won in the 2019 state elections.Two months down the line came the Haryana elections. This time the Congress was riding high on its improved Lok Sabha tally as the party had won 99 seats, up from 52 seats it had managed in 2019 parliamentary polls. Other reasons the party believed it could trounce the ruling BJP was 10 years of anti-incumbency, coupled with agitations of farmers and wrestlers.The exit polls added to the adrenaline rush of the Congress as the pollsters predicted 55 seats for the party and 27 for the BJP in the 90-member Haryana assembly. The BJP, which was still recovering from the Lok Sabha shock, claimed victory like any other political party but kept fingers crossed.On October 8, when early trends began to trickle in, it seemed the pollsters were bang on. The supposition was, however, short-lived as the results wildly swayed in the favour of the BJP.The BJP won a whopping 48 seats in Haryana, which was the party's all-time best in the state till now. The Congress won 37 seats, falling short of the majority mark by 9 seats. While the party at the receiving end had changed, the performance of pollsters was a replica of June 4.Notably, the vote difference between the BJP (39.94%) and the Congress (39.09%) was just 0.84%, which resulted in a gap of 11 seats between both parties. Clearly, pollsters did not see that coming and failed to factor in elements that could lead up to such a narrow vote margin with a wide seat gap.A lot of mud had stuck about pollsters after the failed predictions of the Lok Sabha and Haryana elections, however, Maharashtra and Jharkhand assembly polls served as another chance to understand the voters' perspective.The pollsters had predicted 155 for the BJP-led Mahayuti and 122 for the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly. For Jharkhand, the poll of polls suggested a close fight between the INDIA bloc and the NDA.In Maharashtra, the ruling Mahayuti won a paradigm-shattering mandate by bagging 230 seats. Though the ruling alliance won, as the pollsters predicted, it nevertheless was far from accurate as no exit poll predicted the complete desecration of the opposition MVA, which won only 48 seats in the state elections.In tribal-dominated Jharkhand, all the exit polls, barring one, had predicted a neck-and-neck fight between the NDA and INDIA bloc, giving 38 seats to the JMM-led coalition and 40 to the BJP-led alliance.When it rains it pours, the adage was proved in Jharkhand as almost all the exit poll predictions went down the drain.On November 23, when the Jharkhand assembly results were declared, the INDIA bloc defeated the NDA by winning a resounding mandate as it emphatically won 50 seats in the 81-member Jharkhand assembly. Notably, the vote share of Hemant Soren's JMM, which won 34 seats, was 23.44%, less than BJP's 33.18%.2024 was tough not only for the Indian pollsters but also for those in the United States. In the US, opinion polls suggested a tight contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris , which ultimately was not the case.What exacerbated the embarrassment for the pollsters in the US was their failure to read the swing states. The pollsters had predicted a narrow electoral college victory for Kamala Harris in a majority of the seven swing states, including North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin.With victory in Arizona, Trump won all seven swing states he had lost in 2020. Trump managed to win 312 electoral votes to Kamala Harris' 226 to complete a remarkable victory.2024 was undoubtedly the election year, not only because each election was suspenseful leading to nail-biting result days, but for the fact that it redefined the fate and contours of the pollsters.","In big polls like the Lok Sabha elections and the US presidential elections, the actual outcomes of the elections were inverse to what exit polls had predicted.

NEW DELHI: It will take some more days for the government to allot land for former PM Manmohan Singh’s memorial as spaces for construction of a memorial can be only given to a trust, which in this case is yet to be established, sources said. They added that even in the case of a memorial for former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, land was allotted to the Atal Samiti Nyas (Trust), which was registered more than a month after his death.The government can earmark the land for the memorial but it has to be built by a trust, officials said.Sources said some preliminary assessment of available land parcels in the Rajghat area is being carried out for Manmohan Singh’s memorial. “It will take some more days as the trust, which is yet to be established, needs to apply for the land,” a source said.A member of the Atal Samiti Nyas, which built the Sadaiv Atal (the samadhi and memorial of Vajpayee), recalled that after the demise of the former PM, the trust was established. “We applied for land, and subsequently, an MoU was signed with the Central Public Works Department (CPWD). The design of the samadhi was made by the School of Planning and Architecture. The trust released fund for construction to the CPWD,” the member said.Vajpayee’s memorial is spread over 1.5 acres of land at the Rashtriya Smriti Sthal, where he was cremated on Aug 17, 2018. “Because of a change in policy, the land was allotted only to the trust,” the member said.TOI has learnt that the government is now looking at options to zero down on one to 1.5 acre land in the areas meant for memorials around Raj Ghat for Singh. They added that it takes at least four to five days for registration of a trust.Sources in Congress said they have no fresh update on the memorial.At present, there are 19 memorials in and around the Rajghat complex, which includes that of former presidents, PMs and deputy PMs. The two exceptions are Sanjay Gandhi and Lalita Shastri, the late wife of former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri.","The government can earmark the land for the memorial but it has to be built by a trust, officials said.

Homebuyers body seeks targeted guidelines against misleading ads by real estate players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/homebuyers-body-seeks-targeted-guidelines-against-misleading-ads-by-real-estate-players/articleshow/116808155.cms,"NEW DELHI: Highlighting how over one-third of the real estate advertisements examined by the self regulatory body for advertising industry were found misleading, a pan-India home buyers organisation has urged the consumer affairs department to issue targeted guidelines for real estate advertising to safeguard consumers' interests.The Forum for People’s Collective Efforts (FPCE) has also flagged the average penalty for misleading advertisements by Maharashtra RERA is barely Rs 14,000-Rs 15,000 which is unlikely to deter violators.In its letter to the department, the homebuyers’ body has attached the findings from a recent report of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), which revealed that around 34% of the advertisements analysed by it between April and September this year from Maharashtra’s real estate sector were found to be in “direct violation of the law”.The FPCE said that the ASCI has screened the advertisements on a very limited set of parameters as advised by MahaRERA. “We have absolutely no doubt that if they had screened the advertisements from the point of view of consumers, they would have found 100% of the advertisements misleading,” it said.The letter mentioned that ASCI, in February, had signed an agreement with MahaRERA to scan and address misleading advertisements in the real estate sector. “Out of the total 2,115 advertisements screened by ASCI from the real estate sector, they found 1,027 advertisements to be misleading, which comes to 48.6%. ASCI received prompt compliance in 59% of the cases where advertisers either modified their advertisements or completely withdrew it,” it added.The ASCI reviewed the compliance with mandatory disclosure norms, including the presence of registration numbers, QR codes, and other essential information.As per the letter, some 628 non-compliant advertisements were flagged to MahaRERA by ASCI which in turn levied penalty on the real estate developers to the tune of Rs 88.9 lakh. “The average penalty on each real estate developer thus comes to meagre Rs 14,000-15,000,” the FPCE said.","The Forum for People’s Collective Efforts (FPCE) has also flagged the average penalty for misleading advertisements by Maharashtra RERA is barely Rs 14,000-Rs 15,000.

Majority of Americans don't blame Luigi Mangione solely



'Supervisors laughed as patients cried for money'



A former UnitedHealthcare employee has revealed that they were systematically trained to deny medical claims and the training went for the first two or three months with supervisors standing behind and monitoring how quickly the representative is getting off the call. Natalie Collins told NewsNatoions that there was no instruction on how to actually pay the claim but the entire training was about different ways to deny the claim.“We weren’t given proper instruction to actually pay the claim, and there wasn’t enough monies in certain files in certain companies to pay medical claims,” Collins said. “We would have to just get the client off the phone as fast as we could.”UnitedHealthcare sprang to the news after its CEO Brian Thompson was murdered in front of a New York hotel. 26-year-old Luigi Mangione was arrested on charges of the murder but he pleaded not guilty. Mangione was not a customer of UnitedHealthcare but according to the investigators, he took up the murder as vigilante work.Apart from the online lionization of Mangione because of his looks, and Ivy League college education, the majority of Americans don't hold Luigi Mangione solely responsible for Brian Thompson's death. They blame health insurance profits and coverage denials too for the murder of Thompson. An NORC poll reveals that 8 in 10 adults said that Mangione has a ""great deal"" or a ""moderate amount"" of responsibility for the December 4 shooting but about 7 in 10 adults said denials for health care coverage by insurance companies or the profits made by health insurance companies also bear at least a ""moderate"" amount of responsibility.Collins, the former UnitedHealthcare staff, said the supervisors used to laugh as desperate patients used to cry for money. Collins quit her position after attempting to approve payment for a widowed mother of five whose husband died of pancreatic cancer. The supervisors ihad instructed her to deny the claim and get the caller of the phone line. “They just wouldn’t allow me to submit the claim. There would be alerts on each claim telling us that either we had to put it back in our queue and it would just go to someone else, 30 days later, 60 days later,” Collins said.Collins said she condemns violence though she understands public anger. “I don’t believe anyone should die … but people are angry. People have reasons to be very angry, and I feel that to my bones. I’ve seen it, I lived it, I processed them and I denied them.”",UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot dead in front of a New York hotel on December 4.

Elon Musk's 2-point solution to fix broken H-1B system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-2-point-solution-to-fix-broken-h-1b-system-x-users-ask-whats-tesla-doing/articleshow/116809484.cms,"Elon Musk said H-1B hiring should be costlier for companies than hiring American workers.

'Elon isn't exactly leading by example'



What did Donald Trump say on H-1B?



Elon Musk provided an easy two-point solution to fix the broken H-1B program which he defended vociferously going against the MAGA activists and then Musk even abused them and declared war. Elon Musk asserted his belief in importing the top talent from across the world to 'Make America Great Again', while the old-MAGA supporters clashed with him and said H-1B should be stopped in the interest of the American workers.The MAGA split over the visa row ended only after President-elect Donald Trump said he is in favor of H1-B -- the visa program that enables companies to hire foreign workers.Elon Musk then said he was very clear about his belief that the present H-1B is broke and needs major reform.As reforms, Musk suggested a raise in the minimum salary of H-1B workers, first and second, an addition of yearly cost for maintaining the H-1B. According to Musk, these will make hiring H-1B more expensive which is just the opposite of the present situation. Once hiring foreign workers becomes more expensive for companies than hiring Americans, they will only hire the top talents and won't fill posts with cheap labor.""A rising tide lifts all boats,"" Elon Musk wrote expressing trust in the incoming Trump administration.Reacting to Elon Musk's statements on the need for reforms in the H-1B system, social media users revealed the salaries Tesla has been offering to the H-1B hires. ""So Elon is paying 'the best engineers in the world $76,500/yr? Sounds like a scan to use H-1B to lower wages,"" a user claimed sharing a screenshot of Tesla salaries.Donald Trump picked Elon Musk over MAGA on the H-1B issue. “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,” Trump said.“I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,” Trump said. In his previous term, however, Trump restricted access to foreign worker visas though ahead of the election, he said everyone who graduates in America should get a green card.","Elon Musk said H-1B hiring should be costlier for companies than hiring American workers.

'Concerning': Elon Musk criticises Bezos' ex-wife MacKenzie Scott for $16 billion donation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/concerning-elon-musk-criticises-bezos-ex-wife-mackenzie-scott-for-16-billion-donation/articleshow/116717882.cms,"Elon Musk and MacKenzie Scott (Picture credit: PTI/X)

Tech mogul Elon Musk described the philanthropic efforts of MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, as ""concerning."" His comment came in response to a social media post scrutinising Scott’s extensive donations, alleging that her initiatives primarily fund non-profits promoting divisive ideologies rather than addressing pressing global issues.The post highlighted Scott’s “trust-based philanthropy ,” which involves providing no-strings-attached grants to over 2,500 non-profits. It alleged that her focus on causes such as racial equity, immigrant rights, and LGBTQ justice feeds what the post described as an “NGO/non-profit complex,” creating jobs for individuals seeking to validate their expensive degrees. The post further detailed Scott’s $16 billion in donations over five years, noting her wealth remains substantial at $36 billion, boosted by Amazon’s rising stock price.Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has become one of the most prolific philanthropists in recent years. Through her “Yield Giving” initiative, she has pledged more than $19 billion since 2019 to causes ranging from girls’ education in Africa to affordable housing in the United States. Scott has championed a transformative approach to philanthropy, providing large, unrestricted grants that allow organisations to allocate funds as needed.In 2024 alone, Scott made repeat donations to several organisations, a rare move given her typical “one-time grant” approach. For example, CAMFED, which supports girls’ education in Africa, received its third donation this year. Another notable beneficiary, Enterprise Community Partners, was unexpectedly awarded an additional $65 million after initially receiving $50 million in 2020.This year also marked a significant shift in Scott’s giving strategy, with her introducing an open-call application process for the first time. Over 6,000 non-profits applied, and Scott committed $640 million to more than 360 organisations, far exceeding her initial promise. Grantees praised the unrestricted nature of her grants, describing them as transformative not only for individual organisations but also for entire sectors like affordable housing.","Elon Musk described the philanthropic efforts of MacKenzie Scott as ""concerning"" His comment came in response to a social media post scrutinising Scott’s extensive donations.

"Isro launches space docking satellites, India on path to elite club; PSLV last stage has 24 payloads",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-launches-space-docking-satellites-india-on-path-to-elite-club-pslv-last-stage-has-24-payloads/articleshow/116805228.cms,"24 POEM Payloads

India on Monday got a step closer to becoming part of an elite group of nations with space-docking technology — ability to mate two spacecraft in space — with Isro ’s putting two small satellites weighing 220 kg each, into orbit.The satellites, part of the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission, lifted off around little past 10pm on the PSLV-C60 from the first launchpad at the spaceport in Sriharikota. They were placed in a 475-km circular orbit some 15 minutes later. The first of the two satellites was separated 15.1 minutes after lift off, and the other happened at 15.2 minutes.As per M Sankaran, director, UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), the satellites — ‘chaser’ and ‘target’ spacecraft — launched separately will initially be released with a small relative velocity between them.As reported by TOI earlier, the satellites, through a series of carefully choreographed manoeuvres, will distance from each other over the next few days before Isro attempts to dock them. If Isro manages this successfully, India would have taken the first serious step towards mastering the technology, something only the US, Russia and China boast of as on date.“The rocket has placed the satellite in the right orbit. The satellites moved one behind the other. Their distance will increase to about 20km over the next few days before we close the gap and attempt the docking. We’re hoping to complete docking in the coming week. The nominal date for this is Jan 7,” Isro chairman S Somanath said soon after the launch.The mission is crucial for India’s future space endeavors includingChandrayaan-4 and the planned Bhartiya Antriksh Station (BAS), as confirmed by Isro chairman S Somanath.In addition to the primary docking experiment, the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM) carried 24 innovative payloads, including several groundbreaking experiments: India’s first astrobiology payloads are among the highlights, featuring RV College of Engineering’s microbiological experiment studying gut bacteria behavior in space, and Amity University's investigation of spinach growth in microgravity.Isro is also launching its own CROPS (Compact Research Module for Orbital Plant Studies) payload to demonstrate seed germination in space, a robotic arm designed to capture space debris and a sophisticated inter-satellite communication system. Isro will demonstrate a unique “walking” robotic arm with 7 degrees of freedom, intended for future space station operations.The private sector has also sent payloads on POEM: PierSight, an Ahmedabad-based startup, launched Varuna, a precursor to what could be India’s first private Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite for maritime surveillance. The company aims to establish a 32-satellite constellation by 2028 for comprehensive ocean monitoring.The other payloads are Mumbai-based Manastu and Bengaluru’s Bellatrix Aerospace, both testing their respective green propulsion technologies, while GalaxEye from Bengaluru is showcasing their SAR signal processing technology and TakeMe2Space from Hyderabad is demonstrating nanosatellite subsystems.Other educational institutions participating include SJC Institute of Technology and MIT World Peace University. SJC from Karnataka is sending a multimode message transmitter payload that can transmit audio, text, and image messages from a satellite to the ground using FM modulation and the VHF band. It is designed to provide amateur radio satellite services globally. It was designed in collaboration with Isro’s URSC.","Isro has launched two small satellites weighing 220 kg each.

Terry Bradshaw-Led Steelers Were Part Of An NFL Tradition Started By Jimmy Carter In The Eighties

The late President Jimmy Carter was honoured with a moment of silence before the Atlanta Falcons’ game at the Washington Commanders on Sunday night. The 39th president of the United States died at the age of 100 in Georgia. Carter has a long-standing relationship with the league. Not many people know this but Carter was the first president to host the NFL's Super Bowl champions at the White House in 1980.In February 1980, President Carter invited the Pittsburgh Steelers led by Terry Bradshaw to the White House to celebrate the team's Super Bowl XIV win over the Los Angeles Rams. The late President also invited the MLB's Pittsburgh Pirates, to celebrate the World Series win that same year.The Steelers’ visit was historic because they were the first NFL team invited to the White House. The decision to invite both teams soon set a precedent within American sports. Even today major league and college champions visit the White House during their trips to Washington D.C. and meet the sitting president.Carter’s gesture set a remarkable precedent in the world of sports. “I want to include in this salute not only Pittsburgh itself but to the entire western region of Pennsylvania, because I don’t know of any team or set of teams that have had such overwhelming and constant and enthusiastic support than these two teams have had from the entire region of Pennsylvania—and I might say, looking at my own members of my family, not only from western Pennsylvania but from the White House as well and from Plains, Georgia,"" Carter said at the time.“Excellence on a transient basis is much easier than excellence sustained over a long period of time, and it requires not only a great spirit but a deep and permanent commitment to sustain that kind of championship form,” he added.""Not only have they brought honour and credit to their team but they’ve brought honour and credit to their community, because of a spirit of service to others. I think the reciprocal nature of that unselfish attitude has paid rich dividends for them as teams,” shared Carter.A month after Bradshaw and the Steelers visited the White House, Bradshaw revealed that he voted for Carter in the election that year and explained that decision. ""I’m concerned, but not as concerned about him as I am about all the other problems we’ve got going,"" he told Playboy in March 1980.""It just seems to me that we spend a lot of money to make up our national debt—and there’s inflation and prices go up, the dollar goes down. Everybody talks about balancing the budget. For why? I don’t understand it. I’ve lost a lot of money in the cattle business. We import a lot of meat. And so it’s kept the domestic prices down because of the import of foreign beef,” he broke down.""When we finally cut down our import of foreign beef, our domestic beef prices went up where we could make a living. By the time I put up hay and fertilize my hayfields and pay for my equipment and pay for my labor and then sell my cattle, I may make a profit. Most of the time, I lose money,” he added.Falcons owner Arthur Blank in a statement released by the team said he was deeply saddened by Carter’s demise. He called Carter “a great American, a proud Georgian and an inspirational global humanitarian.”“He lived his life with great civic responsibility and took it upon himself to be the change he wished to see amongst other,” Blank said. “President Carter’s kind and uniting spirit touched so many lives. He was a man of deep faith, and did everything with principles and grace, doing things the right way for the right reasons.""",President Carter was honoured with a moment of silence before the Atlanta Falcons’ game at the Washington Commanders on Sunday night. The 39th president of the United States died at the age of 100. Carter was the first president to host the NFL's Super Bowl champions at the White House in 1980.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116810182,imgsize-1669037,width-400,resizemode-4/116810182.jpg"

Godfather of AI Geoffrey Hinton backs Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI's for-profit shift; says ‘....sends a very bad message…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/godfather-of-ai-geoffrey-hinton-backs-elon-musks-lawsuit-against-openais-for-profit-shift-says-sends-a-very-bad-message/articleshow/116814912.cms,"AI can lead to human extinction: Geoffrey Hilton



Why Elon Musk is opposing OpenAI

Godfather of AI, Geoffrey Hinton , has joined the growing opposition against ChatGPT-maker OpenAI’s plan to become a fully for-profit company. On Monday i.e. December 30, Encode, a youth-led advocacy group representing young people worldwide, filed a legal brief in support of Elon Musk ’s lawsuit aimed at stopping OpenAI’s restructuring. Hinton, a Nobel and Turing Award-winning researcher, supported the filing, voicing concerns over the direction OpenAI is taking.Hinton criticized OpenAI for moving away from its original safety-focused nonprofit mission. In a statement released with Encode’s brief, he said, “OpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused nonprofit and made a variety of safety-related promises in its charter. It received numerous tax and other benefits from its nonprofit status. Allowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.”Hinton has also warned of the risks posed by artificial intelligence, In an recent interview with BBC, he said that there is a “10 to 20 percent” chance AI could lead to human extinction within the next 30 years. This marks a shift from his earlier estimate of 10 percent.OpenAI started as a nonprofit organisation in 2015 to develop AI in a way that would benefit humanity, without the need to generate financial return. It is currently a for-profit company controlled by a nonprofit board. This setup limits its ability to raise funds and pay investors.Last week, the company announced plans to fully transition to a traditional for-profit company, a move that Musk, one of OpenAI’s cofounders, has been trying to block through a lawsuit he filed in November.OpenAI has rejected Musk’s lawsuit, arguing that he lacks the legal standing to challenge the decision and is instead seeking an unfair advantage for his own AI company, xAI. In response, OpenAI released emails and messages from Musk, some of which reportedly show that he supported the idea of transitioning OpenAI to a for-profit model as early as 2017.","OpenAI started as a nonprofit organisation in 2015 to develop AI in a way that would benefit humanity, without the need to generate financial return.

Bandh throws life out of gear for 9 hours in Punjab,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/bandh-throws-life-out-of-gear-for-9-hours-in-punjab/articleshow/116814639.cms,"Demands & claims

CHANDIGARH: A statewide bandh on Monday paralysed daily life in Punjab as farmers staged protests across the Doaba, Malwa, and Majha regions. Highways and railway tracks were blocked, markets shuttered, and public transport suspended from 7 am to 4 pm, leaving commuters stranded and businesses disrupted.In Jalandhar, farmers blocked the national highway and train tracks near Dhanowali railway crossing and Phagwara's Sugar Mill Chowk. Refreshments were provided to passengers stranded on the Pune-Jammu train, thanks to Red Cross Society volunteers who distributed food and water under deputy commissioner Himanshu Aggarwal's directive.In Patiala, major roads leading to the city were blocked, including the Chandigarh, Sangrur, Sirhind, and Devigarh routes. Mehmedpur, Dharehri Toll Plaza, Kalyan, Hardaspur, Jorian, Sidhuval, and Chappar were the blockade spots. Traffic was also disrupted at Bauran Gate in Nabha, Banda Singh Bahadur Chowk and Niyal Bypass in Samana, Kanthal Road at Arno, and Rajpura's Gagan Chowk. Bus services were suspended, and shops and markets were closed.Farmers allowed emergency vehicles and wedding processions such as the one at Dharehri Jatta to pass but clashed with shopkeepers reluctant to close their businesses. Protesters also warned of boycotting dissenting shops.In Amritsar, dharnas at 30 key points, including GT Road and major bypasses, impacted goods' movement and office commutes severely. The farmers severed the city's supply of milk and vegetables. Pilgrims and tourist visitors to the Golden Temple and Durgiana Temple faced challenges due to limited transport options.In Bathinda, Ferozepur railway division refunded more than Rs 6.5 lakh to 1,010 passengers who had missed trains due to disruptions. Refunds were issued through both the passenger reservation system (PRS) and unreserved ticketing system (UTS).Farmers reiterated demands for a minimum support price (MSP) law based on Swaminathan Commission's recommendations. They criticised the government's use of water cannons and tear gas at border protest sites, citing injuries and the death of Subhkaran Singh from a bullet wound in an earlier round of the agitation. Protesters also condemned misinformation about farmer unionist Jagjit Singh Dallewal allegedly being held hostage.Farmer unionist Sarvan Singh Pandher appealed for peaceful solidarity: ""We seek complete support from the people of Punjab and request them to back the ongoing farmer protest.""Environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk joined the movement, calling for dialogue to address agrarian concerns. Wangchuk emphasized the need for inclusive policies to avert further unrest. As the Supreme Court reviews the case on Dec 31, the outcome may shape the trajectory of farmer movements across India. The standoff underscores deepening tensions between farmers and authorities, with potential ramifications for both policy and the lives of those involved.","A statewide bandh on Monday paralysed daily life in Punjab as farmers staged protests.

How TikTok-parent company plans to become ‘one of the world's biggest consumers’ of Nvidia’s AI chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-tiktok-parent-company-plans-to-become-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-consumers-of-nvidias-ai-chips/articleshow/116814528.cms,"Representative photo

Why this is significant

Despite US implemented measures to limit the sale of high-performance AI chips to Chinese companies, ByteDance , the Chinese tech giant behind TikTok , is reportedly doubling down on its AI ambitions. The company plans to become one of the world's biggest consumers of such hardware and centre to its plan is its reliance on Nvidia chips.Citing a person who has been involved in the plan, a report by The Information says claims that ByteDance plans to spend a staggering $7 billion on Nvidia's cutting-edge AI chips in 2025.“The Chinese owner of TikTok recently told suppliers it planned to spend up to $7 billion to access Nvidia chips outside China in 2025,” the report said.“The effort, led by co-founder Zhang Yiming, would make ByteDance one of the world's biggest consumers of such hardware,” the report added.There have been reports which claim that Chinese companies get access to advanced technology such as Nvidia’s sophisticated AI chips by circumventing restrictions by procuring the chips through channels outside of China.Reports have suggested that the Chinese companies are either creating new entities to bypass restrictions or are training their models outside China.Recent reports, however, claimed that that four major Chinese industry associations have urged domestic firms to exercise caution when purchasing US-made chips, citing concerns about reliability and security. This development could significantly impact American chipmakers such as Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, which have maintained a presence in the Chinese market despite stringent export restrictions.The move came in direct response to the latest round of US export controls on advanced semiconductor technology to China announced earlier this month. The US government has been steadily tightening restrictions on chip shipments to China, aiming to curb the country's technological advancement, particularly in artificial intelligence and military applications."," ByteDance plans to spend $7 billion on Nvidia's cutting-edge AI chips in 2025.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
