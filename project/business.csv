SC sends notice on non-recruitment of ‘Rajasthani’ teachers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-sends-notice-on-non-recruitment-of-rajasthani-teachers/articleshow/117136519.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Constitution, Right to Education Act and National Education Policy , mandates imparting primary education to linguistic minorities in their mother tongues, but the governments recruit teachers only in 22 scheduled languages thus depriving instruction in mother tongues to crores of students who speak over 100 languages, which have written heritage.This issue was raised by a scholar in “Rajasthani’ language, which is spoken by more than four crore people, before the Supreme Court on Friday. Appearing for Padam Mehta, senior advocate Manish Singhvi told a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta that the mandate of the Constitution and other statutes are being violated as no person proficient in ‘Rajasthani’ is recruited to teach primary or elementary school students.Not questioning inclusion of other languages as part of the Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teachers (REET), Singhvi said ‘Rajasthani’, spoken by over four crore people, has been excluded from REET but languages like Gujarati, Punjabi, Sindhi and Urdu, which are spoken by a very small population in the state, have been included in REET. The bench entertained the petition and sought response from the state govt.The petitioner said, “If teachers speaking ‘Rajasthani’ are not recruited imparting of education in ‘Mother Tongue’ loses significance” and expressed concern that non-recruitment of teachers in “Rajasthani’ language would violate an important right of the elementary and primary school children to be taught in their mother tongue.Apart from the 22 scheduled languages, there are 23 other languages with millions of speakers including Awadhi, Bagri, Bhili, Bhojpuri, Chhattisgarhi, Deccani, Kangri, Garhwali, Haryanvi, Ho, Kanauji, Khandeshi, Kumaoni, Kurux, Lamani, Magahi, Malvi, Marwari, Meitei, Mundari, Nimadi, Sadari and Tulu, according to Union ministry of educationAs per the ministry, the concept of ‘mother tongue’ is defined by the Census as the language spoken in childhood by the person's mother to the person. If the mother died in infancy, the language mainly spoken in the person’s home in childhood will be the mother tongue.The petitioner said section-29(2) (f) of RTE Act categorically states that while preparation of curriculum and evaluation procedure for elementary education, the medium of instructions as far as practical should be in the child's mother tongue.The National Education Policy also states that the medium of instructions for the children at least till Grade-V or preferably till Grade-VIII will be the mother tongue/local language wherever possible, he said, adding the Rajasthan Assembly more than two decades ago had passed a resolution for inclusion of ‘Rajasthani’ in Eighth Schedule.","The Constitution, Right to Education Act and National Education Policy mandates imparting primary education to linguistic minorities in their mother tongues.

"Ancient wisdom, keys to success in business",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ancient-wisdom-keys-to-success-in-business/articleshow/117121181.cms,"Thirukkural

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

“Aatrin Varundha Varuththam Palar Nindru

Potrinum Poththup Padum”

“The enterprise, not backed by ethical means, will fall

Though many may stand to uphold it”

As I stood before a sea of ambitious faces at the Young Entrepreneur School (YES) conclave, I witnessed the burning flame of aspiration in their eyes. Each participant carried dreams of building the next Amazon, Google, Meta or Apple – giants that began as mere saplings, nourished by nothing but their founders' unwavering vision.These dreamers embodied three distinct phases of the entrepreneurial odyssey.The first wave consisted of those grappling with the age-old dilemma: to jump or not. Their entrepreneurial spirit yearned to break free but family and friends often played devil's advocate.The second group had already taken the plunge, securing partners and promoters but found themselves navigating treacherous waters. Some quietly cast wistful glances at their ‘settled’ peers, drawing bittersweet comparisons.The third category had ventured too deep to turn back, like ancient armies burning bridges behind them to eliminate retreat as an option. Their journey was testament to entrepreneurship 's essence of risk-taking, creativity and opportunity-seeking in uncharted territories.I shared two inspiring tales that capture the essence of entrepreneurial resilience. The first was of a humble dhoti seller who began by carrying his wares on his head. Each day, he faced brutal rejection from the first shop in the bazaar, yet he persisted. When questioned, he revealed that though he was dismissed each day, seeing the owner’s face before he started his venture turned out to be his good luck charm! This simple but intelligent stance transformed his tormentor into an ally, laying the foundation for what would become an apparel empire.The second story featured a sweet shop owner who faced an annual exodus of master chefs during Diwali season. Rather than following the conventional path of higher pay or competitive poaching, he standardised his processes to such perfection that anyone could replicate his sweets' excellence, while keeping the ingredients secret. This innovative solution eliminated his dependency on expensive expertise.These modern tales of enterprise echo the ancient wisdom of Thiruvalluvar, who dedicated an entire chapter to entrepreneurial guidance - Therindhu Vinayaadal (Look before you leap) – which offers timeless principles, from understanding profit mechanisms to choosing knowledgeable partners.His principles, though centuries old, resonate deeply with modern business wisdom.Thiruvalluvar's wisdom extends beyond mere profit-making. He warns against rushing into ventures without proper feasibility studies and advocates for careful planning before challenging competitors. Perhaps most remarkably, he stresses the importance of authentic employee recognition, cautioning against hollow praise and undeserved bonuses – a principle that modern management studies are fully embracing only now.From Enron to Satyam, each fallen giant serves as a testament to Thiruvalluvar's ancient warning about the perils of unethical business practices.The entrepreneurial journey remains one of life's most challenging battlegrounds. True victory, however, lies in choosing the path of ethics, even when it means taking the longer, harder road. For it is in this choice that entrepreneurs transform from mere businesspeople into true leaders who leave lasting legacies of positive change.The young entrepreneurs before me represented not just India's economic future, but its moral compass in commerce. As they embark on their respective journeys, their commitment to ethical business practices will be their guiding star through the storms of entrepreneurship.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117122666,imgsize-40842,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/117122666.jpg"
SC stays GST action against e-gaming companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-stays-gst-action-against-e-gaming-companies/articleshow/117134558.cms,"GST

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday stayed Goods and Services Tax (GST) proceedings against 49 online gaming companies over retrospective demand notices issued to them, a decision that pushed up the share price of some of the listed entities.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan passed the interim order, while posting the matter for further hearing to March 18.Market players saw the SC stay as a relief for online gaming companies, which had received show-cause notices alleging GST evasion of Rs 1.1 lakh crore. As the GST Act allows government to impose a penalty of up to 100 per cent of the tax demand, the total liability could potentially be Rs 2.3 lakh crore.In October 2023, the GST Council had imposed a 28% tax on the face value of online gaming bets, which authorities interpreted as a clarification and raised tax demand for the period preceding the decision. Various online gaming companies have challenged the 'retrospective' GST notices.The gaming industry has been advocating for the tax to be calculated on gross gaming revenue (GGR) rather than the face value of bets. Before the decision, the companies were levying 18% tax on the platform fees or GGR.""While the GST resolution may take time, we remain optimistic that a fair resolution will not only provide the much-needed clarity but also accelerate innovation, job creation, and investor confidence. This clarity is crucial for many companies preparing to go public, positioning the Indian gaming ecosystem for global leadership that India deserves. With the right policies in place, India is poised to seize this once-in-a-millennium opportunity to lead the global consumer tech landscape,"" said Saumya Rathore, co-founder of Winzo, one of the petitioners along with entities, such as Gameskraft, Games24x7. Several petitions pending in High Courts have also transferred to the apex court.In Sept 2023, SC stayed a Karnataka High Court judgment, quashing a GST notice against Gameskraft for alleged evasion of Rs 21,000 crore. The powerful gaming lobby has been seeking a reversal of the GST Council decision , arguing that it will hurt the industry. In Oct 2023, some states had sought a review after six months, but the GST Council had not discussed the matter, amid numbers showing that the bleak picture painted by the gaming companies was not true.On a day when sensex fell 0.3% or 231 points, casino operator Delta Corp gained 4.9% to close at Rs 118.9. Similarly, OnMobile stocks closed 0.6% stronger, while Nazara Tech, whose shares gained 8.5% after the SC stay, closed 3.3% lower.","Market players saw the SC stay as a relief for online gaming companies, which had received show-cause notices alleging GST evasion of Rs 1.1 lakh crore.

Setting the theme of ‘ Swachh Maha Kumbh , Swasth Maha Kumbh ’, the Prayagraj Mela Authority has come up with an elaborate plan to provide healthcare and latest medical facilities to devotees under a single roof with a Central Hospital.Apart from a 100-bed central hospital, two dedicated hospitals are being set up to manage infectious diseases, ensuring health and safety of pilgrims from India and abroad.Senior medical officer and in-charge of central hospital Dr Gaurav Dubey said, “In line with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s vision of ‘Swastha Maha Kumbh,’ a 100-bed central hospital at the Parade Ground has unlimited OPD capacity. Separate wards for men, women, and children are being set up, along with delivery rooms, an emergency ward, and doctor’s rooms. Special arrangements for tests, including OPD, X-ray, ultrasound, and ECG rooms, are also in place.”In addition to Central Hospital, two 25-bed hospitals at Arail and Jhunsi, as well as eight smaller 20-bed hospitals with special facilities, have been set up to cater to the needs of pilgrims. Two hospitals are also dedicated to preventing infectious diseases.Among the latest initiatives, the mela health authorities have introduced Artificial Intelligence (AI) in intensive care units (ICUs), aiming to enhance the quality of healthcare.Being deployed for the first time within the mela area, the advanced AI Messaging Flow System is capable of interpreting and conveying the concerns of patients from any part of the world.In case of any critical deterioration in a patient’s condition, the system will instantly alert the medical team, enabling swift action to ensure care.A groundbreaking technology marks a significant step toward integration of digital innovation with healthcare during the world’s biggest religious congregation, setting a new standard for event medical management. For the first time, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being utilized to monitor the health of devotees, with a particular focus on ICU management .Besides, a 10-bed ICU equipped with cutting-edge AI technology is also set up at the Central Hospital in the Mela area. Under this, special AI-enabled microphones are installed near each patient, capable of instantly translating 22 regional and 19 international languages into Hindi or English. This will bridge language barriers, enabling seamless communication between doctors and patients for effective treatment.The advanced AI-enabled cameras are also installed throughout the ICU to monitor patient conditions in real time. These cameras, overseen by three senior specialists, will assess patients’ health and immediately alert the medical team if emergency intervention is required. The system will automatically message the team leader directly, ensuring prompt medical assistance within seconds.The ICU also features telemedicine facilities, allowing patients to consult online with specialist doctors from Medanta Hospital when necessary. These experts can assess the patient’s condition remotely and provide crucial guidance to the on-site medical team, enhancing the quality and speed of care during Maha Kumbh.Apart from a 100-bed hospital being set up at the Parade, specialist doctors from AIIMS Rae Bareli and the Army Hospital have been assigned duties at central hospital to provide medical care throughout the mega religious event, further strengthening the health infrastructure for devotees. Superspecialist doctors have also been roped in to cater to patients with serious ailments.Separate wards for men, women, and children have been set up which will offer facilities like delivery rooms, emergency wards, and doctors’ rooms. Advanced diagnostic services and immediate medicine distribution will be available to ensure seamless healthcare to all attendees.In addition to the main hospital, eight smaller hospitals with 20 beds each are being prepared for devotees. Two ICUs with 10 beds each are being constructed by the Army Hospital in the mela ground and Arail area. Meanwhile, a 25-bed hospital in Jhunsi will include a 10-bed ICU, managed by AIIMS Rae Bareli, to provide round-the-clock healthcare facilities.The state of the art ‘Bhishm Cube’ mobile hospital, which was previously deployed during the Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha ceremony in Ayodhya on Jan 22 last year would be on-site to enhance emergency preparedness.Each Bhishm Cube can treat up to 200 patients simultaneously, offering a range of facilities including surgical capabilities, diagnostic tools, and comprehensive patient care.Built to be robust, waterproof, and lightweight, these units provide immediate treatment capabilities and leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics for real-time coordination, monitoring, and efficient medical management.Bhishm Cube can be transported by hand, bicycle, or drone and can even be airdropped in critical situations. The unit can be fully operational within 12 minutes of deployment. Jointly developed and rigorously tested by the Indian Air Force, healthcare institutions, and defence technology experts, Bhishm Cube exemplifies cutting-edge innovation in mobile healthcare.","The Prayagraj Mela Authority has come up with an elaborate plan to provide healthcare and latest medical facilities to devotees.

May make mistakes, but won’t do so with bad intentions: PM

NEW DELHI: PM Modi said the decision of US authorities to cancel his visa was taken on the basis of ""falsehoods"" peddled by some people and it rankled with him because it was an insult to a democratically elected govt and the country as a whole.""Visiting the US as a private citizen was not material to me. But I was the chief minister, heading a democratically elected govt and this was an insult to a democratically elected govt and the country. It troubled me. Some people peddled falsehoods..."" Modi said during a conversation with Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of online trading platform Zerodha, in a podcast.""But when I addressed a press conference...I said I can visualise a day when people will be queuing up for Indian visas. I said that in 2005... I can clearly see that India's time has come,"" he said in his debut on a podcast, a medium politicians across the world are banking on to get their message across.The US cancelled the visa of Modi on the basis of allegations about his complicity in the communal riots that erupted after 59 kar sevaks on Sabarmati Express were burnt to death in Godhra. An SC-monitored probe cleared Modi of the charge.Modi touched upon the Godhra arson attack, saying he was deeply anguished by the ghastly sight but was obligated to rise above his emotions. “It was a painful sight. There were dead bodies everywhere, but I knew I am in a post where I have to rise above my emotions. I tried to keep myself together,” he said.He acknowledged that while humans could make mistakes, they should not act with harmful intentions. “When I became CM, in one of my speeches, I had said that I will leave no stone unturned in my efforts. Second, I will not do anything for myself. Third, I am a human, I may make mistakes, but I will not make mistakes with bad intentions. I made them my life’s mantras. It is natural to make mistakes, after all I am a human, I am not God, but will not do wrong intentionally,” he said.The free-wheeling conversation covered Modi’s personality as well as important episodes through his career, with Kamath prodding the PM on whether he was a risk-taker, and on parallels, if any, between politics and entrepreneurship, and high entry barrier facing those wishing to join politics.Modi described himself as a risk-taker, emphasising that he could afford to take more risks because he “does not have anything personal at stake”. “My risk-taking ability is several times more and I have not exhausted my risk-taking capacity yet,” he said. At another point, Modi said while he was not immune to anxieties, he could handle them better. “Definitely, such situations arise... but everyone has a different style and capacity to face such situations,” he said.Asked if he factored in worst-case scenarios while taking important calls, Modi said, “I have never thought about life or death, those who lead calculated lives may feel so. When I became CM, I was surprised how I ended up there because that was not the trajectory I had chosen.” He recalled his desire to become a sanyasi and a monk with Ramakrishna Mission as well as his wanderings in the Himalayas and in the salt deserts of Kutch. “My background is such that my mother would have distributed sweets in the entire locality if I had become a teacher,” he said.","PM Narendra Modi made his debut on a podcast, a medium politicians across the world are banking on to get their message across.

Delhi elections: Why Arvind Kejriwal should be wary of Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-elections-why-arvind-kejriwal-should-be-wary-of-congress/articleshow/117123921.cms,"Poll Do You Believe the Upcoming Elections Will Witness a Shift in Political Power? No Yes

NEW DELHI: Can Arvind Kejriwal sweep Delhi elections once again to score a hat-trick of victories or will a determined BJP succeed in stopping the AAP juggernaut this time around with the Congress playing a ""spoiler"" for the ruling party?The AAP and the Congress had contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Delhi together but have since then gone their separate ways making the February 5 assembly elections a three-way contest. The friends-turned-rivals have openly engaged in ugly spats, much to the delight of the BJP. While the Delhi Congress leaders have unleashed all-out attack against Kejriwal, the AAP chief has accused the grand-old-party of ""secret coordination"" with the BJP.Kejriwal has asserted that Delhi assembly elections is a contest between the BJP and AAP, playing down any possible challenge from the Congress. His assessment may not be completely off the mark, given the performance of Congress in the last two assembly elections where it failed to even open its account and saw its vote share dip to under 5%.But the Congress, which is still smarting under the shock defeats it suffered in Haryana and Maharashtra last year, is going all out to make its presence felt in the Delhi elections. The party has already announced names of 50 candidates and has fielded Sandeep Dikshit, son of three time chief minister Sheila Dikshit, against Arvind Kejriwal. Reacting to Congress's candidates list, AAP claimed ""it looks as if it was finalised at the BJP office."" The Delhi Congress leaders have stepped up their attacks on AAP government and Kejriwal targeting it over issues of corruption and governance. The grand-old-party has promised welfare schemes - Pyari Didi Yojna and Jeevan Raksha Yojna - in line with the recent trends to woo people of Delhi. Congress national leadership, which was missing from action till now, is also planning to take the plunge. Reports say Rahul Gandhi will hold his first rally in Delhi next week.So, should Kejriwal completely dismiss the Congress challenge?Well, a look at the data of the last three elections shows that the rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. The AAP emerged on Delhi's political scene in 2013 winning 28 seats with a vote share of 29.49%. The Congress tally in 2013 came down to 8 seats from 43 that it won in 2008. It's vote share also dipped from 40.31% in 2008 to 24.55% in 2013. The BJP on the other hand saw a marginal dip in vote share of around 3% but gained 8 seats taking its tally from 23 to 31 seats in 2013.In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%. The BJP vote share did not change much registering a decline of just 1%. Clearly, this was an indication of Congress supporters moving towards AAP in a big way.In 2020, the Congress vote share declined further by almost half to 4.26%. However, this time around AAP's support base remained almost the same but the BJP's vote share increased by over 6%. This signalled the strengthening of the BJP at the expense of the Congress.In terms of seats won also, AAP was way ahead of both the BJP and the Congress winning 67 and 62 seats out of 70 in the last two elections. This huge gap perhaps explains AAP's confidence going into the February 5 electoral battle.But Kejriwal's party, which faces the prospect of anti-incumbency after being in power for 10 years, should be wary of an improved Congress performance in the elections. If the Congress manages to better its vote share it could end up cutting into the AAP’s vote-bank which includes slum dwellers, Purvanchalis, Muslims and also residents of unauthorised colonies. Any increase in Congress's vote share may not translate into dramatic increase in party's seat share in the assembly, but would definitely make the contest in some seats difficult for the other two main contenders. Since AAP has 62 seats in the assembly, it could end up suffering more than the BJP has only 8 members at present. The saffron party could gain from the three-way division of votes.The BJP, after the 2024 Lok Sabha setback, has made an impressive electoral comeback - creating history in both Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is leading the BJP campaign, has already held two rallies unleashing a vicious attack on the AAP government. The saffron camp is confident of continuing with its winning spree.Kejriwal, who has campaigned with great success in the last two assembly elections, has also gone all out trying to woo all sections in Delhi in his bid to score a hat-trick in Delhi. He would hope that the Congress continues to remain on the fringes as in the last two elections and not end up playing a spoiler for the AAP.","The AAP and the Congress had contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Delhi together but have since gone their separate ways. The friends-turned-rivals have openly engaged in ugly spats, much to the delight of the BJP. While the Delhi Congress leaders have unleashed all-out attack against Kejriwal, the AAP chief has accused the grand-old-party of ""secret coordination"" with the Hindu party.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117126082,imgsize-976706,width-400,resizemode-4/117126082.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his podcast debut on ' People by WTF ' hosted by Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath, shared his perspective on the changing landscape of politics and the abuses faced in public life. Addressing a question on social media’s impact on politics and the advice he would offer aspiring politicians, PM Modi reflected on his journey and shared a joke.Kamath asked Modi about the shift from pre-social media politics to the present, where digital platforms dominate political narratives. Modi responded with a mix of humour and wisdom, recounting a story from Ahmedabad to illustrate his approach to handling criticism. ""Some children ask me, ‘How do you feel when you are abused so much?’ I tell them a joke about an Ahemdabadi who remained calm even when verbally attacked.""Once, an Ahemdabadi was riding on his scooter and almost collided with someone from behind. The other person got angry, and they started arguing. The other person started abusing me. Ahemdabadi remained standing with his scooter. The other person kept on abusing me. Suddenly someone came and said, ""What kind of a person are you? He is abusing so much and you are standing just like that."" The Ahemdabadi said, ""He is just giving, but he is not taking anything, right?,"" PM Modi said.On facing abuses in the political arena, he said that he is ""okay if they are verbally abusing me"". However, he added that the foundation of the abuse must be truth and there should be no ""evil in heart"".Modi said that there is a need for sensitivity in public life, stating, ""In every aspect of life, friction exists. However, in politics, you must approach challenges with a sense of service. Without sensitivity, one cannot help people effectively.""PM Modi has been at the receiving end of constant barbs from the opposition parties, throughout various state elections as well as Lok Sabha polls.The consistent criticism mainly comes from the Congress party, which has often accused Modi of undermining democratic values and the Constitution and has referred to the PM as ""non-biological"".During the podcast PM Modi also shared his vision for a ""Viksit Bharat"" (Developed India) by 2047, where basic needs like toilets, water, and electricity are available to all, and government schemes are delivered without hindrance. Modi highlighted that AI (Aspirational India) would be the driving force behind this vision.

Do watch"".In the podcast, Kamath expressed his nervousness in Hindi, saying, ""I am sitting here in front of you and talking, I feel nervous. It's a tough conversation for me."" The Prime Minister acknowledged with a smile, responding, ""This is my first podcast, I don't know how it'll go with your audience.""Discussing his early life, the Prime Minister revealed, ""I used to wash the clothes of all my family members. Because of that, I was allowed to go to the pond.."" He also recounted inviting his friends and teachers to the chief minister's residence.""When I became the chief minister, I wanted to invite my old friends to the CM house. I invited all of them, but I didn’t enjoy it because I was trying to find my friends in them, while they were seeing me as the CM,"" the Prime Minister said.PM Modi acknowledged that whilst humans can make mistakes, they should not act with harmful intentions.""When I became the CM, in one of me speeches, I had said that I will leave no stone unturned in my efforts. Secondly, I will not do anything for myself. Third, I am a human, I may make mistakes, but I will not make mistakes with bad intentions. I made them my life's mantras. It is natural to make mistakes, after all I am a human, I am not God, but will not do wrong intentionally,"" he said.The Prime Minister recounted the February 24, 2002 Godhra incident, narrating the ordeal as a newly-elected MLA.""I became MLA for first time on 24 February, 2002. Just 3 days and a train was burnt in Godhra. I decided to hit ground zero. Officers denied citing unavailability of the helicopter. They arranged one but said that they it wasn't for VIPs. I said, I'm not a VIP, I'm a common man,"" he said.""I took a single-engine chopper of ONGC despite the risk and reached Godhra.

Chinese President Xi also made a courtesy call in which he said that he wants to come to India. I said 'you are welcome, you must visit. He said I want to visit Gujarat, your village Vadnagar... He said 'you know why? Me and you share a special bond'... He said Chinese philosopher Hiuen Tsang resided the longest in your village and when he returned to China, he resided in my village,"" he said.During the conversation, the Prime Minister emphasised the importance of public service-oriented individuals joining politics, stating they should be driven by mission rather than personal ambition.He further emphasised that one should enter politics not out of personal ambition but with a mission.""Good people should come into politics. They should come with mission not with ambition. Mission should be above ambition,"" PM Modi said.Discussing the difference between entrepreneurship and politics, he explained that entrepreneurs focus on personal and business growth, while politicians must prioritise societal welfare through self-sacrifice.""Entrepreneur's training is to how to grow, in politics it should be how to sacrifice. There (in entrepreneurship) it is how to make your company number one. In politics it should be nation first. This is the difference,"" he said.He emphasised that political involvement extends beyond electoral participation, noting that society embraces politicians who demonstrate a genuine commitment to national interests.""Society accept nation first people. Life in politics is not easy. We have a worker called Ashok Bhatt. He lived in a small house all his life. He has been a minister. But He did not own a car. To enter politics is not necessary about contest election. The work is about winning the minds of people. To do that one has to live among them. Such people are still there in politics,"" he said.PM Modi clarified the interpretation of ""minimum government, maximum governance"". He explained that the concept focuses on enhancing governmental departmental efficiency, which led to the establishment of separate ministries for skills, cooperatives, and fisheries.The administration eliminated 40,000 compliances to streamline operations across various departments.""We often misunderstand the concept of minimum government, maximum governance. Some believe that minimum government means fewer ministers and fewer employees. However, this is not my understanding. I made different ministries for skill, cooperatives, and fisheries. When I say minimum government...my point is that we took away 40,000 compliances to increase the speed of work. Otherwise, the different departments will demand the same things. If one department has it, use it for all,"" PM Modi said during a podcast conversation with social media influencer Nikhil Kamath.""I have abolished 1,500 old laws. I have changed laws that criminalised certain things. This is my vision of minimum government and maximum governance. I am witnessing it all happen,"" he further said.Although the Prime Minister regularly hosts 'Mann Ki Baat' and appears in television interviews, this marks his initial venture into podcasting.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath on the ""People by WTF"" channel.

Students must not suffer for board’s flip-flops: SC

NEW DELHI: In a relief to a batch of students who dropped one year of study in engineering colleges to take IIT-Advanced exam after maximum attempts were increased to three, Supreme Court on Friday directed they be allowed to appear in the entrance exam which is their third attempt despite the joint admission board withdrawing its decision and restoring maximum attempts to two. JAB, through IIT-Kanpur, released the 'Eligibility Criteria' for candidates appearing for JEE-Advanced 2025 on November 5.As per the criteria, a candidate can attempt JEE (Advanced) maximum three times in three consecutive years. But only 13 days later, the decision was recalled, reviving earlier criteria of maximum two attempts.Observing that the students should not suffer because of flip flops by the board, a bench of Justices B R Gavai and Augustine George Masih said those who dropped out from their courses between Nov 5 and Nov 18, 2024, be allowed to make third attempt to get into IITs by taking JEE-Advanced.“If the students, acting on the said representation (of Nov 5), have dropped from their course with an understanding that they would be entitled to appear for the JEE exam, withdrawal of the promise on Nov 18, 2024 cannot be permitted to act to their detriment,” the SC bench observed.The court, however, made it clear that the benefit of its order would be confined to only those who dropped out of college between Nov 5 and Nov 18, 2024. SC was hearing two petitions, including one filed by 22 aspirants, challenging the reduction in number of attempts available to aspirants for JEE-Advanced from three to two.One of the petitioner students told the apex court that he dropped the first year of his BTech course at NIT Silchar after the number of attempts was increased but was left in the lurch after the decision was withdrawn, which was done in an arbitrary manner.","JAB, through IIT-Kanpur, released the 'Eligibility Criteria' for candidates appearing for JEE-Advanced 2025 on November 5.

NEW DELHI: Giving women significant autonomy to choose whether to return to their estranged husbands, Supreme Court Friday ruled that a wife is entitled to maintenance from her husband even if she refuses to comply with a court decree in favour of the man for restitution of conjugal rights .A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said, ""Preponderance of judicial thought weighs in favour of upholding the wife's right to maintenance under Section 125 CrPC, and the mere passing of a decree for restitution of conjugal rights at the husband's behest and non-compliance therewith by the wife would not, by itself, be sufficient to attract the disqualification under Section 125.""Writing the judgment, Justice Kumar said whether the wife had legitimate reasons for not complying with the decree of restitution of conjugal rights would depend on the facts of each case and there could not be an omnibus ruling that refusal to go back to the matrimonial home would disentitle the woman wife of her right to maintenance.""It would depend on the facts of the individual case, and it would have to be decided, on the strength of the material and evidence available, whether the wife still had valid and sufficient reason to refuse to live with her husband, despite such a decree,"" the bench said.""In any event, a decree for restitution of conjugal rights secured by a husband coupled with non-compliance therewith by the wife would not be determinative straightaway either of her right to maintenance or the applicability of the disqualification under Section 125(4) CrPC,"" it added.Setting aside a Jharkhand high court order that had denied maintenance to a woman for refusing to join the matrimonial home despite the husband getting a decree for restitution of conjugal rights, the Supreme Court said that the facts stated by the woman in refusing to go back to her husband - his that he refusal refused to bear her her treatment expenses after abortion,, and not being allowed to use the toilet at the matrimonial home - were facts about her ill-treatment and formed cogent grounds for her reluctance to go back to him.Finding that the woman was fully dependent on her brother for survival, the SC ordered the husband to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs 10,000 to her and pay arrears of maintenance from Aug 2019 in three instalments by Dec 2025.","Supreme Court rules that a wife is entitled to maintenance from her husband even if she refuses to comply with a court decree.

The authors of the study conducted an impact evaluation of the NFSA on child stunting , nutrition and dietary diversity .The analysis done by Aditya Shrinivas, an economist with IIM Bangalore, along with two professors of geography and economics from the universities of California and Calgary, also showed that food transfer through the PDS increased daily wages and total wage income, improving the welfare of poor households, who are typically net labour suppliers. Additionally, it helped the poorest weather local climate shocks such as poor rainfall or drought.The NFSA standardised entitlement quantities and prices, mandating the provision of 5kg of staple grain per person per month at 3 per kg for rice and 2 per kg for wheat. Earlier, states had discretion over prices and quantities offered to PDS beneficiaries. The paper provides evidence on how food transfers alone can reduce child stunting in developing countries.The study selected households randomly from 30 villages across eight states which account for about 41% of India's population - Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha. Households with ration cards were the focus of the study and non-eligible households, which did not get them, served as an internal control group. The shift from per-household to per-individual entitlements benefitted larger families and states with less generous entitlements had to expand the food transfer after NFSA. The authors used these variations in entitlements to measure the value of PDS transfer before and after the NFSA.While PDS only subsidises staple grains, the authors found that an increase in PDS transfers improves dietary diversity and improves the consumption of nutrient-dense foods. ""We find that PDS transfers increase the share of the food budget spent on animal proteins while decreasing the share spent on grains. The magnitude of increase in nutrient intake is large enough to explain our core finding of a reduction in stunting,"" stated the paper. The authors suggest that this could be because the decrease in out-of-pocket expenditure on staple foods frees up household food budgets for a shift of expenditure to more nutrient-dense foods.""The magnitude of this effect was largest for infants 0 to 2 years, consistent with the critical window of the first 1,000 days of life during which a child's development is highly sensitive to nutritional intake,"" stated the paper. Extensive research has shown that extreme weather events such as droughts substantially increase child stunting, particularly for agricultural households who rely on rain-fed agriculture as their source of income. ""In years with a negative rainfall shock, PDS transfers reduce stunting by 7% points, as compared to 3.2% points during a positive rainfall shock year. These results suggest that a nutrition-sensitive safety net like the PDS supports food security, making child nutrition outcomes less sensitive to local climate shocks,"" observed the authors.Moreover, food transfers can provide insurance against the rise in local food prices in response to agricultural production shocks, they added. PDS has often been criticised for not reaching the intended beneficiaries and for supplying only cereals that provide ""empty calories"". However, the study found that the expansion of PDS following the implementation of NFSA did reach the intended beneficiaries, helped improve nutrition of the poorest households and brought down child stunting.","National Food Security Act of 2013 led to reduction in child stunting in India. Food transfer through the PDS increased daily wages and total wage income, improving welfare of poor households. PDS has often been criticised for not reaching the intended beneficiaries and supplying only cereals that provide ""empty calories""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117131626,imgsize-1165426,width-400,resizemode-4/117131626.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Friday expressed reluctance to entertain a petition by Mathura's Shahi Idgah mosque management committee challenging an Allahabad High Court order for clubbing together all 15 Hindu-side suits seeking right to worship on the disputed site claiming it to be Lord Krishna's birthplace.""Why should we interfere with the order for consolidation of all suits?"" asked a bench comprising CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar even before the committee's counsel Tasneem Ahmadi could give reasons for moving Supreme Court against the August 1, 2024, order of a single judge bench of the HC.Ahmadi said the suits were dissimilar and raised myriad issues & should not have been clubbed together. ""We (SC) are examining other issues (implementation of Places of Worship Act, 1991).

NEW DELHI:All operators of the `Dhruv’ advanced light helicopters (ALHs) have been told by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) that the flying of the indigenous twin-engine choppers should remain suspended till the “root cause” that led to the Jan 5 crash at Porbandar is established.The preliminary analysis of the data retrieved from the FDR (flight data recorder) and CVR (cockpit voice recorder) of the ill-fated Coast Guard chopper has shown that the pilots “lost control three to four seconds” before the crash, an official told TOI.The ALH Mark-III , inducted from the HAL in June 2021, had completed a 90-minute training sortie, with the crew undertaking “running change” for the next sortie. The 5.5-tonne chopper was hovering at 200-feet when it “failed to respond to the pilots’ control inputs” and then nose-dived into the ground and burst into flames.The two pilots, Commandant Saurabh and deputy commandant S K Yadav, and air crew diver Manoj Pradhan Navik, were killed in the crash. The Coast Guard had lost another two pilots and an aircrew diver when their ALH had also crashed into the Arabian Sea during a medical evacuation operation from Porbandar in Sept last year.The armed forces have temporarily grounded all their 330 ALHs for safety checks after Sunday’s crash, as was first reported by TOI. The entire ALH fleet had also been grounded two-three times for systematic technical checks in 2023 after four major crashes. “There have also been some cases of power loss and failure of gear boxes reported in the ALHs in recent months,” another officer said.This troubling safety record has led to calls for a comprehensive investigation, with independent experts in the committee, into the several issues plaguing the helicopters. “These groundings of ALHs, which are the workhorses of the armed forces, are happening far too often. It adversely impacts day-to-day operations,” an experienced helicopter pilot said.“Nothing should be brushed under the carpet now. HAL should resolve all problems,” he added. HAL, in turn, said it “remains committed to the fast-track determination of the root cause of the latest crash and ensuring an early resumption of safe flying operations”.“An expert HAL team is at Porbandar examining all the evidence, while a Coast Guard board of inquiry is also underway. The way forward will be decided soon,” an official said.After the crashes in 2023, the HAL had undertaken safety technical upgrades after cases of design and metallurgical flaws, including “failure of the collective”, which controls the power to the rotors and back, were reported in the multi-mission choppers, as reported by TOI earlier.",All operators of the `Dhruv’ advanced light helicopters (ALHs) have been told by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) that the flying of the indigenous twin-engine choppers should remain suspended.

Officials explained that the notice was designed to help countries share alerts and request information globally, enabling them to locate, identify, and seize assets linked to criminal activities such as fraud, corruption, environmental crime, and drug trafficking.""This notice will facilitate bilateral engagement, including requests for asset seizure, confiscation, or recovery, under national laws. Interpol's general secretariat will review every 'Silver Notice' and diffusion for compliance with Interpol's rules, ensuring they are not used for political purposes. During the pilot phase, extracts of 'Silver Notices' will not be published on Interpol's website,"" an officer said.The project will run at least until November this year, with roughly 500 notices available for distribution among participating countries. India is expected to benefit significantly from this initiative, as it will help locate assets of criminals who transferred illicit wealth to tax havens.Under the notices, countries can request information about assets linked to criminal activities. It will assist in locating, identifying, and obtaining information on laundered assets, including properties, vehicles, financial accounts, and businesses.The Lyon-based Interpol operates eight types of colour-coded notices, which enable member countries to request specific types of information.The Red Notice seeks the location and arrest of individuals wanted for prosecution or to serve a sentence.The Yellow Notice focuses on locating missing persons, often minors, or identifying individuals who are unable to identify themselves.","Interpol issues its first-ever 'Silver Notice' aimed at tracking down laundered assets.

KAZIRANGA: In the face of opposition from anti-mega dam activists, Arunachal Pradesh water transport minister Ojing Tasing on Friday defended the state's decision to build an 11,000 MW hydroelectric project on the Siang river. Tasing said this dam - largest in North-East India - could serve as a protection if China releases excess water from its planned 60,000 MW dam, the world's largest, situated on the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet.Tasing told TOI that while power generation is a secondary consideration, the primary objectives are safeguarding the North-East from China's potential water-related threats and ensuring India's national security. He suggested that certain NGOs were encouraging local villagers to resist the Siang dam project.""If we don't construct our dam, what will be the impact on us if China uses its dam as a 'hydro bomb' on India?"" He claimed China's planned project would affect regions extending to Bengal, not just communities along the Siang river in Arunachal.He explained that the Siang dam's reservoir at Parong would hold nine billion cubic metres of water, potentially protecting northeastern states from excess water release from China. The minister prioritised national security over power generation and agriculture.Regarding the project's future, Tasing mentioned the upcoming finalisation of the project final report (PFR). He claimed that politically motivated NGOs were training social workers to oppose the dam project.","Arunachal Pradesh water transport minister Ojing Tasing defended the state's decision to build an 11,000 MW hydroelectric project on the Siang river.

Poll Will Genome Sequencing Data Impact Healthcare in India? No, It Will Take Time to Make a Difference Yes, It Offers Great Potential

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday released the genome sequencing data of 10,000 Indian nationals and said it will be a milestone in the field of biotechnology research .The Genome India Data , which represents the genetic diversity in the country, will be available to researchers at the Indian Biological Data Centre (IBDC) through managed access. ""I am confident this will be a milestone in the field of biotechnology research,"" Modi said in a video-recorded statement played out at the Genomics Data Conclave organised by the Department of Biotechnology.Modi said this national database will facilitate advancements in the treatment of genetic and infectious diseases, foster the development of new medications and precision medical techniques, and enable research into the lifestyles and habits of diverse communities.A genome is the complete set of DNA sequences in an organism and contains all the instructions required for that organism to function, including embryogenesis, growth, responding to the environment, and healing from disease. The primary aim of Genome India is to construct a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variations for India's population that will better capture our unique diversity. Launched in January 2020, its goal is to sequence 10,000 genomes from healthy Indian individuals spanning the length and breadth of the country.The Human Genome - the complete map of all 23 large DNA sequences (chromosomes) that encodes our species - comprises a total of around three billion base pairs contained within the nuclei of each of our cells.According to Martin Carkett and Alexander Honkala, experts in the field, while this sequence of base pairs is virtually identical in every human, differentiating us from, say, a chimpanzee or a mouse, there are nonetheless subtle differences in each of our individual genomes that make us unique. Whole-genome sequencing enables us to read a person's individual genome and, among other things, identify differences from the average human genome that are often associated with disorders and disease but can also be associated with other factors like disease resistance.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi released the genome sequencing data of 10,000 Indian nationals.

Poll What’s More Important in Diplomacy? Pursuing Neutrality Maintaining Alliances

NEW DELHI: While the Indian government has invited Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto to participate in the Republic Day celebrations as the chief guest, and an official announcement about his visit is expected any moment now, it would not like him to club his visit to India with a proposed visit by the president to Pakistan.Official sources have maintained for the past several weeks that Subianto will be the chief guest for the January 26 parade, but no official announcement has been made so far about the visit. Normally, the same announcement is made months in advance.Amid this delay in announcement, reports emerged in Pakistan media earlier this week that the president is likely to arrive in Islamabad on January 26 for a 3-day visit. India has encouraged foreign leaders in the recent past to not include Pakistan in their itinerary while travelling to India, and to dehyphenate their ties with the 2 countries.It is learnt that India has raised the issue diplomatically with Indonesia, hoping to dissuade Subianto from flying directly to Islamabad after the R-Day celebrations. The president hopping on a direct flight to Islamabad hours after the Indian military parade will be bad optics for India, given its troubled relationship with Pakistan over a range of issues, not least cross-border terrorism. Subianto had met the Pakistan PM, Shehbaz Sharif, in Egypt on the margins of a multilateral event in December and pledged to enhance economic cooperation between the two countries.With their common focus on political sovereignty, economic self- sufficiency and independent foreign policy, India and Indonesia have traditionally enjoyed strong ties. Indonesia has also emerged as India’s largest trading partner in the Asean region. During the state visit of then Indonesian President Joko Widodo in 2016, the two countries agreed to establish a Security Dialogue in order to develop a comprehensive action plan on security cooperation.Widodo was in India again in 2018 as one of the chief guests for the Republic Day parade, along with the leaders of 9 other Asean member-states.

Trudeau had alleged a possible involvement of Indian government agents in the murder, a claim India has consistently denied, calling it “absurd” and “motivated.”India has accused Canada of harbouring extremist and anti-India elements, including supporters of the Khalistan movement.Earlier, the ministry of external affairs stated that Canada had not provided any specific evidence or formal communication regarding the case, despite the arrests of Indian nationals in connection with Nijjar’s murder.The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) in British Columbia, which is handling the case, has accused the individuals of murder and conspiracy. However, Canadian authorities have not presented any evidence linking the accused to India, despite speculation in Canadian media.","Canada has refuted media reports which stated that the four Indian nationals accused of murdering Sikh Canadian Hardeep Singh Nijjar had been released from custody after the case against them fell apart.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Everything You Need to Know About the Monday Night Wars

Back in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, Vince McMahon led WWF (now WWE ) and Erich Bischoff’s WCW was engaged in an intense battle for ratings and viewership. This period of history is referred to as the Monday Night Wars . This was a battle of epic proportions between WWF’s flagship show, Monday Night Raw, and WCW’s Monday Nitro. It is often referred to as a sort of golden age in professional wrestling and is still referenced today.Continue reading to learn more about the Monday Night Wars.It all began when WCW decided to air their show, Monday Nitro during the same time slot as Monday Night Raw. As a result, fans had to choose which show they would rather watch. The aim of both companies was simple, they wanted to outdo their competition and run them out of the wrestling business. To achieve his goal, Eric Bischoff used Turner Broadcasting’s vast resources and gave ridiculous contracts to WWF’s biggest stars like Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, and more.WCW also introduced the nWo storyline which effectively blurred the lines between what was real and what was fake. Through this, WCW managed to beat RAW in ratings for 83 consecutive weeks. However, Vince McMahon had an ace up his sleeve. McMahon switched up his strategy and started to target teen and adult audiences with violent, sexual, and edgy content.This saw the birth of the Attitude Era that gave rise to stars like Stone Cold Steve Austin. WCW was able to sign a lot of WWF’s biggest stars but Vince McMahon just made more. WCW also made a major mistake when they gave away RAW’s pre-taped results. This move backfired massively as fans chose to tune into RAW to witness Mick Foley winning the WWF Championship.ALSO READ: Vince McMahon's Misconduct to Lita Edge Matt Triangle: WWE's Most Shocking Scandals that Left Fans in Disbelief Over time WCW ran itself into the ground by making poor financial and creative decisions. They milked their nWo storyline to the point where fans were exhausted by it. Furthermore, they offered ridiculous contracts to just about everyone and eventually ran out of money. This marked a massive win for Vince McMahon and WWE. McMahon’s bet on edgier content and the superior storytelling of his stars allowed him to run WCW out of business.The battle ended bitterly for Eric Bischoff as Vince McMahon acquired WCW on March 26, 2001. This might’ve been the stressful time of WWF’s existence, but it gave birth to everything that professional wrestling is today.",WWF and WCW were engaged in an intense battle for ratings and viewership.

Damian Lillard has joined Luka Doncic in voicing concerns about the growing pressure on young NBA players. He described the expectations placed on rookies and rising stars as problematic while reflecting on how early-career scrutiny can create unnecessary challenges. Doncic recently sparked this conversation, pointing out the unrealistic standards often imposed on newcomers. Lillard’s comments add weight to the debate, shedding light on how the league’s culture might be affecting its youngest talents. Both players are calling for greater patience and support from fans as these athletes transition into professional basketball.NBA stars Luka Doncic and Damian Lillard may play for different teams, but they share a concern about young basketball players. Both athletes have called out the growing pressure on young players, saying it strips away the joy of the game.The Dallas Mavericks’ standout guard Luka Doncic has started working on tackling the issue by launching the Luka Doncic Foundation . Its mission is to create a positive environment where kids can rediscover the fun in basketball.Damian Lillard who is now playing for the Milwaukee Bucks, has publicly supported Doncic’s efforts. Sharing the 25-year-old’s message on Instagram, Lillard wrote, “Big big facts. It’s a problem,” calling out the fairly common expectation for the young players. Lillard’s support for Doncic’s efforts is understandable as he has also taken the issue on his shoulder addressing these challenges through his own initiative, Formula Zero , a basketball camp launched in 2022.Back to Doncic’s praiseworthy efforts, the foundation has created a Youth Sports Council— a group of basketball legends and current stars. Members include Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol, and Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash alongside active players like Steph Curry and WNBA star Sabrina Ionescu. Additionally, Igor Kokoskov and NBA agent Bill Duffy have also joined the team.Lillard’s camp focuses on helping young players grow both on and off the court. Previously, he candidly reflected on the worrying trend as young athletes are prioritizing personal glory over team success. ""I never would have said that as a kid,"" Lillard said. ""I would have been like, 'I want to win a national championship.' It's just different. This camp is about changing that thought process.""Together, Doncic and Lillard are taking meaningful steps to shift the focus back to what matters most— teamwork and the joy of playing the game. Both the stars understand the inherent pressure from the expectation but as they believe, it has somewhat diminished the real basketball culture.
