DEHRADUN: On the occasion of the completion of four years of the Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami 's completing four years, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami spoke about the several achievements of his government, including the revision of the state's land law that restricts the sale of agricultural and horticulture in 11 districts.Of the 13 districts in Uttarakhand, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar districts have been exempted from the stringent amendments to the land law.Speaking to ANI, Dhami said that these stringent amendments to Uttarakhand's land law were in line with public sentiment. He added that the state government has introduced various legislation, including the anti-cheating law, which has become a model for the entire nation.""People had long-standing expectations about the land law. We have also implemented it. Be it anti-riot law, anti-conversion law to prevent religious conversion, or an encroachment removal campaign, in which we have so far cleared more than 6,500 acres of land from encroachment. The anti-cheating law has become a model for the entire country,"" Dhami said.Highlighting the efforts of the Uttarakhand government in combating corruption, CM Dhami said that his government has taken action against those who have engaged in corruption regardless of their ""position"".""Apart from this, we have taken major action against corruption. Earlier, people used to say that small fish are being caught, and big fish are being released. Today, along with small fish, big fish are also being caught. Those who are the crocodiles of corruption are also not being spared, regardless of their position,"" the CM said.In February, the state legislative assembly passed the Uttarakhand (Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Destruction and Land Reforms Act, 1950) (Amendment) Bill, 2025.At that time, Dhami had stated that the state government laid the foundation for land reforms in accordance with public sentiment. Work will be done continuously on land management and land reforms in future as well.The Uttarakhand government has remained committed to protecting the state's resources and lands from land mafias. The purpose for which people have bought land was not used but misused, Dhami said.The chief minister said that permission for purchase for agricultural and industrial purposes in the state was given at the collector level. ""It has now been abolished in 11 districts, and provision has been made to take decisions at the state government level only in Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar. The land transfer of more than 12.5 acres in the approved limit in favour of any person has been abolished in 11 districts and will be decided at the state government level only in Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar districts,"" CM Dhami said.He further added that an affidavit has been made mandatory for purchasing 250 square meters of land for residential projects. ""If the affidavit is found to be false, the land will be vested in the state government. Permission to purchase the thrust sector and notified Khasra number land under micro, small and medium industries, which was given at the collector level, will now be given at the state government level,"" he said.The chief minister stated that many significant changes have been introduced in the new law. He said that the government had also taken views from stakeholders in Gairsain. ""In these new provisions, the views of the people of the state have been taken, and suggestions have also been taken from everyone. Suggestions were also taken from the people in their districts at the District Magistrates and Tehsil levels of all the districts. This law has been made on the request of suggestions from everyone,"" he further said.The amendment covers land purchases outside municipal limits and excludes Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar districts. Another major change is that land bought for tourism, industry, and educational facilities will have a ceiling of 12.5 acres in the 11 districts.

From access to agency: Uplifting India’s marginalised,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-access-to-agency-uplifting-indias-marginalised/articleshow/122239110.cms,".

.

India’s empowerment journey is at a critical inflection point. While its developmental story often showcases soaring GDP figures and rising global stature, this progress masks a more complex reality. For millions on the margins, advancement remains a distant promise. Caste, gender, disability, religion, and sexuality frequently intersect, forging layers of exclusion that persist despite legislative guarantees.It’s in these invisible trenches that the real battle for empowerment is unfolding — quiet, yet transformational. At the heart of this shift is a recalibration of what empowerment means.No longer is it just about delivering benefits. As Nobel laureate Amartya Sen and feminist scholar Naila Kabeer argue, empowerment must expand people’s capabilities and life choices. That means not merely giving marginalisedcommunities access to goods and services, but enabling them to exercise voice, agency, and dignity.India has, in recent years, initiated an array of legal and policy instruments to address entrenched inequities. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (2016), Forest Rights Act (2006), and Transgender Persons Act (2019) are emblematic of this shift.Schemes like MGNREGA and the Ujjwala Yojana have brought work and clean fuel to rural doorsteps. Yet implementation reveals uneven outcomes, especially among Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and women with disabilities.Bihar’s Viklang Sashaktikaran Yojna and Telangana’s Aasara pension scheme are examples of state-level adaptations that attempt to bridge local gaps. Civil society networks like Wada Na Todo Abhiyan monitor and pressure govts to fulfil promises, adding a layer of accountability. Meanwhile, institutions such as NITI Aayog ’s SDG coordination centres are beginning to integrate community voices in planning and monitoring processes.But real change hinges on more than schemes. It requires systems that understand complexity. A tribal woman with a disability, for instance, doesn’t just need a wheelchair ramp. She needs coordinated entitlements, accessible communication, and community support that acknowledges the multi-layered nature of her exclusion.Corporate India, too, is stepping in with purpose. CSR is evolving beyond cheque-writing. Projects like ITC’s Mission Sunehra Kal, which has mobilised over 3.5 lakh women into self-help groups, or HUL’s Project Shakti, empowering over 1.3 lakh rural women with entrepreneurship and hygiene training, are crafting new templates for inclusive growth. Vedanta’s Nand Ghar and NTPC’s Girl Empowerment Mission are weaving nutrition, education, and health into holistic empowerment.These initiatives are not without limitations. Intersectional targeting is still nascent. While SC/ST inclusion has improved, a closer look reveals gaps in addressing compounded vulnerabilities—say, for transgender persons with disabilities or religious minorities in remote areas.CSR interventions must therefore move from outcome counting to impact mapping, using tools like storytelling, community audits, and life histories to understand what change looks like from the ground. International partnerships add momentum. UNDP-supported projects like the Gender Seal for Development are institutionalising gender equity across health systems and skilling programmes like SMILE.A major structural reform is the govt’s push for third-party evaluations of centrally-sponsored schemes, undertaken by the Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO). These assessments are unearthing the gaps and successes that often escape attention.The convergence of law, policy, civil society, and corporate commitment offers an unparalleled opportunity. But the real test lies in embedding intersectionality — in seeing the individual not just through one identity marker but through all that shapes their lived reality. Welfare delivery must give way to systems of recognition, redistribution, and representation.Only then will India’s growth story be truly inclusive, not just in charts and numbers, but in lives changed, voices heard, and futures reimagined.","India’s empowerment journey is at a critical inflection point.

Startups to giants: India rides the AI wave to sustainability,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/startups-to-giants-india-rides-the-ai-wave-to-sustainability/articleshow/122238919.cms,"India is fast becoming a global vanguard in marrying artificial intelligence (AI) with sustainable development. As the world faces mounting climate challenges, the country’s businesses, ranging from IT behemoths to climate-tech start-ups, are weaving AI into the fabric of their green goals, making India one of the most AI-active nations in sustainability initiatives.A striking 64% of Indian companies are now actively deploying AI to boost the impact of their sustainability efforts — the highest proportion among surveyed countries, according to IBM’s 2024 sustainability readiness study. This isn’t just a sign of technological enthusiasm, but of a maturing mindset that places environmental responsibility at the heart of corporate strategy.India’s journey is as much about economic transformation as it is about ecological conscience. In 2022–23, the digital economy accounted for nearly 12% of the national income, underlining the country’s success in harnessing tech for green growth.Take Infosys, for instance. The IT giant achieved carbon neutrality in 2020 — well ahead of global targets — by using AI and digital tools to drive energy efficiency, adopt renewables, and run offset projects that also benefit rural communities. The company was also the first Indian firm to join the RE100 initiative, committing to 100% renewable electricity.But it’s not just industry titans making waves. India’s climate-tech ecosystem now boasts over 800 operational start-ups, which have collectively raised more than $3.6 billion between 2014 and 2024.Among them is Alt Carbon, a venture leading the charge in carbon removal technologies. The company combines geochemical innovation, environmental data platforms, and scientific validation to sequester CO 2 through enhanced rock weathering and soil improvement on farmland. With its cutting-edge platform ‘Atlas’, Alt Carbon can monitor soil chemistry, water dynamics, and ecosystem health at high resolution, and aims to remove 5 million metric tons of CO 2 by 2030. AI and other emerging technologies like IoT (internet of things), 5G, and blockchain are transforming how Indian enterprises think about sustainability. From resource-efficient smart grids to traceable, ethical supply chains and real-time emissions monitoring, digital tools are offering tangible solutions to previously intractable problems.This momentum is also evident in platforms such as EY’s ESG Compass, which supports businesses in navigating ESG (Environmental, Social & Governance) goals through data automation, risk analytics, and benchmarking tools. Such solutions are helping organisations make more informed, sustainable decisions while increasing transparency for stakeholders.Yet, as PM Narendra Modi recently reminded the world at the AI Action Summit 2025, sustainable AI must not merely be powered by clean energy, but also be efficient by design—light on data, lean on compute power, and accessible to the broader developer community. “After all,” he said, “the human brain can compose poetry and design spaceships while using less power than most light bulbs.”Indeed, while AI tools are proving their worth, there are pressing concerns that must be addressed — particularly around data privacy, interoperability, and ethical design. Most current sustainability-driven AI tools focus on energy emissions during training, often ignoring emissions during the deployment and inference phases. Moreover, many are tailored for highly skilled developers, limiting access for users relying on APIs or nocode platforms.As The Times of India Social Impact Summit approaches, the conversation is expected to pivot around these very themes: how to scale tech-enabled ESG and CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) efforts, ensure inclusive adoption, and drive measurable impact.With diverse stakeholders converging, the summit presented by Malabar Gold & Diamonds — Ernst & Young is knowledge partner — aims to serve as a crucible for collaboration and future-ready sustainability solutions. It is being held on July 11 and 12, 2025, in Mumbai.",India is fast becoming a global vanguard in marrying artificial intelligence with sustainable development. 64% of Indian companies are now actively deploying AI to boost the impact of their sustainability efforts.

For the lower House, at least 100 MPs must endorse the proposal, while in the upper House, support from 50 MPs is required.

Donald Trump Predicts Major India-US Trade Deal With Lower Tariffs Before July 9 Deadline Ends

How US Trade Deal With Vietnam Will Hit China

World’s Trading Dilemma & China’s Warning

Challenge for China & Its Worry

US President Donald Trump’s trade policies, tariff wars, and moves to seal trade deals with major trading partners in Asia and Europe has China increasingly on the guard - and rightly so! These trade deals could potentially separate Chinese companies from global supply networks, despite the recently announced trade truce between the US and China.US officials are actively negotiating with key trading allies in Asia and Europe before July 9, seeking arrangements that could limit Chinese involvement and address what the US considers unfair trade practices by China.The temporary 90-day suspension by Trump on what he termed ""reciprocal"" tariffs affecting many US trading partners concludes on July 9. These countries risk facing substantially higher tariffs if they fail to establish trade agreements with the US.Many countries are taking steps to maintain positive relations with Washington. Since Trump's tariff announcement in April, Vietnam, Thailand and South Korea have implemented regulations to prevent product rerouting through their territories to the US.Also Read | What is Donald Trump’s net worth? Billionaire US President has a big portfolio of cryptocurrencies, stocks & more - top details South Korean authorities have intensified their efforts against transshipments, noting an increase in such activities. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te addressed this concern and subsequently introduced regulations requiring all US-destined exports to include legal certification of their Taiwanese origin.President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday a new tariff structure with Vietnam, marking the first such arrangement. According to Trump's social media announcement, Vietnamese exports to the US will face a 20% tariff, while goods identified as being transshipped through the country will incur a 40% charge.This arrangement will affect products containing Chinese components that are either minimally processed in Vietnam or simply routed through the country before reaching the US. This structure reflects similar provisions found in existing US trade agreements with Mexico and Canada.The complete details of the agreement remain undisclosed by the White House, with some aspects possibly still under development. The impact on China's increasing exports to Vietnam is yet to be determined. China's Ministry of Commerce has not yet provided a response to enquiries.India, which is reportedly close to finalising a deal, is discussing ""rules of origin"" requirements. The US is seeking a minimum of 60% local value addition for products to qualify as ""Made in India"" and receive benefits under the agreement. According to Bloomberg News, India is attempting to negotiate this requirement down to approximately 35%.The trade war predicament facing Asia centres on its dual reliance: needing US consumer markets while depending on Chinese manufacturing inputs, according to Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia-Pacific chief economist at Natixis SA. According to the Bloomberg report, in her recent analysis, she highlighted that Vietnam, Cambodia and Taiwan face particularly high exposure to this situation.Also Read | From ‘dead’ to ‘hottest in world’: Donald Trump calls ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ the path to US making a ‘fortune’; says America growing out of ‘Biden mess’ For most Asian economies, China represents a more significant trading relationship than the United States. Beijing has issued stern warnings about protecting its interests, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi expected to emphasise this position during his upcoming European diplomatic mission to Brussels, Germany and France.""China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of Chinese interests in exchange for so-called tariff reductions,"" said the Ministry of Commerce on Saturday, reiterating previous cautions. ""If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely counter it to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.""According to Bloomberg Economics, Vietnam's trade agreement could trigger retaliatory measures from China.""Beijing has signalled its intention to address arrangements that undermined Chinese interests, and the acceptance of increased tariffs on products 'transshipped' through Vietnam could be considered such a case,"" Bloomberg's Rana Sajedi noted in a research analysis.The United States' potential influence on other nations to strengthen or implement export restrictions on advanced technology poses a significant challenge for Beijing, particularly regarding its acquisition of essential semiconductor manufacturing equipment.In June, Taiwan expanded its restricted entities catalogue to include both Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., requiring Taiwanese companies to obtain governmental clearance before engaging in business transactions with these firms.The situation extends beyond Asian borders. Europe faces its own complexities in this matter. China's electric vehicle exports predominantly flow to the EU, whilst Chinese investments in the EU and UK reached 10 billion euros ($12 billion) in the previous year, as documented by Rhodium Group.Also Read | US plans ‘economic bunker buster’ bill: Will Donald Trump impose 500% tariff on countries importing oil from Russia? How it may impact India However, commercial relations are becoming strained. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has recently criticised Beijing for its approach to rare earths and magnets, whilst highlighting concerns about Chinese industrial surplus.The European Union's potential agreement with the US has raised significant concerns in Beijing, particularly regarding provisions similar to those in the British-American deal, which encompassed supply chain security, export regulations and ownership guidelines for industries including steel, aluminium and pharmaceuticals. Although China was not explicitly mentioned, Beijing issued an unusual public critique of the agreement, viewing it as a direct challenge, according to the Financial Times.""China is clearly worried that the EU will accept the same wording as the UK did on export controls,"" said Joerg Wuttke, a partner at the Albright Stonebridge Group in Washington and former president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China. ""They are pushing the EU not to do this, and the US is pushing the EU to do it.""The EU and US aim to establish an agreement before July 9, when American authorities plan to implement a 50 per cent tariff on virtually all European products. The EU considers the US relationship more vital, as European exports to America exceed twice the value of those to China, providing the US with substantial negotiating power.The primary challenge facing Beijing lies in the potential consolidation of these initiatives into a broader transformation - beyond US-led restrictions on Chinese exports to a fundamental restructuring of global commerce centred on 'trusted' supply networks, potentially marginalising China. During his Southeast Asian tour earlier this year, President Xi Jinping called for regional unity as an ""Asian family,"" cautioning against commercial fragmentation.Also Read | Not just Apple iPhones!

Following EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles last year, Beijing initiated anti-dumping investigations into European brandy, dairy and pork products. In 2023, it suspended Japanese seafood imports after perceiving criticism from G7 meetings in Japan. A diplomatic dispute with Australia in 2020 resulted in trade limitations affecting various commodities, including lobsters, wine and barley.""If some agreements explicitly list China as a target and show that some countries are cooperating or collaborating with the US to 'contain China,' then China will definitely respond,"" said Tu Xinquan, dean of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing and a former adviser to the Chinese Commerce Ministry.","US President Donald Trump’s trade policies, tariff wars, and moves to seal trade deals with major trading partners in Asia and Europe has China increasingly on the guard.

QRSAMs designed to intercept hostile fighters

NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Thursday gave preliminary nod to three major acquisition projects and seven smaller ones, collectively worth over Rs 1 lakh crore, ranging from specialised spy aircraft and advanced minesweepers to quick-reaction air defence missiles and underwater autonomous vessels.The biggest project to get “acceptance of necessity (AoN)”, which is just the first step in the long-winded procurement process, was for the indigenous construction of 12 mine countermeasure vessels (MCMVs) for around Rs 44,000 crore, which will take almost a decade, sources told TOI.These specialised warships, each with a displacement of 900-1,000 tonne, will be capable of detecting, tracking and destroying underwater mines laid by enemy forces to choke harbours and ports, disrupt shipping and maritime trade.They are crucial amid the expanding maritime collusiveness between China and Pakistan. At present, the Navy makes do with just “clip-on mine countermeasure suites” mounted on some ships to plug the major capability gap.The second big project was the Rs 36,000 crore procurement of the new quick reaction surface to air missile (QRSAM) systems developed by DRDO , with three regiments for the Army and three squadrons for the IAF.Overall, the Army Air Defence (AAD) has projected a requirement of 11 such regiments.These highly-mobile QRSAMs, designed to intercept hostile fighters, helicopters and drones at ranges up to 30 km, will add to the country’s existing multi-layered air defence network that played a crucial role under Operation Sindoor in thwarting multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles launched by Pakistan during the May 7-10 hostilities.The third major project was for three ISTAR (intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance) planes, designed to identify and help target high-value enemy targets on the ground with greater precision and accuracy by fighter jets and missiles, for around Rs 10,000 crore.These aircraft will be equipped with a wide array of indigenous sensors and systems developed by DRDO, like synthetic aperture radars, electro-optical and infrared sensors, for gathering “actionable intelligence” in real-time on enemy infrastructure, build-ups and movements.Another interesting project granted AoN was for semi-submersible autonomous vessels for ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) missions. They will be acquired under the ‘Make-II’ category project, where prototype development is funded by the industry.Two other naval projects included procurement, through competitive bidding, of super-rapid gun mounts (SRGMs), which are the main 76mm guns fitted on warships, and the DRDO-developed “processor-based moored mines” that detonate upon sensing an enemy warship’s acoustic, magnetic or pressure signature.AoNs were also accorded for procurement of armoured recovery vehicles, electronic warfare systems and the tri-Service integrated common inventory management system for better supply chain management, the MoD said.","The biggest project to get “acceptance of necessity (AoN)” was for the indigenous construction of 12 mine countermeasure vessels.

Poll Do you believe families should have the right to conduct multiple funerals for the same individual in cases of fragmented remains? Yes, it's their right to grieve. No, it should be limited to one.

AHMEDABAD: Six families of victims of the AI 171 crash on Thursday received a ""second set"" of remains from the Civil Hospital here. For some, this may mean a second funeral.These remains were from the 16 more found at the wreckage site in Meghaninagar during post-disaster operations; they were matched with DNA samples provided by kin.A consent form had been distributed among relatives of the deceased, including passengers, crew members, doctors, their relatives and local residents, sources close to the development said. ""The form sought permission to carry out the last rites of remains that may be found during further clearing of the spot or during medical analysis,"" an official said.The six families, all from different parts of Gujarat, including Anand, Nadiad, and Ahmedabad, had asked hospital authorities to approach them in case of a DNA match. ""It is rare for the same person to have more than one funeral, but in this case the families have the DNA match and certificate of handover of the mortal remains. Thus, there will be no issue even if there is more than one funeral for the remains,"" added the official.Of the remaining 10 victims, the families of nine have consented to the hospital carrying out the last rites, whereas a response from the family of one victim is awaited, said the sources.The sources added the new sets of remains are minuscule compared to the first. ""Some have part of the body, whereas some have one or more bones. Due to the nature of the crash, it is possible that victims' bodies underwent intense distress that may have caused fragmentation,"" an official associated with the process said.At June-end, Gujarat's health department put the air crash death toll at 260. The figure included 229 passengers and 12 crew members aboard the ill-fated flight, totalling 241. The remaining 19 people lost their lives on the ground.All mortal remains were sent to forensic laboratories for DNA matching with the existing record of relatives.","Six families of victims of the AI 171 crash on Thursday received a ""second set"" of remains.

Rijiju to represent India at Dalai Lama b'day event

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday firmly rejected China's claim that it has a decisive say in choosing the Dalai Lama's successor and asserted that the issue could be decided only in accordance with the wishes of the Tibetan spiritual leader and established Buddhist traditions.""The Dalai Lama's position is of immense importance, not just for Tibetans but for millions of his followers across the globe. The right to decide on his successor rests solely with him, in accordance with centuries-old Buddhist customs,"" parliamentary affairs and minorities minister Kiren Rijiju told reporters. He also dismissed as ""unwarranted interference"" China's objection to the Dalai Lama's announcement that he has ""exclusive authority"" in deciding who gets to succeed him.The response came after the 90-year-old spiritual head of the Gelug branch of Tibetan Buddhists, who has lived in exile in India since 1959, asserted that the institution of Dalai Lama would continue after his death, and that his successor would be chosen by the Gaden Phodrang Trust, a non-profit set up by him. The Dalai Lama had earlier said his successor would be from among his supporters based outside China: something that runs counter to Beijing's known desire to have one of its loyalists from Tibet anointed.""The Dalai Lama's reincarnation must follow the principles of domestic recognition, the 'Golden Urn' process, and approval by the central govt, in line with religious traditions and laws,"" the Chinese foreign ministry had said in response to the Dalai Lama's statement.With the Dalai Lama turning 90, the succession issue has gained urgency amid fragile India-China ties.The spat over reincarnation adds another layer to bilateral tensions that have persisted since the 2020 border clashes and China's recent diplomatic outreach to Pakistan.Kiren Rijiju, a Buddhist from Arunachal Pradesh, will visit Dharamshala along with his cabinet colleague and animal husbandry minister Lalan Singh, to represent Indian govt at the Dalai Lama's birthday celebrations.The question of succession has long been a sensitive subject for Beijing, which seeks to assert control over Tibetan Buddhism . It holds a grudge against India for its decision to offer shelter to the Dalai Lama when he fled Tibet in 1959. It has dubbed the Tibetan religious leader a ""splittist"". The Dalai Lama, with his saintly image and message of peace and a following that that includes Hollywood celebrities and members of global cultural elite, has been a thorn in China's side, fuelling its desire to reduce the institution of religious leadership of Tibetan Buddhists to an adjunct of the Communist dictatorship.In the 1990s, China controversially installed its own Panchen Lama after the mysterious disappearance of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the boy selected by the Dalai Lama for the second-most revered figure for Tibetan Buddhists. Panchen Lama has failed to gain acceptance among Tibetans, heightening fears of similar interference in the Dalai Lama's succession.","India rejects China's claim that it has a decisive say in choosing the Dalai Lama's successor.

He added that Sonia and Rahul Gandhi control Congress and wanted to get hold of Rs 2,000 crore instead of the said Rs 92 crore.As per the ED, Congress provided an interest-free loan of Rs 90 crore to AJL, which had assets worth Rs 2,000 crore, for a consideration of just Rs 50 lakh. This debt was allegedly converted into equity in YI's favour.""They deprived AJL's shareholders of their right. YI invested just Rs 50 lakh and got Rs 2,000 crore.

Calling the matter a little peculiar, the judge asked whether they should not also be made witnesses. ""The ED has not investigated the 1,000 shareholders. So will this trial go on without them being witnesses,"" the court asked.The ASG replied, ""The record speaks for itself. This is a classic case of money laundering.

Centre's pick & choose policy hits HC judge appointments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centres-pick-choose-policy-hits-hc-judge-appointments/articleshow/122237031.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Advocate Ramaswamy Neelakandan prepared for life as a high court judge by returning case files to clients after the CJI-led Supreme Court collegium on Jan 17, 2023, recommended to Union govt to appoint him, along with four other advocates, including L C Victoria Gowri, as judges of Madras high court.The Union govt appointed all of them as judges, except Neelakandan. Though names of the five advocates were sent by the SC collegium on the same day, the govt appointed them in batches - three on Feb 7, 2023, and the fourth on Feb 27, 2023.Neelakandan, who belongs to the OBC community, shares his fate with 28 other advocates, whose names were recommended to the govt by the collegium between Jan 2023 and April this year. The Centre's pick and choose policy has left them in suspense - whether to resume practice or keep waiting for the Centre's nod to become an HC judge.While Neelakandan's wait has stretched beyond 29 months, advocate Subhash Upadhyay, whose name was recommended by collegium on April 12, 2023, for judgeship in Uttarakhand HC, is waiting for his warrant of appointment for the last 26 months.Along with Upadhyay, the collegium had recommended names of three advocates and a judicial officer for appointment as judges of the HC. Only Upadhyay's name was left out. Like him, advocate Arun Kumar is awaiting action on collegium's May 9, 2023, recommendation for his appointment as Allahabad HC judge.On Oct 17, 2023, the collegium recommended the names of five advocates for appointment as judges of Madhya Pradesh HC. Among them, only advocate Amit Seth is still awaiting appointment.Of the 29 advocates still awaiting appointment as HC judges, five are women advocates. Among them, the one enduring the longest wait is advocate Shamima Jahan, whose name was recommended by the collegium on Jan 4, 2024, for appointment as a judge of Gauhati HC.Other women advocates sharing Jahan's fate are Sreeja Vijayalakshmi (name recommended on April 16, 2024), Tajal Vashi (Oct 15, 2024; Gujarat HC), Shwetasree Majumder (Aug 21, 2024; Delhi HC), and Sheetal Mirdha (March 5, 2025; Rajasthan HC).Despite successive chief justices, including the incumbent CJI B R Gavai, impressing upon the Union govt not to pick and choose from the list and avoid making staggered appointments from the same batch, the govt has not abandoned the practice which creates seniority issues in constitutional courts where merit and seniority are two crucial factors for career advancement.Interestingly, the collegium's recommendations for appointment of judges to Supreme Court have been speedily processed and implemented by the govt, in some cases the appointments have come through within three days of the recommendation.The collegium recommended to the govt on May 26 to appoint Justices N V Anjaria, Vijay Bishnoi and A S Chandurkar as judges of the SC. The three took oath as Supreme Court judges on May 30.On May 26, the collegium recommended appointments of chief justices to five HCs, transfers of four HC CJs and transfer and repatriation of 22 HC judges. More than a month later, govt is yet to give effect to the appointments and transfers of HC CJs and judges.","Ramaswamy Neelakandan, who belongs to the OBC community, shares his fate with 28 other advocates.

The technologies that foster satellite launch, ground station infrastructure and geospatial applications are expected to deepen industry participation, enable indigenisation and reduce dependency on foreign technologies.Two advanced inertial sensors — Laser Gyroscope and Ceramic Servo Accelerometer — developed by Isro’s inertial systems unit for potential use in satellite launch vehicles have been transferred to Hyderabad-based Zetatek Technologies, which has over 25 years of expertise in inertial navigation system (INS) testing, calibration and QA/QT equipment. Three technologies related to ground station operations — S/X/Ka tri-band dual circular polarised monopulse feed, tri-axis antenna control servo system and Ku/C/L and S Band Cassegrain feed — have been transferred to Avantel and Jisnu Communications, Hyderabad-based companies specialising in end-to-end communications solutions for space and defence platforms.These technologies, currently sourced from foreign vendors, will enable self-reliance in critical ground station infrastructure.Reacting to the development, IN-SPACe chairman Dr Pawan Goenka said, “Transfer of these technologies marks yet another significant step towards empowering the private sector to harness and commercialise space technologies. Isro has a flourishing repository of R&D in space technologies, and it is time we leverage that to the optimum to strengthen India’s space industrial ecosystem, and in that, industry-led innovation will play a key role. ”Further, two geospatial models developed by Ahmedabad-based Space Applications Centre of Isro for pest forewarning and semi-physical crop yield estimation were transferred to Ahmedabad-based Amnex Info Technologies, to be deployed in agricultural decision-making and crop protection. A compact, multi-parameter, portable bathymetry system developed by Isro’s National Remote Sensing Centre has been transferred to Jalkruti Water Solutions, Ahmedabad, to enable UAV-based integration for water resource monitoring.Further, Isro’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre’s ceramic-based flame-proof coating technology, which was originally developed for launch vehicle applications, has been acquired by Ramdev Chemicals, Ahmedabad, for wider industrial applications.","Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) facilitated the transfer of 10 state-of-the-art technologies developed by Isro to six Indian companies.

"After 'good' trials, roads min junks L1 bidding mode",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-good-trials-roads-min-junks-l1-bidding-mode/articleshow/122235845.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major policy change, all highway agencies under the road transport ministry, including the NHAI, will soon replace the least cost (L1) mode for bidding out works for preparing detailed project reports (DPRs) with highest technical score (T1) for companies.The agencies will fix cost for consultancy service (bid price) and companies will be selected on the basis of their technical competence and ratings based on their past performance.Officials said the experiment of only fixed cost and highest technical score for bidding out works in the NHAI has been ""good"" so far, since its introduction in Sept last year. TOI on Sept 8 had first reported this crucial change in bidding parameters. ""The new provision of rating of bidders and assigning 30% marks for technical score will further bring quality players to bid for projects,"" said a senior official.The policy change gains importance considering that there has been major deterioration in preparation of project reports after consultancy firms bagged projects quoting very low and unsustainable prices. Poor project preparation impacts quality of work and results in delay in implementation.In developed countries such as Japan and Australia, govt entities pay more attention and time to preparation for DPRs for perfect execution.Officials admitted that there have been several cases where the prices quoted for preparing DPRs was as low as Rs 70,000-Rs 80,000 per km. ""At such a low cost, no one can prepare a good DPR. Field surveys cost more than such quoted price. That was the trigger for fixing the cost, which approximately comes to Rs 4-5 lakh for one km of 4-6 lane highway. This is barely 0.5% of the overall project cost. In most other countries the payment made for DPR preparation is around 10% of project cost,"" an official said.He added that provisions have been made where companies that have key personnel from top 50 reputed technical institutes, such as IITs and NITs, will get a better score. ""So, the entire framework of technical score, including the marks for ratings, is aimed at getting serious and quality players to bid for DRP works,""an NHAI official said.","All highway agencies under the road transport ministry, including the NHAI, will soon replace the least cost (L1) mode for bidding out works for preparing detailed project reports.

NEW DELHI: Though Election Commission had specifically invited only party heads, along with another person authorised by the party head, for Wednesday's multi-party meeting sought by an AICC counsel to discuss the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral roll, just four of the 11 parties sent prior confirmation of their participation and only two had their party heads in attendance.No confirmation email for the July 2 meeting - offered by the poll panel in response to the June 30 letter from AICC counsel Omar Hoda seeking an ""urgent meeting"" on behalf of 10 parties - was received from the remaining seven parties, including Congress, DMK, TMC, Samajwadi Party, NCP-SP and JMM. Shiv Sena (UBT) was part of the 11-party INDIA delegation but was not mentioned in the AICC e-mail to EC.Congress, which later expressed unhappiness with EC's two-person invite limit, arrived at Nirvachan Sadan on Wednesday with a team of 6-7 members. However, it eventually honoured EC's call to restrict the nominees to two persons, choosing Abhishek Singhvi and Bihar PCC chief Rajesh Kumar to represent the party in the discussion.

"Tejas-Mk-1A roll out from Nashik this month, Astra firing likely in Aug: HAL CMD",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tejas-mk-1a-roll-out-from-nashik-this-month-astra-firing-likely-in-aug-hal-cmd/articleshow/122234157.cms,"HAL CMD DK Sunil

BENGALURU: Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) will roll out the first LCA Tejas Mk1A from its new Nashik production line by the end of July, with integration and test firing of the Astra air-to-air missile scheduled for early August, HAL CMD DK Sunil told TOI in an interview.The rollout from Nashik marks a key milestone in HAL’s efforts to scale up Tejas production, even as the programme works through engine supply constraints and indigenous radar integration delays. “The first aircraft from Nashik is already in final assembly and under testing. We expect the rollout in a month,” Sunil said, adding that while the current year may see three to four aircraft from Nashik, the plant has been built to support an annual output of eight.At present, HAL is operating two production lines in Bengaluru and has initiated the third at Nashik. A parallel private-sector supply chain — comprising VEM Technologies (centre fuselage), Alpha (rear fuselage), and L&T (wings) — is expected to contribute towards an additional six aircraft a year, eventually raising the overall production capacity to 30 aircraft annually.He said that despite engine supply delays from GE, HAL is pressing ahead with deliveries.“We have already built six aircraft which are ready and flying,” Sunil said. HAL expects to produce 12 aircraft this year, using available GE engines in rotation to carry out critical test flights. GE has assured delivery of 12 engines this year, with the second engine expected this month after only one had arrived by April.Integration of Astra missile, developed by DRDO, is scheduled for early August. “We need to have some of the other issues sorted out like the firing of the missile, the Astra missile, which we plan to do in August, early August,” he said.On radar integration, HAL faced criticism for opting to continue with the imported ELTA radar from Israel for all Tejas Mk1A fighters under the current contract, instead of switching midstream — from the 41st aircraft — to the indigenous Uttam AESA radar.Sunil clarified that 40 ELTA radars were contracted initially, with a plan to introduce Uttam from the 41st aircraft onwards. However, delays in certification of both the Uttam radar and associated electronic warfare (EW) suite, also being developed by DRDO, forced HAL’s hand.He noted that over the last three years, HAL has held several meetings with senior officials from DRDO and IAF, but the certification timelines have repeatedly slipped. “As a manufacturer, when we’re under pressure for not delivering, the risk becomes ours. If we wait and the systems still aren’t certified, we are left with no aircraft to hand over.”“There was a clear directive from DRDO headquarters in Feb 2024 that if certification is not achieved by year-end, HAL may proceed. That meeting and directive are on record. We waited until March this year, but when progress still hadn’t been made, we moved forward.”In response to persistent concerns from the Indian Air Force about unmet aircraft staff qualitative requirements (ASQRs), Sunil attributed the delays to legacy issues and dependency on various partners including ADA and DRDO. “Parallel efforts are underway to close these issues across multiple aircraft. It’s not that there’s no effort — it’s just that the closure needs to be more structured,” he said.HAL aims to deliver all 12 Tejas Mk1As scheduled for this year, with the full production ecosystem — including public and private lines — expected to reach a steady state of 30 aircraft annually from 2026-27.","HAL aims to deliver all 12 Tejas Mk1As scheduled for this year, with the full production ecosystem — including public and private lines — expected to reach a steady state of 30 aircraft annually from 2026-27.Integration of Astra missile, developed by DRDO, is scheduled for early August.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122234163,imgsize-748620,width-400,resizemode-4/122234163.jpg"

‘Biggest bill ever signed’: Donald Trump’s first comments after ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ passes US Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biggest-bill-ever-signed-donald-trumps-first-comments-after-big-beautiful-bill-passes-us-congress/articleshow/122238190.cms,"Donald Trump’s first comments after ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ passes US Congress

BREAKING: Trump To Sign Big Beautiful Bill On July 4; Watch Jeffries Stalling Vote For 8.45 Hours

Permanent tax cuts and SALT deduction hike

Big cuts to Medicaid

Food stamp program faces new restrictions

Tougher immigration and border security meeting

Green programs funds rollback

Tax breaks for tipped workers





House Republicans on Thursday passed ‘ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL’ in a 218-214 vote, clearing way for President Donald Trump’s signature, scheduled for July 4.“Our Party is UNITED like never before and our Country is hot,” Trump wrote on Truth Social moments after the vote, thanking Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and “all of the wonderful Republican Members of Congress who helped us deliver on our promises. ” The President added that Americans would soon be “richer, safer, and prouder than ever before” as the nation embarked on what he described as a “new Golden Age.”President Donald Trump was speaking at a rally at Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines, as he kicked off the celebrations for America’s upcoming 250th anniversary.He hailed the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” as a historic achievement. “There can be no better birthday present for America than the phenomenal victory just hours ago when Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill to make America great again,” he told a cheering crowd.Trump emphasized the bill’s economic impact, calling it “rocket fuel to an already strong Trump economy.” He also took aim at Democrats for their unanimous opposition, saying, “Not one Democrat voted for us. All of the things we’ve given, and they wouldn’t vote, all because they hate Trump.”Republican lawmakers are expected to join Trump at a White House 'signing celebration' on Friday at 4 pm (local time). Trump said, “Together we can do things that were not even imagined possible less than one year ago. We will keep working, and winning congratulations, America!”The “Big Beautiful Bill” delivers massive changes across tax, spending, and security policy.At its core, the legislation makes permanent the $4.5 trillion in tax cuts first enacted during Trump’s 2017 term and introduces new breaks, including the elimination of taxes on tips, one of Trump’s key campaign promises.On the spending side, it enacts $1.2 trillion in cuts, targeting Medicaid and food stamp programs by imposing stricter eligibility requirements, new work mandates for some parents and older adults, and reduced federal reimbursements to states. The bill also rolls back billions in tax credits for wind and solar energy, a move critics say will trigger major investment losses in the renewable sector.Additionally, it allocates $350 billion toward border security and immigration enforcement, including expanded deportation efforts, partially financed by new fees on immigrants. To accommodate the fiscal package, the bill raises the national debt ceiling by $5 trillion—a provision that drew pushback from some Republican lawmakers.Also read | Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' passed by House, President likely to sign it on July 4 ceremony The bill makes Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent and adds new tax breaks for overtime pay and tipped workers. It also increases the cap on state and local tax deductions (known as SALT) from $10,000 to $40,000 for five years. However, these tax cuts are expected to increase the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years.According to CBS News, the bill makes deep cuts to Medicaid, the government health program for low-income and disabled Americans. Nearly 12 million people could lose coverage due to new work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks.The bill also blocks Medicaid from covering gender transition treatments and providing care to undocumented immigrants in some states. To reduce state spending on Medicaid, the bill slowly lowers the amount states can raise through “provider taxes.” In response to concerns from GOP senators, the bill adds a $50 billion fund to help rural hospitals affected by these cuts.Food assistance also takes a hit. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps, will now require states to cover part of the costs if they have high error rates. The work requirement age will also be raised from 54 to 64 for able-bodied adults. Some states like Alaska and Hawaii can apply for waivers.On immigration, the bill provides over $46 billion for building the border wall, $45 billion to expand immigrant detention, and $30 billion to boost staffing and training at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It also introduces a $100 fee for asylum seekers — down from $1,000, which was rejected by the Senate parliamentarian.Another part of the bill targets clean energy. It ends tax credits for electric vehicles, home energy upgrades, and other green programs that were created under former President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. It also shuts down the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, though existing contracts will stay in place.The bill raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion to avoid a government default later this year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had warned that the US could run out of money by August unless Congress acted.There’s also a change to the child tax credit. Instead of dropping from $2,000 to $1,000 in 2026, the credit will permanently increase to $2,200 — lower than what was proposed earlier.Meanwhile, tipped workers will be able to deduct up to $25,000 in tip income from federal taxes, though this benefit phases out for higher-income earners.Trump celebrated the bill on social media and plans to promote it during a July 4 event in Des Moines, Iowa. Democrats, who voted unanimously against it, say the bill harms vulnerable Americans and helps the wealthy. They see it as a key issue to campaign on for the 2026 elections.","'Big Beautiful Bill' delivers massive changes across tax, spending, and security policy.

‘I couldn't support Elon Musk any longer…’: Tesla employee resigns after 7 years citing moral conflict with Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/i-couldnt-support-elon-musk-any-longer-tesla-employee-resigns-after-7-years-citing-moral-conflict-with-musk/articleshow/122188860.cms,"Tesla employee resigns after 7 years citing moral conflict with Musk

‘Tesla gave me a future’: Ex-employee on how the company transformed his life

Ex-Tesla employee quits due to Musk’s politics

An emotional exit after 7 years



Respect for the company, not the leadership

After seven years of working at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, former engineering technician Trae Cervantes has made the difficult decision to step away from the company, citing moral discomfort with CEO Elon Musk ’s recent actions. Cervantes, who began his career as a production associate in 2018, steadily advanced to an engineering technician role before formally resigning in March 2025. His departure was not spurred by workplace conditions or job dissatisfaction, but rather by a growing unease over Musk’s political involvement and public conduct.In an interview with Business Insider, Cervantes reflected on both the opportunities and challenges he experienced at Tesla. He joined the company during the high-demand ramp-up of the Model 3 production line and described his early days as physically taxing but professionally rewarding.“I started out on their production line for the Model 3 and I moved up from there,” Cervantes said. “When I started out, it was gruelling work. It was pushing heavy things up and down aisles. I was on my feet for 12 hours a day, but they also give you three to four days off a week to recover.”Tesla supported Cervantes' growth over the years, offering him access to professional development programs, including certifications in advanced manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma through local college partnerships.Cervantes credits Tesla with helping him build a career despite having no formal education or technical training before joining the company.“I was getting paid the most I'd ever gotten in my adult life,” he said. “No education, no real skills to speak of, and Tesla offered me opportunities to take charge of my life and grow my career.”He highlighted how the work culture at Tesla—particularly among peers and supervisors—was largely positive and focused on efficiency, learning, and advancement.“I stayed because they kept treating me well. I didn’t have a reason to leave for a long time,” Cervantes noted.However, Cervantes' sentiment toward the company began to shift as Musk became more active politically and made several high-profile public moves, including acquiring Twitter and engaging in voter-related controversies.“What I took issue with the most was the giveaway for prospective voters,” he said, referring to a public campaign Musk promoted. “It seemed so morally wrong. I didn't want to be associated with that.”The turning point for Cervantes came when Musk's public image, behaviour, and political commentary became more prominent in association with Tesla’s identity.“Last year, I started to be ashamed to tell people where I work,” he admitted.While Cervantes did not go into detail about every incident that caused concern, he made it clear that the cumulative effect of Musk’s public actions led him to feel ethically conflicted about remaining with the company.Cervantes decided to leave Tesla without securing another job. He described his final conversation with his supervisor as emotional and honest.“I have to leave. I can't do this anymore. It's getting to a point where I feel like I'm compromising myself morally by walking through those doors every day,” he recalled telling his manager.The decision was not taken lightly. “I’m not going to lie, I cried a little. Seven years is a long time, and Tesla wasn’t always a bad thing for me,” Cervantes shared.While Cervantes walked away from his position at Tesla, he was careful to clarify that his issue was not with the company’s workforce or its mission, but with its leadership.“There are plenty of good people at Tesla. I didn’t leave the place because of the company. I left because of the face of the company,” he stated, referring directly to Elon Musk.","Trae Cervantes worked as an engineering technician at Tesla's Gigafactory in Nevada for seven years.

What is the Einstein visa? How Melania Trump qualified for a visa reserved for Nobel-level talent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-einstein-visa-how-melania-trump-qualified-for-a-visa-reserved-for-nobel-level-talent/articleshow/122204926.cms,"

What is the EB-1 or 'Einstein' visa?

How did Melania Trump qualify for the Einstein visa?

The larger debate: Loopholes, privilege, and policy





When Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the “Einstein visa,” in 2001, it raised eyebrows and continues to stir debate. Reserved for individuals with “extraordinary ability” in fields such as science, arts, education, business, or athletics, the EB-1 green card is typically associated with Nobel laureates, Olympic medalists, or globally recognized experts. Melania, a Slovenian model at the time, was not widely known for groundbreaking accomplishments, prompting questions about how she met the high bar required. So, what exactly is the Einstein visa, and how did the former First Lady qualify for a program meant for the world’s best and brightest?The EB-1 visa is a US employment-based green card designed for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in specific fields, or who are recognized as outstanding professors, researchers, or multinational executives. Applicants must prove “sustained national or international acclaim” and either win a major international award (like a Nobel Prize) or meet at least three of ten criteria set by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). These include published work, media recognition, contributions to a field of major significance, or commanding a high salary compared to others in the same field.While the standards are rigorous, the process is subjective.Immigration officers ultimately decide if the evidence supports a claim of extraordinary ability. This subjectivity has sparked debate over how consistently the criteria are applied and who benefits most from its loopholes.Melania Trump, then known as Melania Knauss, was living in New York as a model when she applied for the EB-1 visa in 2000. It was approved the following year. Though she was featured in magazines and had some runway experience, she had not received prestigious modeling awards or reached the supermodel status typically associated with international acclaim. Critics argue her qualifications were modest compared to the visa's intent.Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett recently reignited the controversy, questioning whether Melania’s case truly exemplifies merit-based immigration. Her approval has drawn comparisons to other questionable EB-1 recipients, including Playboy models and niche artists who managed to craft narratives aligning with the visa’s requirements.Experts note that while the visa is often seen as exclusive, it can be awarded to applicants whose accomplishments, though not widely known, are well-documented and strategically framed within a narrow field. In Melania’s case, her successful petition may have emphasized uniqueness in her modeling niche, media presence, or professional trajectory.The EB-1 program, limited to around 40,000 visas annually, has been praised for attracting top global talent. But its subjective evaluation process has also made it vulnerable to exploitation. Legal experts and immigration attorneys admit that certain applicants with the right legal guidance can tailor their portfolios to meet the criteria, even without widely celebrated achievements.Adding to the irony, Melania later used her citizenship to sponsor her parents for green cards through “chain migration,” a policy her husband, Donald Trump, has publicly opposed. This contradiction has further politicized her immigration journey and raised broader questions about fairness, privilege, and transparency in the US immigration system.","Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the ‘Einstein visa,’ in 2001.

BENGALURU: For over a year, a bright red Ferrari zipped through Bengaluru's streets, turning heads — and raising eyebrows. On Thursday, its ride came to a brief halt near Lalbagh when transport officials flagged it for allegedly dodging Karnataka's lifetime tax.Registered in Maharashtra, the Rs 7.5 crore SF90 Stradale had been operating in the city well past the one-year limit allowed for out-of-state vehicles. The owner, a businessman, coughed up Rs 1.4 crore in tax and penalty on the same day to avoid having the car impounded.Acting on a tip-off, Jayanagar RTO officials began tracking a Ferrari that had been spotted frequently on Bengaluru's streets.

"Mumbai KEM Hospital: With 7k women, Mumbai’s KEM Hospital starts BMC’s largest and most expensive clinical trial for breast cancer diagnosis",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/with-7k-women-mumbais-kem-hospital-starts-bmcs-largest-and-most-expensive-clinical-trial-for-breast-cancer-diagnosis/articleshow/122234130.cms,"



Mumbai: KEM Hospital has started its largest and most expensive BMC-funded trials with 7,000 women aimed as participants, which will potentially change how breast cancer is diagnosed at the hospital. The trial, which will last for 12 to 28 months, involves a small, portable device with a high-resolution thermal sensor powered by artificial intelligence. The hospital has also started a dedicated 15-bed ward for all breast-related ailments, 14 years after starting the city's first breast clinic at a civic hospital.Unlike traditional mammography, the machine in trial involves no physical contact or breast compression, eliminating the discomfort associated with X-ray-based screening. During the procedure, the patient is alone in a private room, seated at a fixed distance from the thermal imaging device with curtains for privacy.The exact costs were unavailable until press time, but hospital officials said this is the largest BMC-funded trial. The machine, developed by Bangalore-based NIRAMAI Health Analytix, costs Rs 50 lakh and has taken up residence free of cost at KEM Hospital as part of a clinical validation under BMC's startup incubation programme.""We are moving forward with it only on the condition that the machine will remain at KEM Hospital if trials show favourable results,"" said Dr Shilpa Rao, associate professor at KEM's general surgery department, who is also the principal investigator for the trial.She added that thermal imaging has been around since the 2000s, but it detects any source of heat, including infections and inflammation, which can lead to false positives. ""This can result in unnecessary psychological distress and economic burden for patients,"" said Dr Rao.In this case, the machine uses AI to scan heat patterns on the chest, looking over 400,000 tiny temperature points to detect any unusual changes. The report comes back in 24 hours, and the algorithm produces a breast health score that tells doctors if it is malignant, benign, or requires further evaluation.Everyone taking part in the trial will get all three tests: a mammogram, an ultrasound, and the AI-powered scan. Doctors will then compare the results to see how well the new technology works.Dr Rao was also struggling to have a dedicated ward for breast treatment since 2010. ""Perhaps having a woman as a dean made the difference now,"" she said.KEM Dean Dr Sangeeta Ravat said, ""The issue is very close to my heart, and breast cancer patients need a special ward as they are already immunocompromised. There were some problems; it couldn't happen before, but now they have been resolved,"" she said.Dr Varsha Kulkarni, Department Head of General Surgery, who was instrumental in having the ward up and running, said, ""Women's health needs priority.""Mumbai: KEM Hospital has started its largest and most expensive BMC-funded trials with 7,000 women aimed as participants, which will potentially change how breast cancer is diagnosed at the hospital.

Microsoft’s middle management is the target in its second largest ever round of layoffs



Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees Wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year. The cuts, affecting less than 4% of Microsoft's global workforce, hit the Xbox gaming division particularly hard, with several high-profile game cancellations and studio closures announced alongside the layoffs.The job cuts span multiple teams across geographies and tenure levels as Microsoft seeks to streamline operations and reduce management layers. The company cited ""organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace"" as the primary driver for the workforce reduction.The layoffs eliminated hundreds of positions across Microsoft's gaming subsidiaries, including King (makers of Candy Crush), ZeniMax, Raven Software, Sledgehammer Games, Halo Studios, and Turn 10 Studios. Microsoft also shuttered The Initiative studio and canceled the highly anticipated Perfect Dark reboot and fantasy game Everwild after years of development.Microsoft's Stockholm-based King division is cutting 10% of its workforce, eliminating approximately 200 positions. The Initiative, a premium Xbox studio established to develop AAA exclusives, will close entirely following the Perfect Dark cancellation . Rare Studio's Everwild, in development for several years, was also terminated alongside ZeniMax Online Studios' unannounced project.""To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business,"" Xbox CEO Phil Spencer told employees in an internal memo. The gaming division employed about 20,000 people as of January 2024.The latest cuts represent Microsoft's fourth mass layoff in the gaming division within 18 months, following the company's $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition in October 2023. Microsoft previously eliminated 6,000 positions in May, targeting product and engineering roles, plus an additional 300 workers in June.The company cited the need to ""remove layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness"" while redirecting resources toward artificial intelligence development. Microsoft's AI-related expenses reached approximately $80 billion in the last fiscal year as it competes in the generative AI market.“We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the spokesperson said.Affected employees will receive severance packages including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources, with priority consideration for other positions within Microsoft's broader organization.","Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees Wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year.

Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan may be planning this 'big change' in company's chip manufacturing business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-may-be-planning-this-big-change-in-companys-chip-manufacturing-business/articleshow/122214957.cms,"Why Intel’s new CEO may not be ‘happy’ with chipmaking process promoted by ex-chief



Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers. This potential shift deviates from his predecessor's plans and could involve substantial investment. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, two sources familiar with the matter revealed that this new strategy for Intel's foundry business would involve offering outside customers a newer generation of technology. Analysts also reportedly believe that this next-generation chipmaking process would position Intel more competitively against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) in securing large clients like Apple or Nvidia.After taking over as the company’s new CEO in March, Tan has been reassessing the company's investment in its 18A chip manufacturing process, which was promoted by former CEO Pat Gelsinger .The Reuters report cited sources to claim that Tan has expressed concerns that 18A is not attracting enough external clients and may result in a major financial write-off if Intel stops marketing it to new customers. Intel has already spent billions on developing 18A and its variant, 18A-P.While Intel continues using 18A for in-house chips and select commitments to companies like Amazon and Microsoft , Tan may be shifting focus to the 14A process, the Reuters report claims.Intel believes 14A could offer a stronger competitive position against Taiwan-based rival TSMC, whose N2 and N3 technologies are already in production or close to it, the report adds.As per the Reuters report, Tan is expected to present strategic options to Intel’s board, potentially by this month. However, a final decision may not come until later in the year due to the high stakes involved.Meanwhile, Intel continues restructuring under Tan’s leadership, with steps including new engineering hires and streamlined management. Last year, Intel posted a net loss of $18.8 billion, which was its first unprofitable year since 1986, as it works to regain ground lost in past tech transitions.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers.

VASAI: Constables Rajesh Mahajan and Shyam Shinde have been suspended by the MBVV commissionerate after they were arrested by the Achole cops on Wednesday on the charges of abetment of suicide and criminal intimidation.They have been accused to driving a developer to suicide after threatening him to give-up his building project which was financed by them. They had given around 33 lakhs to the deceased Jaiprakash Chauhan who committed suicide blaming these two cops.Chauhan was so stressed with the harassment of these two cops that, as per his family, he was staying at a different flat for the last week or so. Another accused Lala Lajpat who is a broker has also been arrested in this case.

Asian markets showed mixed movement on Friday as investors treaded carefully ahead of a looming US tariff deadline set by President Donald Trump. The uncertainty overshadowed positive cues from Wall Street, where a strong US jobs report lifted major indexes to record highs.Trump told reporters Thursday that he planned to begin sending letters to trading partners detailing new tariffs, as his July 9 deadline approaches. “My inclination is to send a letter out and say what tariff they're going to be paying,” he said, adding that letters could start going out “probably tomorrow, maybe 10 a day.”The move follows his sweeping announcement of new levies on “Liberation Day” in early April, sparking a global rush for trade deals to avoid the tariffs. So far, only Britain and Vietnam have signed agreements, while China has reached a framework deal with Washington to reduce mutual tariffs and ease restrictions on some goods.As negotiations continue, investors worry that countries like Japan, South Korea, India, and Taiwan could soon face higher tariffs. The uncertainty weighed on markets across Asia. Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Wellington, and Jakarta posted small gains, while Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, and Manila ended lower.Despite these concerns, Wall Street closed strong ahead of the US Independence Day holiday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit fresh record highs after US jobs data showed the economy added 147,000 jobs in June, above expectations, while unemployment fell to 4.1%.However, the upbeat headline figures masked underlying weakness, analysts warned. MUFG said hiring in the private sector appeared to be stalling, with more than 750,000 people having exited the labor force over the past two months. ""We continue to view labour demand as being fundamentally weak relative to the past several years,"" they noted.The labor data reduced expectations of a July interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Markets are now pricing in two rate cuts by year-end, the first likely in September.Meanwhile, the passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which extends major tax and spending cuts, added to market confusion. While the legislation includes a $5 trillion debt limit increase, preventing a potential US default, it is also projected to add $3 trillion to the national debt.","Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Wellington, and Jakarta posted small gains.

What does Mamdani own now?







Democratic socialist, and Trump-labelled “communist”, Zohran Mamdani is drawing fresh attention for his family’s property ties, including his mother Mira Nair ’s long-held $2 million Chelsea loft where his political journey quietly began.The New York City mayoral candidate has shaped his political identity around pledges to overhaul the city's housing system, pushing for rent freezes, tax changes, and shifting resources from wealthier, predominantly white neighborhoods to lower-income areas in the outer boroughs.Award-winning filmmaker Mira Nair, known for acclaimed works like 'Monsoon Wedding, Salaam Bombay, and The Namesake', owned a luxury loft in Manhattan’s West Chelsea for over a decade, the New York Post reported.During the years Nair owned the high-end property, her son Mamdani was beginning to build his political career, one that would focus on calls to shift property tax burdens from outer-borough homeowners onto Manhattan’s wealthiest neighborhoods.The loft featured 12-foot ceilings, a sleek Schiffini kitchen, and a spa-like en-suite bathroom with a double glass shower.She bought the corner unit at 420 W 25th St in 2008 for $1.375 million.Nair sold the apartment in 2019 for $1.45 million, according to the NY Post.The 33-year-old now lives in a rent-stabilized one-bedroom apartment in Queens. Comparable units in the area typically rent for around $2,500 per month. In addition to his Queens residence, Mamdani owns a 4-acre plot of land in Uganda, where he was born and lived until he was 7.The Ugandan property, which he purchased in 2012, is valued between $150,000 and $250,000, according to his 2024 financial disclosure filed with the New York Legislative Ethics Commission, according to the NY Post.","Zohran Mamdani's mother Mira Nair owned a luxury loft in Manhattan's West Chelsea for over a decade.

Even while trading within this range the market is resilient. This resilience is supported externally by the strength of the mother market US where S&P 500 and Nasdaq are at record highs and domestically by the strong and sustained flows into the market, which has made DIIs sustained buyers in the market.The cap to the upside of the range is put by the tepid earnings growth and expectations of modest earnings growth in FY26. Investors should watch for possible changes in the earnings growth trajectory, the indications of which will be available in the Q1 results, which will start coming soon.Outperformances in results are likely to be company-specific rather than sector-specific. For instance autos are likely to report modest numbers, but TVS, Eicher and M&M can deliver better than industry numbers. Similarly in financials Bajaj Finance and Sriram Finance may outperform. Therefore, market action is likely to be stock-specific.""US stock indices reached new highs on Thursday, driven by Nvidia's approach towards $4 trillion valuation and robust US employment data.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
