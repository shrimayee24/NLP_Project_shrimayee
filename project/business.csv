Marks end of

right to work

, say activists

New Delhi: Protesting the impending repeal of MGNREGA, social rights activists Nikhil Dey and Aruna Roy said “VB-G RAM G” will mark the end of the “right to work” since the job scheme provided every needy poor with a fall-back employment security. Dey said the proposed bill is insidious as the Centre has given itself the power to determine where to implement the scheme under section 5(1), which is in line with the recommendations of some so-called expert committees that the scheme be operated only in a limited number of blocks.NREGA Sangharsh Morcha, a collective of job scheme activist bodies, including Jean Dreze, dubbed the proposed new scheme as “not a reform but a rollback of democratic and constitutional guarantees won by workers through decades of sustained struggle...the GOI is seeking to dismantle a historic rights-based legislation.”Dey, Roy and Dreze, all members of Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council which served as an influential policy body during UPA govt’s decade-long run, had a key role in designing MGNREGA.According to Dey and Roy, states will not be willing to shoulder the burden of 40% expenditure, which will essentially mark the end of MGNREGA, and badly hurt the poor who depend on the programme for survival.“States are starved for resources, and will be reluctant to implement the scheme. The reason MGNREGA worked was because Centre did not depend on states for funds,” they argued.Sounding catastrophic, Dey said the job scheme saved the country by helping poor during all major crises. “In all economic distress, including the global crash of 2008 and Covid, it allowed rural poor India to survive. It is something that all the governments will have to turn to in times of crises because it provides a framework that allows you to reach all the citizens,” he said.Dey said, “MGNREGA covered entire country. It allowed self-selection of those who wanted to work, as against ‘BPL framework’ which suffered from issues of inclusion and exclusion of beneficiaries.”Activists Nikhil Dey and Aruna Roy said VB-G RAM G will mark the end of the “right to work”.

‘Deity’s sleep & rest being disturbed?’

New Delhi: More than a decade after declaring sleep as part of right to life, Supreme Court on Monday agreed to adjudicate whether the new schedule extending ‘darshan’ time for devotees at Banke Bihari temple at Vrindavan disturbed the traditional sleep and rest periods of the main deity.Appearing for the Banke Bihariji Temple Management Committee, senior advocate Shyam Divan complained to a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that the SC-appointed high powered committee (HPC) has altered the strict summer and winter temple opening times followed since time immemorial.He said between Holi and Diwali, the temple opened between 7.45 am to 12 noon and in the evening from 5.30 pm to 9.30 pm, which has been changed by HPC to 7 am to 12.30 pm in the morning and 4.15 pm to 9.30 pm in the evening. The temple opening timings between Diwali and Holi were 8.45 am to 1 pm in the morning and 4.30 pm to 9.30 pm in the evening, which have been changed to 8 am to 1.30 pm in the morning and 4 pm to 9 pm in the evening.“The change in the temple timing has consequently led to change in the timing of the internal rituals which are performed inside the temple including the ritual when the deity wakes up in the morning and when the deity sleeps at night,” Divan said.The temple committee said the HPC’s Sep 19 decision has resulted in altering the deity’s centuries-old sleep and wake up timings. “The sleep and wake-up timings are wedded to tradition and cannot be interfered with in the name of providing darshan to more devotees,” Divan said.The bench said many devotees have complained that in the name of the pre and post-sleep and wakeup rituals, the goswamis put a curtain and allow the rich and influential to offer obeisance to the deities. “What is the harm in extending the darshan time by a couple of hours daily to facilitate more devotees to get darshan,” the bench asked.However, the bench agreed to examine this issue and sought responses of the HPC led by a retired Allahabad HC judge through its member secretary in Mathura district collector, Mathura-Vrindavan Development Authority and the UP govt. It posted further hearings to the first week of Jan.More than a decade after declaring sleep part of right to life, SC Monday agreed to adjudicate whether the schedule extending ‘darshan’ time for devotees at Banke Bihari temple at Vrindavan disturbed the sleep & rest periods of the main deity.",Supreme Court agreed to adjudicate whether the new schedule extending ‘darshan’ time for devotees at Banke Bihari temple at Vrindavan disturbed the traditional sleep and rest periods of the main deity.

"Test eggs for banned antibiotics, orders FSSAI after nitrofurans row",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/test-eggs-for-banned-antibiotics-orders-fssai-after-nitrofurans-row/articleshow/125993350.cms,".

New Delhi: The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) on Monday directed its regional offices across the country to collect samples of both branded and unbranded eggs and send them to 10 laboratories for testing to check for the presence of nitrofurans residues.The move follows a controversy over the quality of eggs sold by popular brand Eggoz, with reports raising concerns about possible traces of nitrofurans — a group of antibiotics banned for use in food-producing animals. Health authorities say the fact that residues can still enter eggs if such drugs are used illegally in poultry farming is what has prompted the nationwide sampling exercise.The issue surfaced after an online report flagged concerns over egg quality, triggering public debate and regulatory scrutiny. In response, Eggoz issued a statement maintaining that its products are safe.“As promised, the latest lab reports of Eggoz egg samples (Dec 25) are available, and we are sharing them openly for everyone’s reference at www.eggoz.com. At Eggoz, the safety and trust of our consumers mean everything to us. Thank you for your patience and for giving us the opportunity to clarify the facts. We will continue to uphold the highest standards across our farms and processes,” the egg distributors said in a statement on X.According to information shared by the company, the lab reports indicate that the samples tested were free from banned antibiotics, pesticides and drugs, with results marked “BLQ” — below the limit of quantification — for the substances tested.Medical experts, however, say the wider issue of antibiotic misuse in poultry remains a serious public health concern. Prof Chintamani, chairman, surgical oncology at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said nitrofurans are banned worldwide because their residues can persist in eggs even after cooking. Long-term consumption of contaminated eggs has been linked in animal studies to genetic damage and increased cancer risk, besides potential harm to the liver and kidneys.",The move follows a controversy over the quality of eggs sold by popular brand Eggoz.

"Anti-dowry laws suffer from ineffectiveness, misuse: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/anti-dowry-laws-suffer-from-ineffectiveness-misuse-sc/articleshow/125993332.cms,".

New Delhi: Noting that the social evil of dowry still prevails showing the ineffectiveness of the anti-dowry laws and at the same time the law is being misused by women for ulterior motives, Supreme Court Monday said this contradiction needed to be resolved as it is creating judicial tension.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol & N K Singh highlighted this issue while convicting a man and his 94-year old mother in dowry death case when a 20-year old girl burnt to death in 2001 for not fulfilling the demand for a colour television, a motorcycle and Rs 15,000 cash. Bringing the curtain down on the case after almost a quarter of century, the court awarded life imprisonment to the husband but refrained from incarcerating the mother considering her old age.The bench expressed concern over delay in deciding the case and passed a series of directions for social measures to tackle the menace of dowry by spreading awareness among youth as the law had been ineffective in curbing the practice.“While on the one hand, the law suffers from ineffectiveness and so, the malpractice of dowry remains rampant, on the other hand, the provisions of this (Dowry Prohibition) Act have also been used to ventilate ulterior motives along with Section 498-A, IPC.This oscillation between ineffectiveness and misuse creates a judicial tension which needs urgent resolution. While this urgent resolution cannot be stressed upon enough, at the same time it is necessary to be recognised that particularly when it comes to the giving and taking of dowry, this practice unfortunately has deep roots in society, hence, it not being a matter of swift change, instead needs concentrated effort on part of all the involved parties, be it legislature, law enforcement, judiciary, civil society organisations etc,” the bench said.In this case a 20-year old Nasrin was set on fire by pouring kerosene oil on her and she died within a year of her marriage. The trial court convicted both her husband and mother-in-law but Allahabad HC set aside the conviction and acquitted them. The HC decision was based on one part of the deceased father’s statement in which she said that his daughter was happily married.Setting aside HC order and convicting both the accused, SC said, “When the harassment for dowry is proved and so is the fact that such harassment was made soon before her death, then a mere statement of one of the witnesses that she was apparently happy, would not save the Respondents from guilt”.“The HC appears to have been misdirected by the use of the word ‘happily’, at least insofar as the testimony of PW1 (father) is concerned. Reading the entire statement as extracted herein above, clearly establishes that the deceased went back to her matrimonial home having been persuaded and assured by her father. He also states that she had been assaulted and dowry had been demanded from her. Therefore, the use of one word does not colour the entire tenor of the evidence. The sum of the evidence is to be understood, taking into account all aspects testified to therein,” the bench said.As the present case took 24 years to be concluded, SC said there would be many such similar cases and requested all high courts to take stock of the situation, ascertain the number of cases pending dealing with Section 304-B, 498-A from the earliest to the latest for expeditious disposal.","A 20-year old girl burnt to death in 2001 for not fulfilling the demand for a colour television, a motorcycle and Rs 15,000 cash.

AQI Severe-Plus, Delhi’s Worst In More Than 1 Yr

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement, while the region continued to grapple with toxic air quality in the ‘severe-plus’ category. The deteriorating weather and pollution conditions also impacted air travel, prompting IndiGo Airlines to issue a travel advisory warning passengers of possible delays and urging them to plan their journeys with extra caution.Amid changing weather conditions, IndiGo Airlines on Monday issued a travel advisory for passengers as Delhi witnessed the first signs of winter fog this season, impacting visibility at the airport.In its advisory, the airline said visibility levels around the airport were currently reduced, and as a result, flight operations were being adjusted, with some departures likely to take longer than usual. IndiGo assured passengers that its teams remain available to provide support, acknowledging that travel plans, schedules, and connections are important.The airline also cautioned that road traffic could be slower due to foggy conditions and advised passengers to plan their journeys accordingly and allow additional time to reach the airport.IndiGo said it is closely monitoring the situation and will keep passengers informed, adding that departures will continue as conditions improve, with safety remaining the top priority.Similarly Air India issued a travel advisory for passengers; it said, ""Poor visibility due to dense fog is impacting flight operations in Delhi and parts of Northern India. Please check your flight status at: http://airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html before heading to the airport.""Earlier on Sunday, Delhiites could literally see poison in the air. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to 'severe-plus' category for the first time this year.The city's 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec - 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.On Sunday, atmospheric ‘inversion’ made the situation worse. This occurs when cooler air near the ground gets trapped under warmer air above, stopping pollutants from dispersing. Though meteorological conditions remained unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, local emissions continued to remain high.“This is a true depiction of Delhi’s local emissions because wind speeds are almost zero, meaning there is hardly any inflow or outflow of air. Vertical ventilation is confined to a column of just 600 metres, which means whatever remains in the box — Delhi — is largely its own emissions. Under these conditions, the contribution of dust is negligible. When dust is released from construction activity, it usually spreads to other areas due to wind, but with winds nearly calm, it cannot pollute places beyond the immediate site of release,” said Gufran Beig, founder of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and Chair Professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS).Of the total 39 active air quality monitoring stations, 38 saw ‘severe’ AQI while only Shadipur was placed in the ‘very poor’ category at 375. Of these, three stations — Wazirpur, Rohini and Ashok Vihar — maxed out at 500, while several others reported AQI above 490.This is the second spell of severe air days in Delhi this season. The city had recorded three consecutive severe days from Nov 11 to 13. In this winter season, the city has recorded five such days, when AQI surpassed 400.After air quality started rapidly deteriorating on Saturday, the Graded Response Action Plan’s stage III was imposed in the morning. Stage IV was invoked on Saturday evening as AQI showed no sign of improvement. Currently, all stages of GRAP are in force.Delhi’s highest-ever AQI of 497 was recorded on Nov 6, 2016. The second-worst air quality day followed on Nov 18 last year with AQI reaching 494.Experts said since winds are likely to rise only marginally post-noon, no significant respite from toxic air quality is expected on Monday. However, the Centre’s Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) stated that the AQI may dip to ‘very poor’ on Monday. “Delhi’s air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category from Dec 15 till 17. The outlook for the subsequent six days from Dec 18 is that AQI is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category,” said the EWS.The CPCB classifies AQI 050 as 'good', 51-100 as 'satisfactory', 101-200 as 'moderate', 201300 as 'poor', 301-400 as 'very poor', 401-450 as 'severe', and 451 and above as ‘severe plus.’ Meanwhile, the lowest visibility on Sunday morning was recorded at 200 metres at Safdarjung. It was 350 metres at Palam. “Safdarjung reported 300 metres at 5.30am but calm winds further reduced the visibility to 200 metres at 8am,” said a Met official.India Meteorological Department measures fog in terms of visibility. Visibility between 500-1,000 metres is considered ‘shallow’ fog. Fog is 'moderate' when visibility is between 200-500 metres, and ‘dense’ below 200 metres.The maximum temperature was recorded at 24 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The minimum stood at 8.2 degrees C. IMD has predicted shallow to moderate fog in the early hours of Monday.","A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement.

NEW DELHI: Flight operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport were severely disrupted on Monday as dense fog and low visibility led to the cancellation of around 228 flights, with five others diverted, airport authorities said.According to Delhi Airport, the cancellations included 131 departing flights and 97 arriving flights, as visibility levels dropped sharply across the national capital during the early hours of the day.Flight operations are currently being conducted under CAT III conditions, which allow aircraft to land in extremely low visibility but often result in delays and cancellations.Earlier in the day, the ministry of civil aviation issued a travel advisory, urging passengers to check the latest flight status with their airlines before heading to the airport.In a post on X, the ministry said Air Traffic Control and ground teams were “working tirelessly” to minimise disruption, while emphasising that passenger safety remained the top priority.""Heavy Fog Alert for Northern India. Delhi (DEL) & other airports in Northern India are experiencing dense fog, severely affecting visibility.For Passengers: Before heading to the airport, please check the latest flight status with your airline.Check flight information on the airport website/app. Please allow extra travel time,"" civil aviation ministry said.""Safety is our top priority.

Air India similarly advised passengers to verify flight status before travelling to the airport.The disruption came as Delhi remained shrouded in thick smog and fog, sharply reducing visibility and worsening air quality. The city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) remained in the ‘severe’ category, with readings reported as high as 498, close to the maximum possible level of 500.Several monitoring stations recorded ‘severe’ air quality, with residents complaining of breathlessness, low visibility and heightened health risks.Pollution levels had worsened from Sunday, when the AQI climbed to 461, marking Delhi’s most polluted day this winter and the second-worst December air quality day on record. Weather officials warned that poor visibility and air quality conditions were likely to persist in the coming days.Authorities have advised residents, especially children, the elderly and those with respiratory ailments, to take necessary precautions as the capital continues to battle extreme pollution and fog-related disruptions.","Flight operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport were severely disrupted on Monday as dense fog and low visibility led to the cancellation of around 228 flights.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army on Monday showcased a Turkish-made drone that was brought down by the Indian forces on May 10, the final day of the four-day conflict with Pakistan.The reconstructed, armed Yiiha drone was displayed at an event hosted by army chief, General Upendra Dwivedi, on the eve of the 54th Vijay Diwas, commemorating India’s decisive victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war.The Yiiha, a kamikaze-class drone displayed at the event, was flying at an altitude of around 2,000 metres on May 10. Launched from Lahore International Airport, its intended target was Jalandhar, according to military officials.The unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), carrying a 10-kg explosive payload, was brought down by the Army Air Defence (AAD). Remotely operated, it was designed to detonate on impact.The UCAV has a wingspan of about two metres and is powered by a two-stroke engine with a capacity of 170 cc.Kamikaze-class drones, also known as “suicide drones,” are weapon systems designed to loiter over a target area, searching for a suitable target before carrying out an attack.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, carrying out air strikes on terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. It was followed by four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions, following a ceasefire request by Islamabad.Pakistan used a large number of Yiha single-use attack UCAVs to target various Indian military and civilian installations during the conflict.Almost all the Pakistani drones were shot down by the Indian military.","The reconstructed, armed Yiiha drone was displayed at an event hosted by army chief, General Upendra Dwivedi, on the eve of the 54th Vijay Diwas.

BSF IG Warns Of Looming Threat As 120 Terrorists Wait In PoK Despite Dip In Infiltration Attempts

NEW DELHI: Intelligence agencies are alarmed and closely monitoring the expansion of terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK). Satellite imagery and photographs reveal the construction of a new ""dual-use facility"" in the Neelum Valley district.Since November, LeT accelerated the infrastructure build-up of the new centre, named ""Jamia Masjid Ibn Taymiyah wa Markaz,"" being erected in the Sharda area. This facility, sources said, was explicitly designed to function simultaneously as both a religious structure and a command-and-control centre for terrorist activities, raising acute concerns about the deepening entrenchment of terrorist operations in the region.""The project's operational significance was underscored by the recent visit and inspection of the Neelum Valley site by Rizwan Hanif, the Deputy of LeT's PoK unit,"" the source added. According to intelligence sources, this facility is one of four major Markaz (centres) currently under construction by LeT across PoK, with others planned for DhirKot, Bagh; Khaigala, Rawalakot; and Palandri, Sudhanoti.These parallel projects signal a coordinated effort by LeT to dramatically expand its logistical and ideological footprint across the territory while shifting a major chunk of its resources to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.The strategy is to create multiple small infrastructures instead of a massive centralised Markaz. Rawalakot has emerged as another major construction hub for terror infrastructure. Many launchpads here were destroyed by the Indian Army in Operation Sindoor.LeT is now readying terrorist launch pads at these locations under the guise of mosques. ""A huge building is being constructed in the Khaigala area of Rawalakot which will act as a launchpad but in reality, this is again a dual-use facility, named Al-Aqsa Markaz. LeT is attempting to portray it as a mosque.

BMC polls: Mayahuti eyes Mumbai; Thackeray reunion irks Congress; the contest explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bmc-polls-mayahuti-eyes-mumbai-thackeray-reunion-irks-congress-the-contest-explained/articleshow/125980104.cms,"Why BMC control matters

Mahayuti buries hatchet for Mumbai

Thackeray cousins close ranks

Congress’ solo act threat

NEW DELHI: After a delay of nearly three years, the State Election Commission has finally announced dates for Maharashtra's long-pending civic body elections, which have been overdue since 2022. Polling will be held on January 15 for 29 municipal corporations, 32 zilla parishads and 336 panchayat samitis, with results scheduled for January 16.The elections to key urban bodies such as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Pune and Thane are being seen as more than routine local contests, widely viewed as the political mood test for the state.The BMC election is expected to witness the fiercest contest, pitting the ruling BJP-led Mahayuti alliance against a fractured opposition.The BMC’s estimated budget for 2025–26 stands at Rs 74,427 crore, with projected expenditure of Rs 43,162 crore, accounting for nearly 58 per cent of allocations towards development works.This massive financial clout is unmatched by any other municipal body in the country, cementing the BMC’s status as Asia’s wealthiest civic corporation and making control of Mumbai’s local government a prize of enormous political and economic significance.The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance is seeking to present a united front after months of internal friction. The BJP, Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar’s NCP have agreed to contest the BMC polls together, setting up coordination committees to resolve seat-sharing disputes.Relations between BJP and Sena had been strained, particularly over allegations of poaching party workers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The Sena had accused BJP’s state leadership of engineering defections.For BJP, BMC remains unfinished business. After narrowly missing out on control in 2017, the party believes its expanded footprint in Maharashtra and favourable alliance arithmetic could finally deliver Mumbai’s civic body.In 2017, the BJP contested all 227 seats independently and won 82, just two fewer than the undivided Shiv Sena. This time, it will contest fewer seats to accommodate its allies. The Shiv Sena has sought 90–100 seats, BJP state election in-charge Chandrashekhar Bawankule has said.BJP and NCP, however, will not contest together in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. ""Ajit Pawar and we cannot contest the elections together in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. Both of us understand politics well enough to know that if we contest together, it benefits a third party, and we do not want to allow that to happen. We will contest against each other, but it will be a friendly fight,"" CM Devendra Fadnavis said.One of the most striking political developments ahead of the polls is the growing proximity between Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and MNS leader Raj Thackeray. Once bitter rivals, the cousins now appear aligned in their belief that losing Mumbai would deal a severe blow to the Thackeray political legacy.For Uddhav Thackeray, the BMC represents perhaps his last major opportunity to reclaim political relevance after the 2022 split in the Shiv Sena. For Raj Thackeray, the election is being pitched as a battle to protect Marathi identity, with the MNS projecting itself as the custodian of Mumbai’s linguistic and cultural character.The opposition Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), however, appears under strain. The Congress has made it clear it will contest alone if the MNS is included in the alliance, citing concerns over alienating its core support base among minorities, Dalits and north Indian voters in Mumbai.While a solo Congress strategy risks fragmenting the anti-BJP vote, data from the 2024 assembly elections suggests that without MNS support, the opposition may struggle to cross the majority mark of 114 seats in the 227-member BMC, potentially giving the Mahayuti a structural edge.According to reports, Congress leaders have held discussions with Sharad Pawar and leaders of the NCP (SP) on a possible alliance. Pawar has reportedly indicated his preference for keeping the opposition coalition intact and contesting the elections together, including the Raj Thackeray-led MNS.","State Election Commission has finally announced dates for Maharashtra's long- pending civic body elections.

MGNREGA to be replaced with VB–G Ram G: What it is and how it’s different — key FAQs answered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mgnrega-is-now-vbg-ram-g-what-it-is-and-how-its-different-key-faqs-answered/articleshow/125975849.cms,"End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

Here are some of the frequently asked questions:

What is VB–G RAM G?





Water security through water-related works

Core-rural infrastructure

Livelihood-related infrastructure

Special works to mitigate extreme weather events

.

How is the new act different from MGNREGA? What makes it better?





Higher Employment Guarantee: Guarantee increases from 100 → 125 days, giving rural households higher income security.

Strategic Infrastructure Focus: MGNREGA works were scattered across many categories without a robust national strategy.

Localised, Spatially Integrated Planning: The new Act mandates Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans, prepared by panchayats themselves and integrated with national spatial systems like PM Gati-Shakti.

The new Act focuses on 4 major types of works ensuring durable assets that directly support water security, core rural infrastructure, livelihood-related infrastructure creation and climate adaptation

How will the new scheme benefit the rural economy?





Water Security: Water-related works are prioritised. Mission Amrit Sarovar has already created/rejuvenated 68,000+ water bodies, demonstrating clear agricultural and groundwater impact.

Core Rural Infrastructure: Roads, connectivity and foundational infrastructure boost market access and rural business activity.

Livelihood Infrastructure: Storage, markets, and production assets support income diversification.

Climate Resilience: Infrastructure for water harvesting, flood drainage, and soil conservation protects rural livelihoods.

Higher Employment & Consumption: 125 guaranteed days increase household earnings, stimulating the village economy.

Reduced Distress Migration: With more rural opportunities and durable assets, migration pressures fall.

Digital Formalisation: Digital attendance, digital payments and data-driven planning increase efficiency.

How will the new scheme benefit farmers?





Guaranteed Labour Availability: States may notify periods aggregating up to 60 days during peak sowing/harvesting when MGNREGA work stops. This prevents labour shortages during critical farm operations and avoids labour being diverted away to guaranteed-wage worksites.

Preventing Wage Inflation: Stopping public works during peaks prevents artificial wage inflation that raises food production costs.

Water & Irrigation Assets: Prioritised water works improve irrigation, groundwater and multi-season cropping potential (supported by the 68,000+ Amrit Sarovar water bodies achievement).

Better Connectivity & Storage: Core and livelihood infrastructure helps farmers store produce, reduce losses, and access markets.

Climate Resilience: Flood-drainage, water harvesting and soil conservation protect crops and reduce damage.

How will the new scheme benefit labourers?





Higher Income: 125 guaranteed days = 25% more potential earnings.

Predictable Work: Hyperlocal Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans ensure planned, advance-mapped work availability.

Digital Payments & Protection: Electronic wages (already 99.94% in 2024-25) continue with full biometric and Aadhaar-based verification, eliminating wage theft.

Unemployment Allowance: If work is not given, states must pay unemployment allowance.

Asset Creation Benefits Workers Too: Workers build and benefit from improved roads, water, and livelihood assets.

Why is there a need to change MGNREGA now?





MGNREGA was built for 2005, but rural India has transformed.

Poverty fell sharply from 25.7% (2011–12) to 4.86% (2023–24), supported by rising consumption, incomes and financial access recorded in MPCE and NABARD RECSS surveys.

With stronger social protection, better connectivity, deeper digital access and more diverse rural livelihoods, the old framework no longer matched today’s rural economy.

Given this structural change, MGNREGA’s open-ended model had become outdated.

The Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin): VB – G RAM G (विकसित भारत – जी राम जी) Bill modernises the system, raising guaranteed days, refocusing priorities, and building a more accountable, targeted, and relevant employment framework for today’s rural economy.

Why shift from demand-based to normative funding?





Normative funding aligns MGNREGA with the budgeting model used for most Government of India schemes, without reducing the employment guarantee.

A demand-based model leads to unpredictable allocations and mismatched budgeting. Normative funding uses objective parameters, ensuring predictable, rational planning while still guaranteeing that every eligible worker receives employment or unemployment allowance.

Does normative funding weaken the guarantee of 125 days?





Forecasting accuracy shown by FY 2024-25 when allocation matched demand perfectly

States + Centre share responsibility

Special relaxations allowed during disasters

If work is not provided, the unemployment allowance is mandatory

Thus, the right to guaranteed employment remains legally protected.

Were no attempts made to improve MNREGA earlier?





Women’s participation: 48% → 56.74%

Aadhaar-seeded active workers: 76 lakhs → 12.11crore

Workers on APBS: 0 → 11.93crore

Geo-tagged assets: 0 → 6.44 crore+

e-payments: 37% → 99.99%

Individual assets: 17.6% → 62.96%

What were the problems with MNREGA that necessitated a change?





Investigations in 19 districts of West Bengal found non-existent works, rule violations, and fund misuse, leading to a freeze.

Monitoring across 23 states in FY 2025–26 revealed works “not found or not commensurate with expenditure,” machine use where labour was required, and large-scale bypassing of NMMS attendance.

In 2024–25, misappropriation totalled ₹193.67 crore across states. Only 7.61% of households completed 100 days in the post-pandemic period.

These entrenched issues such as leakages, weak verification, and poor compliance required a new framework, not minor tweaks. The GRG Act creates a clean, digitally governed, accountable, and infrastructure-focused system.

What transparency and social protection measures are built into new Act?





AI-based fraud detection

Central + State Steering Committees for oversight

Focus on 4 key verticals for rural development

Enhanced monitoring role for Panchayats

GPS/mobile-based monitoring

real-time MIS dashboards

weekly public disclosures

stronger social audits (twice a year for every GP)

Why shift from a central sector to a centrally sponsored scheme?





States now share cost & responsibility

Better incentives to prevent misuse

Plans tailored to regional conditions through Gram Panchayat Plans

Centre retains standards, while states execute with accountability

This partnership model improves efficiency and reduces misuse.

Will this burden states financially?





Standard ratio: 60:40 (Centre: State)

North-east & Himalayan states/UT: 90:10

UTs without legislature: 100% funded by Central Funds

States already paid 25% materials & 50% admin earlier

Predictable normative allocation aids budgeting

States can request extra support during disasters

Better oversight reduces long-term losses from misappropriation

Why is a 60-day no-work period mandated, and what happens to workers then?





It ensures labour availability during sowing/harvest

Prevents sharp wage inflation that raises food prices

Workers naturally shift to agriculture, which pays higher seasonal wages

60 days is aggregated, not continuous

Workers still get 125 guaranteed days in the remaining ~300 days

Thus, farmers and labourers both benefit.

NEW DELHI: Centre is set to introduce a new rural employment law in the Lok Sabha, proposing to repeal the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with another legislation, titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–G RAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks to replace the MGNREGA with a revamped framework aimed at aligning rural employment and development with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. It has been listed in the supplementary list of businesses issued on Monday.The Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025 represents a major overhaul of MNREGA. Under the proposed law, the government ""establishes a modern statutory framework aligned with Viksit Bharat 2047, guaranteeing 125 days of wage employment per rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work,"" as per a statement released.The Act aims to create both employment and durable rural infrastructure through four priority verticals:All assets created under the scheme will be consolidated into the Viksit Bharat National Rural Infrastructure Stack, aimed at ""ensuring a unified and coordinated national approach to rural development,"" it said.The new Act represents a major upgrade over MGNREGA, fixing structural weaknesses while enhancing employment, transparency, planning, and accountability.Key improvements include:The Act strengthens the rural economy through productive asset creation, higher incomes, and better resilience:Also read: Rural jobs scheme: MGNREGA to be replaced by VB–G Ram G; Congress asks why remove Mahatma Gandhi's name Farmers benefit directly through both labour availability and better agricultural infrastructure.Labourers gain from higher guaranteed days, better wages, strong protections, and transparent systems.No, the guarantee is strengthened with employment days increased to 125.Major improvements were made, but they could not overcome deeper structural problems. Key gains (FY 13-14 vis-à-vis FY 2025-26):Despite these advances, misappropriation continued, digital attendance was bypassed, and assets often failed to match expenditure.The scale and persistence of these issues showed that MNREGA’s architecture had reached its limits, making a new, modernised Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin): VB – G RAM G (विकसित भारत – जी राम जी) Bill necessary.While many attempts were made to improve its functioning, major systemic failures persisted:Because rural employment is inherently local.No. The structure is balanced and sensitive to state capacity.","The new Act mandates Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans, prepared by panchayats themselves and integrated with national spatial systems like PM Gati-Shakti.

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government on Monday directed schools to shift students up to Class V from hybrid to fully online mode in view of the capital’s worsening air pollution.According to a circular issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE), physical classes for students from nursery to Class V in all government, government-aided and unaided private recognised schools in Delhi have been discontinued until further orders due to the prevailing high Air Quality Index (AQI).The order applies to all government, government-aided and private recognised schools in Delhi. School heads have been instructed to ensure that online classes are available for younger students and to inform parents and guardians immediately.The circular clarified that classes for Class VI and above will continue without any change and will be conducted as per earlier instructions issued on December 13. District and zonal education officials have also been asked to ensure smooth implementation of the directions.Delhi remained shrouded in dense smog with the AQI touching 498, close to the maximum level of 500. The city's air quality monitoring stations recorded 'severe' levels at 38 locations and 'very poor' at two stations, with Jahangirpuri recording the worst AQI of 498.Several residents complained of breathlessness, low visibility and health risks.Pollution levels have steadily worsened over the past two days, raising concerns especially for children and other vulnerable groups.The situation had worsened from Sunday when the AQI climbed to 461, marking Delhi's most polluted day this winter and the second-worst December air quality day on record.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, an AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 to 100 'satisfactory', 101 to 200 'moderate', 201 to 300 'poor', 301 to 400 'very poor' and 401 to 500 'severe'.The Air Quality Early Warning System forecasts that Delhi's air quality is likely to remain in the 'severe' category, with predictions for the next six days showing 'very poor' conditions.The current pollution levels pose serious health risks to the city's population, with authorities advising people to take necessary precautions. The situation remains particularly concerning as the winter season typically sees increased pollution levels in the capital region.","The Delhi government has directed schools to shift students up to Class V from hybrid to fully online mode.

Congress Questions BJP’s Renaming Of MGNREGA, Hits Out At Gandhi Hatred

.





About the proposed law:

NEW DELHI: The Opposition has mounted a sharp attack on the Centre over its move to repeal and replace the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( MGNREGA ). Several leaders have questioned the removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name from one of India’s largest welfare programmes. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday alleged that the proposal is part of a “BJP-RSS conspiracy” to dismantle a rights-based welfare law that benefits crores of rural poor.In a post on X, Kharge wrote: “This is not just about renaming the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. This is a BJP-RSS conspiracy to end MGNREGA.""Kharge alleged that removing Mahatma Gandhi’s name while paying symbolic tributes to him exposed what he called the government’s “hollowness and hypocrisy.” The Congress leader said that the party would oppose the move “in Parliament and on the streets” and would not allow the rights of poor workers to be taken away.""Erasing Gandhi's name on the centenary of the Sangh shows how hollow and hypocritical those are who, like Modi ji, offer flowers to Bapu on foreign soil. The Congress Party will strongly oppose in Parliament and on the streets any such decision of this arrogant regime that is against the poor and workers,"" the veteran leader further wrote.The remarks came after the Centre proposed to repeal the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with another legislation, titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–G RAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks to replace the MGNREGA with a revamped framework aimed at aligning rural employment and development with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. It has been listed in the supplementary list of businesses issued on Monday.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh also objected to the proposed legislation and said the Opposition has demanded that the Bill be referred to the appropriate Parliamentary Standing Committee for detailed scrutiny.In a post on X, Ramesh said such far-reaching legislation requires “deep study and wide consultations,” in keeping with parliamentary traditions.“The entire Opposition is demanding that the following three far-reaching Bills be referred to the Standing Committees concerned. We are hopeful that in keeping with the best of Parliamentary traditions and practices, this demand will be agreed to by the Government. The Bills require deep study and wide consultations: Higher Education Commission Bill, Atomic Energy Bill and G-RAM-G Bill,” his post read.Earlier, Ramesh criticised the government’s focus on renaming schemes, accusing it of prioritising branding over substance. He questioned why Mahatma Gandhi’s name was being removed from a programme that has been in place since 2005Speaking to reporters, Ramesh said: ""The Narendra Modi government is unbeatable in changing the names of schemes and laws, no one can match it. The Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan was turned into Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the rural LPG distribution program was named Ujjwala... They are experts in packaging, branding, and naming. The surprising thing is that they hate Pandit Nehru, but they hate Mahatma Gandhi so much too; the Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Scheme has been running since 2005. .. You are changing its name to the Venerable Bapu Employment Guarantee Scheme; what's the problem with the name Mahatma Gandhi?""Other Opposition leaders echoed similar concerns. Congress MP Saptagiri Ulaka, who chairs the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, said the BJP had always intended to end MGNREGA.He recalled that the committee had recommended increasing the number of workdays and wages under the scheme and flagged pending dues to states.""I don't know what problem they have with the name of Bapu, but they wanted to finish it because it was a Congress scheme. I head the Parliamentary panel, and we made so many recommendations — to increase the number of days to 150, to increase the wages... the states have pending dues, West Bengal is not getting funds. They have brought a Bill, but why have they removed the name of Mahatma Gandhi?, "" Ulka asked.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also questioned the rationale behind renaming the law.Speaking to reporters in the Parliament House complex, she said: “Whenever the name of a scheme is changed, there are so many changes that have to be made in offices, stationery... for which money is spent. So, what is the benefit? Why is it being done?Why is Mahatma Gandhi's name being removed. Mahatma Gandhi is considered the tallest leader not just in the country but in the world; so, removing his name, I really don't understand what the objective is. What is their intention?”Senior Trinamool Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien termed the move an insult to the Father of the Nation.""But then, are you surprised! These are the same people who hero-worshipped the man who killed Mahatma Gandhi. They want to insult Mahatma Gandhi and remove him from history,"" O'Brien said.CPI(M) general secretary MA Baby alleged that the proposed overhaul was an attempt to mask the dilution of MGNREGA’s rights-based structure.""The Union Government's grandstanding over a total revamp of the MGNREGS is an attempt to hide the startling fact that the basic rights-based framework under which it operated is being dismantled, and the central share brought down drastically. We will fight tooth and nail against this disastrous move both inside and outside Parliament,"" he claimed.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav also criticised the government’s move, saying renaming schemes was a long-standing BJP practice.Speaking to reporters, Yadav said: ""The BJP's culture of changing names is very old... In this double-engine government, the engine in Delhi is learning from the engine in Uttar Pradesh... This double-engine government is claiming others' work as its own. They don't have any new work to show.""MGNREGA, enacted in 2005 and renamed in 2009, guarantees up to 100 days of wage employment annually to rural households willing to undertake unskilled manual work.The proposed VB–G RAM G Bill increases this guarantee to 125 days and seeks to establish a broader rural development framework aligned with Viksit Bharat 2047.Rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, in the statement of objects and reasons of the Bill, acknowledged that MGNREGA has provided assured wage employment for the past 20 years. However, he said further strengthening was necessary in view of socio-economic changes in rural India and the expansion of other social security schemes.The Bill proposes a centrally sponsored framework under which states will design their own schemes within six months of the Act’s implementation, with the Centre making allocations based on defined parameters. Any expenditure beyond the approved allocation would be borne by state governments.",Opposition questions removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name from one of India's largest welfare programmes.

What changes?



'BJP-RSS conspiracy': Mallikarjun Kharge



NEW DELHI: The Centre is set to replace the two-decade-old national rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with a new legislative framework titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill, 2025. In response to the change, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra slammed the government questioning the intentions behind removing Mahatma Gandhi's name.The Bill, aimed at aligning rural livelihoods with the government’s long-term development vision, has been listed for introduction in the Lok Sabha, according to the supplementary list of business issued on Monday.The proposed legislation seeks to dismantle MGNREGA, enacted in 2005, and establish a new statutory regime for rural employment.Priyanka Gandhi questioned the government’s intent behind renaming the scheme, asking whether such a move was necessary in the first place. Speaking to the reporters outside the Parliament complex, she said, ""Why is Mahatma Gandhi's name being removed. Mahatma Gandhi is considered the tallest leader not just in the country but in the world, so removing his name, I really don't understand. What is the objective? What is their intention?""She further went on to argue, ""Whenever the name of a scheme is changed, there are so many changes that have to be made in offices, stationery, for which money is spent. So, what is the benefit? Why is it being done?""Priyanka Gandhi added that the move was wasteful in terms of both money and time, and said the Centre was effectively disrupting its own work by squandering valuable debate time. ""Even when we are debating, it is on other issues, not the real issues of the people. Time is being wasted, money is being wasted, they are disrupting themselves,"" Priyanka Gandhi added.Last week, when reports surfaced about the government renaming the scheme to 'Poojya Bapu Grameen Rozgar Yojana,' Priyanka Gandhi had said the exercise would be a waste of government resources and questioned what benefit the process would serve.""I can't understand what mentality is behind this. First, this is Mahatma Gandhi's name, and when it is changed, the government's resources are spent on it again,"" Priyanka Gandhi argued, ""From offices to stationery, everything has to be renamed, so this is a big, costly process. So what's the benefit of doing this unnecessarily? I can't understand.""The government would guarantee 125 days of wage employment every financial year to each rural household whose adult members are willing to undertake unskilled manual work. This is an upgrade from the minimum 100 days of wage employment.The bill positions itself as part of a broader “rural development framework aligned with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047”The goal of MGNREGA framed the programme to ""enhance the livelihood security""While the MGNREGA focused on the goal to ""enhance the livelihood security"", the new bill says it aims to promote ""empowerment, growth, convergence and saturation for a prosperous and resilient rural Bharat"", and lays emphasis on ""empowerment, growth, convergence and saturation through public works aggregating into forming Viksit Bharat National Rural Infrastructure Stack"".In the statement of objects and reasons, rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan acknowledged the role played by MGNREGA over the last 20 years in providing assured wage employment to rural households. However, the new legislation signals a reimagining of rural employment policy as the government seeks to transition from an entitlement-based safety net to what it describes as a future-oriented development mission.The VB-G RAM G Bill would mark the end of one of India’s most expansive social welfare programmes and the beginning of a new chapter in rural employment policy, potentially reshaping how the state supports livelihoods in the countryside.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that the proposal is part of a “BJP-RSS conspiracy” to dismantle a rights-based welfare law that benefits crores of rural poor.In a post on X, Kharge wrote: “This is not just about renaming the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. This is a BJP-RSS conspiracy to end MGNREGA.""Kharge alleged that removing Mahatma Gandhi’s name while paying symbolic tributes to him exposed what he called the government’s “hollowness and hypocrisy.” The Congress leader said that the party would oppose the move “in Parliament and on the streets” and would not allow the rights of poor workers to be taken away.""Erasing Gandhi's name on the centenary of the Sangh shows how hollow and hypocritical those are who, like Modi ji, offer flowers to Bapu on foreign soil. The Congress Party will strongly oppose in Parliament and on the streets any such decision of this arrogant regime that is against the poor and workers,"" the veteran leader further wrote.The remarks came after the Centre proposed to repeal the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with another legislation, titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–G RAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks to replace the MGNREGA with a revamped framework aimed at aligning rural employment and development with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. It has been listed in the supplementary list of businesses issued on Monday.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh also objected to the proposed legislation and said the Opposition has demanded that the Bill be referred to the appropriate Parliamentary Standing Committee for detailed scrutiny.In a post on X, Ramesh said such far-reaching legislation requires “deep study and wide consultations,” in keeping with parliamentary traditions.“The entire Opposition is demanding that the following three far-reaching Bills be referred to the Standing Committees concerned. We are hopeful that in keeping with the best of Parliamentary traditions and practices, this demand will be agreed to by the Government. The Bills require deep study and wide consultations: Higher Education Commission Bill, Atomic Energy Bill and G-RAM-G Bill,” his post read.Earlier, Ramesh criticised the government’s focus on renaming schemes, accusing it of prioritising branding over substance. He questioned why Mahatma Gandhi’s name was being removed from a programme that has been in place since 2005Speaking to reporters, Ramesh said: ""The Narendra Modi government is unbeatable in changing the names of schemes and laws, no one can match it. The Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan was turned into Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the rural LPG distribution program was named Ujjwala... They are experts in packaging, branding, and naming. The surprising thing is that they hate Pandit Nehru, but they hate Mahatma Gandhi so much too; the Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Scheme has been running since 2005. .. You are changing its name to the Venerable Bapu Employment Guarantee Scheme; what's the problem with the name Mahatma Gandhi?""","The Centre is set to replace the two-decade-old national rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with a new legislative framework titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill, 2025.

Rapid expansion: 468 hospitals empanelled under CGHS in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rapid-expansion-468-hospitals-empanelled-under-cghs-in-2025/articleshow/125993288.cms,".

.

New Delhi: The Central Govt Health Scheme (CGHS) has seen strong expansion in five years, with 468 hospitals empanelled nationwide in 2025, far outpacing the 42 hospitals that exited the scheme during the same period. Official data tabled in Parliament showed that despite a rise in exits this year, the overall network has grown sharply, expanding treatment options for lakhs of govt employees and pensioners across the country.A year-wise analysis highlights steady growth with intermittent churn. In 2021, CGHS empanelled 266 hospitals, while 22 exited. Following year saw 275 additions and 20 exits. Expansion accelerated in 2023, when 398 hospitals were empanelled, though exits also rose to 23. In 2024, 363 hospitals joined the network and 13 exited, marking relative stability. The year 2025 stands out for both record empanelment and highest exit count so far — yet still delivers largest net gain in five years.Much of the expansion has come from large, high-demand states. Delhi, which probably is home to the highest number of CGHS beneficiaries, added 189 hospitals in 2025, reflecting both rising CGHS usage and the capital’s dense private healthcare market.UP empanelled 62 hospitals, Rajasthan 31, Haryana 38, Maharashtra 30 and Bengal 42. These additions have significantly widened access, particularly in urban centres where CGHS footfall is heavy.At the same time, exits have been concentrated in a handful of large states. UP recorded 15 exits in 2025, which was around a third of the national number, followed by Karnataka (6), Maharashtra (5) and Delhi (3). Over the past five years, cumulative exits have reached 20 in UP, 19 in Karnataka, 18 in Maharashtra and 11 in Delhi. Beneficiaries say even limited exits can cause disruption, forcing patients to change hospitals mid-treatment, repeat diagnostic tests or travel farther for care — a particular burden for pensioners and those with chronic illnesses.Hospital groups argue that growth in empanelment does not automatically translate into stability. “The numbers show expansion, but retention depends on how smoothly hospitals are paid and how disputes are resolved,” said Association of Heathcare Providers-India member Dr C M Bhagat. He pointed out that while the recent revision of CGHS package rates on Oct 3, effective October 13, 2025, is a step forward, hospitals continue to flag delayed reimbursements and deductions as key reasons for exiting.The health ministry has said CGHS wellness centres are opened based on demand and that cashless treatment is already available to pensioners and other priority groups at empanelled hospitals. As CGHS usage grows in major cities, experts say the challenge ahead is clear: ensuring that rapid expansion is matched by hospital retention and continuity of care, so that beneficiaries experience not just a larger network, but a more reliable one.","Central Govt Health Scheme (CGHS) has seen strong expansion in five years. 468 hospitals empanelled nationwide in 2025, far outpacing the 42 hospitals that exited the scheme during the same period.

New Delhi: The amended atomic energy bill was tabled in LS Monday, paving way for a huge policy shift in India’s atomic sector that is expected to accelerate civil nuclear energy production by opening doors for private players. The sector has till now been the preserve of govt enterprises.Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025, introduced by MoS for department of atomic energy Jitendra Singh in the House, seeks to repeal Atomic Energy Act, 1962, and Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA), 2010. It provides for “a pragmatic civil liability regime for nuclear damage and to confer statutory status to Atomic Energy Regulatory Board”, Singh said.The new legislation seeks to support large-scale expansion of nuclear energy and radiation applications across power & non-power sectors. It is central to India’s goal of achieving 100GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047. It proposes a new legal framework that includes modern safety regulations, a dedicated nuclear tribunal for dispute resolution, and reforms to the nuclear liability regime to cap risks & attract investment.While private companies and their joint ventures will be allowed to apply for licences to set up and operate nuclear facilities & transport nuclear fuel, critical functions such as uranium enrichment, spent fuel management and heavy water production will remain under the exclusive control of Centre. Govt will retain control over radioactive substances and radiation-generating equipment to address safety hazards.Singh said the bill was aligned with the goal of increasing the share of nuclear energy in India’s overall energy mix, facilitating innovation in nuclear science and technology, &expanding its use in non-power applications, such as healthcare, food, water, agriculture, industry, environment, research and innovation, and emerging areas such as AI, while continuing to honour India’s obligations on safety, security, safeguards & nuclear liability.The amendments are designed to finally implement the stalled Indo-US nuclear agreement, which has led to little progress beyond fuel imports due to liability issues, and enable US reactor construction in India.",The sector has till now been the preserve of govt enterprises.

New Delhi: Bringing into focus the importance of work-life balance in the digital era, NCP (SP)’s Supriya Sule has introduced a private member’s bill in Lok Sabha proposing establishing an ‘employees welfare authority’ to confer the right on employees to disconnect from work-related phone calls & e-mails beyond work hours and on holidays.“Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, fosters a better quality of life and a healthier work-life balance by reducing burnout caused by today’s digital culture,” Sule had said on X after the bill was introduced on Dec 5. Friday is reserved for private member’s bills in Parliament.The ‘statement of objects and reasons’ of the bill says: “According to a report released by World Economic Forum, the proportion of mobile workers who could work from any location, is expected to rise beyond 70%. While this has benefits in terms of work flexibility, it also carries with it a significant risk of erosion of boundaries between professional and personal life.”The bill emphasises “the need to respect personal space of employees by recognising their right to disconnect and not respond to their employers’ calls, emails, etc, during out-of-work hours”. It seeks to impose sanctions at the rate of 1% of total employees’ remuneration on entities (companies or societies) for any non-compliance with the bill’s provisions.The bill also provides for counselling services to increase awareness among employees and citizens, on reasonable use of digital and communication tools, for professional and personal use. To free employees from digital distractions and enable them to truly connect with people around then, it provides for digital detox centres.The bill also takes into consideration the competitive needs of companies and their diverse work cultures. Calling for flexibility in the right to disconnect rules, it leaves it to the companies to negotiate terms of service with their employees for working out-of-work hours.“The bill thus champions for the rights and welfare of employees, by mandating individual entities to negotiate out-of-hour service conditions with their employees, and upholding the right of employee to disconnect,” it stated.",NCP (SP)’s Supriya Sule has introduced a bill in Lok Sabha.

Modi also reaffirmed India’s support for efforts being made to achieve durable peace in the region.Modi arrived in Amman for what is the first full-fledged bilateral visit by an Indian PM to the country in 37 years. He had in 2018 transited through Jordan on his way to Palestine.The PM is on a three-nation trip to Jordan, Ethiopia and Oman. The leaders also discussed efforts to expand cooperation in areas like trade, fertilisers, digital technology and infrastructure.“On Gaza, from the beginning, your role has been active and positive. It is the hope of all of us that peace and stability remain in this region,” said Modi in his opening remarks.According to Jordan, the need to step up the humanitarian response in Gaza and ensure implementation of the agreement to end the war on the Strip was also discussed.“Against terrorism, our shared and clear stance exists. Under your leadership, Jordan has given a strong and strategic message to all of humanity against terrorism, extremism, and radicalisation,” he added.During the restricted meeting earlier, the leaders discussed giving more strength to cooperation in this area, with Modi recalling the king’s participation in 2018, during his India visit, in a conference on Islamic Heritage. “I remember that our first meeting happened in 2015 at an event focused on countering violent extremism on the sidelines of the UN. You had given inspirational remarks on this subject then too. To promote moderation, your efforts are extremely important not just regionally but for global peace as well,” Modi told Abdullah, adding both sides would continue moving forward solidly in this direction together.In a special gesture, on arrival at the airport in Amman, Modi was received by Jordanian PM Jafar Hassan and accorded a ceremonial welcome. This full-fledged bilateral visit to Jordan is taking place after a span of 37 years, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, said MEA in a statement.Noting that India was Jordan’s 3rd largest trading partner, Modi proposed the two countries should aim to enhance bilateral trade to US$ 5 billion over next five years.On the sidelines of the visit, govts of Jordan and India are due to sign MoUs on renewable energy and water resource management, a cultural exchange programme, a letter of intent on cooperation in the field of digital transformation, and a twinning agreement between the city of Petra and Ellora Caves site in India.In his departure statement earlier, PM Modi said that India shares both age-old civilisational ties, as well as extensive contemporary bilateral relations, with the countries he’s visiting.","Modi arrived in Amman for what is the first full-fledged bilateral visit by an Indian PM to the country in 37 years.

Stiff penalties mark big policy shift in regulating higher education,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stiff-penalties-mark-big-policy-shift-in-regulating-higher-education/articleshow/125992737.cms,".

New Delhi: For the first time, govt proposed a graded penalty regime for higher education institutions, with fines ranging Rs 10-75 lakh for repeated violations, suspension of degree-awarding powers and closure, while illegal institutions could face Rs 2 crore penalty and immediate shutdown, with safeguards to protect enrolled students.The proposed Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill, 2025, placed in Lok Sabha on Monday marks a decisive shift in how higher education institutions will be regulated, moving away from advisory nudges to a system driven by statutory penalties, mandatory transparency and accreditation-linked autonomy.Under the graded penalty framework, proposed with hard financial consequences for regulatory violations, institutions found violating provisions of the law or its regulations could face fines starting at Rs 10 lakh, escalating to Rs 30 lakh for repeat offences, and going up to Rs 75 lakh for persistent violations. In extreme cases, regulators can recommend suspension of degree-awarding powers, withdrawal of affiliation or closure.Every year UGC , which will cease to exist, used to notify a list of fake universities, but beyond that, no action could be initiated and they continued to function at the cost of unsuspecting students, many of whom were left with invalid degrees and financial losses. The bill introduced a Rs 2 crore penalty for unauthorised institutions operating without govt approval, along with immediate closure.The law mandates that penalties must not adversely affect enrolled students, a safeguard aimed at preventing academic disruption.The bill also redraws the autonomy framework. All higher education institutions will be required to move towards full accreditation, which in turn unlocks graded academic and administrative autonomy.High-performing colleges — once dependent on affiliating universities — can be authorised to grant degrees in their own name, subject to regulatory approval. The model is intended to reduce the burden of over-affiliation and push institutions towards becoming autonomous, multidisciplinary campuses, in line with NEP-2020 goals. Expansion is also regulated. Universities will need prior approval to open off-campuses or constituent colleges, replacing the earlier system of largely unchecked growth.Moreover, unlike earlier regulatory regimes that relied heavily on executive guidelines, the bill has hardwired transparency into statute. Institutions will be legally required to publicly disclose financial statements, audits, faculty details, infrastructure, courses, learning outcomes, governance structures and accreditation status. False or misleading disclosures can trigger regulatory action, with the regulator mandated to act within 60 days. Grievance redressal mechanisms for students are also made compulsory, giving stakeholders a formal channel to challenge institutional misconduct.","The proposed Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill, 2025, was placed in Lok Sabha on Monday.

New Delhi: Citing rise in cases of involvement of younger juveniles in heinous crimes, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari introduced a private member’s bill in LS seeking amendments to Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 to bring down the age for juveniles who have committed heinous crimes from 16 years to 14. This will allow such cases to be open for assessment by Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) for transfer to children’s court for trial as an adult under the criminal justice system.The statement of objects of Tiwari’s bill introduced in LS on Dec 5 states Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, was enacted to provide a child-friendly approach to the adjudication and disposition of matters involving children in conflict with the law. “However, in recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in involvement of juveniles aged 14-16 years in serious and heinous crimes, including rape, murder, and other violent offences,” it said.“The existing provision of treating all children below the age of 18 years as juveniles, regardless of the gravity of the offence, has led to concerns about adequacy of the justice system in addressing such crimes. This amendment seeks to strike a balance between the principles of rehabilitation and accountability, while ensuring that the rights and welfare of children are protected,” it said.","BJP MP Manoj Tiwari introduced a private member’s bill in LS seeking amendments to Juvenile Justice Act, 2015.

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

.

NEW DELHI: Nearly half of the sanctioned positions on pollution control boards and committees across the country remain vacant even as most major cities are reeling under the impact of air pollution, reveals the answer to a recent question in Parliament.The answers to other questions this year show that this has been the case over the last five years. Also, utilisation of funds under the National Clean Air Programme has been particularly poor in the Capital and satellite cities.A question answered in the ongoing session revealed that apart from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), there are 28 state pollution control boards (SPCBs) and 8 pollution control committees (PCCs) that work in the UTs and the NCT of Delhi. Together, their sanctioned strength for scientific and technical posts is 6,932, of which 3,161 or 45.6% were vacant. The vacancy was 16.3% in CPCB as of Nov, 43.8% in PCCs and 47.6% in the SPCBs as of Aug.As for all posts, an answer in March this year showed that of the 11,562 sanctioned positions in the SPCBs and PCCs, there were 5,671 or over 49% vacancies. Vacancies have ranged from 44% to 51% over the last five years.According to the March answer, 12 of the 28 SPCBs had over 50% vacancy.Sikkim topped the list with 100% vacancy and was followed by Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh, both lacking more than 70% staff. Kerala was the only large state where the vacancy was less than 10%. The vacancy was 9.3% in Goa, while Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland had no vacancies.Among PCCs, the vacancy was 44.5% in Delhi, while it was 69% in Ladakh and Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. Lakshadweep had zero vacancies, while only 11.1% of the sanctioned strength of Chandigarh was vacant. We are yet to get a response from the environment ministry on why there are so many vacancies. As and when we do, the story will be updated online.Data from 44 urban agglomerations (UAs) shows that Noida, Delhi and Faridabad were at the bottom of the list when it came to fund utilisation under the National Clean Air Programme.A parliamentary question answered in March showed that of the Rs 42 crore released to the national capital, only 32% was utilised. The proportion was 11.1% for Noida and 39% for Faridabad. In comparison, Surat utilised all of the funds alloted and Chennai 99%, while Kolkata utilised 87%.","Nearly half of the sanctioned positions on pollution control boards and committees across the country remain vacant.

Centre Signals Willingness to Discuss SIR, Asks Opposition Not to Set Timeline

New Delhi: The draft electoral rolls for five states/Union territories - West Bengal, Rajasthan, Goa, Puducherry and Lakshadweep - undergoing phase 2 of special intensive revision (SIR) are set to be published Tuesday, with sources indicating likely deletions in the range of 7.5-8.5% for all except Lakshadweep, where they may be barely 2.5%.While West Bengal appears set to have around 58 lakh electors removed on account of being dead, permanently shifted, untraceable or registered at multiple places, sources said the number of notices likely to be issued to electors found to have submitted their enumeration form with discrepancies, including not specifying their link to the electoral roll from the last SIR, ""may be far, far more than 58 lakh"". These discrepancies, by now assessed by booth level officers, are on account of the change in SIR rule that did away with the need for the elector to submit documentation at the enumeration stage, to establish their eligibility for enrolment.Depending on how many of those issued notices can satisfy electoral registration officers of their eligibility with requisite documentation proving their citizenship, the EC will reach the ultimate number of electors to be excluded from the final roll. Sources said the number of dead, shifted, duplicate and untraceable electors identified for deletion in Goa, with a total electorate of 11.8 lakh, may be around a lakh (around 8.5%).In Rajasthan again, 7.5-8% of the total 5.46 crore electors may be removed. Lakshadweep will see the lowest percentage of electors (2.5% of its 57,813 electorate) being struck off the roll.Officials said the large number of entries of dead, duplicate and shifted voters could be due to a 2010 amendment in Representation of the People Act, which disallowed any amendment or deletion of a roll entry without proper verification. Though the manner of this verification was to be prescribed in the following rules, this was never done. ""This is why the dead, shifted and multiple entries have remained in the roll, creating scope for bogus voting,"" said an official.EC sources told TOI once the draft roll is published, each collector will share its printed and soft copy with the district-level functionaries of parties. The draft roll will also be uploaded on the district election officer's website.","Draft electoral rolls for West Bengal, Rajasthan, Goa, Puducherry and Lakshadweep are set to be published Tuesday.

Finance firm head burns man alive to fake own death for Rs 1 crore insurance payout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/finance-firm-head-burns-man-alive-to-fake-own-death-for-rs-1-crore-insurance-payout/articleshow/125990292.cms,".

Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar: Ganesh Chavan (35), the district head of a private finance firm, allegedly burnt a drunk man alive in a car in Latur to claim a Rs 1 crore term insurance payout and wipe out mounting debts, police said on Monday.The meticulously planned crime was aimed at ensuring the insurance benefit reached his family and his liabilities got wiped out. Within 24 hours of the crime, the Latur police tracked the accused on Monday using technical analysis and a lead linked to a woman with whom he had an affair.Superintendent of police Amol Tambe said the accused was under financial stress, with loans totalling Rs 97 lakh taken to buy flats in Mumbai and Latur. ""The burden was aggravated by high personal expenses by his wife and the woman he was involved with. He believed that if he was declared dead, the Rs 1 crore term insurance would clear the liabilities. This belief led to a cold-blooded murder,"" Tambe said.The case came to light after the police received a Dial 112 call around 12.30am on Sunday reporting a car on fire on the Ausa-Vanvada Road. Fire tenders extinguished the blaze and the police found a burnt human skeleton inside the vehicle.An accidental death was initially registered and DNA samples were preserved for identification.The car was found to be registered in the name of a relative but was regularly used by Chavan. When contacted, Chavan's wife told the police that he left home around 10pm on Saturday, claiming he was going to hand over a laptop to a friend, and had not returned.Relatives later identified a metal kada from the remains and believed the body was Chavan's. The police agreed to hand over the remains to the family on the condition that they should bury them instead of burning them.However, inconsistencies during the probe raised suspicion that he was alive. The postmortem of the skeleton was conducted at the spot.""After arresting Chavan, he revealed that 50-year-old Govind Yadav, who was heavily under the influence of liquor, sought a lift from him. The accused gave him a lift and later stopped at a dhaba and bought chicken. Chavan drove towards the isolated Vanvada road, assessing the surroundings while Yadav ate a little and fell asleep in the car,"" said local crime branch inspector Sudhakar Bavkar.The police said Chavan then dragged Yadav to the driver's seat, fastened the seat belt tightly, and placed matchsticks and plastic bags on the seat. He poured petrol inside the car, left the fuel tank cap open to accelerate the blaze, splashed petrol outside, and set the vehicle on fire before fleeing on foot.Sub-divisional police officer Kumar Chaudhary said evidence showed the victim was alive when the car was set ablaze. ""The victim was burnt alive while intoxicated, and was unable to resist. Positioning him in the driver's seat was meant to pass off the death as that of the accused,"" he said.Chavan escaped to Kolhapur and then to Vijaydurg in Sindhudurg district. As doubts mounted, the local crime branch joined the probe. LCB inspector Sudhakar Bavkar said phone analysis, travel data, and financial trails exposed the deception. ""Surveillance of a woman with whom the accused had an extra-marital affair provided a vital lead to trace him to Sindhudurg on Monday,"" Bavkar said.Ausa police station inspector R K Dambale said Chavan admitted that he had planned either suicide or murder to trigger the insurance claim. The police said forensic confirmation was underway.","Ganesh Chavan, district head of a private finance firm, allegedly burnt a drunk man alive in a car in Latur. The meticulously planned crime was aimed at ensuring the insurance benefit reached his family and his liabilities got wiped out. Within 24 hours of the crime, the Latur police tracked the accused on Monday using technical analysis and a lead linked to a woman with whom he had an affair.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125990294,imgsize-41812,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-2025-12-16t024644656.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Delhiites woke up to winter's first dense fog on Monday, with visibility dropping to zero in the city. There was havoc at Delhi airport as departures remained suspended for nearly five hours from 4am to 9am when visibility was below 100m.As many as 228 flights - 131 departures, 97 arrivals - were cancelled, over 800 delayed and five diverted to other airports, officials said. The ripple effect of delays continued long after the fog cleared around noon. At least 100 trains were running late.Safdarjung records zero visibility at 12.30am, things look up after 9amThe civil aviation ministry said dense fog conditions impacted flight operations at several airports in north India.According to India Meteorological Department, visibility began to dip sharply from Sunday night. “It dropped to 150 metres at 11.30pm. By 12.30am Monday, there was zero visibility at Safdarjung, the city’s base station. This continued till 2am and improved marginally to 100m by 2.30am. At Palam, the lowest visibility recorded was 50m at 4am,” an official said.Visibility started improving after 9am, touching 300m at Safdarjung by 9.30am and 700m by 10.30am, with the sun making an appearance.At Palam, visibility improved from 100m at 9am to 300m by 10.30am, and to 500m by noon.Flight operations were severely impacted at IGI Airport from 4am, when visibility dropped to 50m and low-visibility procedures were initiated. According to live flight tracking website Flightradar24, 260 arrivals and 400 departures were delayed till Monday evening. “Some flights arrived late at IGI due to weather conditions at the origin airport. Since they came late, these flights departed late,” said an airport official.Airport officials said pilots who are trained in CAT III procedures can make an aircraft land with a minimum visibility of 50m, while an aircraft can take off at a minimum visibility of 125m. “However, pilots who are not trained in CAT-III procedures wait at the taxiway after all formalities such as boarding are completed and take off when they get clearance as they need visibility of around 500m. This causes major flight delays,” an airport official said earlier.Apart from Delhi, flight operations were hit in many parts of north India. The civil aviation ministry posted on X, “In view of the prevailing situation, certain flights may be delayed, diverted or cancelled. Passengers are advised to stay in touch with their airlines for real-time flight updates, regularly check airport and airline websites/apps, and plan for additional travel time.”IndiGo, in a statement, said low visibility (below minima), due to dense fog, severely impacted operations at Delhi and other airports in northern India, “which is unfortunately beyond our control”. “While operations adjust to the prevailing weather, some flights may experience delays while a few others may be proactively cancelled through the day to prioritise safety and help minimise extended waiting at the airport,” said IndiGo.Air India said poor visibility due to dense fog hit operations of all airlines. “In the interest of safety and to avoid prolonged uncertainty, some flights have been cancelled,” it said on X.The civil aviation ministry said, “The Director General Civil Aviation has reviewed preparedness for fog conditions. Officers should monitor passenger inconvenience and ensure that airlines are facilitating operations and discharging responsibilities as per their respective SOPs and any directions issued.”","As many as 228 flights - 131 departures, 97 arrivals - were cancelled, over 800 delayed and five diverted to other airports.

NEW DELHI: Dense fog through the morning and toxic smog thereafter. Delhi continued to gasp in severe air quality for the third day. The city's average AQI stood at 427, improving slightly from Sunday's severe-plus level of 461 without giving no major relief.The season's first big fog episode, cold conditions and calm winds prevented significant dispersal of pollutants. Of Delhi's 39 air quality monitoring stations, 28 were in 'severe' zone as against 38 on Sunday.

Unlike MGNREGA, demand won’t drive new scheme

NEW DELHI: Set to consign the Congress-stamped MGNREGA to history, Modi govt will unveil a new law on guaranteed unskilled rural jobs, with a structure that will shift the Centre's financial burden to states, provide fixed budgets for states instead of the present practice of it being demand-driven, and annually pause the scheme for two months during the agricultural season - in tweaks that will rewrite the concept of job guarantee from what has been known for the last two decades.Titled 'Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill, 2025', the bill will repeal MGNREGA, and put in place an implementation paraphernalia that is similar to the job scheme even as it diverges on consequential provisions. Also, it hikes the promised employment for a rural household from 100 days under MGNREGA to 125 days.The bill, set to draw protests from the opposition in Parliament, was not tabled Monday even though it was listed in the agenda.As per the proposed Act, the Centre will bear 60% of the cost, while states will bear the remaining 40%. In case of NE states and hill states of Uttarakhand, Himachal and J&K, the fund-sharing between the Centre and state will be 90:10.This fund-sharing formula is a major departure from MGNREGA, as it constitutes a flat division of costs on the lines of a “centrally sponsored scheme”, without the distinctions of “labour cost” and “material cost” as prevalent under MGNREGA.Under MGNREGA, Centre bears the entire cost of labour budget (wages) and 75% of material cost, besides a big part of administrative expenditure.Moreover, the scheme will no longer be “demand-driven” as under MGNREGA in which budget for states is cleared according to “work plan” and “labour budget” — anticipated work demand — presented to Union rural development ministry by individual states at start of the year. In contrast, in new law, as per Sec 22, Centre will determine annual state-wise “normative allocation” based on parameters to be laid down. The “normative allocation” is defined as allocation of fund being made so far by Centre to state. Any expenditure above the “normative allocation” will be borne by the state.Most importantly, ‘VB-G RAM G’ will not be in operation for two months of a year, which would be notified as “peak agricultural seasons” — 60 days to correspond with sowing & harvesting, and which states will announce in advance. As per Section 6, no work shall be commenced or executed during this period. The govt’s rationale for the 60-day pause is “to facilitate adequate availability of agricultural labour during the said period”. Essentially, the govt has agreed with the claims that MGNREGA is responsible for shortage of agricultural labour during peak seasons.In finer detail of the implementation framework, provisions of proposed bill mirror details of MGNREGA — from fixation of wages to the role of panchayats to setting up of monitoring authorities like “central gramin rozgar guarantee council” and its state counterparts, audit, preparation of village and block development plans. A job-seeker will still be entitled to “unemployment allowance” to be paid by state, if s/he is not provided work within a fortnight of demand. The wages under the new scheme will be similar to the one under MGNREGA.The programme will now be a centrally-sponsored scheme, and every state govt will have to prepare a scheme within six months after the commencement of the Act.","Modi govt will unveil a new law on guaranteed unskilled rural jobs.

NEW DELHI: Delhi-NCR woke up to dense layers of toxic smog on Tuesday, with air quality ranging from poor to severe across the region, raising serious health concerns for residents.Several areas, including Anand Vihar, AIIMS, Ghazipur and India Gate, were covered in dense layers of toxic smog. The Air Quality Index (AQI) at Anand Vihar stood at 410, categorised as ‘severe’, while Ghazipur recorded 410 (‘severe’), AIIMS 397 (‘very poor’) and India Gate 380 (‘very poor’), according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).With pollution levels exceeding critical limits, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has invoked all measures under Stage-IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR. Stage-IV is the strictest level of restrictions, applied when AQI exceeds 450, aimed at limiting public exposure and preventing further deterioration of air quality.On Monday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 23°C and a minimum of 8°C.Several monitoring stations reported dangerously high pollution. Akshardham recorded an AQI of 493, while Dwarka Sector-14 had 469. Wazirpur, Rohini and Ashok Vihar recorded the maximum measurable AQI of 500, highlighting the severity of the crisis.According to CPCB standards, air quality is classed as ‘moderate’ when AQI is between 101 and 200, ‘poor’ between 201 and 300, and ‘very poor’ between 301 and 400. AQI above 400 is considered ‘severe’, while readings of 450 and above are categorised as ‘severe-plus’, triggering emergency measures.Under the new restrictions, all construction and demolition work has been suspended. Stone crushers, mining units and related industrial operations have also been ordered to shut down due to their contribution to dust and particulate pollution.Vehicle restrictions have been tightened further, particularly targeting polluting four-wheelers on major roads, as authorities work to curb emissions amid worsening air quality.","Several areas, including Anand Vihar, AIIMS, Ghazipur and India Gate, were covered in dense layers of toxic smog.

Bengaluru airport outrage: Passengers fume as KIA’s compel them to trek 800 meters for cabs; flyers irked by kerbside clampdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/passengers-fume-as-bengaluru-airports-new-rules-compel-them-to-trek-800-metres-for-cabs/articleshow/125988753.cms,"Passengers fume as Bengaluru airport’s new rules compel them to trek 800 metres for cabs





Voices from the ground

BENGALURU: What feels worse after a long flight — sitting inside the aircraft or walking for nearly 800 metres with luggage to board a private pre-booked cab? For hundreds of passengers arriving at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) over the past few days, the answer has been unequivocal: the long walk.Bengaluru International Airport Ltd's newly enforced traffic management and kerbside pick-up policy at Terminal 1 (T1) and Terminal 2 (T2) has triggered widespread frustration among passengers and cab operators alike. Rolled out to curb illegal parking, touting, and congestion outside arrival terminals, the policy allows only airport-authorised aggregator taxis to pick up passengers directly from the kerbside.All other private pre-booked cabs — including long-distance and outstation taxis — have been shifted to designated pickup zones at parking areas P3 and P4, nearly 800 metres from T1. For tired travellers, the new arrangement often means a 15-17 minute trek after landing, navigating elevated walkways, ramps, long corridors, and multiple elevators — all the while hauling heavy luggage. Senior citizens, parents with young children, and families have been hit the hardest, with many describing the change as insensitive and poorly thought out.At T1, arrivals now face a complex lane system: the first lane is reserved for govt vehicles, the second for airport aggregator taxis, the third to fifth lanes for private white-board vehicles, and the remaining lanes for premium app-based services. While passengers opting for airport taxis can step straight into their vehicles, those who have booked private cabs must make the long walk to reach their drivers. At T2, the issue has taken a different form: a strict time window that many say is nearly impossible to meet.Monday morning saw visible chaos at both terminals, with confused passengers asking for directions, pre-booked private cab drivers arguing with security personnel, and tempers flaring. Several travellers complained that the policy was implemented without adequate public communication or a transition period. ""We landed around noon and were suddenly told our cab couldn't come anywhere near the terminal. My parents are elderly, and my mother has knee problems. Making them walk nearly a kilometre was extremely stressful,"" said Rakesh Sharma, a first-time visitor to Bengaluru from Jaipur who had pre-booked a private cab.Another passenger, Anita Fernandez, who arrived from Goa with her two children, said the experience was exhausting. ""After paying airport charges and cab fares, you expect some convenience. Instead, we were made to walk endlessly, with hardly any staff to guide us. For families, this is a nightmare,"" she said.Cab operators, especially private and outstation drivers, say the policy has directly affected their livelihoods. Many report passengers cancelling bookings midway and switching to airport taxis simply to avoid the walk. ""Passengers are angry and take it out on us, but this isn't our fault,"" said Srinath R, a private cab operator who has serviced KIA for over a decade.At T2, commuters say the pressure is even higher. Drivers must pick up passengers within eight minutes to avoid penalties, turning arrivals into a frantic race against time. ""After a three-hour flight from Lucknow, I felt like I was in a sprint just to help my driver avoid a fine,"" said Mohammed Irfan, adding: ""There was no prior information, no clear signage, and no assistance. An airport arrival should be seamless, not stressful. ""“This is absolutely unacceptable. Not everyone wants to be tied to Bengaluru airport taxis or aggregators, many of us operate independently. Just because BIAL wants to maximise revenue, ordinary cab drivers are being made to suffer. I have come to pick up a family of 58 travelling to Kushalnagar, and I am now forced to ask all of them, including several senior citizens, to walk nearly 800 metres to board the cab. They are understandably unhappy… This is not how passenger transport should work. Drivers are being put in embarrassing situations.”— Ravi S | Taxi Driver“I regularly pick up a family, and they trust me because they are comfortable with my driving. Today, they are upset with me — not because of my service, but because I asked them to walk a long distance before boarding the cab. That is not easy, especially after a flight. BIAL should have at least announced these rules well in advance so that both drivers and passengers could plan accordingly.”— Dharmaraju MG | Taxi Driver from Mysuru“As a passenger, the entire system is confusing and extremely tiring. We are forced to walk long distances with heavy luggage, with very little guidance. For passengers who require wheelchairs, this feels like punishment rather than support.”— Kiran Purushotham | Passenger“I have arrived with my family of 58 for a wedding, and this experience has been horrible. The walk is not even straightforward. There are elevations, elevators, long corridors of nearly 400 metres, then another descent using stairs before you finally reach the cab pick-up point. With so much luggage and elderly family members, this is simply not possible. Expecting passengers to navigate such a complicated and physically demanding route defeats the purpose of airport transport. ”— Jashveer Singh Hora | Passenger“I am confused about where to go or how to coordinate the pick-up. For first-time visitors, this creates a terrible impression of the city and the airport. Nothing about this system is passenger-friendly or driver-friendly.”— Mohammed Ansil | Taxi Driver","Bengaluru International Airport Ltd's newly enforced traffic management and kerbside pick-up policy at Terminal 1 (T1) and Terminal 2 (T2) has triggered widespread frustration among passengers and cab operators alike.

An Indian-origin businessman who owns a long-established medical manufacturer in Kanata (High-tech suburb of Ottawa) says he is being forced to relocate operations to India and US as the company gives up its nuclear licence. This is a move he says will cost hundreds of high-tech jobs.Krishnan Suthanthiran, owner of Best Theratronics, said surrendering the licence would lead to “the loss of 200 high-tech jobs” after Canada’s nuclear regulator took action over the company’s failure to meet licence conditions.On Friday, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) confirmed that Best Theratronics is in the process of removing the nuclear materials it used to manufacture cancer treatment devices. The company has secured export licences to ship its Cobalt 60 and Cesium 137 sealed sources out of Canada, officials said during a public meeting.Best Theratronics was once a Crown agency and helped develop the world’s first cancer treatment machine, reports CBC News. However, the company has struggled in recent years under private ownership. Suthanthiran said he has lost millions of dollars since buying the business from MDS Nordion in 2007.The firm also faced a long labour dispute, with workers striking for nearly 10 months over pay.In November last year, the CNSC issued formal orders after discovering the company’s financial guarantee had expired. The regulator required Best Theratronics to set aside $1.8 million to cover potential cleanup costs if the site were to be decommissioned.Suthanthiran did not comply. He told CBC in October that the regulator was wrong and that he did not have the funds to restore the guarantee. Instead, he said he would abandon the nuclear licence and shift the company towards non-nuclear activities.In an email to CBC, Suthanthiran said the decision was forcing him “to relocate to the USA and India”, and that the cost of maintaining the nuclear licence was too high.The regulator has ordered the company to submit monthly updates on its progress. However, it missed a December reporting deadline. Company representative Manny Subramanian told the commission the delay was due to Suthanthiran being out of the country.“We ended up sending about a day late or two days late because Krish, the president of the company, was travelling. We couldn’t get ahold of him,” Subramanian said.The next deadline comes on Tuesday, when Best Theratronics must submit an initial plan to decommission its Kanata plant.","Krishnan Suthanthiran, owner of Best Theratronics, said surrendering the licence would lead to ‘the loss of 200 high-tech jobs’ The company has secured export licences to ship its Cobalt 60 and Cesium 137 sealed sources out of Canada.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125963897,imgsize-1277402,width-400,resizemode-4/125963897.jpg"

NEW DELHI/PANAJI: Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, wanted in connection with the fire that claimed 25 lives at their nightclub in Goa on Dec 6, are expected to be deported from Thailand to India on Tuesday.Sources said the brothers are set to arrive at Delhi's IGI Airport on an Indigo flight from Bangkok at around 1.45 pm. They will be taken by a team of Delhi crime branch and Goa Police to Patiala House Court where their transit remand will be sought. The two are likely to be flown to Goa by Tuesday night, Goa DGP Alok Kumar said.A special team comprising CBI and intelligence officials landed in Phuket last Saturday to complete the deportation process.The brothers fled to Thailand even as police and fire fighters were battling the blaze at Birch By Romeo Lane and rescuing those trapped. The regional passport office, New Delhi, subsequently issued a notice to them, seeking an explanation from both as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days.Once a lookout notice against them was issued, the ministry of external affairs decided to impound their passports, which meant that they were staying in Thailand without valid travel documents.The brothers were then detained by Thai authorities from Hotel Indigo in Phuket for staying in the country illegally and brought to a detention centre in Bangkok.Indian embassy in Thailand issued an emergency certificate — a one-way travel document — to the Luthras since their passport had been suspended by Indian govt.The two countries signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force on June 29, 2015.Goa Police's investigation into the blaze at the Arpora nightclub revealed that over the past 18 months, it had been operating illegally without requisite permissions and on an expired licence. A senior police officer who is part of the investigation said that the instrument of licence was not renewed as the nightclub did not obtain permissions since 2024. However, despite these glaring lapses, not a single authority took action against Birch.So far, Goa Police have arrested Gurgaon resident Ajay Gupta (55), a partner of the Luthra brothers; Rajiv Modak (49), Birch's chief general manager; gate manager Priyanshu Thakur (32); bar manager Rajveer Singhania (32); general manager Vivek Singh (27); and Bharat Kohli.When the fire broke out at the nightclub at around 11.45pm on Dec 6, there were more than 150 tourists attending an event. A preliminary investigation by police and directorate of fire services concluded that the blaze was triggered after electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling of the nightclub.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, wanted in connection with the fire that claimed 25 lives at their nightclub in Goa on Dec 6, are expected to be deported from Thailand to India on Tuesday.Sources said the brothers are set to arrive at Delhi's IGI Airport on an Indigo flight from Bangkok at around 1.45 pm.

Amazon Announces Landmark $35B Investment In India To Drive Digital Transformation

Not a bartender material, says Jeff Bezos





Amazon and how it changed shopping industry









Jeff Bezos has been credited to change the way people shop, however, the Amazon.com founder once revealed that his dream job was not running a trillion-dollar tech empire. In fact, his dream job was nothing related to technology but crafting high-end cocktails behind a bar. He was replying to a question from his brother Mark who asked about his dream job if money wasn't a factor.“I pride myself on my craft cocktails. I do have this fantasy that I want to be a bartender,” he said. The conversation in question is a 2017 discussion. While opening up more on his “fantasy” job, Bezos said that he has “glamorised the job” in his mind, but he loves talking about a well-made drink.Bezos, however, said that he is not a ‘bartender material’ because he is slow and takes his time when crafting cocktails. “I'm super slow,” he said, joking that his bar would charge premium prices to make drinks slow. Bezos also said he would have a sign behind him, “You can have it good or you can have it fast.”While Bezos may not have got his dream job, he made billions from heading Amazon. He has a net worth of $238.4 billion, according to Forbes Billionaire List, making him the fourth richest person on Earth. He founded the e-commerce giant in 1994, which is now worth nearly $2.5 trillion.In 2021, he stepped down as Amazon's chief executive officer. Bezos also founded Blue Origin, a space company focused on making space travel safer and more affordable, and competes with Elon Musk.Recently, Bezos again took a job where he will serve as co-CEO of a new AI startup that focuses on engineering and manufacturing of computers, automobiles and spacecraft. The company is called Project Prometheus and it garnered $6.2 billion in funding, partly from his own company Amazon, making it one of the most well-financed early-stage startups in the world.","The Amazon.com founder once revealed that his dream job was not running a trillion-dollar tech empire, but crafting high-end cocktails behind a bar.

The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.In a recent Bloomberg interview, Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously. “We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.The declaration arrives at a critical juncture for Microsoft’s AI ambitions. After 18 months of contractual restrictions preventing independent pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a new definitive agreement with OpenAI now permits Microsoft to develop superintelligence independently or with third parties. Suleyman, who joined Microsoft in March 2024 after co-founding DeepMind and Inflection, is assembling a dedicated superintelligence team to capitalize on this freedom.Suleyman’s position challenges Silicon Valley’s prevailing rush-to-market mentality. While competitors like OpenAI have committed over $1.5 trillion to data center construction and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg pledges up to $600 billion in AI infrastructure spending, Microsoft is emphasizing caution alongside capability. The company’s 50-year reputation serving 90% of the S&P 500 informs this measured approach, according to Suleyman.The AI chief acknowledged the industry stands at a crossroads, with systems potentially capable of setting their own goals, improving their own code, and acting autonomously emerging within five to ten years. “Those are capabilities that I’ve clearly outlined as increasing the level of risk,” he explained, calling for transparency, audits, and proactive government engagement as these thresholds approach.Despite Microsoft’s stated restraint, internal pressures persist. Recent reports suggest the company’s AI products face adoption challenges, with sales goals for Azure AI reduced across the board. Investors continue demanding clear profitability paths amid billion-dollar investments that show limited immediate returns.Suleyman envisions medical applications as superintelligence’s most promising near-term deployment. Microsoft is developing diagnostic systems capable of identifying rare conditions “significantly better than human performance, more cheaply, with fewer tests and with higher accuracy,” with independent peer review and clinical trials forthcoming. This focus reflects Suleyman’s personal values—his mother worked as a nurse—and his belief that technology should prioritize human wellbeing.Beyond healthcare, Suleyman predicts AI will fundamentally reshape work and society within 20-30 years, potentially sooner. He anticipates machines surpassing human capabilities at most tasks, necessitating universal basic income and wealth redistribution mechanisms to manage workforce displacement. “We already live in a world of abundance, it’s just poorly distributed,” he argued, suggesting AI could proliferate digital goods—ideas, knowledge, intelligence—at unprecedented scale.The executive’s political philosophy diverges sharply from Silicon Valley’s dominant libertarian ethos. Identifying as center-left, Suleyman champions government regulation as essential to AI’s healthy development, comparing it to automotive safety standards. “Cars only work because we have driver training, emissions regulations, streetlights and speed limits,” he noted, calling for financial stability boards, climate-style governance processes, and arms control frameworks adapted for AI.Suleyman’s warnings carry added weight given his insider status among AI’s elite circle. He maintains regular contact with former DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis, now leading Google’s AI efforts, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. While describing the competitive landscape as intense, Suleyman insisted all major players remain “genuinely committed to trying to find the right path through.” Microsoft’s revised OpenAI agreement runs through 2032, granting the company licenses to all OpenAI models while pursuing its own superintelligence development. The tech giant currently operates 33 gigawatts of computing capacity across its data center fleet, positioning it to compete aggressively while maintaining what Suleyman characterizes as ethical guardrails.",Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has warned the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us” The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
