EC looks to sort out legal issues for swift EPIC-Aadhaar linkage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-looks-to-sort-out-legal-issues-for-swift-epic-aadhaar-linkage/articleshow/119091531.cms,"New Delhi: Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar’s initiative to call a meeting with the home secretary, legislative department secretary and UIDAI CEO on Tuesday to discuss EPIC-aadhaar linkage, comes against the backdrop of the notified date for an existing elector to voluntarily intimate his aadhaar number to EC, having expired almost a year ago.There has been no extension after March 31, 2024, the outer time-limit last notified by the law ministry for existing electors to willingly share their aadhaar details to EC, in line with the Section 23 of Representation of the People Act, 1950, as amended via the Election Laws (Amendment) Act, 2022.In February 2024, the Supreme Court – while hearing a plea challenging the statutory form for voter enrolment on the ground that it left no scope for an applicant issued an aadhaar number but unwilling to furnish it, to submit an alternate identification – had dismissed the plea after being assured by EC that furnishing aadhaar was not mandatory and that it would write to the law ministry to amend the R P Act 1950 to clear any confusion in this regard.This was after EC counsel had informed the apex court that over 66.2 crore electors (as against the 99 crore currently enrolled) had voluntarily submitted their aadhaar details. Interestingly, as per law ministry’s replies to questions in Parliament, the poll panel is yet to link the aadhaar details intimated to it, with the EPIC database. This linkage is crucial to establishing voters’ identity via aadhaar – seen as the most error-free method to eliminate bogus and duplicate electors since it involves biometric authentication.The advantages of biometric authentication were encapsulated by former CEC Rajiv Kumar in his farewell speech. “Innovations like biometric authentication may further help prevent impersonation and multiple voting, ensuring that every vote belongs to the rightful voter,” he had said. An EC functionary explained to TOI that Article 326 of the Constitution casts a duty upon EC to ensure voting rights for all citizens above 18 years, and that Aadhaar Act is the only statutory framework to identify such eligible electors.The options to resume aadhaar seeding for the remaining 34 crore voters – likely to be discussed at the March 18 meeting -- may include making it mandatory for electors to intimate aadhaar – a proposal that may not sit well with opposition parties who could reiterate concerns like privacy and aadhaar loopholes. This will involve amendments to Section 23(5) of R P Act 1950 to replace the word ‘may’ with ‘shall’. Alternatively, only tweaks to R P Act to clear the current confusion over ‘voluntary’ nature of aadhaar intimation, may be considered. An attempt in this direction was made in early 2024 by EC, which wrote to the law ministry suggesting changes to Section 23(6) and Section 28(2)hhhb of the Act to remove the part requiring ‘sufficient cause’ for not furnishing an identity field other than aadhaar. There has however been no movement on the proposal.Now, with a new CEC in the saddle, the EC is once again pitching to revive the long-pending efforts at EPIC-aadhaar linkage – which took seed in 2015 but have since been overshadowed by court challenges and opposition from political parties, largely the regional ones.","The outer time-limit for an existing elector to voluntarily intimate his aadhaar number to EC, expired almost a year ago.

PM Modi on governance: ‘From appeasement to aspiration’

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that the discourse surrounding the 2002 post-Godhra riots in Gujarat was an attempt to push a false narrative, adding that despite efforts by his political opponents to hold him responsible, the courts found him innocent.Speaking in a podcast with Lex Fridman, which was released on Sunday, PM Modi refuted claims that the 2002 riots were the ""biggest riots ever"", calling it “misinformation.”""On February 24, 2002, I became a state representative, an elected representative for the first time. And it was only around February 24th, 25th, or 26th that I stepped into the Gujarat Assembly for the very first time. On February 27th, 2002, we were seated in the Assembly for the budget session. And that same day, it had been just three days since I’d become a state representative, when suddenly the horrific Godhra incident occurred,"" PM Modi said.""It was a tragedy of unimaginable magnitude, people were burned alive. You can imagine, against the backdrop of incidents like the Kandahar hijacking, the attack on Parliament, or even 9/11, and then to have so many people killed and burned alive, you can imagine how tense and volatile the situation was. Of course, this was tragic for everyone. Everyone prefers peace,"" he said.PM Modi cited the 1969 riots, which lasted over six months, as an example of Gujarat’s history of communal violence, emphasising that these incidents occurred long before he entered politics.""The perception that these were the biggest riots ever is actually misinformation. If you review the data from before 2002, you will see that Gujarat faced frequent riots. Curfews were constantly being imposed somewhere. Communal violence could erupt over trivial issues, like kite flying contests or even minor bicycle collisions. Before 2002, Gujarat witnessed over 250 significant riots. The riots in 1969 lasted nearly six months. So there was a long history, long before I was in the picture,"" he said.""But that one tragic incident in 2002 became a sparking point, leading some people towards violence. Yet, the judiciary thoroughly investigated the matter.The prime minister asserted that allegations against him were politically motivated, claiming that his opponents, who were in power at the Centre at the time, wanted to see him punished.“At that time, our political opponents were in power, and naturally they wanted all allegations against us to stick. Despite their relentless efforts, the judiciary analyzed the situation meticulously twice and ultimately found us completely innocent. Those who were truly responsible have faced justice from the courts,"" PM Modi said.PM Modi noted that the state, which once saw regular communal violence, has remained peaceful since 2002. “In the past 22 years, Gujarat has not witnessed a single major riot. The state remains completely peaceful,” he said.Fridman followed up by asking Modi how he perceives criticism, particularly when it comes to sensitive topics like the Gujarat riots ""Criticism is the soul of democracy,"" Modi responded. ""Our scriptures say: ‘Always keep your critics close,’ because they help you improve.""However, he was quick to differentiate between constructive criticism and what he called ""sensationalism"" in modern political discourse.“Genuine criticism is based on research and analysis. Unfortunately, today’s media and political opponents often take shortcuts, making unfounded accusations instead of engaging in thoughtful critique,” he said. “The references you’re giving, they are allegations, not criticism.”PM Modi suggested that much of the opposition he faced over the years stemmed from ideological biases rather than factual concerns.“Those who criticised me for the riots did not care about Gujarat’s history of violence before 2002. They were not interested in the transformation that happened after,” he said. “They only wanted to create a narrative that suited their agenda.”Moving beyond the riots, PM Modi outlined what he sees as his administration’s biggest achievement—shifting India’s political culture from ""appeasement politics"" to ""aspirational politics.""""For decades, politics was about appeasement—keeping certain groups happy for votes. We changed that. We focused on aspirational politics, where governance is about delivering results for everyone, not just selected communities,” he said.Modi reiterated his government's guiding principle: ""Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas"" (Together with everyone, development for all, trust from all, and efforts by everyone).“We have ensured that governance reaches the last person in the queue, regardless of caste, creed, or religion,” he added. “Whether it’s housing, electricity, sanitation, or digital payments, every Indian benefits. That is true development.”","Prime Minister Narendra Modi says the discourse surrounding the 2002 post-Godhra riots in Gujarat was an attempt to push a false narrative.

That is why you must learn to synchronize with everyone and everyone else must learn to synchronize with you. That’s the only way to propel this initiative forward.

""Look, Covid exposed the limitations of every nation. No matter how much we consider ourselves as a great nation, no matter how progressive we think we are, or how scientifically advanced we believe we’ve become, everyone has their own way of looking at things. In the end, we all found ourselves on the same ground. Every country in the world faced this reality. At that time, it felt like the world would learn from it, that we would move toward a more unified world. Just as a geopolitical order emerged after World War II, many thought something similar would happen post-Covid. But unfortunately, instead of moving towards peace, the world became even more fragmented, ushering in a period of uncertainty, and the wars have only made it worse,"" he said.","PM Narendra Modi spoke about global conflicts and the role of international organizations.

NEW DELHI: Congress leaders have strongly criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks on the 2002 Gujarat riots during his interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman, accusing him of deflecting responsibility.During the podcast, Fridman asked PM Modi about the riots, describing them as one of the most challenging periods in India’s modern history, leading to over 1,000 deaths. PM Modi, in response, placed the events in the context of a series of terrorist attacks in India and abroad, including the 1999 Kandahar hijacking, the 2001 Parliament attack, and the 9/11 attacks in the US.He argued that Gujarat had a long history of communal riots and claimed that after 2002, the state had remained peaceful for over two decades.Targeting PM Modi, Congress leader Danish Ali said that Prime Minister’s comments were an attempt to justify the riots, which he claimed reflected the failure of the then-Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led central government in handling law and order.“The way the PM has tried to justify the Godhra riots shows the failure of the Vajpayee government regarding law and order in the country. The way he talked about the Kandahar hijacking, the Parliament attack, and more, this is, in a way, a condemnation of the Vajpayee government,” Ali said.Former Uttarakhand chief minister and senior Congress leader Harish Rawat also criticised Modi, referring to Vajpayee’s well-known remark urging Modi to follow ""rajdharma"" (duty of governance).""When the Godhra incident happened and riots broke out, the scenes were gory. Finally, the PM had to ask to uphold 'rajdharma.' If anything is wrong, the leader has to take responsibility—it will always be with a leader. These words of Atalji will keep on echoing in his ears,"" Rawat said.In the podcast, PM Modi also pointed out that India’s Supreme Court had twice upheld that he had no involvement in the riots. He dismissed allegations against him as politically motivated, saying that his government had prioritised peace and development over “appeasement politics.”","Congress leaders strongly criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks on the 2002 Gujarat riots during his interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman.

Narendra Modi: Prime Minister of India - Power, Democracy, War & Peace | Lex Fridman Podcast #460

PM Modi on Swami Vivekananda

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s podcast with MIT scientist and AI researcher Lex Fridman was released on Sunday.During the conversation, PM Modi spoke on various topics, including the impact of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Hindu nationalism. When asked how he joined RSS, PM Modi said, ""In our village, there was a branch of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, where we played sports and sang patriotic songs. Something about those songs touched me deeply. They stirred something inside me, and that’s how I eventually became part of the RSS.""Speaking further the influence of RSS, PM Modi said, ""One of the core values that were instilled in us at RSS was, whatever you do, do it with a purpose. Even while studying, study with the goal of learning enough to contribute to the nation. Even when you exercise, do it with the purpose of strengthening your body to serve the nation. This is what we were taught. And today, RSS is a massive organization. It is now nearing its 100th anniversary. Such a massive volunteer organization likely doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world. Millions of people are connected to it, but understanding RSS is not that simple. One must make an effort to truly grasp the nature of its work. More than anything, the RSS provides you with a clear direction toward what can truly be called a purpose in life. Secondly, the nation is everything, and serving the people is akin to serving God.""Also read - PM Modi's podcast with Lex Fridman released: Talks about early life, journey in Himalayas, RSS, and Hindu nationalism PM Modi also said, ""Alongside education, values are prioritized, and students remain grounded, learning skills so they don’t become a burden on society. That is in every aspect of life, whether it’s women, youth, or even laborers, the RSS has played a role.""Talking further about the Sangh, PM said that he feels blessed to have gained life's purpose from such ""sacred"" organisation. ""The volunteers who come from the RSS follow their own interests, nature and inclination, and in doing so, they strengthen and promote these kinds of activities. When you observe these initiatives, you’ll see how over the past 100 years, the RSS has dedicated itself with the discipline and devotion of a seeker staying away from the glare of mainstream attention. I feel blessed to gain life’s values from such a sacred organization. Through the RSS, I found a life of purpose. Then I was fortunate to spend some time among the saints, which gave me a strong spiritual foundation. I found discipline and a life of purpose. And through the guidance of saints, I gained spiritual grounding,"" PM Modi said.PM Modi also spoke about Swami Vivekananda and his teachings. ""Wherever I go, I carry with me the essence of thousands of years of Vedic tradition, the timeless teachings of Swami Vivekananda, and the blessings, dreams, and aspirations of 1.4 billion Indians,"" he said.He also reflected on how Vivekananda inspired him. ""When I used to read about Swami Vivekananda or Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, I would often wonder, ‘How did they live? How did they build such remarkable lives?’ And for that, I constantly experimented on myself. Most of my experiments were physical in nature, testing my body’s limits.""He added that his interest in Vivekananda deepened as he read more. ""One time I read about Swami Vivekananda, his mother was ill. So, he went to Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa for guidance. He would argue with him, debate with him. In his early days, he would often argue with him, questioning everything intellectually.""PM Modi added, ""The teachings of Ramakrishna Mission, Swami Vivekananda, and the service-driven philosophy of the RSS have played a crucial role in shaping me.""Lex Fridman is a research scientist and hosts the ""Lex Fridman Podcast."" His podcast features discussions with various personalities on topics ranging from complex subjects to broader social issues.Notable guests on his podcast have included political leaders such as US President Donald Trump, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Argentina's Prime Minister Javier Milei, as well as business and academic figures like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Magnus Carlsen, and Yuval Noah Harari.Fridman posted on X, ""I had an epic 3-hour podcast conversation with @narendramodi, Prime Minister of India. It was one of the most powerful conversations of my life. It'll be out tomorrow.""PM Modi responded, calling it a ""fascinating conversation"" and mentioning that he spoke about different phases of his life, including his childhood, time in the Himalayas, and journey into public life.""It was indeed a fascinating conversation with @lexfridman, covering diverse topics including reminiscing about my childhood, the years in the Himalayas and the journey in public life. Do tune in and be a part of this dialogue!"" PM Modi wrote on X.In February, Fridman had described PM Modi as ""one of the most fascinating human beings I have ever studied.""","PM Narendra Modi’s podcast with MIT scientist and AI researcher Lex Fridman was released on Sunday.

THIRUVANANTHPURA: Moration and circulated among key government departments proposes sweeping changes to the state's land laws, paddy land and wetland protection regulations , and the powers of local self-government institutions (LSGIs).The proposals could dismantle some of the very laws that successive Left govts introduced - such as Kerala Land Reforms Act , Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land, and Wetland Act - along with the decentralized planning framework that gave local bodies control over industrial approvals. If implemented, the changes could lead to large-scale industrial land acquisition, widespread paddy land conversion , and reduced authority for local bodies.Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963, which abolished feudal ownership and imposed land ceilings to ensure equitable distribution, faces a potential major overhaul.The proposal suggests exempting all industries from land ceiling limits, which could open the floodgates for corporate land accumulation.It also recommends increasing the land ceiling for industrial projects from 15 acres to 100 acres, with the possibility of even larger exemptions granted by a high-level committee.While the government justifies these changes as necessary to attract large-scale investments, critics argue that they contradict the core principles of land reforms.Even more controversial is the proposed dilution of Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act, 2008, which was enacted to protect the state's rapidly shrinking agricultural land and wetlands.","Proposals could dismantle some of the very laws that successive Left govts introduced.

India to step on the gas for indigenous 5th gen fighter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-step-on-the-gas-for-indigenous-5th-gen-fighter/articleshow/119090404.cms,"NEW DELHI: India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, with a top-level committee now working to evolve a clear-cut strategy and production-cum-business model for the swing-role advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).The committee chaired by defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, which includes IAF vice chief Air Marshal S P Dharkar, secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar and top officials from DRDO and Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), is slated to submit its report next month.This comes at a time when Pakistan is looking to acquire at least 40 J-35A stealth fifth-generation jets from China, which is now brandishing even sixth-generation prototypes.China has already deployed its fifth-generation Chengdu J-20 jets at its airfields facing India like Hotan and Shigatse, as reported earlier by TOI.Faced with this, coupled with the huge delay in production of the fourth-generation Tejas jets by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a source told TOI that the committee's aim is to ""devise how best to get AMCA from the drawing board into the air by shrinking timelines and improving efficiency, including a good workable production-cum-business model with much greater private sector participation"".The committee will also consider the plan for indigenous development of a 110 kilonewton thrust-class engine to power the 25-tonne AMCA with foreign technology collaboration. Aero-engine majors like US General Electric, French Safran and British Rolls-Royce are in the fray for this. The new panel was formed after another defence secretary-led committee chalked out a detailed roadmap for IAF's ""all-round capability enhancement"" to plug existing operational gaps in a time-bound manner. The report was presented to defence minister Rajnath Singh on March 3, as was then reported by TOI.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the full-scale engineering development of five prototypes of the twin-engine AMCA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore. The AMCA, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and ""serpentine air-intake"", however, will be ready for production only by 2035 at the earliest as per existing timelines. ""It will be a challenge to compress timelines but a major effort has to be made due to IAF's expanding technological shortfalls,"" another source said, in the backdrop of IAF currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised. At least eight more squadrons are slated for retirement over the next 10 years. IAF currently plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, which will also have AI-powered electronic pilot systems, netcentric warfare systems, integrated vehicle health management and the like. While the first two squadrons will be powered by GE-F414 engines in the 98 kilonewton thrust class, the next five will have 110 kilonewton engines.In the interim, the dwindling numbers are to be progressively made up by induction of 180 Tejas Mark-1A fighters (for around Rs 1.2 lakh crore) and 108 more capable Tejas Mark-2 jets .Parallelly, the long-pending project to manufacture 114 4.5-generation multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) with foreign collaboration as reported by TOI earlier.",India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi asserted that a fake narrative was spread to malign his image over the Gujarat riots in 2002, while emphasising that the burning of kar sevaks coming back from Ayodhya acted as a spark at a time when the situation was already tense because of a number of attacks carried out by Islamic terrorist groups in India as well as abroad.Talking to Lex Fridman, research scientist at MIT and a leading podcaster, Modi listed the terror attacks - hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane to Kandahar, attacks on Red Fort and the J&K assembly, the Al Qaida strike on New York and the attack on India's Parliament in the months leading up to the Feb 2002 riots which already had public opinion in India tense and on the edge.""In such situations, a spark is enough to cause disturbance and such a situation had already built up... and then the pilgrims were killed, burnt alive, you can imagine the situation that arose, given the background,"" Modi told the famous podcaster who fasted for hours to prepare for the more than three-hour-long conversation with the PM.""Nothing untoward should have happened, true. I also wish the same,"" Modi added. He also took issue with the ""narrative"" on the 2002 riots being an unprecedented phenomenon, recalling that Gujarat's communal situation had been traditionally inflammable and minor skirmishes would set off conflagrations.He also said that while a narrative was built to damage his image, the judiciary had cleared him.The conversation saw the PM touching upon his equations with RSS by launching into fulsome praise of the Sangh. He said it was his good fortune to be part of the Sangh tradition which places patriotism and public service above everything else. He detailed the activities of different Sangh outfits, focusing on Seva Bharati, Vidya Bharati, Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, ""perhaps the world's largest trade union body which unlike the Leftist ones which believe in 'workers of the world unite' subscribes to the motto 'unite the world' philosophy"".Modi also praised Mahatma Gandhi had called him ""GOAT"". ""Mahatma Gandhi wasn't just a 20th-century leader. His relevance transcends centuries. His legacy will last for centuries to come, and he remains relevant to date.""This was the second time after his speech at a Marathi literary festival in Delhi in Feb that Modi has publicly lavished praise on RSS: something which was seen through the prism of speculation about their tense ties during the Lok Sabha campaign and because of crucial decisions, like appointment of a new BJP chief, expected shortly.Modi said RSS teaches that the country is supreme and serving people is like serving God, adding that the organisation gave him a ""purpose"" in life. ""I feel blessed to have got values from such a sacred organisation,"" he said.Asked about the Department of Government Efficiency US President Donald Trump has launched under Elon Musk, Modi said while the initiative has been talked about, he had also tried to improve efficiency in govt and make it more responsive since taking over in 2014. He mentioned the removal of ghost beneficiaries of development schemes, elimination of middlemen and launch of DBT and said it had resulted in saving of Rs 3 lakh crore.","PM Narendra Modi spoke to Lex Fridman, research scientist at MIT and a leading podcaster.

Rising temperatures, high population density, and rapid infrastructure development have made the region more vulnerable to avalanches, the study found.The worst-affected areas include Lahaul & Spiti in Himachal Pradesh and Chamoli in Uttarakhand. The study, titled 'A multi-aggregation approach to estimate avalanche vulnerability and suggest phase-wise adaptation', was conducted by Akshay Singhal, M Kavya, and Sanjeev K.

He suggested that India should explore opportunities in Africa, recognising it as a potential power centre in the evolving geopolitical landscape.“The rise of China as a dominant economic and strategic force adds complexity, creates competition, and hampers India's effort to be the natural leader for the Global South,” he said.Discussing India’s global standing, General Dwivedi noted the obstacles the country faces in influencing key international decisions despite its demographic and strategic advantages.“With the democratic shift and resource control race, we need to look at possibilities of Africa as a future power centre... India’s position will remain pivotal due to its geography, demography, democracy, prosperity, soft power, and inclusive approach... India, despite having the largest population, largest democracy, 7th largest land mass, and a geostrategic location, continues to remain at a relatively lower global standing,” he stated.He also pointed to international roadblocks that have limited India’s influence, referencing setbacks faced by BRICS and the resistance from the Trump administration towards its financial initiatives. “We have been repeatedly blocked, leaving us with little ability to shape key international decisions directly. Even BRICS has faced setbacks... Its purported attempt to upend the mighty US dollar has invited an open pushback from the Trump administration. In light of the same, we need to closely watch SCO ( Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ),” he said.Emphasising the role of emerging technologies in national security, General Dwivedi underscored the need for technological advancements to enhance India's strategic deterrence.“Security is about wholesome capability to wage war and deter war. Healthy military-civil fusion, Aatm Nirbhar defence industrial base, dual-use assets at the national level, well-informed and empowered decision-makers of time framework, and inclusive approach for citizen warriors play a pivotal role,” he said.“Technology prowess has become the new currency of deterrence. Data has become the new capital of trade and security,” he added.He also spoke about the significance of anti-colonial alliances in shaping a stable global order. “I imagine what Gen Rawat would have said had he been required to give us some guidelines on the envisaged role of India in the emerging security paradigm in the centrality of security forces, anti-colonial allies champion multi-world order and bandwagoning of nations helps prevent conflict. Thus, be a part of all frameworks like SCO, BRICS, BIMSTEC, Indian Ocean Regional Association, etc,” he said.General Dwivedi called for India to strengthen its role in global governance, advocating for reforms in the United Nations Security Council and greater involvement in international conflict resolution.“Reform the UN Security Council to include global South representatives. Play an active role in conflict resolution as a negotiator or a mediator. Harness the positive strength of the Indian diaspora the world over for humanitarian causes. Share a common platform for global commerce, enable the emergence of the global South, be the leader in sharing additional resources with the have-nots for better socioeconomic development,” he said.He also stressed India’s leadership in peacekeeping operations and counterterrorism efforts, reaffirming the military’s alignment with national priorities.“Lead peacekeeping operations, advocate nuclear weapons as a political asset only for deterrent purposes as long as possible, lead GWOT ( Global War on Terrorism ) by virtue of facing it firsthand in J&K, the northeast, and against left-wing extremism; I would like to assure you that the Indian Army remains aligned and integrated with the nation,” he added.","Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi highlighted the challenges posed by China's rise as a dominant economic and strategic force. He said it hampers India's ability to position itself as the natural leader of the Global South. He suggested that India should explore opportunities in Africa, recognising it as a potential power centre.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119088650,imgsize-565377,width-400,resizemode-4/119088650.jpg"

During the same podcast, Kylie shared how they’ve yet to settle on a name and might even surprise everyone with an unconventional choice. ""There is a good chance that this child doesn't even get two T's,"" Kylie teased. ""People are very invested in this, but I just feel like a curveball might be fun.""Kylie also opened up about the physical toll of pregnancy in a previous episode.

"Maharashtra among hottest places in India as heat streak continues; Chandrapur sizzles at 42°C, Pune above 40°C",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/maha-among-hottest-places-in-india-as-heat-streak-continues-chandrapur-sizzles-at-42c-pune-above-40c/articleshow/119056161.cms,"PUNE: Parts of Maharashtra, especially locations in Vidarbha, were among the hottest places in India on Saturday as above-normal maximum temperatures continue to persist for over a month, taking a severe toll on those without air-conditioners and adequate cooling facilities.The extended heat spell has been going on since early Feb, with sporadic instances when even night temperatures have been high. These high day temperatures have been coupled with a significant drop in humidity. For instance, in Pune, relative humidity has been in the range of 16-25% during afternoons, making it more uncomfortable.Experts said the combination of high temperatures and low humidity levels ""creates a dangerous situation for the human body"". When humidity is low, sweat evaporates quickly from the skin. This might give a false sense of comfort, but actually accelerates dehydration.Friday's data confirmed the continuing trend, with Chandrapur recording a scorching 41.4°C, making it not only the hottest spot in Maharashtra but also among the hottest locations in India. Other stations were not far behind, with Bramhapuri (41.2°C), Solapur (41.1°C), and Wardha (41°C) crossing the 41°-C mark.Most stations are recording temperatures 3-5 degrees above normal, with Amravati showing a departure of nearly 5 degrees and Wardha 6 degrees above the normal values. The Vidarbha region remains most affected, with seven spots there either touching or crossing the 40°C-mark.The heat continued on Saturday too. Saturday's data showed temperatures climbing even higher across Maharashtra, with Chandrapur recording a blistering 42°C, making it the hottest location in the state and among the hottest ones in India. On Saturday, over nine stations across Maharashtra crossed the 40°C-mark — Akola (41.3°C), Wardha (41°C), Chandrapur (42°C), Bramhapuri (40.8°C), Amravati (40.4°C), Nagpur (40.2°C), Solapur (40.3°C), Lohegaon (40.3°C) and Malegaon (40°C).The Vidarbha region continues to bear the brunt of the heat, with six of its monitoring stations recording temperatures above 40°C. Temperature departures from normal remained significant, with Wardha showing the highest departure at 6 degrees above normal, followed by Chandrapur at 5 degrees, Brahmapuri 4.9 degrees and Akola and Amravati 4.6 degrees above normal.""Heatwave conditions are likely to prevail in Vidarbha region for the next two days,"" said S D Sanap, scientist at IMD Pune. ""We, however, do not anticipate heatwave conditions in Madhya Maharashtra, Konkan or Marathwada during this period. There are indications of light rainfall in Marathwada around March 20-21.""Several locations outside Maharashtra also recorded scorching temperatures on Saturday. In Odisha, Boudh reached 42.5°C, making it the hottest location in the country.Parts of Odisha experienced similarly extreme heat, with Sambalpur (42.2°C), Jharsuguda (41.8°C), and Angul (41.7°C) registering temperatures well above 40°C. Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh recorded a maximum temperature of 40.5°C.In Jharkhand, three locations crossed the 40°C threshold, including Chaibasa (41.0°C) and Daltonganj (40.7°C), Telangana's Adilabad also joined the list at 40.8°C.Sanap explained that the current weather models were not yet showing clear signals for pre-monsoon showers in Madhya Maharashtra. ""We are continuously monitoring the situation. At present, we have not issued any rainfall forecast for Madhya Maharashtra.""Sanap confirmed that day temperatures had consistently remained above normal since Feb across most parts of Maharashtra. ""We expect a marginal relief from the current high temperatures starting Sunday or Monday, though the decrease will likely be modest — around 1-2°Celsius. Some moisture incursion has begun, which could influence weather patterns in the coming days,"" he said.In Pune city, Koregaon Park (40.4°C) was the hottest location on Saturday, followed by Lohegaon. Shivajinagar recorded a day temperature of 38.7°C, but the location can expect a drop to 36-37° C in the coming days because of a forecast of partly cloudy skies in afternoon and evening.","Parts of Maharashtra, especially locations in Vidarbha, were among the hottest places in India on Saturday.

Infosys cofounder Narayana Murthy: Somehow it has become a fashion in India to ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/infosys-cofounder-narayana-murthy-somehow-it-has-become-a-fashion-in-india-to-/articleshow/118991651.cms,"How Narayana Murthy defines AI

Narayana Murthy agrees AI will lead to job losses, but ...

NR Narayana Murthy , co-founder of Infosys , spoke at TiECon Mumbai on Wednesday, attempting to temper the overhyped buzz surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) in India. He pointed out that many systems marketed as AI were simply traditional programming. “I think somehow it has become a fashion in India to talk of AI for everything. I have seen several normal, ordinary programs touted as AI,” Murthy commented during the annual entrepreneurial conference.In a discussion with Harish Mehta, founding president of TiE Mumbai, Murthy clarified that genuine AI rests on two key pillars: Machine learning , which facilitates extensive correlation for predictions, and Deep Learning, which emulates human brain function through unsupervised algorithms.""Frankly, most of what passes for AI these days is trivial and outdated coding,"" Murthy asserted. ""It's the unsupervised algorithms leveraging deep learning and neural networks that hold far greater promise for increasingly human-like capabilities.""Murthy went on to add that deep learning will be able to solve, and handle what are called “unsupervised algorithms”. While machine learning by and large handles supervised algorithms because you have to give a lot of data into that, deep learning uses the data to create new branches of programs or new conditions.

Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg visits White House for second meeting with Donald Trump since taking office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-mark-zuckerberg-visits-white-house-meeting-with-donald-trump/articleshow/118959868.cms,"

Mark Zuckerberg's second meet after Donald Trump assumed office

Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg visited the White House on Wednesday for meetings with Trump administration officials, Reuters reported. “Mark’s continuing the meetings he's been holding with the administration on American technology leadership,” Meta spokesman Andy Stone told the news agency, though he did not confirm the White House visit.Zuckerberg’s meeting comes just weeks after he made headlines for showcasing Meta’s advancements in artificial intelligence and the metaverse . Last month, the Facebook founder demonstrated the latest AI-powered features integrated into Meta’s platforms, emphasizing the company’s commitment to staying at the forefront of technological innovation.The social media giant is reportedly testing its first internally developed chip designed for training artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Meta is partnering with Taiwan-based TSMC to manufacture the chip. Testing began after Meta completed its first “tape-out” - a critical phase in chip development that involves sending an initial design through a chip factory.This development holds much significance as the company joins other tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to create custom silicon and decrease dependence on external suppliers such as Nvidia.This is Zuckerberg’s second visit to the White House in two months. Last month, he met with officials to discuss Meta’s role in advancing U.S. technological leadership. Stone had then confirmed the February 6 visit, stating on X:“Mark Zuckerberg was at the White House today to discuss how Meta can help the administration defend and advance American tech leadership abroad.”Zuckerberg has been actively engaging with policymakers on AI regulations, digital infrastructure, and the role of U.S. tech firms in global competition. His interactions with the administration have also included two reported meetings with Trump at Mar-a-Lago before he took office.","Mark Zuckerberg visited the White House on Wednesday for meetings with Trump administration officials, Reuters reported.

Tech layoffs: Citigroup to slash IT contractors by 30% amid regulatory overhaul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-layoffs-citigroup-to-slash-it-contractors-by-30-amid-regulatory-overhaul/articleshow/119097673.cms,"Citigroup layoffs: Reason behind the job cuts

Citigroup has announced plans to significantly reduce its reliance on IT contractors, cutting their numbers by 30%. This move is part of a broader strategy to strengthen internal technology capabilities and address regulatory concerns over data governance and risk management.Currently, 50% of Citigroup's IT workforce consists of external contractors. The bank aims to reduce this figure to 20%, replacing contractors with full-time employees. As part of this transition, Citigroup plans to increase its internal IT staff to 50,000 by the end of 2025, up from 48,000 in 2024. The company will also consolidate its IT operations, moving teams from Rutherford, New Jersey, to a new facility in Jersey City.“Citi is growing our internal technology capabilities to support our strategy to improve safety and soundness, enable revenue growth and drive efficiencies,” the company told Reuters.The decision comes in the wake of regulatory penalties and a $136 million fine imposed on Citigroup in 2024 for deficiencies in data governance. Additionally, a recent $22.9 million fraud incident involving external contractors highlighted the risks associated with outsourcing. Citigroup's leadership has emphasized the need to enhance operational safety and soundness by bringing critical technology functions in-house.While the move may lead to job losses among contractors, Citigroup's investment in internal teams aims to ensure long-term stability and compliance with regulatory standards.","Citigroup plans to reduce its reliance on IT contractors by 30%.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
