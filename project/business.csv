Make for India: FMCG companies think & design desi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/make-for-india-fmcg-companies-think-design-desi/articleshow/114753835.cms,"MUMBAI: Inside Hindustan Unilever 's headquarters in Mumbai, a section of the research and development team is busy studying consumer trends and drawing up ideas on the next set of products that the company should push into retail shelves to cater to changing consumer tastes. As Indians become discerning and selective in terms of the products they consume, FMCG firms are increasingly focusing on local nuances and ""designing for India"".At HUL, which is relying heavily on technology to bring products to the market faster, the way the firm processes products for different regions has also undergone a change. ""In South, the Red Label tea we sell is a finer blend. In North, the tea is more daaneydar (grainier). The way we process the tea is also quite different,"" Vibhav Sanzgiri, executive director (R&D) at HUL, said. India's varying weather patterns, diverse tastes and cultures have necessitated companies to design for the Indian palate. ""We are looking at health, taste, wellness, fragrance and even packaging,"" said Sanzgiri, who leads a team of over 800 scientists across HUL's three R&D centres in India.Besides, consumers today are willing to pay a premium for differentiated products, enabling firms to pack more in a product. Colgate-Palmolive, for instance, has introduced arginine-based toothpaste in the Indian market considering consumers' affinity for snacking and sugary food. ""While designing and developing products for Indian consumers, we need to build on the various nuances of Indian taste preferences and ensure what is the target consumer group. Given our population size, we have to innovate for all age groups and specialised needs as all of them are quite substantial,"" Swati Agarwal, executive vice-president (IGTC) at Colgate-Palmolive India, said. It is also packing its shower gels with localised fragrances.For Marico , building for India is all about offering healthier options without compromising on the taste. To that end, the company has been pushing honey, millets, soya chunks and oodles into the market under the Saffola brand. The offerings come after its oats, infused with Indianised flavours, gained acceptance among consumers. ""Indian consumer preferences are continually evolving. There is a growing demand for healthier and sustainable FMCG products,"" said Dr Shilpa Vora, chief R&D officer. A recent study by venture capital firm Fireside Ventures showed that urban Indian consumers are willing to pay upto a 15% premium across food categories (covers five segments including staples, functional beverages and healthy snacks) and up to 30% for healthier snacking, functional drinks and ready-to-eat/ready-to-cook items.Nestle India has tapped into this premiumisation trend to launch over 140 new products in the market over the past eight years. Some of these like the Maggi oats-millets and KitKat Dessert Delight Strawberry were later taken to other global markets. ""Everybody is aspiring for the best product suited for them and this trend will continue. Indians today travel much more, they have more global exposure, the influence on consumers is unconstrained and we might even leapfrog certain global trends,"" Sanzgiri said.Recently, PepsiCo India added a localised red chilli flavour variant in its Lay's portfolio to appeal to desi nuances. ""As a nation of many Indias, Lay's recognises the importance of tailoring its products to cater to diverse preferences,"" Soumya Rathor, category lead (potato chips) at PepsiCo India, said.","FMCG firms are increasingly focusing on local nuances and ""designing for India"" India's varying weather patterns, diverse tastes and cultures have necessitated companies to design for the Indian palate.

The Nifty Financial Services, IT, Media, and Metal indices also opened higher. The Nifty mid and small-cap indices opened flat in the broader markets.The Nifty 50 has fallen nearly 8per cent from its all-time high on September 27, weighed down by foreign outflows over the past 20 sessions, as investors shift funds to China due to Beijing's stimulus measures and relatively lower valuations.Analysts noted that weak earnings have also negatively impacted investor sentiment and contributed to the selling pressure, in addition to foreign selling.Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, stated, ""The trend of flight to quality is likely to sustain given the good numbers from banking majors like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank where valuations continue to be fair. Investors can profit from these polarised valuations.""""The global market structure may turn favourable after the subdued Israeli strikes against Iran avoiding the Iranian oil fields which has resulted in a sharp drop in crude prices.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday strongly refuted allegations of poll irregularities in Haryana, calling them ""baseless"". In a formal communication to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge , the ECI outlined its findings, asserting that each stage of the electoral process was meticulously conducted under the observation of Congress candidates or their agents in democratic processes.""The Commission categorically rejects all baseless allegations and apprehensions conveyed by INC regarding all aspects of the electoral process in the recently concluded election to the state assembly of Haryana,"" said the commission in its statement.It further added that ""the Commission normally refrains from responding to grievances relating to constituency specific decentralised electoral processes, whether in case of electoral roll or candidates or deployment of man and material or conduct of poll or counting, officials like ERO/ RO/DEO being the fully empowered election authorities. However, ECI is duty bound to protect and defend the integrity of the core design of this statutory decentralized scheme, that is being sought to be eroded or duplicated, by 'generic' petitions/grievances setting out false narratives without any evidence whatsoever, raised in proximity to polling or counting day, which have serious potential to fuel the surcharged environment.""The EC also said that raising such complaints can cause issues in the country. ""It is needless to remind that such frivolous and unfounded doubts have the potential of creating turbulence when crucial steps like polling and counting are in live play, a time when both public and political parties’ anxiousness is peaking,"" it said.Calling the approach of the party ""carrying baseless allegations"" publicly ""disconcerting"" the EC said that it is ""compelled to note that with no evidence whatsoever of any statutory electoral step being compromised and candidate’s consent to proceed to each next stage being on record; the INC has once again raised the smoke of a “generic” doubt about the credibility of an entire electoral outcome exactly in similar manner as it has done in recent past.Directing its remarks towards the Congress, it said, ""This is least expected of a national political party. The Commission appreciates the criticality of the considered views of political parties in sustaining and strengthening electoral democracy in the country and assures that it will remain committed towards timely grievance redressal. At the same time, the Commission sincerely urges INC to take firm and concrete steps, matching with the party’s long and illustrious standing, to amend their afore stated approach and in doing so set an example for emulation by one and all to responsibly conduct themselves at sensitive electoral stages so as to avoid possibilities of precipitation of public unrest and chaos.""The commission further added that various Constitutional Courts delivered 42 judgments affirming the reliability of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) after thoroughly examining available records and evidence. The Courts broadly observed that ""EVMs are not hackable"", and there is ""no material on record to evidence that the EVMs in India are unreliable or suffer from any drawback"". With the VVPAT system, EVMs ""ensure the accuracy of the voting system"".The Congress had stated that EVMs associated with the BJP displayed battery levels of 99%, while those indicating victories for Congress showed only 60-70% charge.In response, the EC said that it has released comprehensive information on its website addressing common questions about EVM battery operations. The FAQ section elaborates on multiple technical aspects of the power systems used in EVMs.The document explains different battery varieties and clarifies the application of alkaline cells. It distinguishes between the power packs used in EVMs and those found in mobile phones. Additionally, it details how EVMs maintain consistent performance across varying voltage levels.The information also addresses a specific query about why the power pack indicator often displays 99 percent charge even after continuous usage throughout polling day.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday strongly refuted allegations of poll irregularities in Haryana.

Such an integrated approach will ensure that India can not only produce advanced military aircraft but also maintain and upgrade them over time, thereby enhancing operational readiness and sustainability for the Indian Air Force (IAF) Modernisation of air transport capabilities: The C-295 is a versatile medium tactical transport aircraft capable of performing various missions, including troop transport, cargo delivery, medical evacuation, and maritime patrol. Its ability to operate from short and unpaved runways makes it particularly suited for diverse operational environments.

Indigenous production: Under this deal, 16 aircraft will be delivered in a fly-away condition from Spain within 48 months, while the remaining 40 will be manufactured in India by Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) at the new facility in Vadodara. This marks a historic moment as it is the first instance where a complete military aircraft will be manufactured in India by a private entity. The deal includes a 30% offset requirement, which mandates that Airbus invest back into the Indian economy through procurement from local suppliers. This aspect not only boosts local industries but also encourages foreign companies to engage more deeply with Indian businesses.

NEW DELHI: The inauguration of India's first private military aircraft manufacturing facility, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez in Vadodara on Monday, marks a significant milestone in the nation's defence-manufacturing landscape.The inauguration is a major shift towards greater self-reliance in defense production, aligning with the Centre's ' Make in India ' initiative. The facility will primarily focus on the assembly of the Airbus C-295 aircraft, which is set to enhance the capabilities of the Indian Air Force (IAF) while fostering indigenous manufacturing.The facility is expected to become operational by November this year, with the first indigenously manufactured C-295 projected to roll out by September 2026.The C-295 deal, valued at approximately ₹21,935 crore (around $2.5 billion), involves the procurement of 56 aircraft to replace the aging Avro-748 fleet currently used by the IAF. This acquisition is significant for several reasons:The C-295 deal is a cornerstone of the 'Make in India' initiative. By facilitating the local production of military aircraft, this project not only enhances India's defense capabilities but also promotes economic growth through job creation and technology transfer.During the inauguration ceremony, PM Modi emphasised the importance of the facility in bolstering India's defense capabilities and self-reliance, giving a ""boost to our mission of Make in India, Make for the World"".He stated that the establishment of this manufacturing unit represents a new era for India's defense sector, where private participation is crucial for innovation and efficiency.""The aircraft manufactured at this facility will also be exported in future,"" he said, while expressing hope that the ecosystem created by the facility will help India manufacture civil aircraft in future as well.""Today, I am looking beyond just manufacturing transport aircraft. You all must have seen the unprecedented growth and transformation of the country's aviation sector in the last decade. We are already working to make India a hub of aviation and MRO domain. I am sure this ecosystem will pave way for 'Made in India' civil aircraft,"" he said.PM Modi further noted that this initiative aligns with India's broader strategic goals to enhance national security through indigenous capabilities.He remarked on how this project will not only strengthen the IAF but also contribute significantly to India's status as a global player in aerospace manufacturing.The PM reiterated that such initiatives are vital for achieving Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), underscoring the government's commitment to empowering local industries and fostering technological advancements within the country.","The C-295 is a versatile medium tactical transport aircraft capable of performing various missions, including troop transport, cargo delivery, medical evacuation, and maritime patrol.

Russia is getting Nvidia AI chips from an Indian pharma company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russia-is-getting-nvidia-ai-chips-mumbai-drugmaker-putin-shreya-life-sciences-importgenius/articleshow/114672764.cms,"Doing business with Russia is not illegal in India.



BRICS Leader's Summit In Kazan

Occupying the top three floors of an unremarkable office building in northern Mumbai, there’s little to distinguish Shreya Life Sciences from the many other commercial businesses that keep the Andheri neighborhood of India’s largest metropolis humming throughout the day.But this inconspicuous pharmaceutical company is part of a lucrative trade in leading-edge technology to Russia that has the US and its European allies worried at India’s burgeoning role as an intermediary in the sales.A Bloomberg News analysis of data compiled by trade-tracking firms ImportGenius and NBD shows that Shreya exported 1,111 units of Dell Technologies Inc’s most-advanced servers to Russia in April-August of this year.The servers, known as PowerEdge XE9680, contain high-end processors optimized for artificial intelligence made by Nvidia Corp or Advanced Micro Devices Inc, according to Dell’s website. Specification data available for 998 shipped servers show they were equipped with Nvidia’s H100 chips.The servers — and the chips they contain — are on a list of items restricted by the US and the European Union “to target sensitive sectors in Russia’s military industrial complex.” Yet the shipments, worth $300 million and imported by two Russian trading companies, Main Chain Ltd and I.S LLC, were just the latest in a series of advanced technology exports Shreya made perfectly legally to Russia since September 2022, the data showed.Shreya did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and no one was available to do so during two visits to its office.The findings underscore the holes in western government attempts to shut off Moscow’s access to dual-use technology with potential military applications, as well as the cutting-edge nature of the equipment being shipped. India is increasingly the intermediary of choice: It’s now the second-biggest supplier after China of restricted technology to Russia, Bloomberg reported October 12.Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, complained in a post on X that Russia is still receiving components used for electronic intelligence and warfare systems despite western sanctions. “No one should profit from the lives of Ukrainians,” he said October 7.While India is the point of transshipment, trade data suggest that Malaysia is in fact the origin. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim met with President Vladimir Putin in Russia in September, and hailed the “enormous potential” to enhance regional trade relations, including through advanced technologies.Shipping documents of at least 834 PowerEdge XE9680 units destined for Russia showed their country of origin as Malaysia. Indian import data for March-August 2024 reveals that 1,407 of the same Dell units were imported to India from Malaysia. Neither Malaysia’s Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry nor the Prime Minister’s Office responded to an email seeking comments.The tech companies themselves are obligated to follow sanctions rules and monitor any sales of sensitive products. In a statement, Dell said that it had ceased selling and offering services or support for products in Russia in February 2022, immediately following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and maintains “a strict trade compliance program.” Nvidia and AMD said that they work with partners to ensure that sales are in “full compliance” with export controls, and take appropriate action if any violations are identified.Doing business with Russia is not illegal in India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is not party to the multiple rounds of US and EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. Long dependent upon Russia for military equipment, New Delhi stepped in to buy its crude as European countries cut off oil imports over the war — and is signaling that it will continue to do so for as long as Moscow gives bigger discounts than other producers. During an October 22 meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, Modi referred to “our close and deepening” relations.That role has put India on the radar of western governments. US and EU officials have traveled to India in recent months as part of efforts to encourage the government to act to stop the shipments, according to people familiar with the trips. The visits come amid signs of mounting exasperation with India for its role procuring goods for Russia’s war.US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo sent a letter to the Confederation of Indian Industry this summer warning that foreign financial institutions trading with Russia’s military industrial base risked being sanctioned. Despite the Biden administration’s efforts to keep Modi’s government onside in its competition with China, New Delhi has shown little engagement with the US concerns, a senior US official said.Transshipment of battlefield products via India has ramped up since December of last year, according to David O’Sullivan, the EU’s chief sanctions official. In a briefing to reporters, he attributed the increase to “the huge volume of rupees” Russia has accrued from selling oil, rather than Indian policy. The EU has already sanctioned a few entities based in India.India has looked into US allegations and taken action as needed after Washington flagged that some Indian companies were supplying dual-use technology to Russia, said people familiar with the government’s stance, asking not to be named discussing sensitive matters of diplomacy. That matter is now closed, the people said, adding that Shreya Life Sciences did not feature on the list.A spokesperson for India’s Trade Ministry didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. The Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment.India’s exports of controlled and dual-use goods and technologies are in full compliance with its national laws and regulations and its international obligations on non-proliferation, said a senior Indian official who asked not be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.Bloomberg has previously reported that the vast majority of restricted goods enter Russia via re-exports from third countries such as China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Some of those trades involve often unwitting subsidiaries and subcontractors of western firms as well as networks of intermediaries who source from them.Information on those companies involved is rare — and the paper trail leading to Shreya is what makes the drugmaker stand out.The company was founded in Moscow in 1995 by Sujit Kumar Singh just as Russia was on the verge of economic breakdown, offering opportunities for enterprising individuals able to navigate the chaos of those years. Singh, the company’s CEO, was unavailable for comment despite email, telephone and text requests sent to Shreya.In an article for the Economic Times published in 2002, Singh wrote of Shreya’s initial role in developing a marketing and distribution network at a time when “after the collapse of the Soviet Union the pharmaceutical market was practically reduced to zero.” He also expressed hopes that a visit to India by Putin the same year would “impart a new impetus and greater depth and content to Indo-Russian relations.”Records from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs database show that Shreya began life as a distribution and marketing company of pharmaceutical drugs, over time acquiring several companies to create its own manufacturing plants for generic drugs like insulin, antibiotics, anti-malaria and gastrointestinal medicines. Indeed, between January 2022 and August 2024, it sold $22 million worth of pharmaceutical products to Russia, trade data shows. Russia is listed on the company website as the first among six major markets for its international exports.That dependence on Russia has proven to be a liability in the past. Shreya began seeing a dip in operating revenues in 2014-15 coinciding with Putin’s annexation of Crimea that led to sanctions and a collapse in the ruble, according to rating agency Crisil. As Shreya relied on sales of its drugs to Russian clients and to its own entity based in Moscow, Shreya Life Sciences LLC, the company began bleeding losses.The drugmaker defaulted on 1.9 billion rupees ($23 million) of bank loans in March 2015. While its bankers — including the State Bank of India and the LIC Housing Finance Ltd. — restructured its debt, the Bank of India Ltd. filed a suit against the company under the bankruptcy law in 2019, only to later withdraw the petition after the matter was settled out of court.Shreya returned to profitability in the following years. But the biggest lifeline for the Indian concern came from state-owned Promsvyazbank PJSC in Moscow. The bank’s head is Peter Fradkov, son of the former chief of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, Mikhail Fradkov. Both the bank and Fradkov junior are subject to international sanctions.Between 2011 and 2013, Shreya borrowed $86 million from the Russian bank, in the form of a foreign currency loan which was mortgaged against shares owned by Sujit Kumar Singh. The money was used to invest in equity shares of Shreya Life Sciences LLC in Moscow, which in turn used the money to pay for the import of pharmaceutical products from the Indian entity. The loan effectively helped keep the company afloat as the drugmaker sold a significant amount of its products to its own subsidiary.Later, in 2018, as other financial institutions grew wary of tightening western sanctions, Russia turned the lender into the key funder of its defense industry. Throughout that time, the bank seems to have allowed Shreya to defer its repayments consistently, as cash flow payments toward its borrowings were a fraction of what was due. As of 2022-23, the company had 7.6 billion rupees in borrowings of which 85% is owed to Promsvyazbank. An email to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.Meantime, local drug inspectors found deficiencies in insulin injections manufactured by Shreya in 2019, while its products were found to be “not of standard quality” most recently in April by the Central Drug Laboratory in Kolkata.It’s against this backdrop that Shreya began branching out into technology shipments.The first record of non-medical exports by Shreya during the period examined by Bloomberg appeared in September 2022, when it shipped an assortment of computer hardware to Russia worth $755,333. The recipient was Lanprint Ltd., a Russian trading company which was later added to the US sanctioned company list, in September 2023. It sold equipment to another company, Silkway LLC, which was sanctioned the same month.Shreya stopped dealing with both companies two months before they were sanctioned and started selling to Main Chain, which is not on the US list of sanctioned entities.Main Chain was registered as a company in Russia on Jan. 25, 2023, with Anastasia Obukhova its general director. She is listed on a Russian business portal as holding the same post for two previous companies, a tourism agency and a tour operator, both of which were liquidated. Each had declared capital of 10,000 rubles (about $130-$200), so Main Chain is a considerable step up. The company states on its website that it “imports and wholesales computer equipment from various foreign manufacturers.” An email and calls to Main Chain went unanswered.Shreya’s exports to Main Chain and I. S surged in April this year, when it ramped up sales of Dell’s PowerEdge XE9680 at an average price of $260,000. These servers come under HS code 847150, part of the dual-use goods list that aims to curb the Russian weapons systems used against Ukraine. The list, drawn up by the EU in conjunction with the US, the UK and Japan, is based partly on tech identified on the battlefield.Shipping documents show the imports were ordered from Malaysia by Dell International Services India Private Ltd, a Dell subsidiary, and the supplier was recorded as Dell Global BV (Singapore Branch), another subsidiary.Dell said it requires distributors and resellers “to follow all applicable global regulations and export controls,” and invests in tools and resources to help prevent and detect potential product diversion. “If a partner is not adhering to these obligations, we take swift and appropriate action, up to and including termination of our relationship,” the company said.Main Chain sourced technology products from a second Indian company, Hayers Infotech Private Limited. Together, Shreya and Hayers Infotech exported $434 million worth of high-tech goods to Russia since February 2022.Hayers Infotech is registered at the same Mumbai address as Shreya Life Sciences. A discrete plaque at the top floor of Shreya’s offices bears the name, Hayers Infotech Pvt Ltd.","Shreya Life Sciences exported 1,111 units of Dell Technologies Inc’s most- advanced servers to Russia in April-August of this year.

"Shariat Council not a court, husband must get legal stamp on talaq: HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shariat-council-not-a-court-husband-must-get-legal-stamp-on-talaq-hc/articleshow/114705173.cms,"MADURAI: Shariat Council is a private organisation and not a court, Madurai bench of Madras HC ruled recently while hearing a civil revision petition regarding the triple talaq of a Muslim doctor couple who married in 2010.One of the focal points of the case is Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath, the Shariat Council, issuing a divorce certificate to the husband in 2017. Though it can help resolve family and financial issues, it can’t issue divorce certificates or enforce penalties.Justice G R Swaminathan criticised the divorce certificate, describing it as “shocking”.He said the council had accepted the husband’s petition for triple talaq and attempted to mediate, but blamed the wife for not cooperating.“Only courts duly constituted by the state can deliver judgments. Shariat Council is a private body and not a court,” the judge reiterated, dismissing the husband’s revision petition. “So long as such a declaration has not been obtained from the jurisdictional court, the marriage is deemed to subsist.”In 2018, the wife disputed the divorce and filed a petition under the Protection of Women from Domestic ViolenceAct before a Tirunelveli judicial magistrate court. She also asserted that the third talaq was not served on her, meaning the marriage was still valid. The husband married a second time that year.In 2021, the magistrate ruled in favour of the first wife, directing the husband to pay Rs 5 lakh as compensation for domestic violence and Rs 25,000 a month for the maintenance of their minor child. Later, a sessions court dismissed the husband’s appeal against this decision, prompting him to file the current revision petition before the HC.During the hearing, Justice Swaminathan said the husband claimed to have properly pronounced talaq three times. “If it is disputed by the wife, the question arises if the marriage has been validly dissolved. So long as such a declaration has not been obtained from the jurisdictional court, the marriage is deemed to subsist,” the judge observed.The HC said the husband must go to the court and obtain a declaration. “The issue cannot be left to the unilateral determination of the husband since that would amount to the husband becoming a judge of his own cause,” the judge observed.The judge said the act of bigamy caused “considerable emotional distress and pain” to the wife, amounting to cruelty.“If a Hindu, Christian, Parsi, or Jewish husband contracts a second marriage during the subsistence of the first marriage, it would constitute cruelty besides being an offence of bigamy. It would obviously be considered an act of domestic violence entitling the wife to claim compensation under Section 12 of the Protection of Women From Domestic Violence Act, 2005. Will this proposition apply in the case of Muslims? The answer is yes,” Justice Swaminathan said.","Madurai bench of Madras HC ruled while hearing a civil revision petition regarding the triple talaq of a Muslim doctor couple who married in 2010.

US sends back a planeload of illegal Indian immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-sends-back-a-planeload-of-illegal-indian-immigrants/articleshow/114633377.cms,"NEW DELHI: The United States earlier this week sent back a plane loaded with illegal Indian immigrants to India, according to an announcement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Indian govt sources here said that the deportation by a chartered plane was a result of cooperation with the US on migration and mobility .DHS said a large-frame charter removal flight was conducted on Oct 22 to India of Indian nationals who did not establish legal basis to remain in the United States. This shows the “department’s continued commitment to pursuing sustained cooperation with the Indian govt and other international partners to reduce and deter irregular migration and jointly work to counter human smuggling”, it said in a press release. DHS, however, did not give details about the number of immigrants or about where they came from in India.“Indian nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States are subject to swift removal, and intending migrants should not fall for the lies of smugglers who proclaim otherwise,” said senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary of Homeland Security Kristie A Canegallo. “DHS will continue to enforce our nation’s laws,” added the official.Sources in the Indian govt said as part of India-US cooperation on migration and mobility, both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration. “This is being done to create more avenues for legal migration from India to the US. The latest deportation of Indian nationals by a chartered flight is a result of this cooperation,” said an official, adding such deportations have been happening for several years.Since June 2024, DHS said, it removed or returned over 160,000 individuals and operated more than 495 international repatriation flights to more than 145 countries — including India.The Indian govt said in Parliament last year that according to data published by US Customs and Border Protection on their website, the number of illegal Indian immigrants encountered by US authorities in 2023 was 96,917. The annual India-US Consular Dialogue is a mechanism through which both countries discuss consular issues of mutual interest including ensuring safe and legal migration.DHS said it regularly engages with foreign govts throughout the hemisphere and around the world to accept repatriations of their nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States.“This is one tool among many DHS uses to reduce irregular migration, promote the use of safe, lawful, and orderly pathways, and hold transnational criminal networks accountable for smuggling and exploitation of vulnerable people,” it said.","U.S. sent back a plane loaded with illegal Indian immigrants to India, according to an announcement by the Department of Homeland Security.

Gujarati now third most-spoken Indian language in Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarati-now-third-most-spoken-indian-language-in-canada/articleshow/114638545.cms,":

AhmedabadGujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada, following Punjabi and Hindi . According to data from Statistics Canada , around 87,900 Gujarati-speaking immigrants have settled in Canada since 1980, with a notable 26% of them arriving in the country between 2016 and 2021.During this latter period, Punjabi speakers constituted the largest linguistic group at 75,475, followed by Hindi speakers at 35,170. Gujarati speakers ranked third, with 22,935 immigrants, while Malayalam and Bengali speakers followed with 15,440 and 13,835, respectively.The data also revealed that Gujarati immigrants experienced the second-highest decadal growth among major linguistic groups, with a 26% increase between 2011 and 2021, following a 22% rise among Punjabi speakers. Hindi speakers saw a dramatic growth of 114% during the same period. Kutchi — another language from Gujarat — also featured in the statistics, with a decrease in migration from 460 speakers between 2001 and 2010 to 370 from 2011 to 2021.The migration trend for Gujaratis surged after 2011 as Canada became a favoured alternative to US and other English-speaking countries. “US was a hot favourite for decades, but people struggled with visa processing and high costs. With UK, Australia, and New Zealand also introducing restrictions, Canada’s easier permanent residency process and lower educational costs made it an attractive option for students,” immigration consultant Sameer Yadav said.To put this growth into perspective, the number of Gujarati-speaking immigrants was 13,365 between 1991 and 2000, rising to 29,620 in the following decade, and reaching 37,405 from 2011 to 2021.However, recent changes to immigration policies have raised concerns within the community. Increased housing challenges, job market saturation, and stricter permanent residency requirements have already led to an alarming 80% drop in visa applications for Canada from Gujarat, according to a visa consultant in Ahmedabad.“With fewer visa opportunities, enquiries from students and professionals have dramatically declined, with most applications now coming from those who already hold Canadian PR seeking to bring over family members,” the consultant said.","Gujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada. Around 87,900 Gujarati-speaking immigrants have settled in Canada since 1980. The migration trend for Gujaratis surged after 2011 as Canada became a favoured alternative to US and other English-speaking countries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114638552,imgsize-1541612,width-400,resizemode-4/114638552.jpg"

"As CJI, Justice Khanna to focus on paring pendency",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-cji-justice-khanna-to-focus-on-paring-pendency/articleshow/114748841.cms,"NEW DELHI: Personal setbacks and achievements matter little to CJI-designate Sanjiv Khanna, whose family, nearly half a century ago, took in its stride the unceremonious supersession of his uncle Justice H R Khanna, who stood up for citizens’ rights undaunted by the might of Union govt during the dark days of Emergency.He himself was fourth time lucky in getting appointed as a judge of Delhi high court, with govt ignoring three prior recommendations by the collegium for his judgeship.Justice H R Khanna, held in high esteem, had indirectly conveyed that he would not speak to anyone for Sanjiv Khanna’s appointment. Integrity, dignity and bluntness run deep in the Khanna family. When the President signed his warrant of appointment as a judge of Delhi HC in June 2005 and the then high court Chief Justice B C Patel phoned and asked him to take oath the next day, Khanna was driving his WagonR and was a few kilometres short of his ancestral home in Dalhousie.Any other person would have rushed back to take oath, but not Khanna who zealously guards his privacy and enjoys family time. Parking the car on roadside, he took the call and told Justice Patel that he wouldn’t alter his plan to spend few days in Dalhousie with his family, wife and two kids. True to his words, he returned to Delhi after 4-5 days and took oath on June 24, 2005.After nearly two decades as a constitutional court judge, six of them as judge of SC, Justice Khanna is set to take oath as the 51st CJI on Nov 11. With a tenure of six months and three days, he is aware of the time constraint for any major policy reform. But he is keen to deal with pendency , which has crossed the 82,000-mark in the apex court.His primary focus during the short tenure will be to lay down a mechanism to reduce pendency and speed up justice delivery in the top court, TOI gathered during a couple of interactions with him recently. On Tuesday, an SC source told TOI, “In fact, CJI-designate has already commenced the process, in consultation with colleagues, to improve the existing mechanism to decide cases pending for years.”The first year of judgeship in Delhi HC was a lesson for him. Overenthusiastic about reducing pendency, he had reserved judgment in over 100 cases, a task that made him realise that rendering decisions must be as swift as concluding hearing. He took six months to write pending judgments and thereafter, there has never been an occasion when he had more than five judgments pending at a given time.As a media and publicity shy person, Justice Khanna realises that he needs to change his outlook towards interacting with journalists but is firm that it would not be at the cost of his privacy and institutional dignity.He agrees with CJI D Y Chandrachud and says he has never come across a situation where influence from any quarter is exerted on him to render a desired decision.Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, who is scheduled to retire on Nov 10, had recommended Justice Khanna as his successor in office, on Oct 17. Born on May 14, 1960, Justice Khanna enrolled as an advocate with the Bar Council of Delhi in 1983. He said, “There can never be an occasion when anyone could dare approach me in a judicial matter.”During interactions with TOI, Justice Khanna acknowledged that an increasing number of people were rushing to SC with writ petitions and PILs, which took up considerable judicial time. HCs have wide power under Art 226 to deal with state-specific issues and Supreme Court should deal with pan-India matters, especially when it requires urgent intervention to prevent substantial ill-effects, he added.","Justice Khanna is set to take oath as the 51st CJI on Nov 11.

She continues to subsist on a meagre income rearing goats.Before making the trip to Delhi, the widow had met govt officials in Rajasthan, pleaded with them, and produced papers to prove she was Jhamku Devi in flesh and blood. Nothing worked.Hers is one of many instances in Rajasthan of people being denied pension because of erroneous entries in survival records.Ajmer resident Kanchan Devi, 40, hasn't received her widow pension for 30 months. ""I am supposed to be dead on paper. Panchayat Samiti officials suggested that I open a new pension account, in which case I would forfeit my arrears. I declined,"" she said.Gudia, 22, from Mohalla Narsinghpura in Beawar was shocked when her disability pension was abruptly stopped in Jan 2023 without prior notice. She learnt that her address had been changed in the records to ""out of state"" although she remains a resident of Rajasthan.Her plight worsened when repeated Aadhaar verification attempts to reinstate her name in the pension records failed because of her disability. ""My fingerprints and pupils couldn't be registered. This led to my Aadhaar being deactivated in mid-2024,"" said Gudiya, who lives with her mother.Keli Devi from Biyakheda in Beawer stopped receiving pension after an e-Mitra operator mistakenly linked her Pension Payment Order to another woman's account.

In Rajasthan, over 1 crore pension beneficiaries face challenges, with around 13 lakh pensions being cancelled annually, often due to delays or data mismatches.""Activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan said responsible officials needed to be penalised and pensions restored immediately for those that were wrongly excluded.

Lag in US engine supply delays IAF induction of Tejas Mark-1A,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lag-in-us-engine-supply-delays-iaf-induction-of-tejas-mark-1a/articleshow/114748534.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major blow to the IAF ’s already depleted operational capabilities, the induction of new indigenous Tejas Mark-1A jets has been further deferred, primarily because of the continuing delay in supply of engines by US major General Electric (GE), while the project to make 4.5-generation fighters in India with foreign collaboration is still stuck in the doldrums.Defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) will be able to deliver only two to three Tejas Mark-1A fighters instead of 16 promised to the IAF in the 2024-25 fiscal, under the Rs 46,898 crore deal for 83 such single-engine jets inked in Feb 2021, sources told TOI.After both PM Modi and defence minister Rajnath Singh flagged the delay in deliveries of the 99 GE-F404 turbofan jet engines during their recent visits to the US, GE has promised to begin the supply by March 2025 now, around two years behind schedule.“As per terms of the $716 million contract, HAL could invoke penalty clauses in the case. But it’s an ongoing logistical issue that can be worked out between GE and HAL. GE says it has faced supply chain issues from one of its South Korean suppliers,” a source said.Moreover, HAL and GE are now also conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the more powerful GE-F414 aero-engines in India for the planned Tejas Mark-II fighters, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion. “The contract should be inked within this fiscal,” he added.Along with the engines’ delay, the integration of weapons as well as the Israeli radar on the Tejas Mark-1A is also currently underway. All this will have a cascading effect down the line with the IAF banking upon the progressive induction of 180 Tejas Mark-1A and at least 108 Mark-2 jets over the next 15 years to stem the nose-dive in the number of its fighters. The force is currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised to tackle the threat from China and Pakistan.Concurrently, the IAF’s long-standing quest for 114 new 4.5-generation multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) to be manufactured in India with foreign collaboration, at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore, is also still far away from being finalized.The political slugfest over corruption allegations in the Rs 59,000 crore deal for 36 Rafale fighters, which was inked with France in Sept 2016, has made the govt rethink the entire procurement model for the MRFA case.“The Rafale controversy even reached the Supreme Court, with officials being summoned and documents connected to national security being shared. In the MRFA case, the procurement model and the level of indigenization is being finalised to break the logjam,” another source said.HAL, on its part, says it now has the capacity to manufacture 24 Tejas Mark-1A fighters per year after setting up the new production line in Nashik in addition to Bengaluru. “The plan is to increase the production rate to 36 jets per year,” an official said.India also has the plan for an ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter in the future, the swing-role advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), the development of which at a cost of over Rs 15,000 crore was cleared by the PM-led cabinet committee on security in March this year.",The induction of new indigenous Tejas Mark-1A jets has been further deferred.

(AI image)

Should you buy gold this Dhanteras 2024 ? Dhanteras, a day considered auspicious for purchasing gold, is being celebrated in India today on October 29, 2024.. Despite a 30% surge in the yellow metal's price since the previous Dhanteras, investing at current levels may still be a wise choice, feel experts, and investors have various options to consider.Experts believe that investing in gold will yield attractive returns in the future, despite the rally over the past year.According to an ET report, Anuj Gupta from HDFC Securities recommends buying gold around Rs 75,500–76,000 and accumulating on dips in the range of Rs 73,500–73,700, with a price target of Rs 85,300–87,000 until the next Dhanteras. He says the stop loss should be at around Rs 71,500 level.“We expect that investing in gold will reap benefits in the future and it will provide attractive returns notwithstanding the rally in the past one year. Geopolitical and economic uncertainties, significant global ETF inflows, dovish monetary policy by western central bankers, the US election, and a lower dollar index continue will support the bullish trend in gold,” he was quoted as saying.Ventura Securities sees an upside to Rs 85,700 per 10 grams in gold, with support at Rs 77,000, while silver prices may reach Rs 1,06,000 to Rs 1,20,000, with support at Rs 95,500.However, investors with a short-term view should be cautious, as prices may subside after the sharp uptick. Amit Goel from Pace 360 expects gold prices to decline over the next few months before resuming their long-term bull run, as the asset class is currently overheated.Investors have several options for buying gold, including physical gold (jewellery, bars, and coins), gold ETFs , gold SIPs, digital gold, and gold futures.Prathamesh Mallya from Angel One calls gold a ""portfolio diversifier for investors"" and suggests it could be a substitute for equities in the near to medium term for less risk-averse investors.While the demand for gold jewellery during Dhanteras and Diwali 2024 may be under pressure due to record-high prices, jewellers expect demand to persist, particularly due to the ongoing wedding season and the cultural significance of gold during these festivals. Consumers may gravitate towards lightweight jewellery and coins, though volume-based demand may struggle.Gold ETFs have seen significant growth in India over the past four years, with investors increasingly inclined to invest in gold via the mutual fund route.

In a major decision that is expected to bring relief to hundreds of occupants of premises belonging to the Goa Housing Board at New Vaddem , the Mormugao Municipal Council (MMC) on Tuesday resolved to regularise 544 structures.These structures were allocated to municipal workers under the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) Housing Scheme and were approved on Tuesday in accordance with Mormugao Planning and Development Authority (MPDA) records.With this move, the MMC has become the first civic body in the state to take a decision on regularising houses of the Goa Housing Board.A special council meeting scheduled for the purpose was chaired by MMC chairperson Girish Borkar and attended by transport minister and Dabolim legislator, Mauvin Godinho.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Elon Musk, the father of at least 12, wants his children to grow together, though some of them are grown-ups and are not at all close to their father.

But the investigation by the Justice Department into whether Tesla's resources had been used for personal use forced Elon to drop the idea.Elon Musk was living with former girlfriend Grimes in a 6,900-square-foot house until Grimes moved out and left Austin in 2023. ""Still Mr Musk continued his home purchase spree. He offered some homeowners 20 to 70 per cent above the value of their houses, according to those homeowners. Some were required to sign nondisclosure agreements just to see the offer, according to three people familiar with the agreements,"" the NYT report said.Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis, mother of three of Musk's children, now lives in Austin.After the death of his first child, Nevada, who died when he was only 10 weeks, Elon Musk welcomed five children with his wife Justin Wilson -- Griffin, Vivian (Xavier before coming out as transgender), Kai Saxon and Damian; X, Exa Dark Sideræl, Techno Mechanicus with Grimes; Strider, Azure and another child whose name and sex are not known with Shivon Zilis.","Elon Musk reportedly has a 14,400-square-foot mansion villa in Austin.

According to a report from CBS News, S3 analysts noted, ""The price of DJT closely mirrors Trump's chances in prediction markets.""Polymarket investigated four accounts controlled by a French trader who invested millions in Trump contracts but found no evidence of market manipulation.The company's stock has shown significant volatility since its March trading debut, initially reaching a $9 billion valuation despite financial losses, before declining to September lows. The stock price frequently responds to developments in Trump's political prospects.Trading patterns suggest similarities to meme stocks, which are driven by social media sentiment rather than fundamental analysis. Recent trading volume has been notably high, reaching 120 million shares on Tuesday, compared to the 30-day average of 35 million shares.Professor Jay Ritter of the University of Florida explains, ""DJT has been very volatile due to speculators that are momentum players. These speculators buy when the price rises, pushing up the price, but then sell when the tide turns, resulting in occasional big drops.""The company's limited revenue and growth potential deter institutional investors, while high borrowing costs make short-selling expensive, according to Ritter, who adds that the company's financial losses suggest a downward long-term trend.Short sellers targeting the stock could face significant losses if Trump wins, according to S3 analysts, who also note that ""DJT could become worthless if Trump were to lose.""","Trump Media & Technology Group's stock price increased by $5.86 (12.4%) to $53.22 during Tuesday afternoon trading.
