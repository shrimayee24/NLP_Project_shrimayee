NEW DELHI: Amid concerns over the US move to impose a 50% tariff on Indian goods significantly impacting the export of India's fisheries, the government on Monday asked seafood exporters to explore alternative markets for shrimps and other fish varieties.""We have asked them (exporters) to face the current challenge bravely. There are alternative markets available... Where there is a will, there is a way,"" Union fisheries and animal husbandry minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh said after a meeting with seafood exporters.India is currently the leading supplier of frozen shrimps and prawns to the US, with its market share increasing significantly from 24.4% in 2015 to 40.6% in 2024. Since the enhanced tariff will impact India's market share in the US, the country will have to explore alternative markets. The meeting on Monday was held to chart a strategy to expand India's market reach.The alternative markets identified for the purpose include the UK, European Union (EU), Oman, UAE, South Korea, Russia and China, with there being special focus on South Korea's potential and west Asia's growing demand for Indian seafood.Emphasising the need for greater value addition and better packaging in gaining new markets, Singh said, ""We have asked them (exporters) to work in this direction"".","India is currently the leading supplier of frozen shrimps and prawns to the US.

NEW DELHI: Delhi police on Monday detained animal rights activists, rescuers, caregivers, and dog lovers protesting at India Gate against the Supreme Court’s order to move all stray dogs in Delhi-NCR to shelters within eight weeks.Earlier in the day, in a suo motu case on dog bite incidents, the Supreme Court directed the Delhi government to start picking up stray dogs from all localities, house them in shelters, and not release them back onto streets, colonies, or public places.The court said shelters must be set up to accommodate around 5,000 dogs and staffed with enough personnel for sterilisation and immunisation.Calling the situation “extremely grim,” the bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R. Mahadevan stressed, ""We are issuing these directions keeping larger public interest in mind,"" further adding that infants, young children should not at any cost fall prey to stray dog bites leading to rabies.PETA India Advocacy Associate Shaurya Agrawal criticised the ruling, calling it “impractical, illogical and… according to the animal birth control rules, also illegal.”He said Delhi has around 10 lakh stray dogs and housing them all in shelters would be impossible.“This is going to create chaos and problems. Removal of dogs is inhumane, is cruelty in itself, and the conditions within the shelters are going to be very bad...We are exploring all our legal avenues. And in the past, we have met the Delhi government and have urged them to implement the ABC rules properly and the sterilisation programs in the city,” he added.","Delhi police detained animal rights activists, rescuers, caregivers, and dog lovers protesting at India Gate.

It said the practice of fixing a ceiling on recruitment of female candidates has the effect of perpetuating the status quo, which has been historically discriminatory to women candidates. There are 10 streams in the Army where women are eligible for appointment as SSC officers.""This court is of the view that once the Army permits women officers to join any corps, department or branch forming a part of the regular Army, it cannot impose an additional restriction with regard to 'extent of induction' of women officers in the said corps, department or branch - as Section 12 of the Army Act, 1950, does not empower it to do so,"" Justice Manmohan, who wrote the verdict for the bench, said.The court allowed the plea of a woman who contended that she scored more than her male counterparts but was denied because only three females were to be selected.The Centre and the Army took the defence that JAG officers are primarily combatant personnel and that was the reason for restriction on entry of females but the court refused to accept the plea and said if it was accepted, then it would lead to exclusion of women officers from all streams of the Army.""It does not stand to reason that when women officers like Captain Ojaswita Shree of the elite Parachute Air Defence Unit, Major Dwipannita Kalita of highly specialised airborne medical unit of the Indian Army and Flight Lieutenant Shivangi Singh (pilot of Rafale jet) of the Indian Air Force can operate behind enemy lines with all expected risks, why women officers in times of emergency cannot be deployed for counter-insurgency or in counter-terror forces or attached to infantry/artillery units. This is supported by the fact that the Indian Army entrusts women officers with complex tasks, such as transporting convoys of 30 to 50 vehicles through militant-prone areas in Leh, Srinagar, Udhampur and the north-east,"" the bench said.","Women officers can fly Rafales and can be a part of UN peacekeeping missions in combat zones like Syria, Lebanon and Israel.

RAIPUR: A technical snag in an Air India flight arriving from Delhi led to a tense hour-long delay at Raipur airport, leaving around 160 passengers, including a sitting MLA, stranded inside the aircraft with no immediate explanation.Flight AI 2797 departed Delhi at 8.15pm and landed at Raipur's Swami Vivekananda airport at 10.05pm on Sunday. However, upon touchdown, the aircraft's door failed to open due to what airline staff later described as a ""technical fault"". Passengers remained confined inside the plane until after 11pm, sparking confusion and concern.Among those onboard was Congress MLA from Kota constituency in Bilaspur district, Atal Srivastava.Eyewitness accounts suggest that the cabin crew initially offered no clear explanation, leading to growing unease among passengers.The situation reportedly escalated when passengers noticed a halt in power supply within the aircraft, further fuelling speculation of a malfunction. However, Air India officials later clarified that the delay was part of a routine security drill and not a safety breach.Airport authorities confirmed that no injuries or medical emergencies occurred during the delay, and all passengers eventually disembarked safely.","Flight AI 2797 departed Delhi at 8.15pm and landed at Raipur's Swami Vivekananda airport at 10.05pm.

The plan is to make it mandatory for universities to justify every NFS decision and have it examined by the UGC, which can suggest remedies or alternative recruitment measures.The move, aimed at curbing the alleged misuse of the provision to sideline SC, ST and OBC candidates, comes amid a political slugfest: BJP accuses Congress of having historically manipulated recruitment processes under the pretext of NFS, while the Opposition says vacancies remain high under the Modi government.The ""Not Found Suitable Candidates"" committee, constituted by the UGC on June 19 , has been tasked with examining the scale and causes of the problem. In its initial note, the panel said a considerable number of vacancies in central universities are attributed to ""non-availability of suitable candidates against posts advertised,"" an issue repeatedly flagged in parliamentary questions and at other forums.The committee will analyse university-wise and category-wise data, study whether NFS declarations have led to uneven representation and recommend ways to address such disparities.Institutions will have to file detailed reports whenever candidates are rejected as ""not suitable"" despite meeting eligibility criteria. Government sources said UGC's scrutiny will help detect bias, identify procedural lapses, and recommend solutions, including fresh recruitment drives or targeted outreach to eligible candidates.","The move is aimed at curbing the alleged misuse of the provision to sideline SC, ST and OBC candidates.

NEW DELHI: After launching the world's costliest earth observation mission NISAR in collaboration with the US on July 30, India is set to launch a US communication satellite —Block-2 BlueBird — weighing 6,500 kg in a couple of months, Isro chairman V Narayanan disclosed on Sunday.The Block 2 BlueBird satellite features large communication arrays, up to 2,400 sq ft, and has been designed to achieve data transmission speeds of up to 12 Mbps, enabling voice, data and video communication capabilities for end users. The satellite will provide direct-to-smartphone broadband connectivity, eliminating the need for specialised terminals.The next-generation American satellite is expected to reach India in Sept and will be launched aboard LVM-3-M5, Isro's heaviest rocket, from the Sriharikota spaceport. BlueBird satellite uses AST & Science's patented technologies for connecting to cellphones in a space environment for their SpaceMobile constellation.The satellite has a communications array measuring 64.38 sq m to establish direct connectivity with cellphones via 3GPP-standard frequencies, in partnership with leading cellular service providers around the world. After NISAR, the Block-2 BlueBird launch will further boost Indo-US space collaboration.Narayanan, who was presented with an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Maharashtra governor C.P. Radhakrishnan during the convocation ceremony at SRM Institute of Science and Technology at Kattankulathur near Chennai, talked about the rapid strides India’s made in the field of space technology.He said Isro was set up in 1963, with a tiny rocket being donated by the US that year to mark the beginning of the Indian space programme. In 1975, with satellite data given by the US, Isro demonstrated ‘mass communication’ through 2,400 TV sets at 2,400 villages across six Indian states. “From that (humble beginnings), the 30th of July was a historic day for the Indian space programme. We have launched the NISAR satellite, the costliest one ever built in the world. Today, we are working shoulder to shoulder with advanced countries,” Narayanan said.","The Block 2 BlueBird satellite features large communication arrays, up to 2,400 sq ft, and has been designed to achieve data transmission speeds of up to 12 Mbps.

Aircraft shortage: Air India to suspend nonstop flights between Delhi and Washington from September 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/aircraft-shortage-air-india-to-suspend-nonstops-between-delhi-and-washington-from-september-1/articleshow/123235211.cms,"DGCA Investigates Air India After Congress MP KC Venugopal’s Shocking Near-Death Flight Experience

NEW DELHI: Air India will from Sept 1, 2025, suspend its nonstop between Delhi and Washington due to a shortage of wide body planes caused by the revamping of the Maharaj’s legacy fleet. The five times weekly flight is mostly operated on the Boeing 787 due to relatively low passenger numbers compared to AI’s all other North America routes that are served by the B777s and Airbus A350. Passengers booked on AI flights to or from Washington beyond Sept 1 will be offered alternative travel arrangements, including rebooking on other flights or full refunds, as per their individual preferences.“The suspension is primarily driven by the planned shortfall in Air India’s fleet, as the airline commenced retrofitting 26 of its Boeing 787-8 aircraft last month. This extensive retrofit programme, aimed at significantly enhancing customer experience, necessitates a prolonged unavailability of multiple aircraft at any given time until at least end of 2026. That, coupled with the continued closure of airspace over Pakistan, impacts the airline’s long-haul operations, leading to longer flight routings and increased operational complexity,” AI said in a statement.Air India customers will continue to have the options of one-stop flights to Washington via four US gateways – New York (JFK), Newark (EWR), Chicago, and San Francisco – with the airline’s interline partners, Alaska Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, allowing customers to travel on a single itinerary with their baggage checked through to the final destination, AI statement said.Air India will continue to operate nonstops flights between India and six destinations in North America, including Toronto and Vancouver in Canada.Supply chain constraints seen since Covid have delayed Tata’s $400-million fleet retrofit programme “to delivering a world class flying experience and enhancing operational reliability across its legacy fleet.” The airline now hopes to complete the task by Oct 2028, about a year more than the five-year plan announced earlier.The airline said it has finally started the upgrade programme for its legacy wide fleet fleet with the Boeing 787 Dreamliners and the task is now expected to be complete by Oct 2028, “with the timeline having shifted due to supply chain delays”. In its last few cash-starved state-owned years, Air India had no funds to spend on cabin maintenance or upkeep and a poor inflight experience on those planes remains among the biggest irritants for passengers of long haul flights on which these planes are deployed.“Air India has commenced the widebody retrofit programme for its legacy B787-8 aircraft, with the first of 26 aircraft (VT-ANT) having flown to a Boeing facility in Victorville, California, in July 2025. A second aircraft is scheduled to depart for the same facility in Oct 2025, with both expected to return to service in Dec 2025. The retrofit programme for Air India’s B787-8s, now on a steady schedule for completion by mid-2027, will introduce brand-new interiors featuring a three-class configuration with business class, premium economy, and economy class seats,” AI said in a statement.The upgrade will see installation of brand-new seats in each cabin, advanced inflight entertainment (IFE) systems, new carpeting, curtains, upholstery, lavatories, galleys and more.Starting early 2027, AI will additionally retrofit 13 of its legacy Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, aiming for completion by Oct 2028, with the timeline having shifted due to supply chain delays.",The five times weekly flight is mostly operated on the Boeing 787 due to relatively low passenger numbers.

Trump’s tariffs on India: Calls for boycotting US brands

Major American brands in India, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Amazon and Apple, are faced with boycott demands as corporate leaders and supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi respond to US tariffs. India's vast population makes it a crucial market for American companies.The significance of India as a market is evident through various examples: WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has its largest user base in India, whilst Domino's operates more outlets there than any other food chain. American beverage giants Pepsi and Coca-Cola maintain a strong retail presence, whilst Apple stores and Starbucks outlets continue to attract substantial customer interest.The implementation of a 50% tariff on Indian goods by Donald Trump has strained diplomatic relations between New Delhi and Washington, leading to widespread social media campaigns and public calls to support local alternatives over American products. Whilst immediate impact on sales remains unclear, there is increasing momentum behind the movement to boycott US goods in favour of domestic options, according to a Reuters report.Manish Chowdhary, who co-founded Wow Skin Science in India, shared a video on LinkedIn advocating support for domestic farmers and startups. He emphasised the importance of elevating ""Made in India"" products to international recognition, citing South Korea's success in food and beauty sectors.""We have lined up for products from thousands of miles away. We have proudly spent on brands that we don't own, while our own makers fight for attention in their own country,"" he said.DriveU's CEO, Rahm Shastry, expressed on LinkedIn his vision for India to develop its own alternatives to major social media and tech platforms: ""India should have its own home-grown Twitter/Google/YouTube/WhatsApp/FB -- like China has.""W hilst Indian retail organisations successfully compete with international brands such as Starbucks in the local market, achieving global expansion remains difficult.In contrast, Indian technology service companies have established a strong international presence, with organisations like TCS and Infosys delivering software solutions to clients across the globe.During a Sunday gathering in Bengaluru, PM Modi issued a ""special appeal"" for self-reliance, stating that whilst Indian technology firms create products globally, ""now is the time for us to give more priority to India's needs.""Amidst ongoing anti-American demonstrations, Tesla inaugurated its second Indian showroom in New Delhi on Monday, with representatives from both the Indian commerce ministry and US embassy in attendance.","Major American brands in India, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Amazon and Apple, are faced with boycott demands.

New Income Tax Bill 2025: Top recommendations of Parliamentary Select Committee

New Income Tax Bill 2025: The Lok Sabha on Monday passed the modified New Income Tax Bill 2025 after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had introduced earlier today. The government had officially withdrawn the Income-Tax Bill, 2025 on Friday, which had been presented in the Lok Sabha on February 13 this year as a replacement for the current Income-Tax Act, 1961.The Income-Tax Bill, 2025 is designed to update and simplify India's taxation system, replacing legislation that had been in effect for over 60 years. The proposal included a revised structure, provisions for digital taxation, systems for resolving disputes, and initiatives to expand tax collection through technological and data-driven methods.The legislation, which simplifies TDS, exemptions and compliance requirements whilst enabling individuals to seek refunds without penalties for late submissions, received approval amidst ongoing disruptions from opposition parties.Following its passage, the legislation requires Rajya Sabha's endorsement before being forwarded to the President for final approval. The law shall take effect upon receiving Presidential assent.The revised legislation diminishes the current Income Tax Act's scope and intricacy, significantly reducing the quantity of active sections and chapters, whilst cutting the text length by approximately half.It eliminates the perplexing distinction between assessment year and previous year, introducing a straightforward concept of 'tax year'.The parliamentary committee's feedback on the draft necessitated several modifications. The new version, which includes the majority of 285 recommendations provided by the Parliamentary Select Committee led by BJP MP Baijayant Panda, was presented on Monday, August 11.While presenting The Income-Tax (No.2) Bill, 2025, Sitharaman explained that this legislation aims to streamline and update income tax regulations, replacing the existing Income Tax Act, 1961.""Almost all of the recommendations of the Select Committee have been accepted by the government. In addition, suggestions have been received from stakeholders about changes that would convey the proposed legal meaning more accurately,"" stated the bill's objectives and reasoning section.""There are corrections in the nature of drafting, alignment of phrases, consequential changes and cross-referencing. Therefore, a decision has been taken by the government to withdraw the Income-tax Bill, 2025 as reported by the Select Committee. Consequently, Income-tax (No. 2) Bill, 2025 has been prepared to replace the Income-tax Act, 1961,"" the statement indicated.According to an ET report, officials indicated that the withdrawal was necessary to avoid any confusion that might arise from multiple versions circulating, and to present a single comprehensive draft incorporating all approved changes.The Parliamentary Select Committee, comprising 31 members, presented their comprehensive 4,575-page findings last month. Their recommendations include both small adjustments and 32 significant modifications.The principal suggestions put forward include:* A revised definition of ""beneficial owner"" has been proposed, enabling individuals to carry forward losses when they receive direct or indirect share benefits during the tax year.* The committee advocates reinstating the inter-corporate dividend deduction, which was absent in the initial draft. Additionally, they suggest implementing a standard 30% deduction, calculated after municipal tax deductions, whilst pre-construction interest deductions could be extended to include let-out properties.To simplify tax compliance for individual taxpayers, the recommendations include:* Issuing 'Nil' tax deduction certificates* Allowing discretionary waiver of penalties for unintentional non-compliance* Facilitating refunds in delayed ITR submissions for small taxpayers* The committee has additionally requested enhanced clarity regarding the definition of non-performing assets (NPAs) to minimise prolonged disagreements in tax and banking interpretations.The proposal advocates for precise definitions of ""parent company"" whilst establishing appropriate provisions for non-profit organisations and religious-cum-charitable trusts. The committee suggests that anonymous contributions should not affect their eligibility for tax exemptions.Additionally, it recommended eliminating remaining references to the Income-Tax Act, 1961, to create a comprehensive and dispute-resistant new code.According to the revised Bill, individuals will be allowed to claim TDS refund even if their return of income is filed beyond the statutory timeline provided for filing of the original income-tax return. Thus, the Finance Ministry has incorporated the provision of the existing Income Tax Act, 1961.The Income Tax (No.2) Bill provides for 'nil' TCS on Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) remittances for education purposes financed by any financial institutions.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sandeep Jhunjhunwala said deductions in respect of certain inter-corporate dividends for companies opting for concessional rate of taxes have been re-introduced in line with the provisions of the existing Income-tax Act, 1961The provisions relating to the carry forward and set-off of losses have been appropriately amended and the reference to the beneficial owner has been omitted to align with Section 79 of the Income-tax Act, 1961.""By enabling refunds for belated returns and harmonising definitions of Micro and Small enterprise with allied statutes, the Bill reflects a balanced, pragmatic, and taxpayer-oriented approach,"" Jhunjhunwala said.","The Income-Tax Bill, 2025 is designed to update and simplify India's taxation system. It replaces legislation that had been in effect for over 60 years. The legislation simplifies TDS, exemptions and compliance requirements whilst enabling individuals to seek refunds without penalties for late submissions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123233253,imgsize-19382,width-400,resizemode-4/123233253.jpg"
Dana White reveals how UFC sealed massive $7.7 billion streaming deal with Paramount and CBS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/dana-white-reveals-how-ufc-sealed-massive-7-7-billion-streaming-deal-with-paramount-and-cbs/articleshow/123246830.cms,"Dana White reveals how UFC sealed massive $7.7 billion streaming deal with Paramount and CBS (Image via Getty)

Dana White says David Ellison sealed $7.7 billion Paramount UFC deal in 48 hours

“These guys came in aggressive with an all-or-nothing approach,”

“The Ellisons are brilliant businessmen and have a whole game plan behind this. I can’t wait to be in business with them.”

Mark Shapiro and Dana White explain why ending UFC pay-per-view will help fans

Dana White, president and CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, says the biggest change in UFC history happened on August 11, 2025. That’s when UFC signed a seven-year, $7.7 billion deal with Paramount Skydance. Starting in 2026, every UFC event in the United States, thirteen big “numbered” fights and thirty Fight Night cards each year will stream on Paramount+, with some major shows also on CBS. This ends UFC’s long-time pay-per-view model, meaning fans won’t have to pay extra to watch the biggest fights.Dana White says the UFC spoke with many companies before deciding. David Ellison, CEO of Skydance Media and son of billionaire Larry Ellison, made the strongest move. Right after Skydance’s merger with Paramount closed, David Ellison acted quickly and offered to take the entire UFC package. The deal was finalized within 48 hours.Dana White said.The new agreement will pay UFC an average of $1.1 billion a year more than double the current ESPN deal, which pays about $350 million for Fight Nights plus $250 million for big events.With ESPN, fans had to pay around $100 on top of their subscription for each pay-per-view card.Also Read: “He Will Never Come Back”: Conor McGregor Faces Harsh Criticism As He Trains For Potential UFC Fight At White House In 2026 Mark Shapiro, president and COO of UFC’s parent company TKO Group, said fans had been hit with high costs for too long. The pay-per-view model, he explained, pushed many to illegal streaming. “We saw piracy numbers go up ten times during big events,” Shapiro said. “That’s when we knew the double paywall had gotten out of control.”Now, all UFC fights will be available with just a Paramount+ subscription. Dana White believes this will bring more viewers than ever before. Paramount+ currently has about 78 million subscribers, far behind giants like Netflix and Disney+, and UFC is expected to help boost that number.Dana White also teased a one-of-a-kind UFC event at the White House on July 4, 2026. He said it could air live on CBS, just like the UFC’s Las Vegas Sphere event last year. While he hasn’t heard from Donald Trump about the new deal yet, he laughed and said, “I’m sure he will. He always does.”","Dana White, president and CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, says the biggest change in UFC history happened on August 11, 2025.

"Rasmus Andersson breaks silence on Calgary Flames trade rumors, contract status, and offseason speculation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/rasmus-andersson-breaks-silence-on-calgary-flames-trade-rumors-contract-status-and-offseason-speculation/articleshow/123244420.cms,"Credit : Derek Leung/Getty

Rasmus Andersson addresses Calgary Flames trade speculation, NHL contract stance, and future with the team

“I have still been very appreciated in Calgary for a long time… But I have not given Calgary a team, that I only want to sympathize with a team. That is not true,”

Lack of communication fuels Calgary Flames offseason drama and trade speculation

“No one has heard back since then. Sometimes you hear a lot, sometimes you hear a little,”

Rasmus Andersson has finally addressed the swirling trade rumors that have dominated much of the Calgary Flames’ quiet offseason. The Swedish defenceman, whose future with the team has been in question since the season ended, has shed light on his stance regarding potential trades, contract talks, and reports about his preferred destinations. His comments, made via a Swedish sports outlet, have reignited discussions among fans and media.Speculation around Andersson’s future began shortly after Calgary’s postseason media availability, with multiple insiders suggesting a trade was imminent. One report claimed Andersson was only willing to sign long-term with the Vegas Golden Knights, a notion he firmly denied.Andersson said. He emphasized he has one year left on his contract and will address his future next offseason, not now.The defenceman also revealed he blocked a proposed trade earlier this summer. While not confirming the team, reports linked it to the Los Angeles Kings. Andersson admitted the offer was significant but said family considerations and unwillingness to commit long-term to that market led to his decision.Andersson noted that since that trade discussion roughly six weeks ago, he hasn’t had any contact with the Flames’ front office.he said.The lack of dialogue, combined with Andersson’s openness about nixing a deal, has only fueled speculation heading into training camp. While the Flames could still move him before the season, current indications suggest general manager Craig Conroy may keep the current roster intact to remain competitive, with Andersson potentially becoming trade deadline bait.Andersson’s candid offseason comments have brought clarity to some rumors while adding new layers to others. His denial of a single-team preference, admission of blocking a trade, and acknowledgment of minimal contact with management paint a picture of a strained relationship. Whether he remains in Calgary beyond this season will be a major storyline, but for now, Andersson appears set to start the year as a Flame with plenty of eyes watching.Also Read: Insiders predict Connor McDavid will re-sign with Edmonton Oilers before NHL training camp","Rasmus Andersson has shed light on his stance regarding potential trades, contract talks, and reports about his preferred destinations.

Why this didn’t start yesterday: deep causes of Japan’s demographic decline



Japan’s demographic trajectory is the result of multiple, long-running structural factors:

Low fertility: decades of fertility rates below the replacement level (≈2.1 children per woman), driven by economic insecurity, high housing and childcare costs, and changing social norms.

Rapid ageing: a large baby-boom cohort moving into retirement combined with high life expectancy.

Delay or avoidance of marriage/childbearing: many younger adults delay relationships or choose smaller families for economic and lifestyle reasons.

Rockstar Games ’ Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) remains one of the most anticipated video game releases globally. Earlier in 2025, Rockstar unveiled the game’s second official trailer alongside a confirmed release date of May 26, 2026. This announcement thrilled fans but also raised cautious optimism due to Rockstar’s reputation for pushing back major game launches. Originally planned for 2025, questions linger about whether this new date will hold, especially considering the high expectations for innovative gameplay and cutting-edge graphics.The hype around GTA 6 continues to build as Rockstar reveals more details and approaches its projected 2026 release. While fans eagerly await the game, the cautious optimism around timing and pricing reflects the realities of AAA game development in today’s market.Grand Theft Auto 6 is shaping up to redefine open-world gaming once again, but patience will be key as the release date approaches.Rockstar Games is known for its meticulous development process. The company prioritizes delivering polished, expansive gaming experiences over strict adherence to release schedules. This approach often leads to delays, as seen with previous hits like Red Dead Redemption 2 and GTA 5. These delays, while frustrating for fans, usually result in critically acclaimed, technically impressive games that push the boundaries of open-world design and storytelling innovation, enhancing player immersion and long-term engagement.Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, confirmed in their most recent earnings report that GTA 6 is still on track for its May 26, 2026 launch. This is positive news amid speculation about possible delays, fueled by Rockstar’s history of postponing flagship titles.However, previous earnings calls from Take-Two indicated a 2025 release, which didn’t come to fruition, so this confirmation remains tentative. Fans should remain cautiously hopeful but prepared for potential shifts in the timeline.One major uncertainty surrounding GTA 6 is its pricing structure. With the gaming industry trending towards higher launch prices—Nintendo has already introduced $80 titles—there’s widespread speculation that Take-Two might follow suit. Given GTA 6’s reportedly massive budget and scale, an $80 price tag or higher is plausible, as reported.Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick told Variety that their goal is to “deliver more value than what we charge.” This suggests the company plans to justify premium pricing through quality content and added value, possibly with deluxe editions and special bonuses. Unofficial leaks hint at regional standard edition prices ranging from Rs 5,999 in India to $70 in the US, while deluxe editions could cost up to $125 in some markets.Rockstar promises GTA 6 will significantly expand upon the series’ signature open-world crime gameplay. The new installment follows protagonists Jason and Lucia in a Bonnie and Clyde-inspired storyline, set primarily in Leonida—a fictional state modeled after Florida, with Vice City at its core.The game will feature:Take-Two’s Q2 2025 earnings report showcased robust performance, with net bookings reaching $1.42 billion and total revenue of $1.5 billion, driven by existing franchises like NBA 2K25 and GTA Online. This strong financial footing allows Take-Two to invest heavily in GTA 6’s development and marketing.This investment underscores the company’s commitment to making GTA 6 a groundbreaking release that meets fan expectations for quality and innovation. Furthermore, successful launch and reception of GTA 6 could redefine market standards for AAA open-world titles moving forward.The company has also raised its full-year net bookings projection for fiscal 2026 to between $6.05 billion and $6.15 billion, reflecting confidence that GTA 6, alongside other titles like Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4, will drive substantial sales. While GTA 6’s confirmed release date offers hope, fans should remain prepared for potential delays, given Rockstar’s history. Pricing will likely reflect recent industry trends toward premium game costs, but Take-Two’s promise of delivering value could soften that impact.With a bigger world, innovative gameplay, and a compelling dual-protagonist story, GTA 6 promises to be a milestone in open-world gaming. Players can expect a richly detailed experience that pushes the boundaries of the genre.","Grand Theft Auto 6 is shaping up to redefine open-world gaming once again.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates filed for their divorce in 2021. However, before the high-profile divorce, both Bill and Melinda Gates were just two working parents who were trying to juggle preschool schedules and household chores. Melinda Gates once revealed that a small decision by Bill Gates — driving their daughter Jennifer to kindergarten— ended up reshaping more than just their own family dynamics. In a 2019 interview with Business Insider, Melinda Gates shared that how Bill Gates, the then CEO of Microsoft insisted on enrolling their daughter Jennifer in a school that required a long commute. When Melinda opposed the decision of driving their daughter to school daily, Bill responded ‘I will drive her daily.’Speaking to Business Insider, Melinda recounted a small but impactful decision by her ex-husband that rippled through their community, changing expectations for other families and modelling a new kind of fatherhood . The story started when their daughter Jennifer was ready to go to kindergarten. The school which they chose was at a considerable distance from their home and required a long drive.“It was a good drive away from our house. And I was making the argument that there was going to be so many years of driving. Maybe we just wait and put her in that school when she was a little bit older. Bill was really quite adamant that he thought we should start then. And he said, 'I'll drive them,’” Melinda Gates told Business Insider.Melinda Gates was taken aback by the decision of Bill Gates of daily driving their daughter to school. Despite his demanding role at Microsoft, Bill Gates daily drove their daughter, looping back past their home to reach the office.Melinda then told Business Insider that this decision not only impacted their family but it also helped in changing the family dynamics of other students. A few weeks into the school year, Melinda said other moms approached her with a surprising observation — “They said, ‘Hey, do you see what’s changing in the classroom?’” “I’m seeing more dads dropping off kids,” she replied.“They’re like, ‘Yeah, we went home and told our husbands, If Bill Gates, the CEO of Microsoft, can drive his kid to school, so can you!’”Melinda also emphasised that their small decision to share responsibilities — such as school drop and doing dishes turned out to be an equitable version of parenting.Apart from this Melinda also shared that Bill Gates and their kids made the most of that drive and made some great memories from that commute. Melinda told BI, “Bill and the kids cherished those moments in the car. Listening to music together, the conversations over many years that they had — it's a side of him that they might not have seen otherwise. It would've been a missed opportunity.”","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates filed for their divorce in 2021.

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

Gujarat HC reaffirms Muslim couples' right to verbal mutual divorce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gujarat-hc-reaffirms-muslim-couples-right-to-verbal-mutual-divorce/articleshow/123249687.cms,"AHMEDABAD: In a significant ruling, the Gujarat high court has held that a Muslim marriage can be dissolved through 'mubaraat' - a mutual consent divorce - without the necessity of a written agreement recording such consent.Citing the Quran and the Hadith on the procedure for dissolution of marriage, the bench of Justice A Y Kogje and Justice N S Sanjay Gowda set aside an order by a Rajkot family court that had rejected a suit filed by a Muslim couple seeking a declaration of dissolution of marriage by Mubaraat.The family court had held the suit was not maintainable under Section 7 of the Family Courts Act because there was no written agreement regarding mutual consent for divorce.The couple, married in 2021 in Bihar, decided to end their marital union due to mutual aversion and opted for Mubaraat. They filed a suit in Rajkot's family court, which was rejected.On appeal, the high court, after a detailed hearing, referred to Quranic verses and observed: ""There is nothing to suggest that there has to be a written agreement of Mubaraat, nor is there any prevailing practice of maintaining a register to record such an agreement for mutually dissolved Nikah.""Expanding on the matter, the court noted: ""A register is merely a register maintained, and the Nikahnama issued on the basis of such a register is only a declaration of an agreement between two Muslims to enter into Nikah. However, such registration is not essential to personal law. Similarly, the court does not find that recording an agreement between the parties to the Nikah in any written format is essential for recording the fact of dissolution of marriage. For the purpose of Mubaraat, the expression of mutual consent to the dissolution of Nikah is sufficient to dissolve the Nikah in itself.""The high court found error in the family court's findings that a written agreement is a must for divorce ""as the same is not subscribed to any verse of the Quran, Hadith, or the practice followed amongst the Muslims under personal law.""The court also clarified that the logic of treating a register of Muslim marriages as a written contract was flawed: ""The logic given by the family court with regard to registering a Muslim marriage under a register to treat it as a written contract is also erroneous, as such a register and Nikahnama only recognise the agreement entered into by the parties to the marriage by uttering the words 'kabul' in the presence of the witness. That does not make a Nikahnama or registration of a Nikah part of an essential process of Nikah... Similarly, there is no process by which the written agreement is an essential requirement for Mubaraat.""The high court held that such a suit is maintainable under the Family Courts Act and remitted the matter back to the family court to decide afresh within three months.","Gujarat high court rules that a Muslim marriage can be dissolved through'mubaraat' A Rajkot family court had rejected a suit filed by a Muslim couple seeking a declaration of dissolution of marriage by Mubaraat.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
