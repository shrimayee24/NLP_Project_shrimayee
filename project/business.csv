Preparation of River-Sensitive Master Planning (RSMP) is another component of the action plan.According to NMCG, five cities - Kanpur, Ayodhya, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, Moradabad, and Bareilly - have already developed their URMPs, setting the benchmark for other urban centres. Twenty-five more URMPs will be prepared this year. It will be part of creating 60 such plans across India over the next two to three years in the first phase.","The plan covers Agra, Ayodhya, Kanpur, Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Jhansi, Dehradun, Haridwar, Patna, Ranchi, Howrah, Pune, Nashik, Chennai, Hyderabad, Udaipur, Bhubaneshwar, Surat, Thiruvunanthapuram and Visakhapatnam.

SRINAGAR: Kashmir’s chief cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq returned to Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid to deliver his Friday sermon after restrictions of over a month, condemning the Pahalgam massacre and paying tributes to the victims.Mirwaiz and the others observed a minute’s silence in solidarity with the relatives of all those who lost their dear ones in the terror attack.Mirwaiz reminded his audience that the authorities had put him under house arrest ahead of previous Friday prayers in the past month. “Sadly, during this time, we had to witness a terrifying attack, which has left our hearts bleeding. The manner in which a carnage was carried out, more than two dozen people killed after ascertaining their identities and in front of their families, is shocking and chilling beyond belief,” Mirwaiz said.The chief cleric recalled the 1990 day when his father was shot dead by terrorists. “Who better can understand the pain and grief of loss of the families affected (in Pahalgam) than people who have suffered it (terror) for decades and still continue to. Today is the 36th martyrdom anniversary of my father, Mirwaiz Molvi Mohammad Farooq.”Mirwaiz told the gathering that “our hearts go out to these families who will never see their loved ones again, and our prayers are with them and we pray for speedy recovery of the injured.”Mirwaiz underscored Kashmiris’ famed hospitality, saying they had always opened their hearts and homes to outsiders, especially tourists. “People of Kashmir once again upheld the tradition of outreach, help, and humanity in this distressing time. Locals helped those at the (Pahalgam) spot to flee, even at risk to their own lives, in which pony operator Adil Hussain died. We pay homage to this brave young Kashmiri,” Mirwaiz said.He pointed out that other locals ferried the injured, some on their backs, to hospitals, while a complete shutdown was observed in memory of those killed. “The people of Kashmir sent a strong message of their total disapproval of such actions and solidarity and sympathy with the bereaved, standing shoulder to shoulder with them.” He requested authorities to allow him to visit the injured in hospitals and Adil’s family to pay condolences.Mirwaiz struck a note of caution and anguish at “a large section of mainstream media spreading communal rhetoric of hate against Kashmiris”. This, he said, has made Kashmiris across India vulnerable, forcing hundreds, especially students, to leave. “I appeal to govts in different states to ensure the safety of our students and all other Kashmiris,” Mirwaiz said.",Mirwaiz Umar Farooq returned to Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid to deliver his Friday sermon.

NEW DELHI: The Union government on Friday informed Supreme Court that deletion of a provision in the 1995 Waqf Act barring enforcement of rights over unregistered waqfs through an amendment in 2013 resulted in a massive rise in Waqf Board properties country-wide from 2,07,394 to 8,72,870 and a corresponding increase in area from 18.3 lakh acres to 39 lakh acres.Delhi Waqf Board in 2013 had just nine properties having an area of 0.03 acres. By 2025, the number of properties under its control increased to 1,047 having an area of 28 acres. This phenomenon was more accentuated in Jammu & Kashmir, where the Auqaf Board had just one property with 0.42 acres in 2013, which increased to 32,533 with an area of 31.4 acres by 2025, the Centre's affidavit said.Even in the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands, waqf properties increased from 35 in 2013 to 151 in 2025, with the accretion of an additional area of 138 acres. The least increase in waqf properties, from 51 in 2013 to 58 in 2025, was in Meghalaya, where Christians constitute 75% of the population, Hindus 11% and indigenous groups 9%.In Rajasthan too, the rise in waqf properties was minimal, adding 7,769 in 12 years to the 23,126 in 2013. In Tamil Nadu, waqf properties numbering 43,623 in 2013 increased by another 22,469 in the next 12 years. In Uttar Pradesh, Sunni Waqf properties increased from 12,914 in 2013 to 2,17,161 in 2025. In West Bengal, such properties increased from 17,946 in 2013 to 80,808 in 2025. In Gujarat, waqf properties increased from 3,074 in 2013 to 39,940 in 2025. Andhra Pradesh too saw a massive increase - from 390 in 2013 to 14,685 in 2025.Taking the overall picture of alarming increase in waqf properties without registration and suo motu declaration of a property as waqf by boards, the Centre said the 2025 amendment was brought in to ensure that ""Waqf Boards in the country are properly administered and function with transparency and prevent repeated abuse of waqf legislation which resulted in deprivation of personal properties of individuals and encroachment of govt land"".It said the amendment was necessitated because of ""repeated and documented instances across the country where Waqf Boards had claimed title over govt land, public utilities and protected monuments without deed, survey or adjudication, relying solely on the board's unilateral records. Said claims included waqf claims over collectors' offices, govt schools, ASI-protected heritage sites and land vested in state or municipal authorities"".","Delhi Waqf Board in 2013 had just nine properties having an area of 0.03 acres.

NEW DELHI: Dr Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan, an eminent space scientist, educationist and the guiding force behind India’s space and education milestones, passed away on Friday in Bengaluru at the age of 84. A former chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) and the chief architect of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Kasturirangan had been battling age-related ailments following a heart attack he suffered in Sri Lanka in July 2023. He breathed his last at 10:43 am at his Bengaluru residence.His mortal remains will be kept at the Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, on April 27 for people to pay their respects. He is survived by two sons.Kasturirangan-led Isro from 1994 to 2003, a period marked by major milestones, including the operationalisation of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and the successful flight-test of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle. Under his stewardship, Isro pursued technological self-reliance and began planning ambitious missions such as Chandrayaan, despite facing international sanctions following India’s 1998 nuclear tests.PM Narendra Modi said, “I am deeply saddened by the passing of Dr K Kasturirangan, a towering figure in India's scientific and educational journey. His visionary leadership and selfless contribution to the nation will always be remembered.” He praised Kasturirangan’s pivotal role in elevating Isro and said India would always be grateful for his contributions to education.President Droupadi Murmu acknowledged his integral role in shaping both India’s space programme and the NEP.Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan remembered him as an “intellectual titan”, saying, “To me, he was far more than a mentor — he was a guiding light, a wellspring of wisdom, compassion, and quiet strength.”Science and technology minister Jitendra Singh called him “a visionary scientist and a guiding force behind India’s space programme”. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said he made significant contributions in India's space exploration and contributed in various positions in key policy making.Prior to heading Isro, Kasturirangan directed the Isro Satellite Centre and was responsible for overseeing development of next-generation satellites including INSAT-2 and IRS-1A & 1B. As project director for BHASKARA-I and II, India’s first experimental Earth observation satellites, he laid the groundwork for the nation’s remote sensing capabilities.An accomplished astrophysicist, Kasturirangan’s research spanned high-energy X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy. He played a key role in conceptualising India’s first space-based high-energy astronomy observatory and authored over 200 research papers in leading national and international journals. He also edited six books.After his illustrious space career, Kasturirangan pivoted to education policy and led the drafting committee of the NEP-2020, introducing a transformative vision for Indian schooling and higher education. Later, he spearheaded the development of the National Curriculum Framework.He had famously stated, “The vision of India’s new education system is to ensure that it touches each and every citizen's life and creates a just and equitable society.”Kasturirangan was awarded all three of India’s top civilian honours — Padma Shri (1982), Padma Bhushan (1992), and Padma Vibhushan (2000). He was also Member of Rajya Sabha (2003–09), Planning Commission member, National Institute of Advanced Studies director (2004–2009) and JNU chancellor.Born on Oct 24, 1940, in Ernakulam, Kerala, he earned his physics degree from Bombay University and his PhD in experimental high-energy astronomy from the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad. Kasturirangan leaves behind a legacy that spans the cosmos and classrooms.","Dr Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan, an eminent space scientist, educationist and the guiding force behind India’s space and education milestones, passed away on Friday.

"Centre tells SC waqf law 'secular', says petitioners 'spinning a false narrative'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-tells-sc-waqf-law-secular-says-petitioners-spinning-a-false-narrative/articleshow/120631721.cms,"Supreme Court

Waqf Act restricted itself to secular side: Govt

NEW DELHI: Putting up a strong defence of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, the Centre called it a secular law and accused the petitioners challenging its validity in Supreme Court of spinning a false ""interference in religious affairs"" narrative on mandatory registration of every waqf, including ' waqf by user '. It said this provision was more than a century old.In a 1,332-page affidavit, joint secretary in the minority affairs ministry Shersha C Shaikh Mohiddin requested SC to abide by traditional assumption of validity of a law enacted by Parliament and conduct a detailed hearing without granting any stay on operation of the law, which is to stop misuse of 2013 amendment allowing encroachment of private and govt properties. In the last hearing, SC had flagged 3 issues in 2025 law - registration documents of waqf properties, inclusion of non-Muslims in Central Waqf Council and Waqf Boards & determination of govt land.In its affidavit, Centre pointed out that SC in the last 30 years never considered staying provisions of the 1995 Waqf Act and sought an ""equitable"" approach.Rebutting the charge that the new law represented an interference with religious rights of Muslims, the Centre said the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, restricted itself to secular dimensions like record management, procedural reforms and administrative structure and not even remotely attempted to interfere in any ritual, prayer or fundamental Islamic obligations.Addressing the three issues flagged by SC as 'contentious', the Centre said the architecture of the 1995 Waqf Act required a relook because of the sudden increase in the area covered under waqf. ""Till 2013, that is the period which included Mughal era, pre-independence era and post-independence era, the total area under waqf was 18.3 lakh acres. It is really shocking to note that after 2013, another 20.9 lakh acres of land were added to waqfs, which totalled 39.2 lakh acres,"" Centre said.It said no waqf or individual Muslims could validly question the 2025 provision for mandatory registration of waqf properties as this has been in existence since the enactment of Waqf Act, 1923, and the provision was consistently carried forward through the enactment of Waqf Act, 1954 and Waqf Act, 1995.""Legislative intent and policy has always been very clear with regard to waqf being registered so that it remains under the statutory regime with respect to its secular aspects like maintenance of accounts, survey of properties, transparent administration and supervision in case of transfer of property of waqf,"" the Centre said.""Those waqfs which have not registered themselves, including 'waqfs by user', since 1923, 1954, or at least prior to Jan 1, 1996 (date on which the 1995 Act came into force), nor have they been found to be in existence during the survey by the Survey Commissioner and an independent exercise mandated by law from the State Waqf Board and have no legal existence and any belated claim at this stage is not maintainable,"" it added.Centre said the legislative architecture over the last 100 years mandated registration of waqf properties and those who have violated the law are barred from arguing that ""exclusion of unregistered 'waqf by user' is either arbitrary, unreasonable or without any logic purpose or intent"".Central Waqf Council has 22 members and its nature of assignment is to recommend management of properties. Inclusion of a maximum of four non-Muslims would not alter the character or nature of the council. Similar is the case with Waqf Boards, where a maximum of three non-Muslims could be part of an 11-member body, it said.Defending provisions identifying unlawful waqf claims, Centre cited cases like Hyderabad's Viceroy Hotel wrongly claimed as waqf. It said earlier provisions enabled encroachments via 'waqf by user' and suo motu declarations. Now, govt property identified as waqf encroachment by a senior officer can be challenged before Waqf Tribunals, HCs, and SC, ensuring fair scrutiny.","The Centre called it a secular law and accused the petitioners challenging its validity in Supreme Court of spinning a false ""interference in religious affairs"" It said mandatory registration of every waqf, including 'waqf by user', was more than a century old.

"J&K: Small arms fray LoC ceasefire, big guns silent for now",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-small-arms-fray-loc-ceasefire-big-guns-silent-for-now/articleshow/120629973.cms,"Small arms fray LoC ceasefire

NEW DELHI: The ceasefire with Pakistan along the Line of Control has begun to fray with firing of small arms being reported from multiple locations since Thursday night, though big guns like howitzers and large mortars are yet to open up from either side to blow it to smithereens.The escalation in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror massacre came as Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi was in J&K to review the overall operational situation along the 778-km LoC as well as the counter-terror operations, with Udhampur-based Northern Command chief Lt-Gen MV Suchindra Kumar and his successor Lt-Gen Pratik Sharma, among other top officers.“Gen Dwivedi directed all formations to remain on the highest alert,” an officer said, in the backdrop of PM Modi and other top ministers promising deadly retribution as all military options for limited punitive strikes against Pakistan are on the table.A major incident of prolonged exchange of fire across the heavily-militarized LoC began at the Tutmari Gali sector in the Kupwara district of J&K around midnight, with Pakistani soldiers “initiating” heavy firing by assault rifles and light machine guns with “tracer bullets” at Indian Army posts.Indian troops deployed in the area “effectively” responded, with the exchange intermittently continuing for a few hours. “If the Pak troops fired around 600 rounds at our posts, our soldiers retaliated with over 1,300 rounds. There were no casualties on our side,” an officer told TOI.The exchange of fire at other places like Uri, Poonch, Tangdhar and Gurez was not so intense, with jumpy Pakistani soldiers largely indulging in “speculative firing” to elicit responses from the Indian side to pinpoint their positions. “The Pak Army is obviously on the edge and expecting a big Indian reaction,” the source added.The LoC has been relatively quiet since the rival director-generals of military operations reached a fresh understanding in Feb 2021 after a particularly violent year that saw as many as 5,133 ceasefire violations. Howitzers, 120mm mortars and anti-tank guided missiles were then often being used in a “direct firing mode” to cause maximum damage on the other side.Away from the LoC, the IAF has stepped-up its fighter sorties from air bases on the western front, stretching from Srinagar and Awantipur in J&K to Rajasthan, and kept its surface-to-air missile systems and other ground-based weapons on a high alert, sources said.The precautionary measures include enhancing the number of ORPs (operational readiness platforms) at various IAF air bases. An ORP usually includes two to three fighters being kept combat-ready in blast pens adjoining the runway at an airbase for immediate take-off whenever an alarm is sounded.Military officers say if the govt decides to go for some limited military action against Pakistan, the options range from the less-escalatory punitive artillery fire assaults across the LoC to precision air strikes by fighters like Rafales, Mirage-2000s and Sukhoi-30MKIs armed with long-range weapons like the French `Scalp’ air-to-ground cruise missiles, Israeli Crystal Maze missiles and Spice-2000 precision guided penetration bombs.",Firing of small arms reported from multiple locations since Thursday night. Big guns like howitzers and large mortars are yet to open up from either side. The escalation in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror massacre came as Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi was in J&K to review the overall operational situation.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120630028,imgsize-1109729,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-20.jpg"
Top US scientist of Indian-origin quits after DOGE hatchet slashes science,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-us-scientist-of-indian-origin-sethuraman-panchanathan-quits-after-doge-hatchet-slashes-science/articleshow/120622919.cms,"Image credit: ASU's website

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

A top US scientist of Indian-origin resigned as the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), whose $ 9 billion budget funds life-changing research in America, amid allegations that the MAGA-infused Trump administration is gutting science and research in the country.Sethuraman Panchanathan , an alumnus of IIT, Chennai, and Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, resigned with 16 months to go before the end of his six-year term, saying ""I believe I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency and feel that it is time for me to pass the baton to new leadership.""""Panch"" as he is popularly known among colleagues, did not delve into reasons for his departure, but the broad take-away in scientific circles from his all-staff memo is that he quit due to frustration over White House pressure to cut NSF’s $9 billion annual budget and cull the agency’s 1,700-person staff.""This is a pivotal moment for our nation in terms of global competitiveness. NSF is an extremely important investment to make US scientific dominance a reality. We must not lose our competitive edge,"" Dr Panchanathan urged in the memo, even as the Trump/Musk DOGE hatchet hacked at what they consider to be bloated expenditure that funds DEI priorities and non-essential research.The NSF has deep ties with Indian institutions such as the Department of Science and Technology and many universities, collaborating in areas like communications, semiconductors, cyberinfrastructure, secure computing, and green technology, directing millions of dollars to joint research. Although NSF does not directly fund Indian researchers or institutions, it channels grants to US researchers collaborating with Indian counterparts.Panchanathan was a key driver of 2023 US-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies that was signed in the White House. Although he was appointed to the post by President Trump during his first term, the NSF, like many storied American institutions, is running aground as the Trump-Musk credo of eliminating ""waste and fraud"" is drying up funding.As with many institutions, including its companion National Institute of Health (NIH), DOGE teams of young whippersnappers are said to have physically infiltrated into the NSF headquarters earlier this month, demanding accountability from senior leadership who they believe have long had a ""free run.""According to one account, the NSF was directed to terminate over $1 billion in grants and halt new awards that conflicted with President Trump’s executive orders relating to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), clashing directly, given his own background, with Panchanathan’s priorities such as increasing diversity in research.Born and raised in Chennai, Dr Panchanathan completed his B.SC in Vivekananda College and MSc and MTech at IISC and IIT respectively before coming to Canada for his PhD and later moving to US where he has rose rapidly in scientific, winning praise for his work in assistive and rehabilitative technologies, ubiquitous computing environments for individuals with disabilities, haptic user interfaces, and face/gait analysis and recognition. Among the start-ups he co-founded are MotionEase Inc. and RehabDev LLC, both focused on rehabilitative technologies.","Sethuraman Panchanathan, an alumnus of IIT, Chennai, and Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, resigned with 16 months to go before the end of his six-year term.

Poll Should sports events prioritize national sentiments over international participation? I have no opinion. It depends on the situation. No, sports should be inclusive. Yes, national sentiment comes first.

Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra responded to criticism over inviting Pakistani athlete Arshad Nadeem to the Neeraj Chopra Classic event in Bengaluru in May 2025, following the Pahalgam terror attacks . Chopra clarified that the invitations were sent before the attacks and defended himself against social media backlash targeting him and his family.Chopra emphasised that the invitation to Nadeem was purely from one athlete to another, with the event's goal being to bring top athletes to India for world-class competitions. In a conversation with the media, Neeraj had said Nadeem was invited, alongside other top javelin athletes, but had not confirmed his participation.On Thursday, Nadeem declined the invitation to participate in the event due to other commitments. The event also issued its list of foreign participants without the Paris Olympics gold medallist.""I usually am a man of few words, but that doesn't mean I will not speak up against what I think is wrong. More so when it comes to questioning my love for our country, and the respect and honour of my family. There has been so much talk about my decision to invite Arshad Nadeem to compete in the Neeraj Chopra Classic , and most of it has been hate and abuse,"" Chopra wrote in a post on social media.""They haven't even left my family out of it. The invitation I extended to Arshad was from one athlete to another - nothing more, nothing less. The aim of the NC Classic was to bring the best athletes to India and for our country to be the home of world-class sporting events. Invites had gone out to all athletes on Monday, two days before the terrorist attacks at Pahalgam.""""After all that has taken place over the last 48 hours, Arshad's presence at the NC Classic was completely out of the question. My country and its interests will always come first. To those that are going through the loss of their people, my thoughts and prayers are with you. Along with the entire nation, I am both hurt and angry at what has taken place.""""I am confident that our country's response will show our strength as a nation and justice will be served. I have carried my country with pride for so many years now, and so it hurts to see my integrity being questioned. It pains me that I have to explain myself to people who are targeting me and my family, with no good reason. We are simple people, please don't make us out to be anything else.""""There are so many false narratives that certain sections of the media have created around me, but just because I do not speak up, it doesn't make it true. I also find it difficult to understand how people switch opinions. When my mother - in her simplicity - had made an innocent comment a year ago, there was an outpouring of praise for her views.""""Today, the same people haven't held back from targeting her for that very same statement. I, meanwhile, will work even harder to ensure that the world remembers India and looks at it with envy and respect for all the right reasons. Jai Hind.""",Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra responded to criticism over inviting Pakistani athlete Arshad Nadeem.

Implications for global research

Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law, which restricts the sharing of “important data” with overseas partners without approval. The suspension impacts joint research in fields like health and environmental studies , raising questions about the future of international scientific cooperation .Implemented in 2021, China’s Data Security Law broadly defines “important data” as information that could threaten national or economic interests or affect the rights of individuals or organisations. European agencies, including the German Research Foundation , Swedish Research Council, and Swiss National Science Foundation, have expressed concerns over the law’s vague provisions, which make it difficult to assess compliance and avoid legal liabilities.The law requires security clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China to export data classified as “important,” effectively making cross-border data sharing extremely challenging. This has led to the suspension of new co-funded projects with China’s National Natural Science Foundation.The halt in collaborations could delay progress in critical areas like pandemic response and air quality studies, where data sharing is essential. Experts warn that the restrictions may hinder the ability to address global health challenges effectively.Jan Palmowski, Secretary-General of the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities, emphasised the need for responsible and safe data sharing to tackle future pandemics and other health crises.","Major European research funders have paused collaborative projects with China, citing concerns over the country’s Data Security Law.

As of April 2025, Bill Gates remains one of the wealthiest individuals in the world, continuing to exert global influence through both financial investments and philanthropic initiatives. Despite stepping away from his executive role at Microsoft over a decade ago and donating tens of billions to charitable causes, Gates maintains a net worth exceeding $100 billion. The co-founder of Microsoft and current chairman of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates has diversified his portfolio significantly over the years. His fortune is now driven largely by strategic investments managed through Cascade Investment LLC and bolstered by his legacy in the tech sector.According to the, Bill Gates' estimated net worth as of April 2025 stands at $104.6 billion, placing him at #14 on the global wealth rankings. This valuation accounts for a decade of large-scale philanthropy, including his landmark $20 billion donation to the Gates Foundation in 2022. Gates’ consistent presence in the upper echelon of the billionaire ranks is attributed to his diversified investment strategy and long-standing stake in Microsoft, even as his holdings in the company have decreased over time.At his peak, Gates held a dominant stake in Microsoft. However, since resigning from the company’s board in 2020, he has steadily reduced his ownership. By 2025, he owns less than 1% of Microsoft’s total outstanding shares. Despite the reduction, this still represents billions of dollars in value given Microsoft’s current market capitalization exceeding $2.5 trillion.A significant portion of Gates’ wealth is now managed through Cascade Investment LLC, a private investment firm he established with the help of financial advisor Michael Larson. Cascade’s portfolio spans multiple sectors, including:These diversified holdings have allowed Gates to reduce dependency on tech and ensure long-term financial stability.Bill Gates no longer earns from corporate salaries or direct product revenues. Instead, his wealth is sustained through:Though he spends much of his time on philanthropic work, his investments continue to generate substantial returns, ensuring his net worth remains in the multi-billion-dollar range.While Gates was once the richest person in the world, he has since been surpassed by tech entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, who currently have estimated net worths between $200 billion and $300 billion. However, Gates still ranks higher than:Gates’ lower rank is largely due to his extensive charitable giving, but his wealth still surpasses many current tech executives and CEOs.Gates has donated more than $59 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, making it the largest private philanthropic organization in the world. The foundation focuses on:The 2022 donation of $20 billion marked a major milestone in Gates’ ongoing pledge to give away the majority of his fortune.Gates is also a co-founder of The Giving Pledge, a global movement encouraging billionaires to commit at least half their wealth to charitable causes during their lifetimes. He has stated publicly that his children will inherit only a modest portion of his wealth, emphasizing values of self-reliance and service.Unlike many billionaires who invest heavily in luxury items or space travel, Gates is known for a relatively modest lifestyle. His primary residence is a technologically advanced mansion known as Xanadu 2.0 in Medina, Washington, estimated to be worth over $130 million. The 66,000-square-foot estate features:He also owns farmland across the U.S. and a collection of classic cars, but his lifestyle reflects more practicality than extravagance.In 2025, Bill Gates continues to be a central figure in global conversations surrounding:Gates frequently publishes reports, appears at international summits, and collaborates with governments and NGOs to support large-scale initiatives.

Mark Zuckerberg's Education Ventures

The Primary School , a no-cost private institution in the Bay Area co-founded by Priscilla Chan , wife of Facebook parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , will reportedly cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students. First reported by Bloomberg, the impending closure was disclosed in a statement posted on the school's website recently. In a move aimed at preserving its legacy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the billionaire couple's philanthropic arm, has committed $50 million to invest in the communities the school serves -— specifically East Palo Alto, Belle Haven, and the East Bay region near San Francisco -- over the subsequent few years.""This was a very difficult decision, and we are committed to ensuring a thoughtful and supportive transition for students and families over the next year,"" the online statement conveyed. Carson Cook, a spokesperson for The Primary School, stated there would be no further comment beyond the official announcement.Pediatrician Priscilla Chan, 40, co-established The Primary School in 2016, implementing an ""integrated health and education model"" designed to support families and children from birth through high school, according to the organization's tax filings. The school's inaugural middle school cohort commenced in 2023.The most recent tax documentation indicates that over 95% of The Primary School's students in East Palo Alto identify as under-represented minorities. The filing also revealed the nonprofit held assets exceeding $30 million as of the end of June 2023.The Primary School is among several educational endeavors recently initiated by prominent billionaires. Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison have all established schools in recent years. Musk's nonprofit, the Musk Foundation, has contributed $237 million to his technology-focused primary and secondary school in Austin, named Ad Astra, with future aspirations for a university. Ad Astra collaborates with the same entity that assisted Ellison in establishing his Hala Kahiki Montessori school in Lanai, Hawaii, an island largely owned by the Oracle co-founder. Amazon.com founder Bezos has created a network of Montessori-inspired preschools catering to children in underserved communities.The closure of The Primary School coincides with significant strategic shifts within Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc. as the 40-year-old founder appears to be aligning his business interests more closely with the Trump administration. Recent appointments to Meta's board include longtime Trump allies Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, and Dina Powell McCormick, who served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser during his first term.Furthermore, Zuckerberg has appointed a Republican strategist as chief of global affairs, eliminated Meta’s US fact-checking program, rolled back the company’s hate-speech policies, and discontinued key diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at both Meta and CZI. This contrasts with The Primary School's documented commitment to diversity, which included conducting a diversity audit in June 2020 following the Black Lives Matter protests and forming a DEI task force in the fall of that year.","The Primary School will cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students.

The month of March holds special significance in the life and literary struggles of Mooloor Padmanabha Panicker (1869-1931). Just as the birth, enlightenment and Parinibbana of the Buddha all fall in the month of Vaisakh, Mooloor Asan was born and passed away in March. This past March 2025 marked the centenary of his 1925 Malayalam poetic verse translation of the ‘Dhammapada’ of the Buddha, undertaken at the behest of Sahodaran Ayyappan.Through works like ‘Pulavrithangal’ and ‘Kaviramayana’, Mooloor democratized Malayalam literary culture in the early 20th century. His literary interventions laid the foundation for Kerala’s enlightenment modernity as envisioned by Narayana Guru .Mooloor’s literary journey began with early encouragement from Narayana Guru when the guru visited the Mooloor household in Idanad, Chengannur, in the late 19th century. He wrote in the popular verse forms like Ammanapattu and Kilipattu. He is also well known for his Attakadhas for Kathakali.Mooloor is the first accepted Avarna poet in modern times in Kerala. He was given the title Sarasakavi by Valiyakoyi Tampuran.Living by the principle of fraternity championed by the Guru, Mooloor stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Dalits and other marginalized communities. Alongside his younger peer Ayyappan, he helped extend the Guru’s egalitarian message through poetry, activism, and cultural reform.Kurumban Daivathan, Kesavasastri, Kuzhaliyal and many other Dalit brethren achieved education and organisation through this fraternity of Mooloor. Avarnas, women and minorities became part of the poetic canon through his struggles. Thottakattu Ikkavamma and Kandathil Varughese Mappila were also recognized as poets through his concerted cultural politics and letters.A century ago, this pioneering poet-disciple of Narayana Guru, who is called the Kerala Buddha by his poet disciples, set in motion the wheel of ethics or the Dhammachakka (Dharmachakra) of the Buddha and Asoka in Kerala again.It is also comparable to Guru’s own 1918 statement in Sri Lanka, citing the Amarakosa that his philosophy is also Buddhism, inaugurating the modern Buddhism in Kerala led by his lead disciples, Sahodaran, Mooloor, C V Kunjuraman, Dr Palpu and Mitavadi Krishnan. He cited Amarasimha, describing the Buddha as Advayavadi and Vinayaka.Dhammapada is one among the 15 parts of Khudaka Nikaya within Sutapidaka. Suta, Vinaya and Abhidhamma Pitakas form the Tipidaka or Tripidaka, the three great baskets of the Pali canon finalized during Asoka’s third great conference in Patna in BCE 244 and taken to Sri Lanka as oral verses by Mahinda, his son and eventually written down in Sri Lanka by King Vattagamini.In 26 chapters or Vaggas of the Dhammapada, there are 423 verses. It is mostly a compilation of the words of the Buddha as he talked to the people on various occasions. So, he used the language of the common people, Pali or Ardha Magadhi. Buddha Ghosha, who wrote a commentary on the Dhammapada as Dhammapada-Attakadha, also attests to the fact that it is the word of the Buddha. Dhammapada literally means the place or stature of the Dhamma. It also means the way or Marga of the Dhamma as taught by the Buddha.It is a simple and lucid introduction or entry point to the world of nuanced ethical thoughts by the Buddha.The quintessence of the text is Triratna or triple gems, Chatur Satya or Fourfold Truths, Panchaseela or Five Precepts and Attamagga or Eightfold Paths. Triratana or Trisarana means Buddham or enlightenment, Dhammam or ethics and democratic or representative and participatory society, or Sangha.Fourfold truths means the Chatur Ariya Satyas of the awareness of suffering, the cause of suffering, the elimination of suffering and the Attamagga or eightfold paths for it. Panchaseela means abstaining from killing, stealing, lying, intoxication and adultery. Attamagga or Ashtanga Marga means the right or total or comprehensive ethical perspective, conception, words, action, livelihood, efforts, concentration and meditation.Mooloor’s translation is widely appraised as the most enduring translation in poetry by multilingual scholars and critics alike. The centenary of this monumental text deserves earnest recognition from Kerala’s cultural institutions, media, and academia.(Dr Ajay S Sekher:",The month of March holds special significance in the life and literary struggles of Mooloor Padmanabha Panicker (1869-1931) This past March 2025 marked the centenary of his 1925 Malayalam poetic verse translation of the ‘Dhammapada’ of the Buddha.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/47529300.jpg"

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

"'Not only unlawful, but harmful': 19 states sue Trump administration over DEI programs in public schools",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-only-unlawful-but-harmful-19-states-sue-trump-administration-over-dei-programs-in-public-schools/articleshow/120629544.cms,"Donald Trump

In a move to challenge the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in public schools, 19 states filed a federal lawsuit on Friday.The lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts by Democratic attorneys general, seeks to block the Department of Education’s directive, issued on April 3, which threatened to cut federal funding if states did not comply with civil rights laws and reject what the federal government deemed ""illegal DEI practices.""The directive required states to certify their compliance by April 24, including gathering signatures from local school systems confirming their adherence. However, the plaintiffs, attorneys general from 19 states, argue that they will not abandon policies designed to ensure equal access to education and that their prior certifications of compliance with the law stand.“Diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives are legal efforts that help students feel safe, supported and respected. The Trump administration’s threats to withhold critical education funding due to the use of these initiatives are not only unlawful, but harmful to our children, families, and schools,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell.This new lawsuit follows a series of rulings against the Trump administration earlier this week. Judges in three states issued decisions blocking elements of the directive: a Maryland judge postponed the effective date of the February 14 memo, which instructed schools to end practices that differentiate people based on race; a judge in Washington, DC, granted a preliminary injunction against the April certification letter; and in New Hampshire, a judge ruled that the education department cannot enforce either directive against the plaintiffs, which include one of the nation's largest teachers' unions.All three cases argue that the guidance threatens academic freedom and is vague, leaving schools uncertain about what actions are permissible, such as whether voluntary student groups for minority students can continue.The new lawsuit warns that the administration’s directive could put more than $13.8 billion in federal funding at risk, money that supports students, including those with disabilities.“Plaintiffs are left with an impossible choice: either certify compliance with an ambiguous and unconstitutional federal directive -- threatening to chill policies, programs and speech -- or risk losing indispensable funds that serve their most vulnerable student populations,” the lawsuit states.The lawsuit is backed by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.The education department has not yet responded to requests for comment. Linda McMahon, education secretary under President Donald Trump, had warned that states refusing to sign the certification forms could face funding cuts. In an interview on the Fox Business Network, McMahon stated that states that do not comply could “risk some defunding in their districts,” adding that the purpose of the form is “to make sure there’s no discrimination that’s happening in any of the schools.”","19 states filed a federal lawsuit on Friday against the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in public schools.

NEW DELHI: In his first public reaction to the recent terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, US President Donald Trump described the incident as “a bad one” and acknowledged the long-standing tensions between India and Pakistan.Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump reflected on the deep-rooted nature of the conflict in Kashmir and voiced hope that both nations would “figure it out.”“I’m very close to India and very close to Pakistan,” Trump said. “They’ve had that fight for a thousand years in Kashmir… that was a bad one yesterday—over 30 people,” he added, referencing the April 22 terror strike in the Valley, that claimed the lives of 25 Indian tourists and one Nepali citizen.When asked about his concerns over the escalating border tensions, Trump said that the India-Pakistan rivalry along the Line of Control has persisted for centuries. “Tensions on that border for 1,500 years… but I am sure they’ll get it figured out one way or the other,” he said, while reiterating his familiarity with both countries’ leadership.Following the deadly attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly introduced a range of diplomatic measures: suspending the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme for Pakistani nationals, closing the Integrated Check Post at Attari, issuing a 40-hour return deadline for Pakistani visitors, and reducing diplomatic staff in both countries' high commissions.India also halted its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty—a decades-old water-sharing agreement brokered by the World Bank in 1960 after nine years of negotiations. Recognised as one of the most durable international treaties, the Indus Waters Treaty allocates the three eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej) to India, while Pakistan receives rights over the three western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab). India is entitled to 20% of the Indus River System’s waters under the pact, with Pakistan receiving the remaining 80%.",US President Donald Trump described the recent terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam as ‘a bad one’ Trump reflected on the deep-rooted nature of the conflict in Kashmir and voiced hope that both nations would ‘figure it out’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120629189,imgsize-960833,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-6.jpg"
SEVIS is being quietly restored for international students across US: Indian students who were the most impacted can breathe easy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sevis-is-being-quietly-restored-for-international-students-across-us-indian-students-who-were-the-most-impacted-can-breathe-easy/articleshow/120628179.cms,"(AI image)

MUMBAI: International students will be able to breathe easy, at least for now, as the Trump administration appears to have backtracked on the abrupt, unlawful SEVIS termination of hundreds of international students.Immigration attorneys are reporting that since Thursday evening, Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records have been quietly reinstated for a large number of international students across the US, including those students who are not involved in lawsuits filed to challenge termination of their records.According to attorneys, news is pouring in from the international student community and from educational institutions of a terminated status suddenly becoming ‘active’. In many cases, Designated School Officers (DSOs) have informed students of the reactivation of their SEVIS records.For instance, ‘The Daily Californian’, an independent, student-run newspaper which covers the UC Berkeley campus and Berkeley city, has reported: “At UC Berkeley, 12 students have had their status restored today after 23 were terminated since April 4.”SEVIS is the web-based information system that the US agencies use to track and monitor international students during their duration of study. On abrupt termination of SEVIS – an exercise that began in mid-March, affected students were informed by DSOs to self-deport, resulting in several lawsuits being filed.Initially – as of Thursday, educational institutes were unaware for the reasons for reactivation. However, immigration attorneys state that some institutions have now been informed that Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) is developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations. “Until such a policy is issued the SEVIS records will remain active/will be reactivated. ICE will not modify the SEVIS records solely based on the NCIC finding that resulted in the recent SEVIS terminations…,” states the communication. The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) is a central database for crime-related information in the US, maintained by the Criminal Justice Information Services Division (CJIS) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It provides access to virtually all law enforcement agencies nationwide and enables rapid exchange of information.The New York Times reports that “The Trump administration on Friday abruptly walked back its cancellation of more than 1,500 student visas held by international students, announcing a dramatic shift by ICE during a court hearing in Washington. Joseph F. Carilli, a Justice Department lawyer, said that immigration officials had begun work on a new system for reviewing and terminating visas for international students and that until the process was complete, agencies would not make additional changes or further revocations.” The paper also quotes him as saying that the government was prepared to file the policy change across other lawsuits, potentially providing some reprieve for students who had sued to have their visas reinstated and remain in the country through graduation ceremonies in the spring.The grounds on which action was taken against international students for F-1 visa revocation and/or SEVIS termination were arbitrary. Based on the recent statement by ICE, in many cases it was presumably based on NCIC data. As reported by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) and other advocacy groups, not all instances of termination related to campus activism. Some related to minor infractions with police such as not wearing a seatbelt, tickets for illegal parking, or speeding tickets or even instances of domestic violence where even the victim is taken into custody. In other cases, the international students had no run-in with the police at all.According to immigration attorneys, during the recent court hearings US agencies have not been able to offer any tangible explanation for the abrupt termination of SEVIS records, except to counter that it does not result in irreparable harm. With Indian students being the largest cohort, they were the most impacted by the abrupt SEVIS terminations. Hundreds of students have filed lawsuits with various district courts challenging their SEVIS termination – which made them vulnerable to devastating immigration outcomes such as detention and deportation, as well as irreparable harm. Many others are lining up to file individual lawsuits or join class action suits.Courts such as Georgia, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Washington and Wisconsin have granted temporary restraining orders. As reported by TOI recently, pursuant to an order of a district court (Northern District of Georgia) SEVIS records of all 133 students who were party to a lawsuit were reinstated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) retroactive to March 31.Jonathan Wasden, an immigration attorney, said, “We are seeing many SEVIS status being reactivated in cases of our clients who had obtained temporary restraining orders. It seems that the DHS is slowly working its way out of the hole it dug for itself. We are also hearing that DHS has been reactivating SEVIS in cases where these international students have not sued. The heavy lift may be done here and the agency may be backing off on this issue.”Some immigration attorneys are asking international students to approach their DSOs to check their SEVIS records, before planning any further course of action. On the other hand, due to the uncertainty involved, several students have decided to proceed with their plans of a lawsuit.IMMPact Litigation a joint venture of four law firms, is all set to file a class action suit in the coming week, as many questions still remain unanswered – including those relating to unlawful presence, OPT unemployment accrual (while the students could not work), or whether revoked visas will be reinstated again.","Immigration attorneys are reporting that since Thursday evening, Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records have been quietly reinstated for a large number of international students.

'Jung karni hai to...': How Pakistanis are trolling themselves on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/jung-karni-hai-to-how-pakistanis-are-trolling-themselves-on-social-media/articleshow/120622600.cms,"After the Pahalgam massacre—where terrorists from Pakistan crossed the border and executed 26 people in cold blood—the usual geopolitical script began to unfold. India condemned, Pakistan denied, and the West reached for its thesaurus of euphemisms : “gunmen,” “militants,” “insurgents.” But something unusual happened this time. The sharpest rebuke didn’t come from New Delhi or Washington. It came from within Pakistan itself.Not from TV anchors or ministers. But from everyday Pakistanis—with Wi-Fi in one hand, rage in the other, and no illusions left to break.Take this tweet: “Jung karni ho to 9 baje se pehle kar lena, 9:15 per gas chali jati hai hamari.”Translation: If you're planning a war, please do it before 9am—we run out of gas after that.It would be hilarious if it weren’t heartbreakingly accurate. Pakistan, a nuclear power, can’t guarantee a cup of tea in the morning.Another tweet offered mock-condolences: “People of Karachi, Faisalabad, Multan, Islamabad—we are sorry.”A citizen apologising not for terrorism—but for governance. Or the lack of it.This isn’t your everyday political frustration. This is something more profound. More fatalistic. What we're witnessing is post-collapse satire—not born from resistance, but from resignation. Not defiance, but detachment. Pakistanis aren’t mocking their military, politicians, or failing institutions because they’re angry. They're doing it because there's nothing left to do but laugh.The timing of this public self-roast is revealing. Pakistan has once again been implicated in a cross-border terrorist attack. The victims were targeted for their religion. The attackers were affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba ’s proxy, The Resistance Front. And while the world watched, Pakistanis didn’t take to the streets to support their “freedom fighters.” They didn’t protest Indian foreign policy. They turned inward—and began roasting the very state that enabled this tragedy.Not because they were suddenly overcome with guilt. But because they’ve understood what the world still struggles to say aloud:The real victim of Pakistan’s obsession with jihad isn’t India. It’s Pakistanis themselves.Their fuel. Their food. Their currency. Their safety. Their dignity.All sacrificed at the altar of “strategic depth.”While generals polish their medals and issue denials, the public boils with a mix of exhaustion and clarity. There’s no electricity. Gas is rationed like contraband. Inflation hovers at 30%. The rupee is in freefall. The government runs on loans. And when Pakistan was supposed to host the ICC Champions Trophy, India refused to show up—forcing Pakistan to play on neutral ground in Dubai. The punchline wrote itself: even Pakistan can’t host itself without a connecting flight.This level of civic self-awareness would have once been dangerous. A decade ago, a sarcastic tweet could get you disappeared. Today, the dam has broken. Not because the state has grown tolerant—but because the people have grown numb. The rot is no longer underground. It’s trending on X.If memes are the last resort of a powerless populace, then Pakistanis are now full-time philosophers. Their humour is bleak, their metaphors are postmodern, and their sarcasm is indistinguishable from sadness. This is not the comedy of rebellion. This is the comedy of collapse.After Pahalgam, the rest of the world looked at Pakistan with suspicion. But for once, Pakistanis looked inward—and they laughed. Not because they didn’t care. But because they’ve stopped pretending that anything will change. The state has lost the plot. The people have rewritten it as dark comedy.And so, in the aftermath of yet another tragedy, it wasn’t India that needed to respond. The loudest condemnation came from within Pakistan. Not through op-eds or diplomatic cables, but through memes, tweets, and deadpan jokes. The only thing that still functions on time in Pakistan today is the punchline.They mocked their inability to keep the lights on. Their dependence on bailouts. Their cricketing humiliations. Their rulers. Their uniforms.It was gallows humour in a gaslit republic.Albert Camus would’ve called it freedom—the moment you stop asking why and simply push the boulder again. That’s the Sisyphus Clause.India, despite all its flaws, still chases Jefferson’s promise of happiness—through growth, dissent, and democracy.Pakistan? It has stopped expecting anything. And in that quiet surrender, it has turned its citizens into jesters, philosophers, and unwilling realists.They don’t protest anymore. They don’t revolt. They meme. Because in Pakistan, even tragedy comes with load-shedding. And the only thing that ever arrives on time… is the joke.","After the Pahalgam massacre, Pakistanis turned inward and began roasting the very state that enabled this tragedy. Pakistanis aren’t mocking their military, politicians, or failing institutions because they’re angry. They're doing it because there's nothing left to do but laugh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120622718,imgsize-95910,width-400,resizemode-4/How-Pak-social-media-is-trolling-themselves.jpg"

Overlooked letter shows Shakespeare was not a neglectful husband,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/overlooked-letter-shows-shakespeare-was-not-a-neglectful-husband/articleshow/120632792.cms,"NYT photo

Any clue about William Shakespeare's life usually excites scholars, but one piece of evidence had been neglected for decades. Now, a new analysis of that overlooked document seems to shatter a long-standing narrative about the Bard's bad marriage.Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend in Stratford-upon-Avon, in her mid-20s and pregnant. For centuries, it was thought he left his wife and children behind for a literary life in London, seeking to avoid ""the humiliation of domestic feuds"", as one 19th-century essayist put it. This view of Shakespeare's wife as a ""distant encumbrance"" suited scholars who thought ""Shakespeare was far too interesting to be a married guy,"" said Matthew Steggle, a professor at University of Bristol, England. The perception was bolstered by the fact that Shakespeare had left her his ""second best bed"" in his will. But Steggle's research, expected to be published this week in the journal Shakespeare, suggests the writer was not detached from his marriage after all.The hint lies in a fragment of a 17th-century letter addressing a ""Mrs Shakspaire,"" found in the binding of a book published in 1608. The letter was noted in 1978 by an amateur historian, but got minimal attention, even after the book was unbound in 2016, revealing what appeared to be part of a reply from Shakespeare's wife, Steggle said.If it really was addressed to Mrs Shakespeare, ""it is self-evidently remarkable,"" Steggle said - it offers new clues about their relationship, and suggests Mrs Shakespeare lived for a time in London with her husband. If she did live in London, she was possibly back in Stratford by the time she received the letter, around 1607 - though not necessarily because her husband wanted independence. Steggle says ""there is an obvious reason to avoid London in 1603-4, namely the very bad wave of plague"". Also, the upcoming arrival of their first grandchild after daughter Susanna's 1607 marriage ""would surely be a good time"" for Hathaway to be back in Stratford.Steggle says her movements should be reconsidered with an eye to her ""possible absences from London rather than her perpetual absence"". The letter concerned money for a fatherless child named John. It called upon her to pay money, most likely held in trust for him, a pledge her husband may have undertaken, and referred to a time when she ""dwelt in trinitie lane,"" which Steggle believes refers to a location in London.","William Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend.

"Why Annabel Elliot, Queen Camilla’s sister, refuses to curtsy her despite royal protocol",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-annabel-elliot-queen-camillas-sister-refuses-to-curtsy-her-despite-royal-protocol/articleshow/120612332.cms,"Annabel (L) and Camilla (R): AP file photos

Annabel Elliot , younger sister to the British Queen Camilla and official “companion” to her, has said she still cannot bring herself to curtsy to her elder sibling—even two decades after Camilla entered the royal family.The revelation came in a new Tatler profile written by royal biographer Robert Hardman to mark the 20th wedding anniversary of King Charles and Queen Camilla.Although royal customs have relaxed over time—and the official royal website says there are no compulsory gestures—curtsying remains common within the royal household. For most, especially insiders like Elliot who hold formal roles, such traditions are still followed.Elliot, an interior designer by profession, said the formality feels unnatural despite her sister’s royal status. “I think she’s transitioned beautifully, actually. I mean, I sometimes look at her, and I can’t really believe it,” she said, reflecting on Camilla’s journey from private citizen to Queen.While Elliot may skip the curtsy, her love and support for Camilla are unwavering. She has been described as the Queen’s emotional anchor, especially during a difficult year in 2024, which saw family health challenges and personal loss.In the BBC documentary Charles III: The Coronation Year, Elliot appeared visibly moved as she recalled watching her sister depart for Westminster Abbey in the golden coach. “It was quite a moment,” she said, recalling how surreal it felt to see someone she grew up with take the throne beside King Charles.",Annabel Elliot is the younger sister to the British Queen Camilla.
