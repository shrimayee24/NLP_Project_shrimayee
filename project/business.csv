Threads of history

Struggles of continuity

In 1946, when Mahatma Gandhi set foot in Sualkuchi, a picturesque village nestled along the Brahmaputra near Guwahati, he was spellbound by the artistry of the local weavers, particularly the women. Their looms seemed to weave not just silk, but dreams, he felt. His words — “Assamese women weave dreams on their looms”, have lingered like the rustle of silk ever since.Nearly eight decades later, those looms are still humming. Sualkuchi remains one of the rare places in India where handlooms, not machines, dictate the rhythm of daily life.While many historic silk weaving centres across India have succumbed to the lure of power looms for economic gain, Sualkuchi, located 35km from Guwahati, remains a bastion of handloom tradition. This steadfast commitment to authenticity is a bequest of the village’s dedication to preserving its cultural heritage. Despite govt’s push for mechanisation in places like Varanasi and Kancheepuram, Sualkuchi’s weavers, supported by their community and loyal customers, have resisted, ensuring that the artistry of handwoven Muga and Pat silk remains untouched by the clatter of machines.This village, with approximately 50,000 people, produces three exquisite varieties of Assam silk — the golden Muga, the warm Eri, and the lustrous Pat — each derived from different silkworms.Within its 8 sq km, 12,000 handlooms work tirelessly, producing around 3 lakh sq m of silk fabric a year, valued at Rs 300 crore. But beyond the numbers lies something more fragile: a cultural identity woven into every strand of yarn. This cottage industry supports nearly 6,000 families, all intricately woven into the fabric of Sualkuchi’s identity.Dr Nihar Ranjan Kalita, an adviser to the Sualkuchi Tat Silpa Unnayan Samiti and principal of SBMS (Sualkuchi Budram Madhab Satradhikar) College, explains that the village’s handloom industry thrives because it is deeply embedded in the local culture. He says that the younger generation, drawn by the allure of fashion and style, actively participates in this age-old craft, ensuring its continuity. “There is societal pressure in Sualkuchi and Assam to keep the textile industry handloombased. The community understands the exquisite value of handloom products.”In Sualkuchi, wearing a mekhela chador (Assam’s traditional two-piece garment) made of Pat and Muga silk is a mark of prestige at weddings and festive gatherings. The village’s commitment to the handloom is so strong that the word “powerloom” is almost taboo, seen as a threat to the originality of their textiles.Kalita, who has explored various textile hubs across India, observes that while other centres focus on exports, Sualkuchi’s products are cherished domestically. This local focus, coupled with govt support for semimechanisation in allied activities, helps maintain the village’s handloom legacy.This guardianship of tradition is not without struggle. In 2013, when powerloom textiles and counterfeit fabrics began flooding the market, threatening to dilute Sualkuchi’s reputation, villagers rose in protest. Their agitation eventually led to the establishment of the Sualkuchi Silk Testing Laboratory. In 2017, its centuries-old weaving tradition earned trademark status. Now, entrepreneurs submit their products in the lab where every piece of silk is tested, certified, and tagged — with a QR code, a 3D hologram and the Silk Mark logo — if they meet the standards.With a quick scan, buyers today can verify a garment’s authenticity, trace its fabric details, and even discover the specific handloom and artisan behind the weave. The trademark seal, ‘Sualkuchi’s’, acts as both a brand and a shield, protecting these handcrafted treasures from counterfeiting.During’s visit to the lab, the staffers were seen conducting three tests to confirm authenticity — burning analysis, microscopic crosssectional examination and chemical verification. The first test involves burning small thread samples to verify silk content; microscopic analysis identifies the specific silk variety, while chemical testing is performed when the first two examinations prove inconclusive.Assam is unique in producing all four recognised silk varieties in India — Muga, Eri, Mulberry, and Tussar. But it is Muga that sets Sualkuchi apart. The distinctive golden yellow silk, exclusive to Assam, comes from the Antheraea assamensis silkworm. It’s valued for its longevity and distinctive lustre.Eri, recognised for its even texture, is used in clothing and household items. In the Mulberry category, despite substantial demand for the yarn, the supply of the locally available Nuni pat variety is insufficient. Weavers often source Mulberry and Tussar yarn, a recent addition to the state’s silk portfolio, from Karnataka (Mulberry), Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal (Tussar).Sualkuchi’s history dates back to the 11th century, when King Dharma Pala of the Pala Dynasty established it as a weavers’ village by relocating 26 weaver families from Tantikuchi in Barpeta. Royal patronage turned the village into a hub of silk weaving. During the 17th century, under Ahom rule, it had become Assam’s primary handloom centre. For centuries, its economy thrived not just on weaving but also on pottery, goldsmithing, and oil pressing — until the 1940s, when only the looms endured.Until 1930, silk weaving was concentrated within Tantipara’s Tanti community. World War II gave Sualkuchi its biggest push, as skyrocketing demand and prices prompted several Tanti families to establish commercial weaving units with hired workers.However, challenges like rising raw material costs, market instability, and limited cocoon availability have pressed Sualkuchi’s weavers hard. “Muga silk products of Sualkuchi have been the most precious. But inadequate supply of cocoons and high prices of yarn have confined the number of households producing Muga textile to about 50,” says Kalyan Kalita, an entrepreneur. “Once, Sualkuchi was known for Muga above all else. Now, few families can afford to produce them. ” The industry has seen shifts: Bodo weavers, mostly women, have returned home after peace talks, reviving traditional skills, and skilled weavers from Bengal found refuge in Sualkuchi post-Covid. This convergence of talent has reinforced the village’s handloom tradition.Weaver Binita Boro reflects on the enduring appeal of the craft: “Handloom cannot die. As a child, I watched my aunt weave dreams here in Sualkuchi. Now, as an adult, I am part of this enchanting village.”","Sualkuchi is a picturesque village nestled along the Brahmaputra near Guwahati. It operates 12,000 handlooms, producing around 3 lakh sq m of silk fabric a year. The village’s commitment to the handloom is so strong that the word ‘powerloom’ is almost taboo.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125514594,imgsize-1372959,width-400,resizemode-4/article-81.jpg"

At G20 Summit, PM Modi Proposes Global Knowledge, Skills, Health And Security Initiatives For Future

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Saturday proposed a G20 Critical Minerals Circularity Initiative, saying for global growth, sustainability and clean energy are essential, and critical minerals have a huge role to play.“Under this, innovations such as re-cycling, urban mining and second-life batteries can be promoted,” said Modi, addressing a G20 meeting in Johannesburg. This comes amid concerns China is leveraging its chokehold over supply of rare and critical minerals to further its strategic goals.“If there is investment in circularity, then dependence on primary mining will be less. This will also reduce the pressure on the supply chain, and it will also be good for nature. This initiative can support joint research, technology standards and pilot recycling facilities in the Global South,” Modi said.Resilience cannot be built in silos, stressed the PM. “The G20 should promote comprehensive strategies that combine nutrition, public health, sustainable agriculture, and disaster preparedness, to create a robust global defence,” he said. PM Modi also suggested a G20 open satellite data partnership saying India believes that the entire humanity should benefit from space technology.“This will make satellite data and analysis of space agencies of G20 countries more accessible, interoperable and usable for countries in the Global South,” he said.","PM Narendra Modi proposed a G20 Critical Minerals Circularity Initiative.

ED Cracks Down On ‘White-Collar Terror Module’, Conducts 25 Raids Linked To Al-Falah University

LUCKNOW: Fresh revelations in the probe into the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) module busted in Faridabad have exposed a sophisticated weapons procurement and explosive-manufacturing network involving arrested suspects Dr Muzammil, Dr Shaheen, Dr Adeel and Amir.Investigators said Muzammil purchased a Russian assault rifle for Rs 5 lakh through a contact linked to co-accused Dr Shaheen. The weapon was later recovered from a locker belonging to Dr Adeel, marking a breakthrough in mapping the module's arms routes.Another Russian-origin rifle, an AK Krinkov, along with a Chinese star pistol, a Beretta pistol and nearly 2,900 kg of explosive precursor material, was earlier seized in Faridabad.Also Read | Chilling revelation in Delhi car blast: AK-47 bought for more than Rs 5 lakh, deep freezer used for explosives Officials said Lucknow-based Dr Shaheen arranged for the Russian assault rifles and deep freezer—after discreet negotiations with suppliers to avoid suspicion—on Umar's request and purchases were done by Muzzamil.The agencies are also tracking the suppliers. Overall, Rs 26 lakh was raised by the suspects, majority of the share through Shaheen.The freezer was allegedly used to store temperature-sensitive precursor chemicals essential for fabricating powerful improvised explosive devices (IEDs).Forensic teams are examining the recovered samples to identify the compounds.Intelligence sources said Shaheen not only helped arrange the rifle and freezer but also tapped her network to mobilise funds for the purchase of arms and ammunition. Sources added that the possible links could be through Afirah Bibi, the wife of Jaish commander and Pulwama attack mastermind Umar Farooq.Umar Farooq, the nephew of Jaish chief Masood Azhar, was killed in an encounter in the wake of the 2019 Pulwama attack that claimed the lives of 40 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).""The AK-56 recovery from Adeel's locker is a crucial link. It highlights the level of planning, financing and operational readiness of the module,"" an official said.The probe also revealed that Umar had extensively studied bomb-making tutorials, manuals and open-source content online and was given directions by handlers from Turkiye.He allegedly sourced chemical ingredients from Nuh, electronic components from Bhagirath Palace in Delhi and Faridabad's NIT Market and used the freezer to stabilise and process the explosive mixture.Sources added that tensions had erupted between the accused inside Al-Falah University premises over money matters, an altercation witnessed by several students.

PM Modi lauds South Africa’s presidency

In his address at the G20 summit in Johannesburg on Saturday, PM Narendra Modi pitched for sustainable and inclusive growth and made four proposals, including a coordinated global effort to combat the drug-terror nexus, calling drug trafficking a threat to public health, stability and security and a source of terror financing.He pushed for reconsidering the parameters of growth, saying the existing framework has left a vast section of the population deprived of resources and led to overexploitation of nature.Modi, who was instrumental in getting the African Union as a permanent member of G20 at the New Delhi meet of the grouping two years ago, emphasised the continent has suffered the most because of skewed growth priorities. “Today, as Africa hosts G20 Summit for the first time, it is imperative for us to reconsider the parameters of development.”The PM mentioned “integral humanism”, an idea associated with BJP’s ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay, as a path forward. “We will have to look at the individual, society and nature as an integrated whole. Only then can we achieve true harmony between progress and nature,” he said.He proposed creation of a global traditional knowledge repository built on Indian knowledge systems’ initiative, saying this can preserve the collective wisdom of humanity for future generationsBatting for a global healthcare response team to bring together experts from G20 countries, he said it will ensure swift measures in case of health emergencies and natural disasters.The speech was marked by an unabashed advocacy of what Modi called India’s civilisational ethos. India’s civilisational values, he said, can offer ways to reevaluate development parameters.Focusing on Africa, PM said the continent can benefit from skills transfer. He said Africa’s development and empowerment of its young talent are in the interests of the entire world and proposed a ‘G20-Africa Skills Multiplier Initiative’. This can operate under a “train-the-trainers” model across various sectors, and all G20 partners can finance and support this effort, he added.“Our collective goal will be to prepare one million certified trainers in Africa over the next decade. These trainers will, in turn, help equip millions of young people with skills. This initiative will have a powerful multiplier effect. It will strengthen local capacity and significantly contribute to Africa’s long-term development.”Turning his attention to drug trafficking, PM Modi singled out the “rapid spread of highly lethal substances like fentanyl”. “This has emerged as a serious challenge to public health, social stability and global security. It also serves as a significant channel for financing terrorism,” he said.A G20 initiative to counter this global threat can bring together various instruments relating to finance, governance and security. Only then can the drug-terror economy be effectively weakened, he said. Modi lauded South Africa’s presidency for making commendable progress on key areas such as skilled migration, tourism, food security, AI, digital economy, innovation and women’s empowerment, noting that historic initiatives undertaken at the New Delhi G20 Summit have been carried forwardPM Modi on Saturday also proposed a G20 Critical Minerals Circularity Initiative, saying that for global growth, sustainability and clean energy are essential, and critical minerals have a huge role to play.“Under this, innovations such as re-cycling, urban mining and second-life batteries can be promoted,” said PM Modi.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Two days prior to taking oath as the 53rd Chief Justice of India , Justice Surya Kant on Saturday said he does not get pressured by social media trolls, many of whom attempt to misrepresent, misquote or selectively extract court observations to create a negative impression about the judiciary despite having little knowledge of law.In an informal interaction with the media, Justice Kant said, ""I have never been pressured by the campaigns and motivated reporting on social media. I think an overwhelming majority of judges would not be affected by social media trolls as they decide cases based on facts and law.""Outlining his priorities, the CJI-designate said that in his tenure of one year and three months, he would focus on chalking out a strategy, in consultation with stakeholders, to reduce the pendency of 90,000 cases in SC and around 5 crore cases in HCs and district courts. The listing of long-pending bunch cases, whether before 9-Judge, 7-Judge or 5-Judge constitution benches, would get priority as thousands of cases, raising the same or similar questions of law, are pending in various HCs, which have deferred hearing them in anticipation of SC verdicts, he said.One such matter pending adjudication by a 9-Judge bench is the entry of women into Sabarimala temple, mosque and other custom-related religious issues.He said it is a matter of concern that despite SC judges disposing of almost as many cases as are filed every year, the pendency is increasing. Judges cannot be overburdened, whether in SC, HCs or trial courts, he said, adding that some innovative measure must be devised to tackle pendency.Mediation, he said, would be a game-changer in the future and reduce pendency in courts. It is receiving an encouraging response from public sector banks and insurance companies, which are asking the judiciary to train their personnel in mediation to resolve disputes at the pre-litigation stage. ""To use mediation to the fullest extent will be the focal point during my tenure as it is litigant-friendly and cost-effective,"" he said.","Justice Surya Kant said he does not get pressured by social media trolls.

Uranium found in breast milk in 6 Bihar districts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uranium-found-in-breast-milk-in-6-bihar-districts/articleshow/125511777.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The study was carried out by Mahavir Cancer Sansthan, Patna, under the leadership of Dr Arun Kumar and Prof Ashok Ghosh, in collaboration with AIIMS, New Delhi, led by Dr Ashok Sharma from the department of biochemistry.Conducted between October 2021 and July 2024, the research analysed breast milk from 40 mothers aged 17-35 in Bhojpur, Samastipur, Begusarai, Khagaria, Katihar and Nalanda.Uranium (U238) was detected in all samples, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 5.25 g/L. There is no permissible limit for uranium in breast milk.Khagaria recorded the highest average contamination, Nalanda the lowest, while Katihar showed the single-highest reading. Nearly 70% of infants faced exposure levels associated with potential non-carcinogenic health risks.Co-author Dr Ashok Sharma of AIIMS said the source of contamination remains unclear. ""We do not yet know the source of the uranium; the Geological Survey of India is also trying to find out. Unfortunately, uranium comes into the food chain and causes cancer, neurological disorders and affects the growth of children - which is a very serious concern,"" Dr Sharma said.Bihar's environmental conditions have compounded the issue. The state's heavy dependence on groundwater for drinking and irrigation, discharge of untreated industrial effluents and long-term use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides have already led to contamination with arsenic, lead and mercury in biological samples. The detection of uranium in breast milk signals the contamination has reached the most vulnerable population - infants.Infants are especially vulnerable to uranium because their organs are still developing, they absorb toxic metals more readily and their low body weight amplifies exposure. Uranium can cause kidney damage, neurological impairment, cognitive delays and increase the risk of cancer later in life.Globally, elevated uranium in groundwater has been reported in Canada, the US, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, Bangladesh, China, Korea, Mongolia, Pakistan and the Mekong delta. But its presence in breast milk in Bihar takes the problem to a new level.Despite the alarming results, the researchers strongly emphasised that breastfeeding should continue. It remains irreplaceable for immunity and early development, and should be discontinued only on medical advice. With uranium from contaminated groundwater being traced in the most essential nutrition an infant receives, the study calls for urgent biomonitoring, rigorous water-quality testing and immediate public-health intervention.Considering the threat it poses to the most vulnerable of humankind, the research is a call for action.","Uranium (U238) was detected in all samples, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 5.25 g/L.

Tejas Crash: IAF Pilot Killed In Dubai Crash Identified As Wing Commander Namansh Syal

NEW DELHI: India has sent an IAF officer to Dubai to take part in the inquiry to be conducted by the aviation authorities there into the Tejas fighter's crash Friday, with the ill-fated jet's flight data recorder (FDR) or ""black box"" expected to provide key information about the cause of the accident.The IAF officer will be ""a member in attendance"" at the inquiry, as per protocol, into the mishap that saw the single-engine Tejas Mark-1 jet crash into the ground after failing to recover from a ""negative G-turn"" manoeuvre during a low-level aerobatic display at the Dubai Airshow.The mortal remains of the pilot, Wing Commander Namansh Syal (37), were brought back to Sulur in Tamil Nadu on an IAF C-130J aircraft on Saturday night. ""A dedicated fighter pilot and thorough professional, Wing Commander Syal served the nation with unwavering commitment, exceptional skill and an unyielding sense of duty,"" IAF said.The IAF has not yet grounded its Tejas Mark-1 fighters in the '45 Flying Daggers' Squadron at Sulur and '18 Flying Bullets' Squadron at Naliya for safety technical checks. ""The FDR, which would have recorded all critical flight parameters of the Tejas, such as speed, altitude, control inputs and other such things, will be crucial for reconstructing the sequence of events leading to the accident,"" an officer said.While the exact reason for the crash will be determined by the inquiry, the pilot could have suffered a ""blackout"" or spatial disorientation due to ""negative G-forces"", or there could have been a sudden loss of engine power or control malfunction in the fighter, as was earlier reported by TOI.""Pilots can suffer G-LOC or gravity induced temporary loss of consciousness during sharp turns or dives in supersonic fighters. That is why fighter pilots wear pressurised G-suits to counter the effects of gravity,"" another officer said. The 13.5-tonne multirole Tejas, manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics and powered by American GE-F404 turbofan engine, has had a stellar flight safety record ever since its first prototype took to the skies in Jan 2001, even as IAF wants a fighter with much better capabilities.Since IAF raised its first Tejas Mark-1 squadron at Sulur in July 2016, the crash at Dubai was only the second after a jet went down near Jaisalmer on Mar 12 last year. While the IAF court of inquiry report into that crash has not been declassified, the cause is attributed to an engine snag. While IAF has inducted 38 Tejas Mark-1 jets, the deliveries of 83 ""improved"" Tejas Mark-1A fighters contracted in Feb 2021 for Rs 46,898 crore will begin only in March next year, after a long delay. A Rs 66,500 crore contract for another 97 Mark-1A jets was inked with HAL in Sept this year.","IAF officer will be ""a member in attendance"" at the inquiry, as per protocol.

NEW DELHI: An interim inquiry into the Federation Internationale du Sport Universitaire (FISU) World University Games 2025 fiasco has uncovered a disturbing pattern of corruption, nepotism, regional bias, moral misconduct and procedural lapses within Association of Indian Universities (AIU). The lapses - including unauthorised foreign travel, suspicious financial transactions, misuse of authority, biased selections and failures to register qualified athletes - not only embarrassed India internationally but also denied student-athletes crucial competitive opportunities.The four-member committee headed by Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya vice-chancellor Alok Kumar Chakrawal, in its interim report accessed by the TOI, found strong evidence of dereliction of duty and possible financial misconduct by suspended joint secretary (sports) Baljit Singh Sekhon.""There appear to be instances indicative of dereliction of duties, failure to discharge duties, breach of responsibility, nonfeasance, negligence, failure to act,"" the report noted. Multiple unexplained deposits were found in Sekhon's bank account in June 2025 - transactions ""potentially linked to his official capacity.""The committee also flagged conflicting statements regarding who funded his Germany trip.When contacted, Sekhon said since he is under suspension it would not be correct to make any comment. Another suspended official, Gaurav Rai, is accused of facilitating the inclusion of his PhD guide - a yoga expert - in the Indian contingent even though yoga was not part of the Games. He allegedly accepted travel sponsorship from KIIT University without approval, amounting to ""unauthorised financial benefit. "" The committee said ""repeated non-compliance with established protocols... may be construed as gross disobedience, blatant insubordination,"" recommending termination under AIU rules.The report also raised ethical concerns involving former joint secretary, AIU, Binu George Varghese, citing a complaint that he ""shared a twin-room accommodation with a female official"" during the 2023 Chengdu Games - behaviour termed ""a case of moral turpitude."" It further noted that ""officials from the South Zone were disproportionately appointed"" as basketball coaches and managers, indicating ""regional bias"" and ""neglect of national integration principles. "" Varghese didn't respond to calls and text message for his comments. According to AIU sources, the general council on Oct 24, 2025 decided to repatriate Varghese and terminate Rai.The inquiry followed nationwide outrage over India's mishandled participation at WUG 2025 in Germany, where several selected athletes were unable to compete due to administrative lapses.In badminton, six players were barred after only half the names were submitted. India's bronze-winning mixed team had just six of its 12 players on the podium. Athletes across sports called the fiasco ""career sabotage,"" prompting the Sports Authority of India to intervene.Operational failures included a Rs 1,000-per-match fine for jersey violations, no pre-booked practice courts and athletes borrowing shuttlecocks. AIU did not fund designated coaches, leaving players without support staff.While interim, the report warns of ""multiple areas of concern that merit deeper investigation,"" underscoring systemic failures that cost athletes their rightful place on the world stage.","Interim inquiry into FISU World University Games 2025 fiasco uncovers pattern of corruption, nepotism, regional bias, moral misconduct and procedural lapses.

NEW DELHI: India has just four palliative-care centres for every 10 million people, leaving millions battling cancer, chronic illnesses and terminal conditions without timely pain relief or support, according to a new study published in cancer journal ecancermedicalscience. It also showed that people often travel nearly two hours to reach the nearest palliative-care centre, and only 23.7% of the population can access such services within 30 minutes.The study - conducted by the Association for Socially Applicable Research in collaboration with NGO Pallium India - stated that compact territories like Delhi, Chandigarh and Goa fare better due to stronger infrastructure and shorter travel distances. But most large states remain severely underserved, far from the WHO's definition of qualitative palliative care.Lead author of the study, Dr Parth Sharma, said India can achieve near-universal palliative-care access without building new infrastructure. ""If effectively leveraged, the existing public health system can deliver palliative care. Training more healthcare providers would be enough to meet population needs,"" said Sharma.""The study highlights a critical gap in India's healthcare system,"" said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, internal medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals. He said palliative care ""is not an elective addition but the heart of humane, person-centred care"", and called for integrating services into primary health centres, scaling home-based models, expanding specialist training and ensuring district-level access to essential pain medicines.Dr Dinesh Singh, director of radiation oncology, Action Cancer Hospital, Delhi, said the findings expose ""an urgent and deeply concerning gap"", with patients' pain, dignity and quality of life compromised when palliative care is out of reach. He urged expansion of centres, integration of palliative services in all hospitals and strengthening of home-care models.Kerala is the standout model. With only 2.5% of India's population, it hosts 44.5% of all palliative-care centres, giving 94.6% of its people access within 30 minutes.In contrast, Uttar Pradesh has just 12 centres for 17% of India's population, with a median travel time of 111 minutes. In the North-east, mountainous terrain means long travel times even where centres exist.Rural-urban gaps are equally stark, with rural travel times ranging from nine minutes to 591 minutes, underscoring deep inequity. As India's burden of cancer and chronic illness rises, the study warned that geography still decides whether a patient receives comfort - or suffers without care.","People often travel nearly two hours to reach the nearest palliative-care centre.

PM Modi Predicts Major Congress Split After NDA’s Bihar Win And Warns Allies Of Growing Instability

Also read:

NEW DELHI: A group of 272 eminent citizens, including 16 judges, 123 retired bureaucrats, 14 former ambassadors and 133 retired armed forces officers, issued an open letter accusing leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and the Congress of trying to erode public faith in the Election Commission and other constitutional institutions.The letter, titled ""Assault on National Constitutional Authorities,"" alleged that opposition leaders were attempting to manufacture a sense of institutional breakdown through what it described as “venomous rhetoric” and “provocative but unsubstantiated accusations.”The letter said: “Some political leaders, instead of offering genuine policy alternative, resort to provocative but unsubstantiated accusations in their theatrical political strategy. After their attempts to tarnish the Indian Armed Forces by questioning their valour and accomplishments, and the Judiciary by questioning its fairness, Parliament, and its constitutional functionaries, now it is the turn of Election Commission of India to face systematic and conspiratorial attacks on its integrity and reputation.”The signatories singled out Rahul Gandhi for repeatedly alleging vote theft while, they said, failing to file a formal complaint or sworn affidavit to back his claims. They pointed to his assertions that he had “100 per cent proof” and an “atom bomb” against the Commission, alongside accusations of “treason,” and argued that such remarks came “without the prescribed sworn affidavit” required for accountability.The letter also noted that similar accusations had been amplified by Congress leaders, opposition parties and allied NGOs, including claims that the Election Commission had acted like the “B-team of the BJP.” It argued these assertions collapsed under scrutiny, pointing to the ECI’s public release of its methodology and verification done under court oversight.It said, “Moreover, several senior figures of Congress and other political parties, leftist NGOs, ideologically opinionated scholars, and a few attention seekers in other walks of life, have joined in with similarly blistering rhetoric against SIR, even declaring that the Commission has descended into complete shamelessness by acting like the ‘B-team of the BJP.’ Such fiery rhetoric may be emotionally powerful but it collapses under scrutiny, because the ECI has publicly shared its SIR methodology, overseen verification by court-sanctioned means, removed ineligible names in a compliant manner, and added new eligible voters. ”The signatories described this pattern of criticism as “impotent rage,” stating that leaders who faced electoral setbacks “lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility.”The letter said, “This pattern of behaviour reflects what might be called ‘impotent rage’ deep anger born of repeated electoral failure and frustration, without a concrete plan to reconnect with the people. When political leaders lose touch with the aspirations of ordinary citizens, they lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility. Theatrics replace analysis. Public spectacle takes the place of public service. ”Invoking the legacy of former chief election commissioners TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, the letter said, “Today, thinking of ECI, the country also remembers the likes of TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, whose unyielding leadership transformed the Election Commission into a formidable constitutional sentinel. They did not court popularity. They did not chase headlines. They enforced the rules fearlessly, impartially, relentlessly. ”Calling for transparency, legal accountability and respectful political conduct, the letter concluded by saying, “We call upon the Election Commission to continue its path of transparency and rigour. Publish complete data, defend itself through legal channels when necessary, and reject politics dressed up as victimhood. We call upon political leaders to respect the constitutional process, to compete not through baseless accusation but through policy articulation, and to accept democratic verdicts with grace. ”"," 272 eminent citizens, including 16 judges, 123 retired bureaucrats, 14 former ambassadors and 133 retired armed forces officers, issued an open letter.

Big workforce reform! Four Labour Codes made effective to simplify and streamline labour laws,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/big-workforce-reform-four-labour-codes-made-effective-to-simplify-and-streamline-labour-laws-check-top-details/articleshow/125483660.cms,"AI image

Here are top 10 highlights from new labour Codes

1. Fixed-term staff get permanent-level benefits

2. Gig and platform workers formally recognised

3. Wider social security net across industries

4. Minimum wage and timely payment for all workers

5. Women allowed in all shifts and job roles

6. Mandatory health checks and safety norms

7. Stronger protections for contract, migrant and unorganised workers

8. Improved working-hour rules and overtime protection

9. Digital and media workers formally covered

10. Universal appointment letters and formalisation push

In a major policy shift, the government on Friday announced the implementation of four consolidated labour codes--Code on Wages (2019), Industrial Relations Code (2020), Code on Social Security (2020) and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code (2020)--with effect from November 21, 2025.The move rationalises 29 existing labour laws and aims to modernise regulations, strengthen worker protections and align India’s labour framework with evolving employment structures.According to a statement by the government, the new codes seek to build a future-ready labour ecosystem that promotes formalisation, ensures timely wages, expands social security, and reduces compliance burden for enterprises. The implementation also aims to support Aatmanirbhar Bharat by building resilient industries and improving workforce productivity.The government said the reforms replace fragmented labour provisions dating back to the pre-independence era, addressing long-pending demands for simplicity and uniformity in labour laws. The new framework aims to equip industries for global competitiveness while expanding worker coverage across sectors.Under the new regime, formal employment will be strengthened through mandatory appointment letters, universal minimum wages across sectors, compulsory timely wage payments, and free annual health check-ups for workers above 40 years. Social security benefits will be extended pan-India, including to gig workers, platform workers, and employees in hazardous industries, with Aadhaar-linked portability.Women workers will be permitted to work night shifts across all establishments subject to consent and mandated safety measures, while anti-discrimination provisions and expanded family definitions have been introduced to improve inclusivity. The codes also guarantee equal pay, time-bound grievance redressal, and mandatory representation of women in committees.Fixed-term employees will receive benefits equal to permanent workers, including social security, medical cover and paid leave, with gratuity eligibility after one year instead of five. The move aims to reduce over-dependence on contract labour and encourage direct hiring.For the first time, gig and platform labour is legally defined. Aggregators must contribute 1–2% of turnover (capped at 5% of payouts) towards welfare, with Aadhaar-linked portable benefits accessible across states.Coverage under the Social Security Code extends nationwide, including for MSME employees, hazardous establishments with even one worker, platform workers and sectors previously outside mandatory ESI norms.All workers, regardless of sector, will receive a statutory minimum wage aligned to a national floor rate, along with mandatory timely wage payment and no unauthorised deductions.Women can work night shifts and in all categories—mining, heavy machinery and hazardous sites—subject to consent and safety measures. Equal pay is mandated and representation in grievance panels is compulsory.Annual free health check-ups are required for workers above specified thresholds across hazardous industries, plantations, contract labour and mines, alongside national OSH standards and safety committees in large establishments.Contract and migrant workers will receive equal wages, welfare schemes and portability benefits. Principal employers must ensure social security for contract staff and provide basic amenities such as water, rest areas and sanitation.Working hours in most sectors are capped at 8–12 per day and 48 per week, with double wages for overtime and mandatory written consent where required. Leaves accrue after 180 working days annually in sectors like exports.Journalists, freelancers, dubbing artists and media professionals now fall under the labour protection framework, ensuring appointment letters, wage security and regulated working hours.Employers must issue appointment letters to all workers, improving traceable employment history, wage transparency and access to benefits to accelerate formalisation across sectors including IT, dock work and textile units.Labour protections extend to fixed-term employees, who will receive wages and benefits at par with permanent workers, including gratuity eligibility after one year. Contract workers, migrant workers, plantation workers, dock workers and employees in hazardous sectors will receive mandatory health benefits, workplace safety standards, accident coverage and double wages for overtime.The reforms also introduce a single registration and single licence framework across India, replacing multiple filings. An inspector-cum-facilitator system will support compliance through advisory mechanisms rather than punitive oversight. The codes further provide for national safety standards, mandatory safety committees in units with 500+ workers and streamlined dispute resolution via two-member industrial tribunals.The statement noted that India’s social security coverage has risen from 19% of the workforce in 2015 to over 64% in 2025, and the new codes expand portability and accessibility of benefits across states and sectors. Existing laws and rules will remain in force during the transition until all subordinate regulations under the new regime are notified.By enhancing protections for women, youth, unorganised workers and gig economy participants while reducing compliance complexity, the new labour codes aim to boost employment, skilling and industrial growth, the government said.Lokesh Gulati, Partner, Regulatory & Business Solutions PwC India, said ""India’s labour codes unify 29 laws into four codes, modernizing India’s labour framework. They simplify compliance, reduce regulatory friction, and promote formalisation—key for attracting investment and scaling operations. Major changes include guaranteed universal minimum wages, mandatory appointment letters, timely wage payments, free health check-ups for workers over 40, and expanded social security covering gig, platform, fixed term, and migrant workers. """"Women can work night shifts with safety measures. The codes introduce single registration and licensing, faster dispute resolution, and enhanced workplace safety. Old laws remain during rule finalization. These reforms align with ESG goals, strengthening India’s competitive, responsible economy,"" He added.","The government on Friday announced the implementation of four consolidated labour codes.

New Delhi: Dr Umar un Nabi, the suicide bomber behind the Nov 10 Delhi car blast, had met a Syrian terror operative in Turkiye in 2022 along with co-accused Dr Muzammil Shakeel Ganai and Dr Muzzafar Rather, supposedly on the directions of their Pakistani handler Ukasha, sources connected with the investigation told TOI on Thursday.The agencies are trying to dig deeper into what transpired during the meeting. Muzammil, who was arrested by NIA Thursday with three other accused - Dr Adeel Ahmed Rather, Dr Shaheen Saeed and Mufti Irfan Ahmad Wagay - is expected to be interrogated by NIA to take forward the probe into international linkages of the conspiracy.Intelligence sources told TOI the three doctors - Umar, Muzammil and Muzzafar (Adeel Rather's brother) - had stayed in Turkiye for around 20 days. Though they had travelled there to see Ukasha, who is said to be based along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, the meeting never happened, as per the accused. Instead, Ukasha directed them to meet the Syrian national.Muzaffar went on to travel via UAE to Afghanistan and is said to have joined al-Qaida.Sources said Umar was also keen to travel to Afghanistan from Turkiye but was told by Ukasha to return to India to execute Jaish's ""bigger"" terror plans there.He followed the direction, and it was only after his return that he joined Al Falah University and gave shape to the terror module that had been amassing explosives for future attacks when it was busted.""Muzammil, Adeel and Umer were constantly in touch with three Pakistan-based handlers Faisal, Hashim and Ukasha via Telegram, who would give them instructions, radicalisation material and bomb making videos,"" an officer told TOI.NIA said on Thursday that the three doctors and Shopian cleric Mufti Irfan arrested by it had played a key role in the Delhi terror attack and were also conspiring to carry out similar pan-India strikes.Earlier, NIA had arrested Amir Rashid Ali, a plumber from Pampore, and Jasir Bilal Wani who hails from Qazigund.

What is Talaak-e-Hasan





Why Talaak-e-Hasan is challenged now





What happened in the 2017 case





How is teen talaq different from Talaak-e-Hasan





Where the debate stands now





NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court, while hearing a petition challenging the unilateral use of Talaq-e-Hasan, on Wednesday questioned the validity of a growing practice in which Muslim men authorise lawyers to issue monthly talaq notices on their behalf. Examining the case of journalist Benazeer Heena, the bench observed that such notices, issued without the husband’s signature, could not be treated as a valid dissolution of marriage. The Court warned that delegating talaq to lawyers or third parties exposes women to serious legal vulnerabilities, including the possibility of being accused of polyandry if they enter another marriage under the mistaken belief that the first marriage has been legally dissolved. The matter, already before the apex court through multiple petitions, has now brought renewed attention to the constitutional and procedural validity of Talaak-e-Hasan.The bench of Chief Justice-designate Surya Kant, along with Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and N K Singh, expressed strong reservations about this emerging practice, reiterating that talaq requires the husband’s direct pronouncement and signature.When senior advocate M R Shamshad, appearing for the husband, argued that such delegation was a customary practice within the community, the bench firmly rejected the claim. Justice Kant asked, “How can this be a valid practice? The notices for talaq and talaqnama must have the signature of the husband. How can a third party give the woman notice on behalf of her husband?” The bench further noted that clients often disown their lawyers’ actions, leaving women legally stranded. “Is this legal? How are such innovations made to give talaq? How is the community promoting such practices? We will not permit such processes to harm the dignity of the Muslim women,” the Court said.Also read - 3 talaqs sent through lawyer not valid: Supreme Court Benazeer, who was present in court, narrated how she had been abandoned by her husband after paying a total alimony of Rs 17,000 and forced to run from “pillar to post”. The Court directed her to file an application specifying the welfare needs of her child, assuring, “We will do the needful.” The bench also praised her courage, stating, “We salute her for gathering courage to move the court challenging the unilateral Talaq-e-Hasan process of divorce. Think of the condition of millions of Muslim women, illiterate and living in rural areas. What would be their plight?”The Court’s remarks indicated that the issue extends beyond individual grievances and affects thousands of Muslim women who may lack awareness, access or legal protection. The bench said it would examine the validity of Talaak-e-Hasan after detailed arguments, a move that has set the stage for a significant judicial review of practices that have long existed within Muslim personal law.Talaak-e-Hasan (TEH) is one of the classical Islamic methods of divorce recognised under Sunni Muslim personal law. Unlike instant triple talaq , which the Supreme Court struck down in 2017, TEH is a staggered process carried out over three months. The husband pronounces “talaq” once every month, typically during a period when the wife is not menstruating, and each pronouncement is intended to be separated by at least one complete menstrual cycle or lunar month. This timing is not arbitrary; it is grounded in Islamic jurisprudence, which emphasises reflection, restraint and opportunities for reconciliation between the spouses.The first pronouncement initiates the process, but the divorce does not become final. During the month that follows, the couple is expected to attempt reconciliation. If they resume cohabitation in any form before the second pronouncement, or if the husband changes his mind, the declaration becomes void. The second pronouncement follows the same pattern. Only if the third pronouncement is made in the third consecutive month, without any resumption of marital relations, does the divorce become final and irrevocable. This structure is closely tied to the Islamic concept of iddat, a mandatory waiting period observed by the wife after divorce or widowhood. The iddat serves several theological and practical functions, including providing time for reflection and clarifying pregnancy status.Within Islamic jurisprudence, TEH is seen as a measured and reversible form of divorce, distinct from the abruptness of instant triple talaq. Nevertheless, critics argue that despite its structured nature, TEH remains a unilateral and extra-judicial mechanism controlled solely by the husband. While Muslim women do have options such as khula—a wife-initiated divorce that requires returning the mehar—or mubarat, where both parties mutually agree to end the marriage, these processes can be inhibited by social pressure, family influence and lack of legal support. As a result, women often remain at a disadvantage when navigating marital dissolution within personal law.The challenge to TEH arises not merely from its theological structure but from how it is being applied today. The Supreme Court’s current examination stems from allegations that husbands are misusing the process by issuing talaq notices through lawyers instead of personally pronouncing the divorce. In the case of Benazeer Heena, her husband allegedly sent three talaq notices through his lawyer, completed a divorce and remarried another woman. Her counsel, senior advocate Rizwan Ahmed, told the Court that “when a talaqnama does not bear the husband’s signature, it is not a valid divorce document.” He cautioned that if a woman remarries under the belief that she is divorced, only to later learn that her husband denies having signed or authorised the talaq, she could be accused of polyandry. He further noted that potential suitors may refuse to marry her out of fear that the earlier divorce may not be legally valid.The bench reacted strongly to this argument. It rejected the claim that delegation of talaq is a widespread or acceptable practice. The judges observed that the integrity of the process collapses when a third party issues notices, especially when the husband can later deny authorising them. They expressed astonishment at the idea that a husband would ask someone else to divorce his wife, asking pointedly, “How can a third party give the woman notice on behalf of her husband?” The bench insisted that talaq must be executed strictly in accordance with religious law and not through intermediaries.The misuse of TEH is not limited to this case. Another petitioner, Nazri Nisha, appeared in person to narrate her difficulties, saying her husband attempted to divorce her through an irregular method. She explained that the lack of a valid divorce document had made it nearly impossible to access essential services such as school admissions and passports for her child. The Supreme Court asked her to file an application so that directions could be issued to protect her rights, emphasising that husbands cannot “enjoy their own life while destroying their wife’s. ”These cases have added to a broader argument that TEH, even when executed in good faith, gives unilateral and disproportionate power to husbands. The petitions challenge this imbalance, arguing that TEH remains discriminatory and violates Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. They contend that the practice lacks judicial oversight and allows men to dissolve marriages without ensuring financial security, due process or legal validation. The Court’s willingness to examine these claims signals its recognition of the deeper systemic issues at play.The current debate cannot be understood without reference to the Supreme Court’s landmark 2017 judgment in the Shayara Bano case, which struck down instant triple talaq (Talaq-e-biddat) as unconstitutional. The case began when Shayara Bano challenged the talaqnama her husband sent to her in 2015, arguing that triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy violated her fundamental rights. Her petition triggered a nationwide debate on Muslim women’s rights and the nature of personal law.Many women joined the litigation, including Ishrat Jahan, whose husband divorced her over a phone call from Dubai; Gulshan Parween, who received her talaq on a stamp paper; Aafreen Rehman from Jaipur; and Atiya Sabri from Saharanpur. The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) also filed a petition, arguing that triple talaq lacked Quranic sanction and violated women’s rights to equality, non-discrimination and dignity.The practice was defended by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and organisations like the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind. They contended that Muslim personal laws are protected under Article 25 and constitute essential religious practices. They argued that although triple talaq was “bad in theology”, it was “good in law” and valid under the Hanafi school of jurisprudence. They urged the Court to leave any reform to Parliament instead of judicial intervention.In a historic 3:2 verdict, the Supreme Court struck down instant triple talaq as arbitrary and unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that the practice violated Article 14 by granting husbands unilateral power without any possibility of reconciliation. The verdict was followed by the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, which criminalised the pronouncement of instant triple talaq.Significantly, however, the 2017 ruling did not address Talaak-e-Hasan or Talaak-e-Ahsan. These practices were considered more acceptable because they provided time for reflection and potential reconciliation. This omission left unanswered questions that have now resurfaced through petitions filed by women who argue that unilateral talaq—whether instant or staggered—remains discriminatory in practice.Teen talaq, or Talaq-e-biddat, is fundamentally different from Talaak-e-Hasan both in process and principle. Teen talaq involves the husband pronouncing “talaq” three times in one sitting, leading to the immediate termination of marriage. It does not require a waiting period, the wife’s presence or acknowledgement, or any attempt at reconciliation. Historically, the practice became infamous for being delivered through letters, phone calls, text messages and even social media. This instant, irrevocable nature was the chief reason it was struck down as unconstitutional.Talaak-e-Hasan, by contrast, is a three-step process over three months. Each pronouncement is separated by a significant interval, creating space for reflection and reconciliation. The first and second pronouncements are revocable, meaning the marriage continues if the couple resumes cohabitation. Only after the third pronouncement does the divorce become final. Scholars argue that TEH aligns with Quranic principles, which discourage hasty dissolution of marriage and emphasise attempts to reconcile.Also read - Explained: Why did SC say 'Talaq-e-Hasan' is different from triple talaq The Supreme Court itself has recognised this distinction. In a 2022 hearing on a related petition, the Court observed, “This is not triple talaq. You (women) also have option of Khula.” The Court noted that women have alternative routes such as khula, separation by mutual consent through mubarat and judicial remedies, whereas teen talaq offered no such opportunities for women.Yet, critics point out that despite these theoretical safeguards, TEH remains unilateral and extra-judicial. They argue that waiting periods or reconciliation windows do not compensate for the fact that the husband alone controls the process. The petitions before the Court contend that even staggered unilateral divorce violates the principles of equality and dignity enshrined in the Constitution.The Supreme Court’s latest observations do not equate TEH with instant triple talaq. The bench made it clear that TEH is not “so improper” as to be immediately struck down. However, the judges also signalled that procedural misuse, especially through delegated notices, cannot be tolerated. They emphasised that any valid divorce must comply strictly with Sharia procedures and must not compromise the dignity and security of women.The Court will now examine TEH in detail on 26 November, when it hears a batch of petitions challenging unilateral talaq practices. The issues before the Court include whether TEH is constitutionally valid, whether unilateral extra-judicial divorce violates women’s fundamental rights, and whether Parliament or the judiciary should reform personal laws that affect millions of Indian Muslim families.Whatever the eventual decision, the case marks an important moment in India’s evolving dialogue on personal laws, gender justice and constitutional morality. The Court’s findings will likely shape the future of marital rights for Muslim women and further clarify the balance between religious freedom and the right to equality.","Supreme Court questions validity of a growing practice in which Muslim men authorise lawyers to issue monthly talaq notices on their behalf.

NEW DELHI: Amid the rumblings triggered by the opposition's comprehensive defeat in Bihar, Congress said it was committed to INDIA bloc and would double efforts to strengthen the national alliance.AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said the INDIA bloc was put together as an arrangement at the national level for like-minded parties to coordinate their efforts to counter BJP's regressive politics. ""Nothing has changed since it was formed. Congress is committed to INDIA and will make further efforts to boost its efficacy,"" he told TOI. The Congress manager also said the opposition would continue with its coordination in Parliament when the winter session gets under way on Dec 1.Doubts about the fate of the opposition alliance have surfaced on social media after the decimation suffered by the RJD-Congress combine in the recent Bihar elections , where it was roundly defeated by the JDU-BJP coalition. Some Congress netas too have advocated that in future, the party should move independently in Bihar by junking ally RJD. Some of the questions have also been stoked by the likelihood of Congress contesting the upcoming Bombay Municipal Corporation elections separate from NCP and Shiv Sena (UBT), which are its allies in Maha Vikas Aghadi.Venugopal, however, rubbished the speculations.Many Congress netas said the alliance was intrinsic to the politics of the party, as it would soon be fighting in Tamil Nadu as DMK's junior partner, and would go into the future Assam polls as part of a coalition that is already being stitched.Venugopal said municipal and panchayat elections were local contests, where decisions on alliances were made by local units based on political ground realities, like in BMC. ""But even there, the idea would be to defeat BJP,"" he said. The Kerala MP, who is a confidant of Rahul Gandhi, said while nothing had changed since the national alliance was formed, members were aware there would be differences in a few states, like West Bengal and Kerala. ""We will still fight separately in the two states. But the larger alliance will remain intact,"" he said.","Doubts about the fate of the opposition alliance have surfaced on social media after the decimation suffered by the RJD-Congress combine in the recent Bihar elections.

Public Provident Fund or PPF is one of the most popular investment options available - and one that can make you a crorepati with disciplined investing. In fact if you were to start a PPF account by the age of 21, you can easily become a crorepati by the age of 46 - way ahead of the conventional retirement age.PPF is a government-backed investment which currently offers an interest rate of 7.1% making it a suitable option for not only risk-averse investors, but also those who are looking at fixed income instruments.Who can open a PPF account and what is the maximum investment limit? Are there any tax benefits of PPF and how long is the lock-in period? Importantly, is PPF the right investment option for you to become a crorepati? How do other investment alternatives compare? Here is a detailed explainer:Any resident Indian can open one PPF account in their own name. Additionally, an individual can open one PPF account on behalf of a minor child or a person with mental illness or intellectual disability, provided they serve as the guardian.However, PPF does not allow for joint accounts. Each minor or dependent is allowed only one account and that too through a guardian.PPF accounts can be opened at post offices, designated banks, and e-banking services.Deposits can be made in one lump sum or in multiple installments.The overall limit of Rs 1.5 lakh includes contributions made to your own account as well as any accounts you operate for minors.PPF is a EEE product - making it a preferred option for tax saving investments. EEE products or Exempt, Exempt, Exempt are those instruments where the principal investment, interest, and maturity amount are all tax-free.All PPF contributions qualify for tax deduction under Section 80C. This means that individuals opting for the old income tax regime can avail a deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh for their PPF investment. While Section 80C benefits are not available under the new income tax regime, the interest earned and the final maturity amount continue to be tax-free.Interest rate on PPF is reviewed quarterly by the Ministry of Finance. For your PPF account, the interest calculation is done monthly on the lowest balance between the 5th and the last day of the month. This interest is credited annually, typically at the end of the financial year.This means that to accrue the maximum benefit of the full Rs 1.5 lakh investment limit for a year, investors should look at a lump sum deposit between April 1-5 of a financial year.You can opt for premature withdrawal after five years from the end of the year in which the account was opened. Account holders may withdraw up to 50% of the balance—calculated based on either the fourth year preceding the withdrawal year or the previous year, whichever is lower.Any outstanding loan must be fully repaid before a withdrawal can be made, and discontinued accounts are not eligible for this facility. You can take a loan against your PPF balance between the 3rd and 6th financial year, up to 25% of the balance from two years prior. The loan must be repaid within 36 months, after which only 1% interest per year is charged — but delays push this to 6%. Only one loan can be taken in a year, and no new loan is allowed until the previous one is fully repaid.Premature closure of a PPF account is permitted only under specific circumstances: life-threatening illness of the account holder or immediate family, higher education needs of the account holder or dependent children, or a change in residency status to NRI.In such cases, the account earns interest at a rate 1% lower than originally credited over time. In the event of the account holder’s death, the PPF account must be closed; the nominee or legal heir cannot continue it, although interest is payable until the end of the month preceding the final payout.A PPF account matures 15 years after the end of the financial year in which it was opened. At maturity, you have three options:You may withdraw the entire balance and close the account.You may choose to let the account remain active without additional deposits. The balance continues to earn interest, and you may make one withdrawal per year. However, once you opt for continuation without deposits, you cannot revert to deposit-based continuation later.You may continue the account with deposits for additional 5-year blocks, provided the request is submitted within one year of maturity. It is this provision that allows you to become a crorepati - as explained in the section belowThe provision to extend your PPF account beyond the lock-in period of 15 years allows you to earn the benefits of compounding. The biggest advantage of a PPF investment is compounding. Your money grows - not just on the amount you invest each year - but also on the interest that you accumulate over time, creating a powerful snowball effect.Since PPF has a long 15-year lock-in, the interest added annually continues to earn more interest in the following years, leading to exponential growth—especially in the later years of the account.Even though the yearly contribution limit is capped, compounding ensures that disciplined, consistent deposits can grow into a significantly larger corpus by maturity. This makes PPF one of the most effective long-term wealth-building tools for risk-free, tax-free returns.Let’s understand this better over different investment time-frames. In a scenario where you invest the full Rs 1.5 lakh investment limit every year, you will accumulate a corpus of over Rs 40 lakh in 15 years, of which you would have invested Rs 22.5 lakh. But, if you continue to contribute to your PPF account in blocks of 5 years - then with 25 years of investment your accumulated corpus would be over Rs 1 crore, with an investment of only Rs 37.5 lakh! The interest accrued as a result of compounding would be over Rs 65 lakh!The answer depends entirely on your investment time-frame, risk taking ability and investment purpose. Experts say that PPF is ideal for conservative investors - backed by the government of India - and offering 7.1% returns with the benefits of compounding, it works well for risk averse individuals, long-term wealth builders and those who are looking to save tax.Apart from the above-mentioned category of investors, Mohit Gang - Co-Founder & CEO Moneyfront says PPF is ideal for investors looking for stable debt allocation, and those without EPF/NPS.According to Prableen Bajpai, Founder, Finfix Research & Analytics, in India, fixed income continues to dominate investor portfolios. “These asset classes provide a sense of security and comfort, but while they are popular, they often fail to reward investors over the long term. For example, bank fixed deposits do not offer true compounding, are rarely able to beat inflation, and are not tax-efficient—especially for high-income individuals,” she tells TOI.However, Prableen is of the view that government-backed schemes such as the PPF stand out due to their specific benefits. “Within the fixed-income category, PPF remains one of the best vehicles for building a long-term portfolio, particularly when the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) is not available as an investment option,” she says.Mohit Gang says that PPF’s nominal return (historically ~7–9%) beats inflation, but only by a small margin. To put it simply, the long-term average rate of return for PPF is around 8%, while the average inflation is around 6%, which makes the real return around 2%, he says.•⁠ ⁠You want equity exposure + tax efficiency•⁠ ⁠You want 80CCD(1B) extra ₹50,000 tax benefit•⁠ ⁠Investment horizon is very long (till age 60)•⁠ ⁠Partial withdrawal restrictions•⁠ ⁠Taxable annuity at retirement•⁠ ⁠No guaranteed return•⁠ ⁠EPF rate (usually ~8.1–8.25%) > PPF•⁠ ⁠Mandatory contributions form the base; voluntary VPF can top-up•⁠ ⁠Salary-based compounding is larger for high earners•⁠ ⁠Only available for salaried employees•⁠ ⁠Interest rate is revised annually and can reduce•⁠ ⁠Withdrawals are restricted unless conditions met•⁠ ⁠Liquidity•⁠ ⁠Potentially higher returns depending on category•⁠ ⁠No lock-in•⁠ ⁠Gains are fully taxable at slab rate (no indexation) after April 2023 amendments•⁠ ⁠No guarantee of returns•⁠ ⁠Credit & duration risk possible•⁠ ⁠For >30% tax slab investors, post-tax returns become unattractive•⁠ ⁠Highest guaranteed small-savings rate (8.2% currently)•⁠ ⁠Similar EEE tax advantages•⁠ ⁠Use-case limited•⁠ ⁠Long lock-inPrableen believes that any long-term portfolio should ideally include a mix of debt and equity, and PPF can serve as an effective fixed-income component. “But if a higher-interest, employer-linked EPF is available, then PPF can be replaced with other higher return–generating fixed-income alternatives,” she adds.",PPF is a government-backed investment which currently offers an interest rate of 7.1%.

Understanding the 'Rewards System'

Unlike some previous full-time government positions, jobs under the Rewards System do not require full-time commitment.

This flexibility is a huge advantage for applicants, as it allows appointees the vital opportunity to combine two jobs—they can hold a primary job while also serving their community in a mosque.

Application Process: Qualified citizens are encouraged to apply directly through the Ministry’s branches located in the various regions of the Kingdom.

Who can apply?

The applicant must be a Saudi citizen.

The applicant must be at least 18 years old.

Applicants must have a record of good conduct and behavior. They must not have been previously sentenced or imprisoned for any public or dishonorable crime.

The applicant must be physically and mentally capable of performing the required duties.





Qualifications for Imams

Quran Proficiency: Must be a proficient reader (Qari’) of the Holy Qur’an. For higher-tier mosques, this includes being a Mujawwid (reciting with proper Tajweed) and memorizing a substantial portion of the Book (e.g., a third of the Qur'an).

Basic Islamic Knowledge: Must have sufficient knowledge of Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh), especially the rulings related to worship (Ibadah), such as prayer.

Where to apply?

Method of Application: Candidates are urged to apply in person.

Location: Applicants must visit the nearest branch offices (Furoo’) of the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawah, and Guidance in the various regions across the Kingdom.





Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawah, and Guidance has launched a massive employment drive, announcing 31,000 new job openings for citizens across the Kingdom. This unprecedented initiative is aimed at bolstering the service standards in mosques nationwide, offering a flexible route into employment for thousands of qualified Saudis. The roles are specifically for Imams (prayer leaders) and Muezzins (those who call to prayer).The announcement was made by the Minister of Islamic Affairs, Sheikh Dr. Abdullatif bin Abdulaziz Al-Sheikh. This latest recruitment phase is considered a historic achievement, forming part of the ministry’s largest employment drive ever undertaken.The current phase introduces 31,000 positions specifically for mosque personnel. The openings target citizens qualified to serve as Imams and Muezzins.When combined with 60,000 previous appointments finalized over four years, this brings the total number of jobs provided by the Ministry under the National Employment Initiative to a massive 91,000.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Record earnings









Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed the growing concerns about an AI bubble. In recent months, investors and analysts have raised alarms about a potential AI bubble, warning that soaring spending by cloud providers and tech giants may prove unsustainable. Concerns have centered on whether the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure could mirror past boom-and-bust cycles in technology. Huang feels that the industry is presently undergoing some structural transformations and that it will sustain growth for the years to come. Speaking at the company’s earnings call, Huang said, “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.” The remarks made by Huang in AI bubble were quite expected as his company is presently at the centre of the artificial intelligence boom. Almost all the major cloud service provider such as Google, Amazon, Oracle are Nvidia’s customers.During the earnings call, Huang also laid down three major transitions which are fueling the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs.- From CPUs to GPUs - Firstly, Huang talked about the slow down of Moore’s law.He said that traditional computing is built around central processors and it is reaching its limit. Industries ranging from data processing to search and ad recommendations are shifting toward GPU-powered systems, which are uniquely suited to handle the massive computational demands of AI.- AI as a creator of new applications - Secondly Huang feels that AI is not just improving the existing tools but it is now unlocking completely new categories of applications. From generative models reshaping search and recommendations to advanced engineering solutions, AI is becoming the foundation for innovations that didn’t exist before.- Rise of Agentic and Physical AI - Lastly, Huang pointed out that the next-generation AI systems are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting and require minimal human intervention. These “agentic” and “physical” AI applications, such as coding assistants and robotics, will require unprecedented levels of computing power, further driving demand for Nvidia’s architecture.Huang believes that Nvidia’s singular architecture supports all three transitions across every industry and modality of AI, making the company uniquely positioned to power this next wave of infrastructure growth.Nvidia reported a record quarter with $57 billion revenue which is up by 62% year-over-year, and forecasted $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The shares of the company rose by 5% in after-hours trading. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress reinforced the bullish outlook, noting, “The clouds are sold out. Our GPU installed base is fully utilized.”","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed the growing concerns about an AI bubble.

"Verizon layoffs: America’s largest telecom company to cut 13,000 jobs, what CEO Dan Schulman said in internal memo",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/verizon-layoffs-americas-largest-telecom-company-to-cut-13000-jobs-what-ceo-dan-schulman-said-in-internal-memo/articleshow/125465746.cms,"Verizon layoffs 2025

How this compares to Verizon's previous layoffs









: Verizon has announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history, a report has said, adding that the job cuts come as the country’s largest wireless carrier struggles with competitive pressures and a shrinking customer base. CEO Dan Schulman, who took the helm in October after serving on Verizon’s board since 2018, cited the need to streamline operations and reduce costs that are limiting the company's ability to invest in customer value.“Our current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,"" Schulman wrote in an internal memo obtained by news agency Reuters. “We must simplify our operations to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers”.The telecom giant plans to significantly reduce not only its direct workforce but also outsourced and external labour expenses, the report noted. Additionally, Verizon will convert 179 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations and close one location.Meanwhile, a company spokesperson told CNBC that the job cuts are “an opportunity for Verizon to reset, restructure and realign our priorities on ways that will help us regain our leadership as a communications provider.”This represents Verizon's largest-ever single job cut. The company had approximately 1,00,000 US employees at the end of 2024, including around 70,000 non-union workers. Over the previous three years, Verizon had already eliminated nearly 20,000 positions, making the current reduction particularly dramatic.Verizon is establishing a $20 million career transition fund specifically for laid-off workers, focusing on “opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI.” The company emphasised that the job cuts were not driven by AI implementation.Reports say that Verizon is facing competition from established rivals offering cheaper plans and cable operators entering the wireless market. The company added just 44,000 monthly bill-paying wireless subscribers in the third quarter, significantly trailing AT&T and far behind T-Mobile, which led the industry with over 1 million net subscriber additions.Schulman inherited substantial challenges from his predecessor at PayPal, arriving amid aggressive promotions from AT&T and T-Mobile surrounding new iPhone launches. Despite massive investments—including $52 billion for 5G spectrum in 2021, a $20 billion Frontier Communications acquisition, and $6 billion for TracFone Wireless—Verizon continues to lose ground in the competitive landscape.","Verizon announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history.

Moody's warns that many US States showing recession signs





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy. Bezos has urged the consumers and businesses to postpone their large purchases as the fear of recession is mounting. Speaking to CNN’s Chole Melas in an interview, Bezos has cautioned that the coming months could bring prolonged downturn. Bezos has recommend that households should consider putting a hold on purchasing big-ticket products such as cars, televisions and appliances. He urge the consumers to save that money as it will make a lot of difference if the economic worsens. Along with this, Bezos has also advised the small businesses to avoid large capital expenditures or acquisitions during this uncertain period.“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”Despite his cautionary advice, Bezos struck an optimistic tone about the long-term future, saying he believes the American Dream remains attainable. He even projected that within his lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public. Last month, Bezos tweeted a warning to “batten down the hatches,” advice he reiterated in his CNN interview as relevant to both consumers and business owners.Ironically, if the consumers follow Bezos’ advice, then it could mean lower sales for Amazon. Recently, Amazon announced its plans to layoff 14,000 employees. In October, Amazon projected holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street expectations, citing inflation and shifting consumer behavior. Americans are spending more on travel and dining out and less on discretionary goods.Recently, Mark Zandi, chief economist at credit rating agency Moody' warned about recession in the US. A new analysis of state-level data suggests that the US economy is ""on the edge of recession,"" said Mark Zandi of Moody's. ""Based on my assessment of various data, states making up nearly a third of US GDP are either in or at high risk of recession, another third are just holding steady, and the remaining third are growing,"" Zandi wrote on social media.The data reveals a mixed picture across the country. States in the South are generally the strongest, though their growth is beginning to slow. Meanwhile, some of the nation's largest economies, like California and New York, are described as ""holding their own,"" and their stability is seen as critical to preventing a full-blown national recession.However, many states are showing signs of vulnerability. Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Kansas, and Massachusetts were all identified as being at high risk of recession. The broader Washington, D.C. area is also notable for its economic struggles, which Zandi attributes to government job cuts.Adding to the forecast, Zandi predicts that the annual inflation rate, currently at 2.7%, could rise to nearly 4% within the next year, further eroding purchasing power for consumers.Along with this, Zandi also warned about the restrictive immigration policies which could hurt the tech sector. He urged the lawmakers to protect access to global talent especially in AI, software engineering, and data science. ""If it feels like we're coming to the end of the tariff increases, or like we're going to get a more rational immigration policy,' I think that would be a signal that the coast may be cleared,"" Zandi told BI.“It’s no mystery why the economy is struggling; blame increasing U.S. tariffs and highly restrictive immigration policy. The tariffs are cutting increasingly deeply into the profits of American companies and the purchasing power of American households. Fewer immigrant workers means a smaller economy,” added Zandi.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy.

A room full of startup founders and investors at the world's biggest AI conference votes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI among 'likely flops',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-biggest-ai-conference-votes-sam-altmans-openai-among-likely-flops/articleshow/125364076.cms,"Representative Image

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’





OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference.

New Delhi: Indian boxers are attracted by the huge prize money on offer at the IBA World Championships, due to be held at the Dubai Tennis Stadium from Dec 1 to 14. The tournament, led by Russian official Umar Kremlev and hosted by the International Boxing Association (IBA), will feature prize purses unlike anything seen before in boxing tournaments.The country’s leading male pugilists – without being quoted – told TOI that the money on offer is unprecedented and they would have liked to participate. The gold medallist of each weight category at the IBA Worlds will receive $300,000 (Rs 2.49 crore), the silver winner $150,000 (Rs 1.25 crore), $75,000 for bronze (Rs 62.25 lakh) and the quarterfinalists $10,000 (Rs 8.3 lakh).Some of World Boxing’s member countries from Central Asia and other regions have agreed to send men’s boxers to the championships. However, India has maintained a firm stand on the matter. BFI president Ajay Singh has categorically stated that the country’s boxers would not be allowed to compete in Dubai, as such participation would go against the Olympic movement and could annoy World Boxing, which is recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and to which BFI is affiliated.“Our current position is very clear: We do not want to be distracted or participate in events that may attract sanctions.We will not be sending our teams to that tournament. IBA has its own philosophy. We wish them well, but our priority is the Olympics. When the IOC invited India to join World Boxing after removing IBA from the Olympic structure, we were one of the first major Asian nations to join. We stand fully committed to World Boxing, to the IOC, and to the Olympic movement,” Singh said.Under World Boxing, all its sanctioned events including the men’s and women’s World Championships, which were held in Liverpool in Sept last year, the three World Cups and the season-ending WBC Finals, don’t offer any prize money.Singh informed that he has already spoken in this regard with the sport's global body. “There is a thought that these championships should have prize money. I believe boxers — especially those coming from humble backgrounds — should be rewarded for their achievements. Of course, the Olympic movement is not about prize money; it is about pride and representing your country. But I still think athletes should be rewarded, and the Indian govt has a prize money scheme. Going forward, yes, we will certainly discuss prize money with World Boxing for future cycles,” he said.","Indian boxers are attracted by the huge prize money on offer at the IBA World Championships, due to be held at the Dubai Tennis Stadium from Dec 1 to 14.

US President Donald Trump once again defended his aggressive tariff strategy, claiming it is generating “TRILLIONS of Dollars” for America and has functioned as a powerful tool to prevent international conflicts.In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump wrote, “We are taking in TRILLIONS of Dollars in Tariffs and Investment Dollars from foreign lands because of Tariffs. I have stopped 5 of the eight WARS directly because of the threat of Tariffs if they don’t stop fighting or, better yet, if they start.”Trump has repeatedly claimed that he has solved 8 wars across the globe, including brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan during the May standoff by threatening them with 350 per cent tariffs.Trump further argued that tariffs are vital to the US economy and security. “There is almost no Inflation, and the worst in USA History under Sleepy Joe Biden,” he said, adding, “The Stock Market just hit an ALL-TIME HIGH for the 48th time in 9 months.”Turning to his critics, Trump targeted Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo, the Koch network, and foreign governments for “ripping off"" the US through the use of their own tariffs.Trump’s criticism of Leo follows a public fallout earlier this year. In May, he attacked his once ally after the US Court of International Trade struck down his tariffs, calling him a “sleazebag” who “probably hates America.”The latest remarks add to Trump’s ongoing defence of his tariff-driven agenda, which he continues to frame as central to US strength both at home and abroad.","US President Donald Trump once again defended his aggressive tariff strategy.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

The latest trouble: Eviction from a Spitzer-owned building

“We are very aware of the situation and have a very active legal case against this Resident… NYPD has been here multiple times… with little long term improvement.”

The alleged pattern: High-end meals, no payment

“She wanted to trade pictures and a blog post for the meal… I said we would have to agree on that beforehand, and we haven’t, so I need you to pay the check.”

“Police officers showed up… they looked at her and said, ‘Oh yeah. That’s her. We know her.’”

The persona behind the charges

the Post





For weeks, New York’s dining scene has whispered about a woman who slipped through its most expensive dining rooms, feasted like a tastemaker and allegedly vanished before the bill arrived. Now, 34-year-old Pei Chung, whose curated online persona masked a string of dine-and-dash arrests, is facing an entirely different reckoning: eviction from her Williamsburg apartment owned by Eliot Spitzer. Her digital glamour and real-world debts have finally collided, and the fallout is no longer confined to restaurant tabs.A Brooklyn woman whose alleged dine-and-dash habits have made her a fixture in police blotters is now on the brink of losing her home.According to, 34-year-old Pei Chung is facing eviction on 2 December from her $3,350-a-month Williamsburg studio after falling nearly $40,000 behind on rent. The building is owned by former New York governor Eliot Spitzer.Court filings describe mounting complaints from neighbours and repeated police visits. In internal correspondence cited by the Post, building manager Bob Jenny told a tenant:Neighbours reported “repeated outbursts, visible signs of conflict, and disorder in the hallway,” while one resident wrote that loud arguments and vibrations “frequently” travelled through the walls.It is inside this well-appointed waterfront studio that Chung has filmed much of her social media content, posing in lingerie, showcasing designer labels and styling luxury purchases, even as rent went unpaid.Her eviction is now described by the building as “high on our priority list,” according to documents reviewed byBy the time her landlord moved to evict her, a clearer picture of Pei Chung’s life outside her Williamsburg apartment had already begun to emerge, one that New York restaurateurs were all too familiar with. According to, five separate arrests since late October tell a similar story: a woman who entered some of the city’s most admired dining rooms, ordered generously, projected confidence, and then allegedly refused to pay.At Francie, the Michelin-starred restaurant in Brooklyn, staff say the performance was polished. Chung arrived on 22 October, ordered a full spread, foie gras, carpaccio, bucatini, lamb and chocolate mousse, and only after finishing allegedly proposed that the meal be settled through her online presence. Co-owner John Winterman toldshe approached the bill almost as if an agreement already existed:When she returned less than three weeks later on 7 November, ordering another $83.83 worth of dishes, staff called police after she again allegedly refused payment. Winterman recalled the moment officers arrived:She was handcuffed at the bar as diners watched.Francie, however, was not an outlier. Over the same fortnight,reports she allegedly slipped out of Lavender Lake without paying a $97 tab, vanished for “45 minutes” at Peter Luger before staff located her hiding in the bathroom during bill time, and refused to pay a $135 bill at Motorino Pizza, leading to yet another arrest.What complicated matters further was the existence of her blog , curated, polished, and at times lyrical. Of the same Peter Luger steak she allegedly tried to evade paying for, she wrote:Across these episodes, the NYPD repeatedly charged her with theft of services and issued desk-appearance tickets, while restaurants compared notes about a woman whose social-media sophistication, they believed, was being used as leverage to avoid the very bills her online persona celebrated.According to, Chung is a 34-year-old Brooklyn resident of Taiwanese descent, with roughly 14,000 Instagram followers. Her carefully curated feed presents her as a luxury food and lifestyle influencer, posing in Cartier, Dior, Chanel and Burberry while documenting meals at New York’s most exclusive restaurants.Her LinkedIn lists former work as a user-experience consultant at JPMorgan Chase, with six years in tech and e-commerce.She earned a master’s in Information Experience Design from Pratt Institute in 2019, receiving a full merit scholarship. On social media, she describes herself as a former child prodigy, trained in violin, piano and ballet.But restaurateurs now say her online persona served as leverage, a means to pressure venues into comped meals or escape before paying.With the rent case now moving through housing court, the alleged dine-and-dash spree that once played out across New York’s restaurant scene has reached a new, defining consequence: Chung is at risk of losing the apartment that anchored her entire influencer lifestyle.","Pei Chung, 34, is facing eviction from her $3,350-a-month Williamsburg studio after falling nearly $40,000 behind on rent.
