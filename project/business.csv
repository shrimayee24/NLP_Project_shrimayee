HC upholds appointment of AMU’s 1st woman vice-chancellor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-upholds-appointment-of-amus-1st-woman-vice-chancellor/articleshow/121242119.cms,"Allahabad High Court has validated professor Naima Khatoon's appointment as Aligarh Muslim University's Vice-Chancellor, dismissing challenges to the selection process.

Khatoon says HC ruling reaffirmation of democratic values

AGRA: Dismissing all petitions that challenged the selection process, Allahabad high court upheld the appointment of professor Naima Khatoon as the vice-chancellor (VC) of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on Saturday. Khatoon, who earlier served as principal of women’s college in AMU, became the first woman to hold the VC’s post in the varsity’s over 100-year history, reports Mohammad Dilshad.HC division bench of Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra and Justice Donadi Ramesh found no procedural lapses, asserting the selection process adhered fully to the AMU Act, statutes and regulations. The court also emphasised the symbolic and progressive nature of her “historic appointment”, calling it a “major stride for gender representation and constitutional values in academic leadership”.The HC division bench of Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra and Justice Donadi Ramesh further recognised that the “final discretion to appoint the VC lay with the ‘visitor’ of the university — the President of India, and no allegations of mala fide were established at that level”. The court had reserved the verdict on April 9 after hearing arguments from counsels representing the petitioner, AMU and the central govt.The petitions were filed in late 2023 by Prof Syed Afzal Murtaza Rizvi of Jamia Millia Islamia, Mujahid Beg from AMU’s medicine department and retired AMU prof M U Rabbani.They had raised objections after Khatoon, wife of then acting VC Mohd Gulrez, was “shortlisted” for the post.After HC’s decision, Khatoon, said, “I’ve always had the highest regard and faith in our judiciary. This verdict is not just a personal vindication, but a strong reaffirmation of institutional processes and democratic values in our higher education system. Let this judgment inspire confidence among all stakeholders and reaffirm our shared mission to uphold the university’s legacy of knowledge, justice and progress.”In Nov 2023, controversy erupted after the AMU’s executive council shortlisted “five eligible names”. An AMU professor wrote to the President, claiming “the process of selecting a new VC was not followed”. The ‘AMU court’ then forwarded three names, including that of Khatoon, to the ministry of education and the President, and the matter also went to HC.","Allahabad High Court has validated professor Naima Khatoon's appointment as Aligarh Muslim University's Vice-Chancellor.

'Talent vacuum in BJP': Congress on reports of Shashi Tharoor leading delegation of MPs to expose Pakistan's terrorism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/talent-vacuum-in-bjp-congress-on-reports-of-shashi-tharoor-leading-delegation-of-mps-to-expose-pakistans-terrorism/articleshow/121226984.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday welcomed the Centre’s decision to bring in Shashi Tharoor to lead a delegation of MPs tasked with exposing Pakistan-sponsored terrorism on international platforms.Taking to X, the Kerala Congress claimed that the government chose Tharoor for the role due to a “talent vacuum” within the BJP, asserting that the nation needs a voice that commands global respect.“At a time when Prime Minister Modi and his external affairs minister have lost credibility internationally, the nation needs a voice that commands respect. We appreciate the government for recognising the talent vacuum within the BJP and choosing a Congress leader to represent the country,” the party said.“We are confident that Shashi Tharoor will present India's case at the global level and correct the mistakes made by the Modi government,” the post added.The statement comes a day after the government announced plans to send around 40 parliamentarians to various parts of the world to highlight Pakistan's continued support for terrorism.The MPs will brief the international community about Pakistan’s ongoing involvement in cross-border terrorism and draw attention to India’s recently launched Operation Sindoor.The 10-day tour is expected to commence on May 23, with delegations likely to visit key world capitals including Washington D.C., London, Abu Dhabi, Johannesburg, and Tokyo.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju is leading the coordination efforts for the initiative. Several opposition MPs, including Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor, Priyanka Chaturvedi, and Sasmit Patra, have reportedly been approached to participate.This will be the first time the Centre is deputing a multi-party delegation of MPs to present India’s stance on Kashmir and cross-border terrorism originating from Pakistan.Although the government has not made an official announcement, it is understood that the ministry of external affairs, ministry of home affairs, ministry of parliamentary affairs, and other agencies are preparing detailed dossiers to substantiate India’s allegations against Pakistan.An official from the ministry of external affairs is expected to accompany the delegations.The move comes in the wake of precision strikes by Indian armed forces on terrorist launchpads in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Following several days of confrontation along the Line of Control, both nations agreed to a ceasefire on May 10.

Supreme Court Criticizes Repeated PILs on Rohingya Deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-irked-by-repeated-pils-to-stop-rohingya-deportation/articleshow/121220210.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday was irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims within a fortnight and told senior advocate Colin Gonsalves that he can’t be filing PIL after PIL on the same issue without any new fact to seek modification of SC’s May 8 decision refusing relief.On May 8, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and N Kotiswar Singh had refused to grant interim stay on apprehended deportation of Rohingyas despite spirited arguments from Gonsalves and Prashant Bhushan. The bench had said Rohingyas, who are not Indian citizens, do not have a right to reside anywhere in the country.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had said India is not a signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees and disputed validity of UNHCR granting refugee status to Rohingyas, who are from Myanmar and had fled to other countries because of serious threat to their lives from the military.On Friday, Gonsalves said on May 8 itself the Union govt had deported 28 Rohingyas, who were handcuffed and taken to Andaman Island, given life jackets and pushed towards Myanmar. After somehow reaching Myanmar, they took help of fishermen to make phone calls to their relatives in Delhi to inform them that they faced imminent threats to their lives.The bench of Justices Kant and Singh said these are bald averments and who is there to verify these facts are true to his knowledge. “When the country is facing such a situation at present, you cannot come up with fanciful PILs like this. There is no material to support vague and sweeping allegations made in the petition. Unless the petitioner provides prima facie credible material, it is difficult to pass an interim order which is contrary to the one refused on May 8 by a 3-J bench.”Gonsalves cited a SC judgement on protection of Chakma refugees to seek similar relief for Rohingyas. He also cited a UN Report as well as an order of the International Court of Justice to claim that Rohingyas are not migrants but refugees whose protection of lives is mandated by the UN.The bench said, “We do not want to comment on the UN Report today. We will give an answer to that on July 31, when this petition along with the pending one would be taken up for hearing.” Gonsalves said this would allow govt to deport more Rohingyas, whose number exceed 8,000 in different parts of the country and 800 of them are in Delhi.","Supreme Court irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims.

"With Operation Sindoor still on, military gets emergency purchase powers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-operation-sindoor-still-on-military-gets-emergency-purchase-powers/articleshow/121241511.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: With India making it clear that the cessation of hostilities under Operation Sindoor is only a ‘strategic pause’ if Pakistan does not mend its ways in fuelling cross-border terrorism , govt has granted emergency procurement (EP) powers to the armed forces with an overall outer limit of around Rs 40,000 crore.The EP-6 approval for Army, IAF and Navy to further boost as well as replenish their arms stockpiles was granted by the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council just a few days ago, officials told TOI on Saturday.The first four EPs were granted during the military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh, while the fifth was for counter-terror operations. Under EP-6, the armed forces can fast-track multiple contracts, each worth Rs 300 crore, under both capital and revenue heads instead of following the normal long-winded procurement procedure.“The contracts have to be finalised within 40 days, with deliveries to be completed in one year. The powers will be exercised by the three Service vice chiefs,” an official said.This will allow the armed forces to quickly build their arsenals of missiles and other long-range weapons, loiter and precision-guided munitions, kamikaze drones and counter-drone systems, among other weapons and ammunition.There is a 15% cap each on the total capital and revenue procurements of the overall defence outlay earmarked for the ongoing fiscal. “All EP-6 purchases have to take place with the concurrence of the financial advisors, while special permission is needed for imports,” the official said. “While the actual expenditure is likely to be less than the overall 15% outer limit, it gives the Services the requisite flexibility to meet urgent operational gaps and replenish their ammunition stocks depleted in the four days of intense hostilities from May 7 to 10,” he added.IAF jets, for instance, used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, which are jointly produced in India with Russia, the Israeli-origin air-to-ground Crystal Maze-2 and Rampage missiles and Spice- 2000 precision-guided bombs, and French-origin Scalp cruise missiles and Hammer air-to-ground precision-guided munitions, for their precision strikes, as earlier reported by TOI. IAF also used Israeli Harop and Harpy kamikaze drones.Similarly, Army units launched loitering munitions like SkyStriker as well as fired ‘smart’ extended range artillery shells like Excalibur to hammer specific targets.The armed forces also used a wide array of weapons as part of the multi-layered air defence network. They included the Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missiles, jointly developed with Israel, and the indigenous Akash missiles.","The EP-6 approval for Army, IAF and Navy to further boost as well as replenish their arms stockpiles was granted by the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council just a few days ago.

NEW DELHI: On the intervening night of May 9 and 10, the Indian Air Force (IAF) destroyed 11 of Pakistan's 12 airbases, retaliating against Islamabad targeting 26 locations across India as a response to the successful ""Operation Sindoor.""India's air defence systems, however, thwarted Pakistan's attacks.According to an ANI report, the subsequent counter-strikes on airbases of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) began with the Indian forces sending across ""dummy pilotless aircraft."" These were camouflaged to appear as IAF jets on enemy radars.As expected, the PAF radars and air defence network got activated to take down the Indian 'incoming aircraft.' The IAF then launched the loitering munitions, including the Israeli-made Harops, targeting Pakistan's air defence radars and command and control systems.Pakistan's air force had to mobilise its entire set of its HQ-9 air defence missile system launchers and radars to different locations; some of these were detected following activation, despite being deployed at new locations.The IAF then followed up with its long-range missiles, including the BrahMos and Scalp, using these to attack the Pakistani air bases. As per reports, around 15 BrahMos, as well as the Scalp, Rampage and Crystal Maze, were launched in the offensive.The strikes marked the first time that the BrahMos, a supersonic cruise missile system, has been used in an active conflict.The damages were so extensive that the PAF was forced to shift its aircraft to different bases in the rear. Also, it is likely to have lost a significant number of long-endurance drones and an airborne early warning and control aircraft during an IAF missile hit on a hangar at an airbase in the Sindh province.Defence sources told ANI the intensity of the strikes made Pakistan drop its plans for a counter to the capitulation of its air defence system. Islamabad urgently requested DGMO (Director General of Military Operations)-level talks to arrive at an ""understanding"" with New Delhi to put a pause to all military action going forward.The DGMO talks were held at 3:35 pm on May 10. Around two hours later, the two sides announced the ceasefire.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) destroyed 11 of Pakistan's 12 airbases, retaliating against Islamabad targeting 26 locations across India.

India approves Rs 40,000 cr to fast-track military purchases amid Operation Sindoor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-emergency-defence-procurement-power-india-approves-rs-40000-cr-to-fast-track-military-purchases-amid-operation-sindoor/articleshow/121239505.cms,"PTI file photo

What is

emergency defence procurement power

?

Emergency defence procurement power allows the armed forces to bypass standard procurement timelines for urgent military needs.

Under it, the equipment must be delivered quickly—often within 3 to 6 months.

The powers are activated during conflict, tensions, or natural disasters.

Financial limits are set for each procurement cycle, allowing the military to negotiate directly.

This mechanism was used in previous border clashes and now during Operation Sindoor.

According to ministry of defence, for items previously supplied by defence PSUs or ordnance factories, the government can issue Letters of Intent (LoI) to speed up procurement before a full contract is signed.

To ensure oversight, a high-level defence ministry committee ensures that rules are followed and no irregularities occur in large contracts.

The Indian defence forces are set to make emergency purchases worth Rs 40,000 crore to enhance combat readiness during Operation Sindoor . The defence acquisition council, chaired by senior defence and military officials, have approved the spending to ensure timely procurement of critical equipment.Key systems being prioritised under the emergency powers include surveillance drones, kamikaze drones, loitering munitions, and various types of missiles and ammunition. Some of these, like the BrahMos and Scalp cruise missiles, have already been deployed against Pakistani targets. The Rampage missile, also used in the strikes, was initially procured under similar emergency provisions.These emergency powers ensure that the equipment is received within a strict timeline, helping meet immediate operational requirements. This is the fifth such tranche of emergency procurement since 2019. Procurement teams from all three services will coordinate with defence finance advisers to manage purchases efficiently.Indian public and private defence firms, including Bharat Electronics and Solar Defence, are expected to receive orders for low-level radars and other high-tech systems. The forces also plan to acquire more Heron Mark 2 drones , which have been instrumental in surveillance during Operation Sindoor.Given the current conflict and its evolving demands, the Indian government may consider additional funds for defence needs in future budgets.","Emergency defence procurement power allows the armed forces to bypass standard procurement timelines for urgent military needs.

Ban on Bangladesh goods likely to benefit NE

NEW DELHI: In a “retaliatory move”, govt on Saturday restricted the import of several products from Bangladesh, including a ban on the entry of readymade garments through the land route, amid growing unease with the interim administration led by chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.In a notification Saturday, the directorate general of foreign trade, however, allowed garments, the mainstay of Bangladesh industry, to be shipped via Nhava Sheva and Kolkata ports. The latest move will deal a blow to a significant chunk of the $700 million garment exports to India, a large part of which lands up in stores and on e-comm platforms.While fish, edible oil, LPG and crushed stones have been spared, import of several products via land customs stations and integrated check posts in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Changrabandha and Fulbari in West Bengal will be discontinued.Govt sources said the notification by DGFT was retaliatory action against Bangladesh, which last month restricted the entry of Indian yarn, the key input for making apparel, and rice. India had earlier disallowed transit of Bangladesh garments meant for export to third markets as these goods cornered the space on freighters, elbowing out India-made products.“Bangladesh cannot cherry-pick the terms of bilateral engagement solely to benefit itself or take India’s market access for granted. India is willing to discuss these issues but it is Bangladesh’s responsibility to create an environment that is free of rancour,” said an official.Govt sources said industrial growth in the northeastern states had taken a hit because of the imposition of unreasonably high and economically unviable transit charges by Dhaka, even as Bangladesh itself enjoyed free access to the entire northeastern market. Access for manufactured products, barring some farm goods, is also an issue in Bangladesh.“Due to Bangladesh’s landport restrictions, the northeastern states suffer from lack of access to the Bangladesh market to sell locally manufactured goods, restricting market access to primary agricultural goods only,” said a source, adding India’s decision on Saturday will support local manufacturing in the Northeast and India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative .Earlier this week, Yunus had suggested a comprehensive economic plan for Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and the northeastern states. The notification comes days after an alleged “secret visit” by a Chinese team to Lalmonirhat to restore an air base.","India has restricted imports from Bangladesh, including a ban on readymade garments via land routes.

"At 1.5 lakh, pedestrians made up 20% of road deaths in 5 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/at-1-5-lakh-pedestrians-made-up-20-of-road-deaths-in-5-years/articleshow/121241568.cms,"Nearly 1.5 lakh pedestrians died in India from 2019-2023, highlighting their vulnerability despite having right-of-way. A Supreme Court panel audit revealed that footpath availability varies widely across states, often not meeting standards. The court emphasized pedestrians' rights under Article 21, advocating for accessible, encroachment-free footpaths as a crucial, low-cost safety measure.

Just 3% of J&K roads have pavements

NEW DELHI: Despite having the first right on roads, pedestrians remain the most vulnerable user and data show that nearly 1.5 lakh of them died in road crashes in the country in from 2019-2023 out of the little over 7.9 lakh of all road fatalities during these years.While Supreme Court this week said that “rights of pedestrians to use footpaths are guaranteed under Article 21 of Constitution”, audits carried out in 24 states following a direction of an SC panel found that roads having footpaths across most states and UTs range between 19% and 73%, with Maharashtra having the maximum.Details of the audit findings were released recently by the Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Centre of Injury and IIT-Delhi in its report ‘India Status Report on Road Safety’. The availability of footpaths and whether these comply with the norms of width and height specified by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) were arrived at based on surveys across four cities in each state.As per the findings, in Jammu & Kashmir, barely 3% of the roads surveyed had footpath, and in the case of Puducherry, it was only 5%. In Bihar and Haryana, 19%-20% of roads had footpath. In most cases, footpath were not as per IRC norms.The apex court, in its order this week, observed, “It is necessary to have proper footpaths for citizens. They should be such that they should be accessible for persons with disabilities and removal of encroachments is mandatory. This court has recognised that the right of pedestrians to use footpaths is guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.”Amar Srivastava, who heads India Road Safety Campaign, a youth-led road safety movement, said that building proper footpaths and keeping them free for pedestrians is the most low cost intervention to prevent road crashes. “So, this should be the priority of every city administration and local govts,” he added.According to World Health Organisation, globally pedestrians make up 21% of road fatalities and in India, nearly one-fifth of people killed in road crashes in 2023 were walkers. WHO, last week, released a toolkit for promoting ‘walking and cycling’ for govt bodies as part of the ongoing UN Road Safety Week with the theme ‘make walking and cycling safe’, laying out why promoting walking and cycling should be the priority of govts for sustainable development and good health of people.","Nearly 1.5 lakh pedestrians died in India from 2019-2023, highlighting their vulnerability despite having right-of-way.

India gives special entry to 160 Afghan trucks via Attari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gives-special-entry-to-160-afghan-trucks-via-attari/articleshow/121221556.cms,"Afghan trucks allowed to unload goods at Attari

Poll Should countries increase trade and humanitarian aid to help rebuild nations facing conflict and crises? No, it may create more challenges Yes, it promotes peace and development

NEW DELHI: India is learnt to have approved as a “special gesture” entry of 160 Afghan trucks carrying dry fruits and nuts through the Attari border with Pakistan, as bilateral ties with the Taliban develop rapidly even in the absence of a formal recognition for the regime in Kabul. According to sources, Pakistan held up clearance for a while on the Wagah side for the movement of the trucks before allowing some of them to unload at Attari on Friday.India had decided to shut the Attari-Wagah border on April 23, following the Pahalgam terrorist attack that took place a day earlier. Pakistan has in the past allowed one-way trade between Afghanistan and India through that border, facilitating export of Afghan goods to India but not any reverse export from India to Afghanistan.Expanding trade ties was one of the issues that external affairs minister S Jaishankar discussed with the Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in what was the first political engagement between India and the Taliban on May 15. Despite the hurdles created by transit issues in Pakistan, India remains the largest market for Afghan products in South Asia and annual trade stands at approximately $ 1 billion.The one time in the recent past Pakistan did allow India to send goods to Afghanistan through the land border was in late 2021, after India proposed sending 50,000 tonnes of wheat as aid to the drought-affected country. The Taliban, who had just returned to Kabul, pushed Pakistan to not hold up clearance for the supply.Muttaqi had called Jaishankar on Thursday ahead of his upcoming visit to Iran and China, a fact India attaches a lot of significance to. Both leaders had agreed to remain in touch and Jaishankar thanked Muttaqi for the solidarity Kabul expressed for India after the Pahalgam attack and for not buying into subsequent attempts by Pakistan authorities to sow discord between India and the Taliban, including through the claim that India fired missiles at Afghanistan. A source said this was significant “posturing” given the tense situation that followed India’s Operation Sindoor.Since foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Muttaqi in Dubai earlier this year, India has been looking to resume work on its projects in Afghanistan and, while also considering more development cooperation projects for the people of Afghanistan. These efforts will likely be further expedited by India’s move to politically engage Kabul.“We are also considering humanitarian assistance for the Afghan refugees expelled by Pakistan,’’ said a source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Formal recognition, however, will have to wait until the international community remains convinced that the Taliban dispensation is not serious about providing inclusive governance and removing restrictions on women.“Since 2021, India has sent 50,000 tonnes of wheat, 350 tonnes of medicines, 40,000 litres of Malathion and 28 tonnes of earthquake relief material to Afghanistan. We have also provided 2000 online scholarships for Afghan students. This aid was appreciated by the Afghan side,’’ added the source.",India is learnt to have approved entry of 160 Afghan trucks carrying dry fruits and nuts.

'The number of H-1Bs we need this year is ZERO'







The USCIS has revealed that 120,141 H-1B visa applications have been selected for 2026 which is the lowest since 2021, owing to several issues, including H-1B cap, increased fee etc. But MAGA supporters freaked out over the 'huge' number of H-1B approvals and contended that US jobs are still being stolen.""US workers are being replaced. 120,000 H-1B visas have been approved for 2026.

This represents a 27% drop in eligible registrations from the 470,342 reported for FY 2025. The H-1B program operates under an annual cap of 65,000 new visas. However, an additional 20,000 petitions are exempt from this limit for applicants who hold a U.S. master's degree or higher, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).Steve Bannon said the number of visa approvals is outrageous.

Here’s what Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath wrote on X (formerly Twitter)

""Here's something worrying from a recent earnings call of a beverage maker: Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever. Even Indian companies have said something similar. Remember, India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic.""

Diabetes is a ticking time bomb for India. We have the largest number of people with diabetes in the world.

There was a time when people used to call diabetes a rich person's disease. But that's no longer the case. According to a recent study, 21 crore Indians are living with diabetes.

Poll Do you believe increasing soft drink consumption is a significant health risk for India? No, I don't think so Yes, it's a serious concern

The scary part is the rate at which it's affecting young Indians. If you're a 20-year-old woman living in a city today, you have a 64.6% chance of developing diabetes during your lifetime. If you're a young man, your risk is also quite high at 55.5%.

But the sad part is there's a lack of awareness among people. About 27.5% of people with diabetes don't even know they have it. Even if they do know, very few people get treatment.

What makes this a serious crisis is that less than 20% of Indians have health insurance. Most Indians end up spending out of their pocket, which is a huge burden for poor and low-income households.

There's no magic bullet to solve this issue. We need multiple approaches, from public awareness campaigns, insurance coverage for the poor and vulnerable, to introducing early detection programs.

Simple lifestyle changes, like adding a few extra minutes of exercise each day or reducing time spent sitting, can make a big difference. Even small changes, such as walking or cycling for an extra five minutes a day, can lower the risk of diabetes.

We've been supporting founders and startups that are working on helping Indians become healthier, but this is a systemic challenge that needs all people involved—from individuals to the government—to take action.

Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to raise concerns about increasing soft drink consumption in India. In the post, Kamath cited a worrying trend from a beverage maker’s recent earnings. “Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever,” he wrote without naming the beverage company. Kamath linked the increased consumption of soft drinks to a broader health issue, pointing out that “India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic”. Notably, this is the second time when Kamath has warned against rising cases of diabetes in the country. He previously shared a post in November last year, calling Diabetes 'a ticking time bomb for India.'Kamath quoted his previous post which he shared in November last year.

US woman praises India’s 10 best traits on social media

1. Affordable healthcare

2. Extensive and cost-effective public transportation

3. Rich and diverse food culture

4. Strong community and family bonds



5. Culture of resourcefulness and sustainability

6. Affordable and high-quality education

7. Vibrant festivals and cultural celebrations



8. Hard work and resilience

9. Flexible and adaptive labor market

10. Strong social networks and community support



India, a nation known for its rich cultural heritage and rapid economic growth, often surprises foreigners with its unique blend of tradition and modernity. One such admirer is Kristen Fischer , an American expat living in India, who recently highlighted ten practical aspects of Indian life that she believes the country excels at, compared to other parts of the world. In an Instagram video titled ""Things India Does Better,"" Fischer shared her firsthand observations on why India stands out, praising its affordability, strong community support, and cultural vibrancy. Her insights provide a refreshing perspective on the everyday strengths of Indian society that often go unnoticed.India’s healthcare system stands out for its affordability and accessibility, a factor that Fischer highlighted as one of the country’s biggest strengths. Unlike many Western countries where medical treatments can lead to financial strain, India offers high-quality medical services at a fraction of the cost. This affordability extends to everything from routine check-ups to complex surgeries, making healthcare accessible to a larger section of the population.Additionally, India is known for its world-class hospitals and medical professionals, with cities like Chennai, Mumbai, and Delhi emerging as medical tourism hubs. Patients from around the globe often travel to India for treatments like heart surgeries, joint replacements, and cosmetic procedures, drawn by the combination of advanced technology and cost-effectiveness.India boasts one of the world’s largest and most cost-effective public transportation networks. Fischer praised the country’s extensive rail system, which spans over 68,000 kilometers, connecting even the remotest corners of the nation. This network is complemented by affordable buses, autorickshaws, metros, and app-based ride-sharing services, providing convenient travel options for millions every day.For instance, the Delhi Metro, known for its punctuality and cleanliness, has become a model for other cities, while local trains in Mumbai are the lifeline for the city’s bustling workforce. The affordability of these options makes daily commuting more economical compared to many Western countries, where public transport can be significantly more expensive.Indian cuisine is renowned worldwide for its vibrant flavors, rich spices, and immense variety. Fischer noted that India’s diverse food culture is not only delicious but also remarkably affordable. From street food like samosas and chaat to elaborate regional dishes like Rajasthani thalis and Hyderabadi biryani, India offers a gastronomic experience that caters to every palate and budget.Moreover, the widespread use of fresh, locally sourced ingredients and centuries-old cooking techniques contribute to the health benefits and distinct flavors of Indian dishes. India’s food culture also emphasizes hospitality and sharing, reflecting the country’s deeply rooted community values.One of the most distinctive aspects of Indian society is its emphasis on close-knit family structures and strong community ties. Fischer highlighted this as a key strength, noting that Indian families often live together, providing a robust support system for both emotional and financial well-being.In India, it is common for multiple generations to share a household, creating an environment where family members can rely on each other during tough times. This sense of togetherness extends beyond the family unit to include neighbors and local communities, fostering a deep sense of belonging and mutual support.Fischer also praised India’s culture of resourcefulness, where people often repair, reuse, and recycle items rather than discarding them. This mindset minimizes waste and promotes sustainability, reflecting a practical approach to everyday living.In rural areas, this resourcefulness is evident in the widespread use of traditional farming techniques, reliance on locally sourced food, and innovative approaches to water conservation. Urban households, too, are increasingly embracing sustainable practices, from composting to using solar power, driven by a growing awareness of environmental issues.India’s education system, while facing challenges, also stands out for its affordability and quality. Fischer noted that India is home to some of the world’s most prestigious institutions, like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), which offer top-tier education at a fraction of the cost compared to their Western counterparts.This affordability extends to primary and secondary education, where many public and private schools provide high-quality instruction at reasonable fees, making education accessible to a broader population.India’s festivals, known for their color, energy, and inclusivity, are among the most vibrant in the world. Fischer appreciated the way these celebrations bring communities together, fostering a sense of unity and shared joy.From the lights of Diwali and the colors of Holi to the spiritual fervor of Eid and the grandeur of Durga Puja , Indian festivals reflect the country’s deep-rooted traditions and diverse cultural heritage. These celebrations often include family gatherings, community feasts, and elaborate rituals, creating lasting memories for participants.Fischer also highlighted the hardworking nature and resilience of Indians, who show remarkable adaptability in the face of challenges. This resilience is evident in the country’s thriving startup ecosystem, its rapid economic growth, and the determination of its people to overcome adversity.India’s labor market is known for its flexibility, which has fueled the growth of industries like information technology, business process outsourcing (BPO), and manufacturing. This adaptability has made India a global outsourcing hub, attracting companies from around the world seeking cost-effective solutions.Finally, Fischer emphasized the importance of strong social networks in India, where communities often come together to support each other during difficult times. This sense of community is reinforced by cultural values that prioritize relationships and collective well-being.","US woman praises India’s 10 best traits on social media.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s plan to cut bureaucracy at company

Amazon has reportedly fired 100 employees within its Devices and Services division . According to a report by Reuters, the company said the jobs represented a small number of the total for the unit and were part of its regular business review. The Devices and Services unit is responsible for developing popular hardware products such as the Echo smart speakers, Fire TV devices, and Ring security systems. To recall, Amazon also laid off some employees from Alexa-related jobs in 2023.In a statement given to Reuters, Amazon spokesperson said,While the full scope of the layoffs remains unclear, reports indicate that a variety of teams within the Devices and Services unit have been affected. This suggests a broad restructuring effort rather than targeting a specific product line.The layoffs come as Amazon continues to navigate a challenging economic environment. Like many other tech companies, Amazon has been focused on cost-cutting measures to improve efficiency and profitability. These measures have included workforce reductions across various divisions. Amazon has not yet released an official statement specifying the reasons for this particular round of layoffs.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees that building large teams and personal fiefdoms is not the path to advancement at the company, emphasizing instead that the e-commerce giant rewards those who accomplish more with fewer resources. Jassy's comments came during a recent all-hands meeting as Jassy continues his push to reduce management layers and bureaucracy across the organization.The CEO highlighted Amazon's commitment to operating with the agility of ""the world's largest startup"" despite its size. This initiative includes a recently completed effort to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% across the company. Rather than massive layoffs, Amazon achieved this goal by combining teams and moving some managers into individual contributor roles.Jassy also stressed the importance of meritocracy over bureaucracy in Amazon's corporate culture.

Chris Olave emerges as Steelers next big target after Pickens trade: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chris-olave-emerges-as-steelers-next-big-target-after-pickens-trade-report/articleshow/121218390.cms,"Chris Olave emerges as Steelers next big target after Pickens trade: Report (Image Source: Getty Images)

Chris Olave linked to Steelers as trade rumors heat up

Steelers are trying for Chris Olave but deal is not close yet

The Pittsburgh Steelers have already made two high-profile moves this offseason with wide receivers. They first traded for DK Metcalf from the Seattle Seahawks. They then traded George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys. Now, it appears they may not be finished. The team is reportedly eyeing trading for another star, New Orleans Saints receiver Chris Olave .The Steelers began by acquiring a dominant wideout. They sent a second-round pick and a later pick trade to acquire DK Metcalf in March. Weeks after, they sent George Pickens to Dallas. That transaction acquired them a third-round pick in 2026 as well as a future late-round trade.With Metcalf on board as their best wide receiver, the team is a bit improved at the top, but their depth is still lacking. They do have veteran Robert Woods, who does not get much playing time but is primarily recognized for blocking and leadership. Calvin Austin had potential last year but isn't ready for an outside full-time role. Rookie Roman Wilson is still without a track record.Which means the Steelers will probably do one more thing. On his radio show, Pittsburgh radio personality Adam Crowley said the next suspect is Saints phenom Chris Olave. He tweeted out the name ""Chris Olave"" and then followed up by saying that someone close to the situation texted him the name.Kevin Adams of Barstool Sports also broke the story. He supplied more information, indicating, ""Trying. Interested. But not close."" That translates to the Steelers are making an effort, but it is not even close to being finished.If they can get Olave, it would be a big signing. Although Olave sat out time with a concussion last year, he was great in 2023. He caught 87 passes for more than 1,100 yards that season. He's the type of receiver who can do everything short passes, deep passes, and all things in between. He'd complement Metcalf, who is more suited for deep, run-after-catch plays.Adding Olave would provide the Steelers with two high-level receivers and a significant boost to their offense. It would also assist quarterback Russell Wilson or Justin Fields, whichever one wins the starting job, by providing them with more weapons.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers Leaves NFL Fans Guessing As Steelers Await Blockbuster Decision That Could Shake Up The League","Pittsburgh Steelers are reportedly trying to sign New Orleans Saints receiver Chris Olave.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Delhi Election Results 2025: Why AAP Lost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-election-results-2025-aap-lost-reasons-arvind-kejriwal-new-delhi-manish-sisodia-bjp-modi-incumbency-corruptio-sheesh-mahal-liquor-freebies-congress-rahul/articleshow/118023276.cms,"Here are 10 reasons behind AAP's defeat:



Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Look at the chief economic and strategic spots across Africa — ports for key trade corridors, mines that produce critical minerals, large renewable energy projects — and you will find the United Arab Emirates. As the United States and, to a lesser extent, China reduce their investment, aid and presence on the continent, the Emirates is using its enormous wealth to fill the void. Persian Gulf investments in Africa, primarily by the Emirates, have exploded in recent years. Since 2019, $110 billion worth of deals — mostly by firms tightly aligned with the ruling powers — have been announced, dwarfing amounts pledged by any other country. “The UAE is turning into a dominant foreign player” in much of Africa, said Anna Jacobs, a nonresident fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.Its efforts to become a world leader, particularly in finance and technology, are likely to be bolstered under President Trump, Jacobs said. The President, seeking to draw Emirati money to the United States, paved the way this week for the sale of American advanced artificial intelligence chips to the Emirates.Like other oil-producing nations in the Persian Gulf, the Emirates is looking to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels, and it sees Africa as an essential part of the plan.The continent has vast mineral resources, a growing population, agricultural potential and a strategically important location bordering the Red and Mediterranean seas as well as the Indian and Atlantic oceans.Powerhouse Emirati corporations based in Dubai and Abu Dhabi with political connections are in dozens of countries across Africa. AMEA Power is already building or operating clean energy plants in Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Morocco, South Africa, Togo, Tunisia and Uganda and has plans to expand. Abu Dhabi National Energy has projects in Morocco, Senegal and South Africa. DP World , the gargantuan govt-backed ports and logistics operator, has invested billions of dollars in ports and economic free zones from Algeria to Zambia, including in the Berbera port city in the breakaway republic of Somaliland, where the Emirates also has a military base.Last year, the Emirati International Holding invested more than $1 billion for a 51% share in the Mopani Copper Mines in Zambia.Spending in Egypt has also soared. Last year, the Emirates agreed to invest $35 billion to develop a new city and tourism destination on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast.Once the biggest foreign investor on the continent through its Belt and Road Initiative, China still has a large presence, but Beijing has pulled back in recent years after a series of debt crises in Africa and at home.In 2022 and 2023, the Emirates announced a total of $97 billion in investments in Africa — three times China’s total, according to fDi Markets, a database of foreign investments. US investment in 2023 was about $10 billion.Meanwhile, Trump has fast-tracked the US’ exit from Africa, ending billions of dollars in funding, dismantling the USAID and ending all contributions to the African Development Bank.","The United Arab Emirates is using its enormous wealth to fill the void.

‘Eat the tariffs’: Donald Trump scolds Walmart after retailer blames import taxes for price hikes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eat-the-tariffs-donald-trump-scolds-walmart-after-retailer-blames-import-taxes-for-price-hikes/articleshow/121241541.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Saturday told Walmart to “eat the tariffs” after the retail giant warned that it would have to raise prices because of the new import taxes . Trump said that the retail giant should not blame tariffs for the price hikes.The US’s biggest retailer recently said that tariffs, even at reduced levels, would soon force price increases on many of its products. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon explained that while the company would try to keep prices low, it could not “absorb all the pressure” caused by the tariffs.In response, Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to scold Walmart. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,” he wrote. “Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected.”Trump urged Walmart to keep prices down despite the tariffs. “EAT THE TARIFFS,” he said, adding, “I’ll be watching, and so will your customers.”Walmart’s warning comes amid growing concerns over inflation and rising costs, with Trump pushing to keep prices stable as part of his trade policy. About one-third of Walmart’s products come from overseas, with many imported from China and Mexico.The company sells a wide range of affordable goods to millions of Americans and says 90% of the population is its customers, according to the New York Times.Many retailers have avoided raising prices so far by stockpiling goods. Walmart is seen as somewhat protected because many of its groceries are sourced within the United States. However, the company has stopped projecting profits for the current quarter due to the uncertainty caused by tariffs.Walmart reported a sales increase of over 3%, reaching $112 billion in the last quarter, and expects revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the year. Walmart is one of several companies warning that shoppers could soon face higher prices as import taxes drive up costs.","US President Donald Trump told Walmart to ""eat the tariffs"" after the retail giant warned that it would have to raise prices.

'Some teachers will buy pads for us'



Cloth pads can be unsafe



Government initiatives fall short



New vouchers expected this year







When 14-year-old Janani gets her period, she doesn't always make it to school. Some days, there are no sanitary pads at home, and Janani is forced to use a pad made from old clothes. On those days, she skips classes.""I feel ashamed of using cloth,"" Janani told DW. ""If we miss school because of this, they won't teach us again the lessons we've missed, will they?""A survey conducted by DW of more than 500 girls across six schools in Sri Lanka's Central Province indicated that nearly half — 46% — struggled to afford pads each month, with the figure skyrocketing to 81% at one school.Janani's mother works as a tea plucker in the hills of Nuwara Eliya District and earns about 1,350 rupees (around €4 or $4.5) per day. She buys her daughter pads when she can afford it. When she has no pads, Janani said, she wonders ""why I get my period at all.""Almost half of the girls surveyed by DW said they missed school during their period for a myriad of reasons, including excessive pain. And it is affecting their school performance.""I keep thinking about it, and so I can't study,"" said 14-year-old Girija referring to period poverty , a sentiment echoed by some of her peers.Sri Lanka's government is making an effort to address the problem as its economy inches towards recovery following an economic collapse in 2022.The cost of a pack of 10 sanitary napkins increased by 92% after the economic crisis, from 140 to 270 rupees, according to the Advocata Institute. Imported sanitary pads continue to be taxed in Sri Lanka at 51%.Teacher Anthonyraj Devaneshi told DW that her school gave out one sanitary pad to girls in emergency situations, but could not afford to give them out consistently.""Some teachers will buy pads for us, but others won't,"" said 12-year-old Harini, adding that she found it awkward to ask and would usually ask her friends to do it on her behalf. ""If my friends aren't at school [when I get my period], I'll just come home.""Harini has to make the long journey home by herself if her parents are unable to pick her up — a walk which takes her an hour through the hills.Her school also has no place for girls to dispose of their sanitary pads, with several girls telling DW they avoided changing at school. Two schools had a policy requiring students who took a pad from school to purchase a replacement and hand it in the next day.A 2021 study by Advocata revealed that half of Sri Lankan women did not spend any money on sanitary products.Rashmira Balasuriya, director of the Arka Initiative to combat period poverty and technical advisor to Sri Lanka's Family Planning Association, said the issue had ""most likely gotten worse"" following the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis.To save money, many girls use cloth. About 44% of the girls surveyed by DW reported using a combination of cloth and pads or exclusively cloth during their period, although not all of them cited unaffordability as the reason.Balasuriya said the lack of sunlight in Sri Lanka's hill country meant cloth pads were not always safe to use, because they would not properly dry.Girija told DW she had started using pads after developing an infection from cloth. ""Using cloth is hard. It feels like it's not secure,"" she said. ""I feel scared to sit because I'm worried something might happen. It's hard to walk, to sit, or to sleep.""At least a dozen other girls told DW they had also developed infections from using cloth.Girija said her family took out loans from the store to buy pads and she felt angry with her mother when they could not afford them. However, her mother told her, ""It doesn't matter if we have to use cloth, you use pads."" Still, Girija only changes her pad only once every seven hours, afraid of running out.""When we use cloth for too long, sometimes it burns,"" said 13-year-old Saraswathi, who sometimes uses cloth pads even at school, although she avoids changing for the entire day. ""It's difficult to walk with cloth, and my hips hurt.""Teacher Thiruchelvam Mangala Roobini said there was also a lack of awareness around menstruation, with many girls who lacked pads forced to bleed through their underwear, which they would then dispose of in the toilets.Last year, the Sri Lankan government distributed two vouchers of 600 rupees each to 800,000 schoolgirls, with the last disbursement given in September 2024. The goal of the scheme was to allow the girls to buy sanitary pads.But Balasuriya said the voucher system was ""not a sustainable one,"" as the average woman needs about 20 pads over five days in a single month, and the money was simply insufficient. Some girls told DW the pads they purchased had run out in one or two months.Roobini believes that many girls did not purchase sanitary pads with the vouchers, citing previous instances where shoe vouchers provided by the government had been used to purchase other necessities.One school principal told DW he was ""100% sure"" that the sanitary pad voucher had even been used to purchase alcohol.The current government, led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake, announced in March that it would spend 1.44 billion rupees on a similar initiative, distributing two vouchers of 720 rupees each to all menstruating schoolgirls.A representative from the Department of Education told DW the initiative would begin again at the end of May, but it was not possible to say whether it would continue after the two sets of voucher disbursements. The lawmakers have yet to decide on the issue.""If they give us pads continuously, it'll be good,"" 14-year-old Girija told DW. ""Then they won't run out, right? We can keep using them.""","Nearly half of Sri Lankan girls struggle to afford sanitary pads each month. The cost of a pack of 10 sanitary napkins increased by 92% after the economic crisis. To save money, many girls use cloth during their period, which can be unsafe.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121184660,imgsize-1118791,width-400,resizemode-4/121184660.jpg"

Yields under threat

Seeping salt



Resistant varieties







Katukurunda: A commando in an elite Sri Lankan police unit, Sameera Dilshan has an unusual mission, to reclaim farms poisoned by salt, a long-standing problem now accelerating due to climate change.Increasing salinity is slowly and steadily swallowing traditional rice paddies along the island's coastline, taking away the livelihood of generations of farmers.Two hours' drive south of the capital Colombo lies Katukurunda, one of the camps of the formidable Special Task Force (STF), created four decades ago to fight Tamil rebels.While his colleagues train for riot control under the humid heat of the nearby Indian Ocean, the 35-year-old non-commissioned officer and his ""commando-farmer"" team are hoeing, weeding and watering.Their goal? To grow coconut palms and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in a paddy declared dead 40 years ago due to salt water contamination.""This plantation was launched in 2022 as part of a government initiative to improve food security,"" Dilshan said, with local authorities allocating land parcels.The method, known as sorjan, is similar to techniques used in Thailand and Indonesia.It reshapes flood-prone land by digging ponds where rice can be grown or fish raised, with more saline-tolerant coconut trees planted.Embankments around these ponds are used for more delicate crops.""We're tending to 360 coconut trees planted here... along with pumpkins, gourds and cucumbers,"" Dilshan said. ""In two and a half years, we'll know if it's a success or not.""""It's an efficient and climate-resilient production system that optimises land use and productivity, and increases farmers' profits,"" said Buddhi Marambe, from the University of Peradeniya.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a 2024 report that saltwater from seas and oceans affects 10.7 percent of the Earth's land, making it uncultivable in some cases.It travels up rivers with the tides, seeps into soil through evaporation, and contaminates groundwater used for irrigation.Climate change, which dries out the soil, reduces water resources, or raises sea levels, is expected to increase the proportion of such ""salty"" land from 24 percent to 32 percent of the world's surface area by the end of the century, the FAO predicts.These trends ""threaten agricultural productivity and reduce crop yields in affected zones"", it warns.Sri Lanka is no exception.Marambe estimates that 223,000 hectares (551,000 acres), half of which are rice paddies, are impacted by salinity -- nearly eight percent of the country's total arable land.South of the pilot plantation lies the village of Parappuwa, surrounded by abandoned land.Here, just a few kilometres from the sea, only a few small areas of the paddy fields are still in use.""Everything is polluted by salt that comes up during high tide,"" said Gamini Piyal Wijesinghe, 46, a farmer's son who, after he left the army, went into the restaurant business instead.He pointed to a stream where 18 small dams were built to stop the seawater.""They weren't constructed properly,"" he said. ""The water seeps through.""Other former rice farmers have turned to cinnamon or rubber cultivation.""Cinnamon is doing fairly well, but our income has significantly dropped since we stopped growing rice,"" said W.D. Jayaratne, 50, head of the local farmers' association.The future is gloomy.""Salinity in the water is increasing and threatening our farmland,"" he added. ""There are also insects. Everywhere you look, there are problems.""In this district of Kalutara, local authorities are offering abandoned land to farmers to bring it back under cultivation, mostly with coconut trees.""We've already allocated 400 hectares and plan to increase that to 1,000 in the next two years,"" said district chief Janaka Gunawardana.""There's high demand for coconut. It will create income for our people.""In Katukurunda, Aruna Priyankara Perera, 55, was encouraged by the success of the STF farming experiment.""I got five acres (two hectares) next to my hotel to replicate the STF's project,"" he said in front of his freshly planted coconut and pumpkin field.""The land is free for two years, provided you can show it's being cultivated.""Rice, the local staple, is a top concern for the authorities.""Soil salinity is a major issue in Sri Lanka,"" Marambe said. ""We've successfully tested several promising rice varieties that are resistant to salinity and flooding.""The stakes are high.A recent study of the Bentota river estuary, in the island's southwest, found that half of local rice farmers had lost all their income due to saltwater contamination.Even more serious, Sri Lanka's food security is now under threat. The last rice harvest, from September to March, was the country's lowest since 2019.""If we don't all roll up our sleeves to bring salt-polluted land back into cultivation and production,"" Marambe said, ""the future will only get darker.""",Sri Lankan commando-farmer team aims to reclaim rice paddies poisoned by salt.

Billionaires in retreat





King Charles III and former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have found themselves side by side, not in politics, but in pounds. Both are now worth an estimated £640 million, earning them the 238th spot on the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List , released Friday.The list, which tracks Britain’s 350 wealthiest individuals and families, reveals a dramatic reshuffling at the top, and signs of financial turbulence rippling through the elite.At 76, King Charles climbed 20 spots from last year, buoyed in part by surging profits from Crown Estate wind farm deals, which doubled returns and boosted the sovereign grant that funds royal activities. Still, most royal assets, including Buckingham Palace, remain off the books as they’re owned “in the right of the Crown,” not personally. His private wealth includes the Balmoral and Sandringham estates, along with an investment portfolio inherited from Queen Elizabeth II.Meanwhile, Sunak’s political exit hasn’t dented his bank balance too much. The former PM has taken up a part-time role at Stanford University and joined the lucrative Washington Speakers Bureau. His wife, Akshata Murty, continues to draw dividends from Infosys, £7.5 million last year, though the tech stock’s recent slide shaved off some value.Despite this, the couple’s fortunes rose just enough to push them up from last year’s 245th place.The Hinduja family holds the crown at the top for a fourth straight year, with an estimated £35.3 billion, even after a £2 billion dip. They’re followed by another Indian-born duo, David and Simon Reuben, who climbed to No. 2 with £26.87 billion.Lakshmi Mittal, the steel magnate behind ArcelorMittal, remains at No. 8 with £15.44 billion, while Anil Agarwal of Vedanta Resources sits at No. 25 with £7.5 billion. Also on the list: Prakash Lohia (No. 31, £6.02 bn), Mohsin and Zuber Issa of Asda and EG Group (No. 32, £6 bn), and Navin and Varsha Engineer (No. 48, £3.45 bn). The Arora brothers and Lord Swraj Paul are also among the top 100.But not everyone’s raking it in. The 2025 list saw the sharpest fall in billionaire numbers in its 37-year history, down to 156 from 165 last year.“This was one of the toughest editions to compile,” said list compiler Robert Watts, blaming Donald Trump’s tariffs and market volatility. “It’s the third straight year of collective wealth decline, and the biggest drop in UK billionaires we’ve ever recorded.”In an increasingly shaky economy, it seems even the richest aren’t immune. But for now, wind farms, Indian billionaires, and a former PM on the lecture circuit are holding their ground.","The Hinduja family holds the crown at the top for a fourth straight year, with an estimated £35.3 billion.

The New Labour Doctrine: Technocratic Populism

Risks and Pushback

Final Word: A New Track, But the Same Band







For the better part of a decade, the UK’s Labour Party had perfected the art of losing.Despite Brexit chaos, five Tory prime ministers, Boris Johnson’s Downing Street circus, Liz Truss ’s lettuce-inflicted collapse, a pandemic, and a brutal cost-of-living crisis, Labour remained stuck in opposition—haunted by its own ideological baggage and public mistrust. Voters flirted with them, but never committed. In fact, by the time the adult in the room (read: Rishi Sunak) took the helm, the British voters were fed up with the torrid Tories.Under Keir Starmer , Labour stormed back into power with 412 seats, ending 14 years of Conservative rule and delivering the party its most decisive mandate since Tony Blair. Starmer entered Downing Street promising “national renewal.”And ten months later, that renewal has a soundtrack.Once content to hum along to the liberal chorus of inclusivity and open borders, Labour under Starmer has flipped the record. If the party’s earlier stance on immigration echoed the hopeful tones of Led Zeppelin’s Immigrant Song—a rallying cry for arrival and adventure—Starmer has turned down the volume and remixed the track. The tone is no longer about crossing oceans. It’s about drawing lines.Nowhere is that clearer than in immigration, the policy area undergoing perhaps the most dramatic transformation of Starmer’s premiership.Gone is Labour’s open-armed approach. In its place: a tougher, technocratic, and unapologetically control-oriented stance that has redrawn the political centre ground. Starmer’s pivot on immigration isn’t just a shift—it’s a strategic reset of Labour’s governing DNA.In a blistering departure from the past, Starmer’s government has unveiled a sweeping overhaul of the UK’s immigration system—signalling a new era of pragmatism over idealism.His administration’s white paper, released in May 2025, laid out the most comprehensive set of immigration reforms in over a decade. Key features include:The closure of the overseas care worker visa route, despite warnings from the social care sector about staffing shortages. Graduate route visas shortened from two years to 18 months, signalling a clampdown on education-to-immigration pipelines. Employer penalties for sponsors who fail to ensure their visa holders comply with immigration rules.Each policy is calibrated to lower net migration, raise entry standards, and reduce dependency on foreign workers—without the theatrics often associated with right-wing immigration crackdowns. Starmer, once a cautious voice on the issue, is now crystal clear: control is back at the heart of UK immigration policy.Unlike his predecessors, Starmer isn’t relying solely on domestic tightening. He’s aggressively pursuing bilateral returns agreements—most prominently with Albania, a key transit point for irregular migration to the UK. This isn’t abstract diplomacy. The results are being posted—literally. Starmer’s own social media feed touts numbers:Labour governments of the past tiptoed around such figures. Starmer leads with them.The message is unmistakable: Labour is no longer the party of soft borders. It is the party of competent enforcement.Perhaps the most symbolic reform in the white paper is the expansion of English language requirements.Skilled migrants are now expected to speak fluent English. Adult dependents—often excluded from integration policy—are now required to meet basic linguistic benchmarks.Starmer has framed this not as exclusion, but as national cohesion.It’s a politically deft move. By focusing on language, Labour communicates a clear, values-based vision of integration—one that appeals across class and party lines.Labour’s pivot isn’t occurring in a vacuum. The political right, now fragmented between the remnants of the Conservatives and Farage-linked Reform UK, continues to press immigration as a defining issue. Nigel Farage , never one to miss a populist wave, has tried to frame Labour’s pivot as a political theft—but in truth, Starmer has simply executed what Farage only ever ranted about.Rather than ceding that ground, Starmer has planted a flag in it. His rhetoric—“take back control,” “deterrence at source,” “secure our borders”—could comfortably fit into a Conservative press release. But under Starmer, those slogans come with spreadsheets and statecraft, not slogans and scapegoats.What makes Starmer’s pivot effective isn’t just the toughness—it’s the tone. Where Boris Johnson offered theatre and Suella Braverman brought ideological warfare, Starmer offers cold clarity. He isn’t trying to rile the base. He’s trying to reassure the majority. That line—“further and faster”—has become the defining rhythm of Starmer’s government. It’s not a slogan. It’s a mission tempo.None of this is without friction.Trade unions and care sector leaders have criticised the loss of overseas recruitment channels. Universities fear a chilling effect on foreign student enrolments. Civil liberties groups have warned of the long-term consequences of hardening language tests and residency pathways.But crucially, there has been no internal revolt. Labour MPs may grumble in private, but few dare publicly challenge the Prime Minister’s line. Starmer holds the whip hand—and the voter trust.A party once paralysed by factionalism is now united under one doctrine: delivery over debate.Keir Starmer hasn’t just shifted Labour’s tone on immigration. He’s composed a new track entirely—tighter, sharper, less forgiving, more focused.If the party once played to the rhythm of globalism and open-door optimism, Starmer now conducts with statecraft and structure. The Immigrant Song may still be on the national playlist—but this version plays in a different key.This isn’t a betrayal of Labour’s soul. It’s an adaptation of its sound. A band playing to a different crowd—without skipping a beat.That’s not just a promise. It’s a tempo.And Keir Starmer is keeping time.","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has unveiled a sweeping overhaul of the UK’s immigration system.

"Extreme wind blamed for sinking of superyacht off Sicily last year, British probe says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/extreme-wind-blamed-for-sinking-of-superyacht-off-sicily-last-year-british-probe-says/articleshow/121185871.cms,"Hebo Lift 2 monitors the stretch of sea where the British superyacht Bayesian sunk (AP)





LONDON: The superyacht of British tech magnate Mike Lynch, which capsized last August off the coast of Sicily at the cost of seven lives, was knocked over by "" extreme wind "" and could not recover, British investigators said Thursday.Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the 56-meter (184 feet) Bayesian sank Aug. 19 last year. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch's acquittal in a fraud case in the US in June.In an interim report on the disaster, Britain's Marine Accident Investigation Branch said the boat was ""vulnerable"" to winds that were even lighter than the ones that tipped it over. The report was based on ""a limited amount of verified evidence"" as a criminal investigation by Italian authorities has restricted its access to the wreck and other pieces of evidence, it said.The agency, which is investigating the disaster because the Bayesian was registered in the U.K, said the ""vulnerabilities"" were ""unknown to either the owner or the crew,"" as they were not included in the stability information book carried on board.The report stated that the Bayesian was sailed to the site where it sank the day before in order to ""shelter"" from forecast thunderstorms. It said the disaster occurred at 4:06 a.m. local time, when wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.), ""violently"" knocking the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds,It said that at the time of the incident, the vessel was in a ""motoring condition"" with its sails lowered, while the centerboard, which is used to help stabilize it, was in a ""raised"" position.""You have the wind pushing the vessel over and then you have the stability of the vessel trying to push the vessel back up right again,"" said Simon Graves, an MAIB investigator. ""And what our studies found was that they show that the Bayesian may have been vulnerable to high winds and that these winds were likely to have been evident at the time of the accident.""Inquest proceedings in the UK are looking at the deaths of Lynch and his daughter, as well as Morgan Stanley International bank chairman Jonathan Bloomer, 70, and his wife, Judy Bloomer, 71, who were all British nationals.The others who died in the sinking were US lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife Neda Morvillo, and Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, who was working as a chef on the vessel.Fifteen people, including Lynch's wife, Angela Bacares, were rescued.A project to move the Bayesian into an upright position and lift it to the surface has been paused since May 9 when a diver died during underwater work. Recovery work is set to resume from Thursday.Further details such as ""escape routes"" will be included in the final report, according to Graves.""Once we get access to the vessel we'll be able to tell a fuller picture of activities on board and the sequence of events,"" he said.No date has been set for when the final report will be published.","Billionaire entrepreneur Mike Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank.
