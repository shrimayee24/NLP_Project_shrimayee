Under the leadership of chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami , prompt action is being ensured in cases of misconduct by government personnel. In line with this, the chairman of Uttarakhand peyjal nigam, Shailesh Bagauli, has suspended Sujeet Kumar Vikas, in-charge chief engineer (Kumaon), whose substantive post is superintending engineer, Uttarakhand peyjal nigam, Haldwani, with immediate effect for violation of the employee conduct code.As per the official order issued by the chairman of Uttarakhand peyjal nigam, a complaint was received from Sanjay Kumar, son of Chandrapal Singh, stating that he works on water supply projects on a contractual basis.

India tests nuclear-capable Agni-1 & Prithvi-2 ballistic missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tests-nuclear-capable-agni-1-prithvi-2-ballistic-missiles/articleshow/122720740.cms,"India test-fires Prithvi-II & Agni-1 ballistic missiles (ANI)

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday conducted successive tests of short-range nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, the Prithvi-2 and Agni-1, in what constitutes some strategic deterrence messaging to Pakistan soon after the intense cross-border hostilities under Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10.The Prithvi-2 (350-km strike range) and Agni-1 (700-km) missiles were launched from the integrated test range at Chandipur, off the Odisha coast, by the tri-service strategic forces command (SFC). “The launches validated all operational and technical parameters,” the defence ministry said in a brief statement on Thursday night.An official described the tests as “periodic routine trials” of already inducted missiles conducted by the SFC, which was established in 2003 to handle the country’s nuclear arsenal. But it’s possibly the first time that two such nuclear-capable missiles have been tested together on the same day.Both these missiles are Pakistan-specific, while the others like Agni-2 (2,000-km), Agni-3 (3,000-km) and the near ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) Agni-5 (over 5,000-km) are largely geared towards China.DRDO and the SFC have also been conducting “pre-induction night trials” of the new-generation Agni-Prime ballistic missile, which has a strike range from 1,000 to 2,000-km, which will gradually replace the Agni-1 and Agni-2 missiles in the country’s nuclear arsenal.The solid-fuelled Agni-Prime is the smallest and lightest among the entire Agni series of ballistic missiles and incorporates new propulsion systems and composite rocket motor casings as well as advanced navigation and guidance systems.The Agni-Prime, significantly, is also a canister-launch system like the Agni-V, which brings even the northernmost parts of China under its strike envelope, and the two together will add more teeth to India’s nuclear deterrence posture. Both these missiles are in the process of being inducted into the SFC, with new regiments being raised for them, as reported by TOI earlier.Canister-launch missiles - with the warheads already mated with the missiles - give the SFC the requisite operational flexibility to store them for long periods, swiftly transport them through rail or road when required, and fire them from wherever they want.The Agni-5 was also tested with multiple warheads (MIRVs or multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles) for the first time on March 11 last year. Once inducted in a few years more, this MIRVed missile will be capable of delivering three to four warheads at different targets separated by hundreds of kilometres.China, of course, is leagues ahead. It is adding around 100 nuclear warheads every year to its existing stockpile of 600 warheads, while deploying ICBMs like the DongFeng-5 and DF-41 with ranges over 12,000-km. India, in turn, has 180 warheads and Pakistan 170, as per the latest assessment by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI).","The Prithvi-2 (350-km strike range) and Agni-1 (700-km) missiles were launched from the integrated test range at Chandipur, off the Odisha coast.

Elusive warbler spotted in Ladakh after 46-year gap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/elusive-warbler-spotted-in-ladakh-after-46-year-gap/articleshow/122708065.cms,"Elusive warbler

TOI

At an elevation of 3,200 metres, Ladakh’s rugged mountain sweep in the backdrop, a group of five sat huddled and listened intently to the ‘click-clickclick’ captured in a recording. The insect-like call was proof that one of the most elusive bird species they had come looking for was there.Visual proof came soon enough, making July 15 the day when a conﬁrmed sighting of the long-billed bush warbler would be recorded after 46 years, in a thicket in Kargil’s Suru Valley.The last time the bird (Locustella Major) was seen was also in Ladakh in 1979, when a group of birders from Southampton University were on a tour (1977-80) to chronicle avian fauna. Between 1979 and now, one more sighting of the longbilled bush warbler was documented when ornithologist James Eaton spotted it in Naltar Valley of GilgitBaltistan in 2023.The current expedition by ﬁve birders – Harish Thangaraj, Lt Gen Bhupesh Goyal, Manjula Desai, Rigzin Nubu and Irfan Jeelani — was planned speciﬁcally to spot this warbler.Team leader Thangaraj toldthe group “has years and years of experience sighting birds” and “what we are now looking for are ‘lost birds’ – that were spotted decades ago but were never seen since”.This Feb, the group had made another expedition in search of the bird but failed to spot it. “We searched in Gurez and Tulail valleys at altitudes between 2,400m and 2,800m. But it yielded no results, possibly because of altitude mismatch,” Thangaraj said, referring to the Gilgit-Baltistan sighting, which was at a higher reach.After the unsuccessful attempt, the group stepped up research and got in touch with Eaton. It was the Malaysia-based American ornithologist who steered them on the right path – in this case, near terraced ﬁelds surrounded by rumex and gooseberry shrubs at Sankoo in Suru. “The bird was found in a willow amidst terraced ﬁelds. It’s the ﬁrst time it has been seen on a willow, which will now be added to its known habitats,” Thangaraj told TOI .At 3,200 metres, this is also the highest recorded altitude at which the bird has been seen. Classiﬁed as ‘near threatened’ by International Union for Conservation of Nature, long-billed bush warblers were commonly seen in Ladakh and GilgitBaltistan till the 1930s. In the decades since, birding expeditions were sparse. In 2015, Eaton wrote, birder Shashank Dalvi sighted two warblers in Suru, but it was too brief for him to take a picture. “Expansion of settlements combined with climate change, could be pushing the birds to go higher,” Thangaraj said.Pankaj Gupta, a Delhi Bird Society member who was not part of the expedition, said the “rediscovery” of the bird is “nothing short of extraordinary”. “It reminds us how much remains hidden in our fragmented landscapes, and how urgent it is to protect these last remaining pockets of wilderness,” Gupta said.","The long-billed bush warbler was last seen in Ladakh in 1979. The bird was found in a willow amidst terraced ﬁelds. At 3,200 metres, this is also the highest recorded altitude at which the bird has been seen.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122708098,imgsize-35798,width-400,resizemode-4/122708098.jpg"
My rate vs your rate: Govt vs central banks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/my-rate-vs-your-rate-govt-vs-central-banks/articleshow/122707532.cms,"Trump on powell

Trump dissing Fed chief Powell is new only to the extent that the former is rude. Plenty of govt bosses, in the West or in India, have had a go at chiefs of central banks. Govts like cheap money, it’s feel-good.

Central banks hate inflation. There lies the tension

‘CRAZY’, ‘LOCO’

INTERESTED PARTIES

NIXON WAS WORSE

INDEPENDENCE DAYS

Ex-US President Nixon

TUSSLE CONTINUES

Ex-RBI governors

Jerome Powell may still be a marked man. Trump now says he won’t sack him. But you never know with Trump. He called Powell “Too Late” for dithering in the face of the 2022 inflation surge. Also, “low IQ”, “very stupid”, “average mentally person”, and declared, “I think he’s doing a terrible job.” Yet, Trump is at a loss: “I do it every way in the book. I’m nasty. I’m nice. Nothing works.”Now, Trump’s aides are trying a pincer over the alleged $700mn cost overrun in the Fed building’s renovation that might let them pin Powell to the mat in his last year as Fed chair. Or not. Powell, after all, has been here before.When Trump picked Powell over Janet Yellen late in 2017, he was, in the President’s words: “strong, committed, smart”, someone who would provide the Fed “the leadership it needs in the years to come”.But six months into his first term, he was already out of favour.A non-economist — Powell’s a lawyer by training — he was expected to toe Trump’s line on interest rates. Basically, keep interest rates low to spur growth, boost stock prices, and ensure Trump’s re-election in 2020. Powell turned out to have a spine, and by Aug 2018 Trump was calling the Fed “crazy”, “loco”, “gone wild”. He told The Wall Street Journal: “(Powell) was supposed to be a low-interestrate guy. It’s turned out that he’s not. ”The crux of the Trump-Powell feud is the cost of money, or interest rates. Govts universally want money to be cheap, so that businesses don’t hesitate to borrow for expansion. Expanding businesses add jobs, GDP grows, stock markets zoom, and everybody lives happily ever after.However, cheap money can also drive up prices, or inflation, and when things cost more, people buy less, so businesses put off expansion. And if demand falls too much, jobs are lost, and everybody is miserable.So, central banks universally aim to keep price rise in check with interest rates. But because interest rates, unlike Schrodinger’s cat, can’t be in two states — high and low, in this case — at the same time, govts and central bankers with a spine must agree to disagree.History repeats itself. In 1969, Nixon picked Arthur Burns to head the Fed. Like Trump, he believed Burns would prove pliant, and just to be sure he told him: “I know there’s the myth of the autonomous Fed…” To ensure everyone else also got this, he declared at Burns’s swearing-in: “I respect his independence. However, I hope that, independently, he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed.”Nixon wanted low rates with an eye on the 1972 election, and we know from the “Nixon tapes” that he told Burns in Oct 1971: “Liquidity problem (too much money in the system)... is just bullshit”. Burns obliged. His rate cut stimulated the economy in the short term and handed Nixon a landslide victory, but then caused an inflation problem that lasted a decade, and became the strongest argument for central bank independence (CBI).Central banks like RBI and the US Fed are a relatively recent development. Before WW-2, they were merely the lenders of last resort. After the war, setting interest rates became their job, but with plenty of govt interference. In India, RBI governor Benegal Rama Rau quit in 1957 after a face-off with finance minister T T Krishnamachari. During the Vietnam war, President Johnson summoned the Fed chair to his ranch and criticised the prevailing monetary policy.Even Milton Friedman, who coined the term ‘central bank independence’ in 1962, wasn’t in favour of all-powerful central banks. He wanted govt to set central bank objectives, and banks to attain them using policy instruments like interest rates — without further interference. CBI was important for central banks to function without fear of criticism from a man like Trump, especially since there’s a lag between policy implementation and results.Over a century from 1923, CBI has risen around the world. Trinity College professor Davide Romelli’s analysis shows 370 banking reforms across 155 countries — 279 of these increased CBI and 91 reduced it. Globally, the CBI index rose from 0.35 in the 1970s to 0.6 by 2020.That’s why Trump, when he brought “independent” govt agencies under his thumb with an executive order, made it clear that “This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy.”Still, the old tussle for control over monetary policy continues. The Chidambaram-Subbarao standoff over interest rates in 2012, RBI governor Urjit Patel’s resignation in 2018, resignations of two Argentine central bank chiefs — Martin Redrado in 2010 and Juan Carlos Fabrega in 2014 (Luis Caputo’s 2018 resignation was under IMF pressure) — and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe’s choice of a “like-minded” central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, in 2013, are all examples of govt’s upper hand.But govt assertiveness over central banks takes a toll on stocks and bonds. For example, the S&P 500 dipped 2.4% when Trump called Powell a “major loser” in April. That’s why he can’t use a hammer to dislodge the Fed chief. What he can do is try to pry Powell off with a screwdriver, and that’s what he’s doing.","Jerome Powell may still be a marked man. Trump now says he won’t sack him. But you never know with Trump.

I can’t accept payment by UPI anymore,” Shankar, a shopkeeper in Horamavu told ET.According to vendors, lawyers and accountants, thousands of unregistered small businesses, including street food stalls, push carts and corner shops, have received GST notices. Some face demands running into lakhs of rupees.Advocate Vinay K Sreenivasa, joint secretary of the Federation of Bengaluru Street Vendors Associations, said many vendors fear harassment by GST officers and possible eviction by civic authorities, prompting them to switch to cash.Under the current GST framework, businesses supplying goods must register and pay GST if their annual turnover exceeds Rs 40 lakh. For service providers, the threshold is Rs 20 lakh.The commercial taxes department stated that notices were issued only in cases where UPI transaction data since 2021-22 indicated turnover levels that require GST registration. It said such businesses must register, disclose their taxable turnover, and pay the applicable tax.However, HD Arun Kumar, former additional commissioner of commercial taxes in Karnataka, said GST authorities cannot simply quote random figures as turnover. “Under the GST laws, the burden of proof is on officers. They must establish it before arriving at a tax demand, unlike in money laundering cases,” he said.Opposition BJP MLA S Suresh Kumar said he plans to write to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah seeking his intervention.A former GST field official pointed out that not all UPI credits reflect business income. “Some of it would be informal loans or transfers from family and friends,” he said.“Bengaluru may emerge as a test case. If the GST authorities can net a good chunk of revenue by tapping unregistered vendors, other states too will take the cue as every state is desperate for funds,” said chartered accountant Sreenivasan Ramakrishnan of Sreeni & Associates.“Officials have zeroed in on chat vendors with high business in Mumbai. It's only a matter of time considering the huge potential tax base,” he told ET.Karnataka’s tax officials are under pressure to meet a collection target of Rs 1.20 lakh crore for 2025-26. CM Siddaramaiah is grappling with the twin demands of funding Rs 52,000 crore worth of welfare guarantees and responding to pressure from Congress MLAs seeking funds for infrastructure.","Bengaluru, once hailed as a tech capital, switching QR codes with physical currency.

‘Safe harbour’ not an absolute right, but a privilege contingent upon strict adherence to statutory duties: Govt

NEW DELHI: The Centre told Karnataka high court Thursday that allowing the proliferation of unlawful content on social media in the name of free speech endangered democracy, and accused Elon Musk-owned X of attempting to escape accountability by taking shelter under the IT Act’s ‘safe harbour’ protection.Questioning the US-based company’s locus standi to move an Indian HC for protection of fundamental rights, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the constitutional protection to freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a) must not be misunderstood as absolute protection for unlawful content.“Constitutional jurisprudence clearly differentiates between protected speech that contributes meaningfully to democratic discourse and unlawful speech that undermines societal stability and individual rights,” it said.It said the ‘safe harbour’ provision, which protects social media platforms from liability for content posed by their users, was a privilege available only to those internet intermediaries which were responsible.X had moved HC seeking to restrain govt departments from taking coercive action against it and its officials for the content on the microblogging site and said, “Unlawful and unjustified orders harm the X platform and its ability to operate.The issuance of information blocking orders without following due process of law, and in violation of IT Act and the Constitution, violates X’s right to equality under Article 14 and detrimentally impacts its business. ”In written submissions before HC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Proliferation of what can be termed as unlawful content on social media platforms poses an unprecedented threat to public discourse, democracy and societal stability.”“Social media intermediaries possess an unparalleled ability to amplify information instantaneously, without traditional barriers like language or geographical limitations, and thus carry significant responsibilities,” the law officer said.Advent of the internet, social media and digital intermediaries had fundamentally altered the character and scale of human communication, demanding a re-examination and suitable tailoring of constitutional standards, Mehta said, adding India’s internet subscriber base had grown from 25 crore in 2013-14 to 97 crore in Sept 2024.The govt’s stand that ‘safe harbour’ does not mean blanket immunity can have implications for all social media platforms. This also rhymes with the growing call for repeal of Section 230 of US's Communications Decency Act from which social media giants derive the immunity.The Centre said ‘safe harbour’ protection for internet intermediaries was not an unconditional entitlement but a privilege contingent upon strict adherence to statutory duties. While committing to full protection of the right to free speech, the govt said, “The question raised by X cannot be examined merely from the prism of the person using this medium.“The concept of ‘safe harbour’ inherently includes rigorous responsibilities, requiring intermediaries to promptly and effectively remove or disable unlawful content upon receiving notice. These safeguards are deliberately designed to balance innovation with accountability, ensuring intermediaries do not become platforms for unlawful activities.”The govt said X’s attempt was to present ‘safe harbour’ as an absolute right, devoid of any corresponding duties. “Such a stand fundamentally misconstrues the very basis of this legal protection. ‘Safe harbour’ is not a constitutional guarantee but a statutory privilege, specifically designed to foster responsible conduct,” it said.It told HC that X had confused itself with the play of Sections 69A and 79 of the IT Act. It said Section 69A pertains explicitly to govt orders for blocking content with serious penal consequences for non-compliance whereas Section 79 deals with due diligence obligations to maintain ‘safe harbour’ protection.The Centre said X purposefully blurred the clear distinction to escape accountability for its statutory duties. It said social media platforms use ‘amplification’ mechanisms to push visibility of a particular type of view.“The algorithms used by intermediaries actively curate and boost content, shaping public opinion and significantly influencing social harmony or disorder. This active role demands heightened accountability, necessitating robust regulation specifically tailored for social media, distinct from traditional media,” the Centre further said.",The Centre told Karnataka high court Thursday that allowing the proliferation of unlawful content on social media in the name of free speech endangered democracy.

NEW DELHI: The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) on Wednesday raised serious concerns over the preliminary findings and public commentary surrounding the crash of Air India Flight AI171, which went down in Ahmedabad shortly after takeoff en route to London.In an official statement, the FIP said, ""We register our dissatisfaction with the exclusion of pilot representatives from the investigation process. We also firmly object to how the preliminary report has been interpreted and presented publicly.""The federation criticised the report for lacking comprehensive data and relying heavily on ""selectively paraphrased cockpit voice recordings"" that appear to imply pilot error and question the competence of the flight crew. ""This approach is neither objective nor complete,"" the FIP said, urging members and the public not to draw conclusions prematurely.""Assigning blame before a thorough, transparent, and data-driven investigation is both premature and irresponsible. Such speculative commentary undermines the professionalism of highly trained crew members and causes undue distress to their families and colleagues,"" the statement added.The 15-page preliminary report, released a month after the crash, outlines initial findings from the accident that claimed 240 lives out of the 241 people on board.

India warns West on energy security double standards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-warns-west-on-energy-security-double-standards/articleshow/122674405.cms,"Petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri

NEW DELHI: India can arrange alternative supplies if Russian oil exports are sanctioned, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Thursday in what is seen as the first official reaction to the US and EU threat of secondary sanctions for buying those barrels.“India has diversified the sources (of oil). I am not worried at all. If something happens, we will deal with it. There is sufficient supply available,” Puri said at an industry event.Separately, the foreign ministry said govt’s overriding priority was to secure the energy needs of its people, while also cautioning against any double standards on the issue.The comments, in response to media queries, followed NATO chief Mark Rutte’s threat, echoing the US, that countries like India, China and Brazil would take a battering for buying Russian exports.“Let me reiterate, and I have said this in the past as well. Securing energy needs of our people is understandably an overriding priority for us,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.“In this endeavour, we are guided by what is there on offer in the markets, as also by the prevailing global circumstances. We would particularly caution against any double standards on the matter,” he added. India has in the past too accused the West of having double standards on the issue, saying that European countries have themselves benefited from importing Russian energy for prolonged periods.Puri said India has built up “navigational resilience” by expanding the sourcing of oil from 40 countries against 27 countries earlier. “India has been clear that it will buy oil from wherever it has to. The prime minister’s commitment, in the final analysis, is to the Indian consumer,” he said.In addition, Puri said, more oil was coming into the global market from countries such as Brazil, Guyana and Canada that are not members of the OPEC+ grouping. “If a major source goes off the market, you diversify.

5.8% Bihar voters yet to submit poll forms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-8-bihar-voters-yet-to-submit-poll-forms/articleshow/122692818.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Only 45.8 lakh voters, or 5.8% of Bihar’s 7.9 crore electorate, are yet to submit their enumeration forms as part of the ongoing SIR of electoral rolls in state, with eight days to go before the July 25 deadline. EC Thursday said close to 7.1 crore or 89.7% forms have been submitted, while 4.5% electors were not found at their addresses, possibly on account of being deceased, permanently shifted or enrolled at multiple places.The details of electors not found at their recorded addresses, even after three mandatory visits by BLOs, will be shared with district presidents and booth level agents of political parties from Friday onwards to confirm the exact status of such electors before the July 25 deadline for submitting enumeration forms.All electors whose enumeration forms are received before July 25 will figure in the draft electoral roll to be published on Aug 1. Any elector can also check the status of their enumeration form either on ECINet app or on EC’s voters’ portal.EC continues to reach out to temporary migrants working or living outside Bihar, urging them to fill enumeration forms online using their mobile phones, through ECINet app or https://voters.eci.gov.in.They can also download the pre-filled enumeration form and share their filled forms with BLOs directly or through family via WhatsApp or any other medium, it said Thursday.EC will be filing its response in SC by July 21 to its direction to consider including Aadhaar , EPIC No. and ration card in the list of documents accepted as part of SIR. Interestingly, as reported by TOI earlier, EPIC is pre-printed on the enumeration form of each of the 7.9 crore electors in Bihar; the form also has a field seeking Aadhaar number, though furnishing the same is optional for the elector.","Only 45.8 lakh voters, or 5.8% of Bihar’s 7.9 crore electorate, are yet to submit their enumeration forms.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Home Minister Ashish Sood on Thursday alleged that AAP leaders Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia purchased several top‑of‑the‑line mobile phones on government funds.Citing a 2013 government circular that allows the chief minister and ministers to buy phones worth up to Rs 50,000 and Rs 45,000 respectively, Sood showed documents that suggested Kejriwal bought an iPhone 6s Plus for Rs 81,000 in 2015, an iPhone 7 Plus for Rs 69,000 in 2017, an iPhone 12 Pro Max worth Rs 1.39 lakh during the Covid period in 2020, and an iPhone 13 Pro Max for Rs 1.63 lakh in July 2022.He further said Manish Sisodia had purchased five expensive handsets between 2017 and 2022, including Samsung Galaxy S8 models costing nearly Rs 60,000 and iPhones priced between Rs 1.12 lakh and Rs 1.66 lakh. Former minister Atishi too allegedly bought a phone for Rs 1.27 lakh in 2023, though the entitled reimbursement was only Rs 45,000.Delhi CM Rekha Gupta also weighed in with a poetic jibe on social media. She wrote, “AAP’s cap was hiding a whole market — every move filled with scams! They bought costly phones for themselves, now the truth is out so smile! The truth fears no one, and this matter will be investigated.”The allegations from the Delhi BJP come after AAP criticised the recent move by the Delhi government that raises the stipulated limit for purchase of mobile phones by the chief minister and ministers to Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 1.25 lakh respectively.The party accused the BJP of neglecting women’s monthly support schemes and instead spending public money on luxury phones and extra staff for MLAs.The Aam Aadmi Party rebutted the allegations by Sood, calling them ""false"" and a “political sabotage” aimed at derailing the previous government’s welfare initiatives. AAP Delhi president Saurabh Bharadwaj pointed out that the BJP had failed on its promises to the people of Delhi and was now targeting opposition leaders with “smokescreen” charges.","Delhi Home Minister Ashish Sood alleged that AAP leaders Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia purchased several top‑of‑the‑line mobile phones on government funds.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A 16-year legal battle over toddy strength has ended with Kerala revising the permissible alcohol content in the popular coconut palm beverage to 8.98% v/v, replacing the 2007 cap of 8.1% that triggered prolonged litigation.The decision comes after a SC directive on May 1 last year in a special leave petition filed by Komalan, a former toddy shop licensee.The 2007 limit, imposed citing public health concerns, sparked a legal fight beginning with a Kerala HC writ petition and culminating in the apex court. SC asked the state to conduct a scientific study and revisit its policy. Komalan cited a Kerala University study recommending a 9.59% limit. The state initially rejected that, warning higher levels could indicate adulteration with spirit or arrack. The chief chemical examiner and Bureau of Indian Standards backed the 8.1% cap, while research by Coconut Research Institute’s former director R Child showed toddy could naturally reach 8.1% after 33 hours of fermentation.An expert panel later reviewed samples statewide and global literature. It recommended the 8.98% limit, now adopted. A gazette notification is expected soon. The decision is seen as a boost to the traditional toddy sector.","Kerala revises the permissible alcohol content in the popular coconut palm beverage to 8.98% v/v, replacing the 2007 cap of 8.1% that triggered prolonged litigation.

(With PTI inputs)

PATNA: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar announced Thursday 125 units of free electricity, unwrapping a potential no-bill bonanza ahead of assembly polls for an estimated 91% of households which consume less than the threshold. The move follows promises of 200 units of free electricity by rival and former deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav of RJD, which leads opposition INDIA bloc in the state.Nitish made the announcement through his official social media handle. “All domestic consumers will get 100% subsidy on 125 units of power from Aug 1... It will benefit 1.67 crore families,” he said.Bihar has around 1.82 crore power consumers, deputy CM Samrat Choudhary of BJP revealed at a press conference later. “Among these households, an estimated 1.67 crore (91%) are known to consume less than 125 units. They will enjoy a golden time as a result of the CM’s announcement,” he said.As per the deputy CM, the benefits will cost the state an additional Rs 3,000 crore. “So far, govt has been bearing an annual expenditure of about Rs 16,000 crore for power subsidy. The new scheme will raise the amount to more than Rs 19,000 crore,” said Choudhary, who is also the state’s finance minister.To mitigate the financial impact of free power, Nitish announced that govt will promote solar energy through two schemes where a 50% central subsidy was provided for rooftop solar panels and associated equipment. Choudhary said the state intended to achieve a target of 10,000MW solar power in next three years, tapping PM’s Surya Ghar Yojana. Reminded about NDA’s earlier stand of ‘no freebies’, Choudhary said “we are not using the word free (muft). It is a 100% subsidy.”","The move follows promises of 200 units of free electricity by rival Tejashwi Yadav of RJD.

NEW DELHI: The SIR exercise in Bihar and the issue of official documents like voter ID and Aadhaar card being obtained by alleged infiltrators figured in Public Accounts Committee (PAC) meeting Thursday, with several BJP MPs expressing concern over benefits of welfare schemes being availed by ineligible people.The PAC, headed by Congress MP K C Venugopal, also deliberated on “functioning of UIDAI”, with a few members suggesting a simpler procedure to effect changes in erroneous Aadhaar details, which deny people access to what’s their due, including govt benefits.“Documents like voter ID and Aadhaar are given to citizens and not residents... The matter was raised and a suggestion made that ineligible cardholders should be identified,” a senior member said, citing the process until 2023 under which a certificate from panchayat head was enough to procure Aadhaar or voter ID.A few members said Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Bihar was an exercise being conducted in earnest, as it is in interest of the country if the ineligible are identified. BJP MPs Ravi Shankar Prasad, Nishikant Dubey, Anurag Thakur, Tejaswi Surya, L Laxman, and Congress’ Jai Prakash and Shaktisinh Gohil were among those who attended the meeting. The BJP MPs said a large number of ineligible people, especially suspected infiltrators, had obtained the unique identity before the application rules were made stringent and sought a review of their bona fides, sources said.An MP claimed Aadhaar serves as “backdoor” entry for people with suspect citizenship to get a raft of official documents, including voter ID and passport, while others spoke of the presence of alleged infiltrators in Karnataka, Bihar and Jharkhand.Sources said some MPs were of the view that since Aadhaar is considered a residency proof and does not certify Indian citizenship, authorities need to reconsider if it alone should be the basis for identifying people eligible for welfare schemes. Without getting into details of the committee’s deliberations, Venugopal said Aadhaar is a “common man issue” and many questions had been raised and suggestions made.At the meeting, attended by officials of ministry of electronics and information technology and UIDAI, a few members highlighted difficulties faced by Aadhaar cardholders in redress of their gri-evances, as at times biometric details do not match for a variety of reasons, or other details are erroneous.","BJP MPs expressed concern over benefits of welfare schemes being availed by ineligible people.

RAIPUR: A husband cannot demand access to his spouse’s personal information or communication as that would amount to infringement of privacy, Chhattisgarh high court has ruled, dismissing a man’s plea seeking the call detail records (CDR) of his wife.Asserting that privacy is a constitutionally protected right under Article 21 that marriage cannot override, the court said forcing the wife to share her phone call or bank account details could even attract domestic violence charges.“Marriage does not grant the husband automatic access to the wife’s private information, communications and personal belongings. The husband cannot compel his wife to share her passwords for the cellphone or bank account, and such an act would amount to a violation of privacy and potentially domestic violence. There should be a balance between marital privacy and the need for transparency and, at the same time, trust in the relationship,” Justice Rakesh Mohan Pandey said, upholding a Durg family court’s order.The first additional principal judge of family court had in June last year rejected his application for his wife’s CDR.He argued his wife frequently spoke to her brother-in-law for long periods, suggesting a possible illicit relationship.","Chhattisgarh high court dismisses a man's plea seeking the call detail records (CDR) of his wife.

NEW DELHI: The US embassy in India has warned that “committing assault, theft, or burglary in the United States won’t just cause you legal issues — it could lead to your visa being revoked and make you ineligible for future US visas”. The warning was issued days after a video of an Indian woman who tried to leave a store with a cart full of items without paying went viral. This also prompted the embassy to say, “The US values law and order and expects foreign visitors to follow all US laws.”Responding to queries on the issue, the ministry of external affairs said that “whether a person is living in any country—whether they are a citizen of that country or a foreign national—it is their responsibility to abide by the laws there”. “I would say that whenever our people go abroad, we always urge them to respect and follow the laws of that country, so that they can build a good and positive image for themselves, and through them, also project a good image of our country,” ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.The Indian woman had spent several hours in the store of a famous chain on May 1.

Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and Chief People Officer Kristin Cabot have ignited a social media firestorm after being caught on the jumbotron during a Coldplay concert in Boston. The footage, which shows the pair in a close embrace during the event's “kiss cam” segment, has gone viral—sparking widespread speculation about an alleged affair between the two married executives.Neither Byron nor Cabot has responded publicly, and Astronomer has issued no official statement. Online reactions have been swift and unforgiving, with attention now turning to the company’s leadership culture, the response (or lack thereof) from those involved, and the impact on the CEO’s family.At a Coldplay concert on July 16 at Gillette Stadium, Byron and Cabot were caught by the stadium’s “kiss cam.” As the jumbotron focused on them, Byron held Cabot from behind as both smiled awkwardly. The moment became even more charged when Coldplay frontman Chris Martin joked, “Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy.” That single comment turned an awkward moment into a fullblown internet scandal.The short clip of the encounter racked up over 34 million views across TikTok, Twitter, and Reddit. Dubbed “ColdplayGate,” the video has triggered a flood of reactions, with viewers slamming the pair for perceived impropriety.The rapid viral spread also saw memes and Coldplaylyric puns dominate LinkedIn comments and social media posts mocking Byron.Amid the uproar, attention turned to Byron’s wife, Megan Kerrigan Byron. Social media users flooded her Facebook account with comments, prompting her to first remove “Byron” from her profile and then delete the account entirely. Online, many expressed sympathy, describing her as the ""real victim"" of the incident. She has made no public statement.The incident has reignited claims of a “toxic” work environment at Astronomer. Viewers identified a third employee, Alyssa Stoddard, smiling knowingly in the video. She had recently been promoted by Cabot, raising questions about internal favouritism and blurred boundaries in the company’s leadership culture.Following a barrage of critical comments—including Coldplaythemed jabs like “Lights did not guide Andy home”—Andy Byron disabled comments on all LinkedIn posts and eventually deleted his entire profile. Screenshots of these comments, however, continue to circulate widely, fuelling ongoing ridicule.Despite the widespread attention, Astronomer has remained silent. The company has turned off comments on its social media accounts, and no official statement has been issued by Byron, Cabot, or the board. This silence has only intensified public criticism and raised further questions about accountability.The Coldplay frontman’s comment—“Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy”—added fuel to the fire. Martin’s reaction, combined with the couple’s visible discomfort on camera, led to increased speculation. Coldplay’s official X account later joked about “camerafree sections for people and their sidepieces,” adding to the virality.Internet users uncovered that Cabot also goes by the name Kristin Thornby and may be married to Kenneth C. Thornby, though her current marital status remains unclear. Meanwhile, Byron is confirmed to be married with two children and owns a home near the concert venue. His family’s privacy has become collateral damage in the scandal.Several exemployees have taken the opportunity to criticise Byron’s leadership. One described him as “toxic” and “salesobsessed,” with others calling the public fallout “karmic justice.” Allegations of highpressure work environments and personal misconduct have resurfaced from his previous role at Cybereason.Adding to the scandal’s reach, Elon Musk responded to a viral fake apology statement with a laughing emoji on X. Meanwhile, Astronomer cofounder Ry Walker publicly distanced himself, clarifying he left the company in 2022 and is uninvolved in current operations. The company’s future now faces significant reputational risk as the saga unfolds.","Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and Chief People Officer Kristin Cabot have ignited a social media firestorm after being caught on the jumbotron during a Coldplay concert.

Originally the 19th overall pick in 2022 by the Timberwolves , he was immediately traded to Memphis and later moved again to Sacramento before entering free agency this summer. He’s long been considered a prototypical “3-and-D” wing—a role modern NBA teams highly prize.During the 2024–25 season, split between the Grizzlies and Kings, LaRavia posted:- 66 appearances- 6.9 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game- An efficient 47.5% field goal shooting, including 42.3% from beyond the arcDespite these solid shooting splits, Jake LaRavia hasn’t yet established himself as a regular starter or high-impact contributor.The Los Angeles Lakers made LaRavia their first major free agent signing, handing him a fully guaranteed two-year deal worth $12 million—slightly above the taxpayer mid-level exception.That contract immediately triggered a hard cap for LA, significantly tightening their financial flexibility.This move also filled the roster spot vacated by Dorian Finney-Smith, who left for Houston on a four-year, $53 million deal. While Finney-Smith brought more experience and defensive pedigree, the Los Angeles Lakers opted for youth and upside.However, several league executives and commentators have ranked LaRavia’s deal among the least valuable of the summer, criticizing the contract’s size relative to the player’s career output.- Overpay for a Role Player: Critics say $6 million annually is too much for someone who has yet to prove himself as more than a rotational piece.- Cap Space Consequences: Triggering the hard cap for a relatively unproven player has many questioning the Los Angeles Lakers’ cap management strategy.- Better Alternatives Ignored: Some analysts argue that more experienced, playoff-tested wings were available at comparable or even lower price tags.A Western Conference executive summed it up bluntly: “The Lakers may have paid top dollar for a player best suited as an eighth or ninth man on a contender, rather than a key contributor.”And another insider noted: “It’s a classic gamble on upside, but the cost could handcuff LA’s front office if LaRavia fails to break out next season.”Despite criticism, LA sees significant potential in Jake LaRavia. His youth, size, and ability to knock down threes offer qualities the front office values under new head coach JJ Redick.Rob Pelinka, Los Angeles Lakers president of basketball operations, defended the move: “Jake is a high-IQ two-way player… We think Jake has significant basketball upside, which will be honed nicely in our Lakers basketball development program.”From a team-building standpoint, LaRavia helps address two long-standing issues: three-point shooting and defensive versatility. At just 23, the Lakers believe there’s plenty of room for growth—and they’re betting he’ll flourish in their system.To better understand the skepticism, here’s how LaRavia stacks up against similar players signed this offseason:While Jake LaRavia boasts a better shooting percentage than both Finney-Smith and Reddish, his overall production and impact still leave much to be desired.Also read: Damian Lillard Returns to Portland Trail Blazers on Three-Year, $42 Million Deal Featuring No-Trade Clause The Los Angeles Lakers’ acquisition of Jake LaRavia is a high-stakes play on future development. With limited experience but promising shooting, he could emerge as a key floor-spacer in Redick’s system—or end up as a costly misfire that limits LA’s options moving forward. Whether this deal becomes a savvy investment or a cautionary tale in cap management will depend entirely on LaRavia’s growth in the seasons ahead. For now, the spotlight is firmly on him as one of the most debated contracts of the summer.","Jake LaRavia has agreed to a two-year, $12 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.

Federal Reserve System controversy: Jerome Powell denies extravagant spending; refutes claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-reserve-system-controversy-jerome-powell-denies-extravagant-spending-refutes-claims/articleshow/122706140.cms,"Russ Vought (Image: X) and Jerome Powell (AP image)





Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sent a letter on Thursday to White House Budget Director Russ Vought, responding to allegations that he mismanaged the renovation of the Federal Reserve Board’s Eccles Building and the 1951 Constitution Avenue facility.The letter comes amid growing speculation that the Trump administration may seek to remove Powell, using the renovation issue as a possible justification.Last week, Vaught alleged that the renovation included extravagant features such as rooftop gardens, luxury elevators, fountains and premium marble. In a letter, he said the project was under investigation and criticised its growing cost.“As explained on the Board’s public website, we take seriously the responsibility to be good stewards of public resources as we fulfill the duties given to us by Congress on behalf of the American people,” Powell wrote in his letter to Vought. Firmly rejecting the claim, he clarified the facts.He explained that there are no rooftop gardens. The term ""garden terrace"" appeared in one planning document, but it refers only to a standard green roof designed to manage stormwater and improve energy efficiency.“There are no VIP dining rooms being constructed as part of the project,” Powell wrote. Existing conference rooms some of which are used during meals are simply being renovated.Powell wrote that the Federal Reserve buildings ""were originally constructed using marble for the façades and stonework."" He explained that the renovation project has saved the original exterior marble to reinstall it and will use new marble from Georgia in areas where the original is damaged or needs replacement to meet historic preservation standards.He also said that no special or VIP elevators are being installed. Powell wrote that although the Board’s original design included new water features for the 1951 Constitution Avenue building, those plans have been removed. He added that the original fountains at the Eccles Building are being restored.Powell sent his letter after the White House’s official “rapid response” account on social media platform X shared video of Vought telling Fox Business that he is investigating the costly renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters. The project has also been mentioned by President Donald Trump as a possible reason to fire Powell ""for cause"".Vought told Fox Business host Larry Kudlow, who served as an advisor to President Trump during his first term, that the president is a builder and finds it exasperating how expensive the building project has become and how much it has gone over budget. He added that they will seek as much information as they can gather, as reported by the Guardian.Earlier the same day, Representative French Hill, a Republican from Arkansas who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, tried to downplay speculation about Powell's possible dismissal. When asked by CBS News if there was any scenario in which the president could or should fire the Fed chair, Hill replied, “He’s not gonna fire Jay Powell, and I don’t believe he can fire Jay Powell.”Despite these reassurances, tensions remain. While Hill and other Republicans are trying to ease concerns that the president might trigger financial instability by removing the chairman of the US central bank, Vought and some others in the White House seem to be taking steps to create pressure on Powell possibly in the hope that he will choose to resign.On Tuesday, Trump suggested that Powell could be dismissed over the $2.5 billion renovation plan for the central bank’s headquarters. However, on Wednesday, while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump downplayed the possibility, though he did not completely rule it out. When asked if he had decided against firing Powell, he said he never rules anything out, but called it “highly unlikely.” He added that the only exception would be “unless he has to leave for fraud. ”","Jerome Powell sent a letter to White House Budget Director Russ Vought on Thursday.

India at growing risk of gastric cancer: New WHO study projects 1.6 million cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/india-at-growing-risk-of-gastric-cancer-new-who-study-projects-1-6-million-cases/articleshow/122380231.cms,"India and China could see 6.5 million gastric cancer cases combined



Helicobacter pylori infection causes most gastric cancer cases in India



Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions



Early detection could prevent most gastric cancer cases



Younger populations in India face rising gastric cancer risk



Nationwide screening campaigns to detect and treat H. pylori early

Public education initiatives to raise awareness of gastric cancer symptoms, such as persistent indigestion, bloating, and unexplained weight loss

A recent study published in Nature Medicine by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialised agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), has issued a stark warning: the world is facing a significant surge in gastric cancer cases, with Asia—and particularly India—bearing the brunt. The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk.Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.India must take public health action against gastric cancerTo reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.",Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions.

Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Now, as he re-enters the private sector, many will watch to see how Sunak’s unique blend of political insight and financial expertise influences Goldman Sachs’ global strategy. His move also raises broader questions about the crossover between public leadership and corporate influence in a post-pandemic world.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.When Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s comeback to the private sector is not just a career move; it’s an inspiring example of how public service can continue even after leaving office. Unlike many politicians who often retire into comfort, relying on accumulated wealth or government benefits, Sunak is choosing to re-engage professionally in a meaningful way. His decision to take on an advisory role at Goldman Sachs without drawing a salary, and instead donating any earnings to charity, reflects both integrity and a deep sense of responsibility. It sets a strong precedent for how former leaders can remain active contributors to society, not for personal gain, but for a greater public good.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser.

Who was Felix Baumgartner?



Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner, immortalised for his breathtaking 2012 skydive from the stratosphere, tragically died Thursday in a paragliding crash in Porto Sant’Elpidio, Italy. He was 56.Baumgartner, famously known as “Fearless Felix,” made history on October 14, 2012, when he became the first human to break the sound barrier in freefall - without the aid of a machine. The jump, conducted as part of the Red Bull Stratos mission, captured the world’s attention and remains one of the most iconic feats in extreme sports.In the now-legendary video, streamed live to millions, Baumgartner stands on the edge of a tiny capsule 24 miles (39 kilometers) above Earth, looks down at the curve of the planet, flashes a calm thumbs-up, and leaps. What follows is four minutes of pure human daring - as he plummets at speeds reaching 843.6 mph (1,357.6 km/h), eventually deploying his parachute and landing safely in the New Mexico desert.“Sometimes you have to go really high to understand how small you are,” Baumgartner said moments before the jump, words that still echo across time.From his teenage skydives to BASE jumps off skyscrapers and canyons, to flying across the English Channel in carbon wings, Baumgartner lived a life above ground - and far beyond the ordinary.But it was his 2012 leap that cemented his place in history.More than a decade later, that jump still inspires awe. Watch the moment below and remember the man who dared to fall faster than sound - and made the world hold its breath.Felix Baumgartner was an Austrian skydiver, BASE jumper, stunt pilot, and extreme sports icon known for pushing the limits of human flight. Born in Salzburg in 1969, he began skydiving in his teens and honed his skills in the Austrian military. Over the years, he became famous for daring stunts - from jumping off skyscrapers to gliding across the English Channel in carbon wings. In 1999, he gained international attention by performing the world’s lowest BASE jump from the hand of Rio’s Christ the Redeemer statue.However, it was his 2012 Red Bull Stratos mission that truly defined him: a 24-mile skydive from the stratosphere, making him the first person to break the sound barrier without mechanical assistance. Known as “Fearless Felix,” he combined precision, planning, and bravery in everything he did. Baumgartner was also a licensed helicopter pilot and balloonist, embodying a lifelong passion to be, quite literally, above it all.","Felix Baumgartner, 56, died Thursday in a paragliding crash in Porto Sant’Elpidio, Italy.

BENGALURU: The state govt's decision to greenlight a hike in autorickshaw fares has hit a raw nerve among the city's commuters, who are already struggling with soaring travel costs and shrinking transport options in the tech capital.With effect from Aug 1, the minimum auto fare within BBMP limits will rise from Rs 30 to Rs 36 for the first 2km, and every subsequent kilometre of ride will cost Rs 18. But the hike has not gone down well with the public.Reacting tersely to the hike, netizen Deepak stated on X: ""It is a big joke on hapless passengers who are already victims of autorickshaw drivers who never go by the meter, refuse to ply and demand excess fare."" Joining him, fellow netizen Harish described the hike as a ‘big joke of the decade' as autorickshaw drivers never ply by switching on the meters.In fact, when @TOIBengaluru asked on X if the hike was justified, many equated it to legalising daylight robbery. There are around 3.6 lakh autorickshaws plying in the city, of these only a few hundred go by the meter. A majority of the autorickshaw drivers either fleece passengers by quoting fares randomly or, with regard to vehicles linked to aggregators, do accept rides till the tip offered is high. Netizens asked: ""How much more should we shell out just to get around the city?""I take an auto from Doddakallasandra Metro station to my home at Uttarahalli.Autos are an important and crucial part of everyone's life for commuting. The fares are already quite high. Even my kids say auto fares have become too expensive. The rates have gone up further after the bike-taxi ban. A ride that usually costs Rs 60 now comes to Rs 80. I understand that auto drivers also need to earn a living, but this is unfair to commuters. It's high time the govt looked into providing more feeder buses so that people like me can avoid paying such high faresI take an auto from MG Road to my college. I take autos when there are no buses available. The current situation is already bad with auto drivers not coming unless and until we give them extra tips on online apps. Now the future hike will definitely burn a big hole in our pockets. We are students, and this is not fair on the govt side to do soAutos ask for almost double the fare, sometimes. That's why we choose buses to travel. But the buses don't come on time, which leaves us with no choice but to take autos. It's one of the crucial means of commuting in my everyday life. A fare hike will make autos unaffordable for students like me. After Metro and bus (fare increases) earlier, now it's autos. What more does the govt want to do? We haven't seen many using meters as wellI belong to the middle class. No matter what, our lives feel doomed because of price hikes everywhere. Whatever the cost, we always look for the cheapest option — otherwise, we simply can't manage. We can't do anything about the hikePeople are already not preferring autos, claiming that fares are high and this hike only forces them to avoid autos. I don't know how the govt went ahead with this decision without consulting all auto unions. This will mainly affect those auto drivers who are not working directly under any aggregators. The public already has a negative opinion on auto drivers in Bengaluru and this adds more negativity","The minimum auto fare within BBMP limits will rise from Rs 30 to Rs 36 for the first 2km, and every subsequent kilometre of ride will cost Rs 18.

GST heat drives Karnataka’s small traders away from UPI mode,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/gst-heat-drives-karnatakas-small-traders-away-from-upi-mode/articleshow/122671590.cms,"



Mysuru /Bengaluru: As GST notices continue to land at the doorsteps of small traders across Karnataka, vendors in cities like Mysuru and Bengaluru are increasingly rejecting UPI payments in favour of cash—raising concerns over the future of India's digital payment ecosystem.In Mysuru, small shopkeepers, hotel owners, PG operators, and auto drivers have started declining UPI payments after receiving tax notices. The state's commercial tax department, using cumulative UPI transaction data from the 2022-25 financial years, flagged potential non-compliance—causing panic among merchants unaware that digital inflows could be considered undeclared turnover.""For years, UPI was the easiest way to get paid,"" said a hotelier from Bogadi. ""But I can't maintain records for every transaction. I'd rather lose a few customers than deal with GST registration or file returns for a 1% tax under the composition scheme.""Bengaluru-based trade activist Sajjan Raj Mehta said while the department is within its legal rights to use UPI data, the lack of clarity and warning has led to confusion. ""Many traders didn't know mixed personal and business UPI inflows could be treated as turnover.The issue isn't enforcement—it's the absence of prior communication."" In Bengaluru, the impact is visible. Rekha, a flower vendor near Banashankari metro station, said she stopped accepting UPI after a neighbour received a GST notice. ""Now, customers either leave or argue. My sales have dropped 30% this week."" Mehta stressed that notices failed to account for exempt goods. ""Fruits, vegetables, and unbranded food items don't require GST registration. Yet, small traders dealing in them have been pulled into the compliance net."" The shift isn't yet widespread but is growing. ""In tech-savvy areas, UPI use continues. But rural belts and older vendors are reverting to cash,"" Mehta noted.Customers are feeling the pinch. ""Three local stalls refused UPI this week—it's frustrating,"" said Rohit Dubey, a tech worker in Bengaluru. Homemaker Sunitha S added, ""This defeats the purpose of Digital India."" Trade bodies are urging the government to intervene. ""Traders need clear GST guidelines on UPI, a grievance mechanism for mismatches, and awareness programs in local languages,"" said Mehta.While large businesses with turnover above Rs 2 crore remain unaffected, Mehta warned that the move could reverse years of progress. ""After pushing digital payments post-demonetisation, we're risking a rollback. If UPI equals tax scrutiny, small businesses will default to cash. Trust, once broken, is hard to rebuild.""KC Narayana Gowda, president of the Mysuru Hotels Association, called the retrospective notices ""highly condemnable."" ""These should've been issued in the same year. We had to bring in Rs 25 lakh worth of coins to meet demand."" KB Lingaraju, president of the Mysuru Chamber of Commerce and Industries, added, ""The state must prioritise education over enforcement.

Walmart slashed 1,500 jobs



Walmart, America’s largest retailer has announced the fresh round of layoffs. As reported by Bloomberg the fresh round of layoffs will impact hundreds of employees in the store support and training division. While the company has not disclosed the number of laid off employees, but reports indicate this round of layoffs will affect of hundreds of employees across various locations. The move to reduce the workforce is part of the company’s restructuring efforts and is aimed at streamlining operations and adapting to evolving retail landscapes.As reported by Bloomberg, in a memo to employees, Cedric Clark, executive vice president of store operations at Walrmart US said that the company is removing market coordinator positions— the corporate role which assists market managers who oversee multiple stores. “We’re simplifying our market support structure, reducing touchpoints and friction for our store associates,” said Cedric Clark in the memo.The memo also emphasised that the job cuts are part of a shift towards simplifying the market support structure and “reduce touchpoints and friction for store associates”. Along with this, the retailer is also eliminating coach and coordinator roles at Walmart Academy , which is training division for the store managers and employees.The report also adds that the impacted employees will be offered store-level coach roles in their local areas.This move follows earlier restructuring steps, including the closure of Walmart’s North Carolina office and relocation of staff to hubs in Arkansas and California. In May, the company also announced 1,500 job cuts across its tech, e-commerce, and advertising divisions.The move is aimed towards streamlining its operations, according to an internal memo cited by Reuters.

Biggest iPhone manufacturers in India

Apple iPhone 17 series manufacturing has reportedly started in India

Apple has reportedly set a new milestone in India in the first six months of 2025. According to a report in Economic Times, the iPhone-maker has reportedly achieved the fastest ramp-up in iPhone production and exports from India in the first half of 2025 ever since it started smartphone assembly in the country in 2017. The move is said to be an attempt on Apple's part to diversify global production amid threat of higher US tariffs on Chinese imports.Quoting market researcher Canalys, the report said that iPhone production in India surged 53% on-year during the January to June period, reaching 23.9 million units. As per research firm Cybermedia Research (CMR), iPhone export volumes touched 22.88 million units in H1 2025, from 15.05 million a year earlier, an increase of 52%. In value terms, Apple exported $22.56 billion worth of iPhones from India in the first half of 2025, compared to $14.71 billion a year earlier as per CMR. ""This shift reflects improving yield rates, line maturity, and Apple's growing confidence in India as a core manufacturing base,"" said Sanyam Chaurasia, analyst, Canalys.Apple also faces a significant challenge in India as President Trump has warned the company about imposing 25% tariff on imported iPhones if they are not manufactured within US borders. ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social in May. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.""Apple transported five planes full of iPhones and other products from India to the US in just three days during the final week of March. The urgent shipments were made to avoid a new 10% reciprocal tariff imposed by US President Donald Trump’s administration that took effect on April 5. Apple's US warehouses are reportedly stocked for several months ahead with 'made-in-India' iPhones. Analyst said that stockpiling was aimed to allow Apple to maintain current pricing temporarily. “The reserves that arrived at lower duty will temporarily insulate the company from the higher prices that it will need to pay for new shipments under the revised tax rates,” a source explained to TOI.In May, the US government later declared a 90-day pause on imposing reciprocal tariffs for most of its trading partners till July 9, which has since been extended to August 1. For India, the US has proposed a 26% tariff.Foxconn (Hon Hai) and Tata Electronics are the leading manufacturers of iPhones in India. Last year, Tata Electronics took over operations of Wistron and Pegatron plants in the country.Apple is now reportedly planning to undertake simultaneous day-one manufacturing of the upcoming iPhone 17 in China and India. Apple iPhone 17 series is likely set for launch in September. Components for the iPhone 17 are reported to have already started arriving at the Foxconn plant in Tamil Nadu. ""While not officially confirmed, the volume and type of these imports make it highly likely that trial production or early-stage assembly has commenced, months ahead of Apple's typical September launch window. This would mark a new benchmark with the earliest ever flagship ramp-up from India,"" Chaurasia said.","iPhone production in India surged 53% on-year during the January to June period, reaching 23.9 million units. iPhone export volumes touched 22.88 million units in H1 2025, from 15.05 million a year earlier, an increase of 52%.

GTA 6: Grand Theft Auto VI expected to generate nearly $8 billion within two months of its release,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-expected-to-generate-nearly-8-billion-within-two-months-of-its-release/articleshow/122633119.cms,"Image credit: Playstation

GTA 6: What Konvoy analyst Josh Chapman predicted about GTA 6’s success



“🎮 GTA VI: we predict that GTA VI will generate $7.6 BILLION in revenue in the first 60 Days of its launch (current release date: May 26, 2026). This will be the greatest video game release of all time; shattering player, viewership, and revenue records.

For Take-Two Interactive's $2 billion investment into this game, we believe they will break even on that within 30 days of release (see our breakdown in the chart attached).

🚀 Predictions: Our Expectations of GTA VI:

We chatted internally here at Konvoy and decided to write down a few predictions and make them public. In the end, we're just gamers who can't wait to see this title released:

1️⃣ GTA VI is the largest gaming release of all time, shattering records of copies sold and revenue generated within almost every period of time

2️⃣ GTA VI will cost $80 (there will be premium versions of course, but the base price is $80)

3️⃣ GTA VI is the next UGC platform. It will have a UGC component that includes creator payouts for server hosts, mod creators, and more (mimicking the creator economics of UEFN and Roblox)

4️⃣ GTA VI will have 200-person lobbies, and there will be higher risk/reward dynamics where you can raid and steal items from players more easily

5️⃣ GTA VI will break even on its $2bn investment <30 days of release

6️⃣ GTA VI will hit the attached chart of copies sold, revenue, and player targets.

We can't wait for this title to be released in 2026. I'll certainly be playing it.”

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is set to launch in May next year. Meanwhile, investment firm Konvoy has made some major predictions for the upcoming open world title’s financial performance. The video game venture capitalist company suggests that GTA 6 will generate $7.6 billion in revenue within just two months or 60 days of its release. Josh Chapman, a managing partner of Konvoy, shared this forecast on a post shared on the professional networking site LinkedIn. He highlighted that the firm believes that the highly anticipated game will have major commercial success. However, it's important to note that Konvoy's projection is based on certain assumptions that Take-Two Interactive has not yet confirmed, such as an $80 price point for the game and a reported budget of around $2 billion, which the company is said to have spent to develop the game.Konvoy's analysis suggests that GTA 6 could recover its estimated $2 billion budget in under 30 days and build considerable momentum. The firm predicts that it may become the gaming industry’s biggest launch to date and is expected to break records for both copies sold and revenue generated by a game. Considering that analysts have referred to GTA 6 as ""the most important game to ever release in the industry,"" a multi-billion dollar revenue figure may be within reach for the title.In his LinkedIn post, Chapman wrote:",Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is set to launch in May next year.

Mark Zuckerberg to build Manhattan-sized AI data center in Meta’s superintelligence drive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-to-build-manhattan-sized-ai-data-center-in-metas-superintelligence-drive/articleshow/122622532.cms,"Mark Zuckerberg bets big on superclusters to drive Meta’s AGI ambitions



Talent raids, new leadership, and the future of Meta’s AI division

In a move to solidify Meta’s position in the race for artificial general intelligence (AGI), CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced plans to build a data center nearly the size of Manhattan. The facility, described as a multi-gigawatt titan cluster, will support the company’s ambitious AI initiatives, including its newly formed Superintelligence Labs division. As part of its broader AI strategy, Meta plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming years, reflecting the scale and urgency of its vision.With superclusters like Prometheus set to come online in 2026 and Hyperion following, Meta aims to outpace rivals like OpenAI and Google in the development of next-generation AI models and infrastructure.Zuckerberg confirmed that Meta is building several massive AI compute clusters, each with the energy footprint of a small city. One such facility, Prometheus, will be the company’s first multi-gigawatt data center, while Hyperion is designed to scale up to 5 gigawatts over time.These efforts are intended to support the creation of superintelligent AI systems—machines capable of outperforming humans in a wide range of tasks. To fund this vision, Meta raised its 2025 capital expenditure estimate to between $64 billion and $72 billion. Zuckerberg cited the company’s strong ad revenue, $165 billion last year, as a key enabler of such spending. “We have the capital from our business to do this,” he told investors.In addition to infrastructure, Meta is aggressively investing in talent. The company recently formed Superintelligence Labs, a new division led by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and ex-GitHub chief Nat Friedman. Zuckerberg has reportedly led a personal effort to attract top-tier researchers, offering multimillion-dollar packages, some reaching $100 million, to secure talent from rival firms.These hires follow challenges with Meta’s open-source Llama 4 model and the departure of key staff. With new AI applications like Meta AI, image-to-video ad tools, and smart glasses in development, the company is working to diversify beyond its traditional social media roots. Industry analysts suggest Meta could become the first company to bring a gigawatt-plus AI supercluster online, cementing its leadership in the global AI race.","Zuckerberg confirms Meta is building several massive AI compute clusters, each with the energy footprint of a small city.

‘Alliance with BJP essential to unseat anti-people DMK; AIADMK will return with absolute majority in 2026’: Edappadi K Palaniswami,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/alliance-with-bjp-essential-to-unseat-anti-people-dmk-aiadmk-will-return-with-absolute-majority-in-2026-edappadi-k-palaniswami/articleshow/122725984.cms,"AIADMK's General Secretary expresses confidence in securing an absolute majority in the 2026 assembly election, citing widespread public dissatisfaction with the DMK's governance.

Every section of society has been affected over the past 50 months since the DMK assumed office, says AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami in an interview with Jaya Menon and Julie Mariappan.

He adds that as the largest party in Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK will emerge victorious in the 2026 assembly election. Excerpts:

How is the AIADMK poised for the 2026 assembly election?

It is eight years since you took charge as AIADMK general secretary.

What is your assessment of AIADMK’s strengths?

In an interview to TOI in 2019 ahead of LS polls, you said AIADMK lacked a strong national leader after

Jayalalithaa and Narendra Modi was the only option.

Why didn’t you align with BJP for the 2024 LS polls?

Is AIADMK ready to form a coalition govt for the first time in its history if it does not win a majority? Even if it gets a majority?

Did your decision to align with BJP have anything to do with Annamalai not continuing as its state president?

Are you in talks with

Vijay

’s TVK?

Will AIADMK snap ties with the BJP and join hands with TVK in the event of Vijay climbing down?

Who is a stronger ally — BJP or TVK?

Did the AIADMK explore alliances with NTK and DMK allies, VCK and the Left parties for the 2026 election?

What about criticism that AIADMK leadership lacks the dynamism and charisma of former chief ministers MGR and Jayalalithaa?

What is your response to allegations that conflicts, splits and ideological inconsistencies led to AIADMK’s poor

show in the elections?

How will the AIADMK-BJP alliance influence vote conversion considering that cadres burst firecrackers when the allies split in 2023?

What do you have to say about the perceived insults aimed at Dravidian icons Periyar and Annadurai during the Murugan devotees’ conference?

How are you going to revive relationships with minority groups, especially after erstwhile allies representing the community have parted ways?

AIADMK is struggling to build a formidable alliance, having lost most of its allies since 2021.

Why did you raise the issue of temple funds being used by HR&CE department for education given that MGR too took such initiatives?

Your thoughts on the state economic survey’s findings, suggesting growth, high per capita income and employment opportunities.

Chief minister M K Stalin says AIADMK has no locus standi to comment on law and order.

How do you respond to the govt’s assertion that the state’s debt is well within the prescribed levels?





AIADMK will capture power with absolute majority in 2026. Every section of society has been affected over the past 50 months since the DMK assumed office — an increase in drug trafficking, illicit liquor deaths, murder, burglary and sexual offences, price rise and spike in tax burden. There is a growing hatred for the Stalin model govt among the public. Never in the history of Tamil Nadu has there been such a corrupt, incompetent anti-people govt. I began the ‘Makkalai Kappom–Tamizhagathai Meetpom’ statewide tour from July 7 covering 234 constituencies to remind people of the AIADMK govt’s achievements. I can see massive support wherever I go.My political journey in AIADMK began 46 years ago. As general secretary, I am working with the sole objective of bringing AIADMK back to power, with the blessings of two deities — Puratchi Thalaivar M G Ramachandran and Puratchi Thalaivi Amma (J Jayalalithaa).I will achieve that goal with the support of people and cooperation of AIADMK cadres.There are more than two crore members in AIADMK. It is the third largest party in the country in terms of membership. We are the largest party in Tamil Nadu. We will emerge victorious.AIADMK is a state party. If projects need to be implemented in the state, the cooperation and support of the Centre is essential. BJP is a strong party nationally. It is the ruling party at the Centre. The major issues facing the state today are the DMK’s autocratic rule, deep-rooted corruption, deteriorating law and order, unbearable debt burden, and a lack of development projects. The administration is trapped in the clutches of one family. AIADMK believes an alliance with BJP is essential to remove this chaotic govt, reclaim Tamil Nadu, and bring it back on the path of development. We want to remove the anti-people DMK regime from Tamil Nadu.Poll strategies are formed based on the political situation. Given the current political scenario, the DMK must be ousted. Hence, it has become necessary to unite like-minded parties. Such a situation did not arise during the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.How can I answer a hypothetical question? AIADMK will form the govt with an absolute majority.The AIADMK never interferes in the activities of other parties.We cannot reveal our election strategies and tactics.I don’t respond to hypothetical questions.BJP is a national party. It is the ruling party in several states. Each party has its own strength. We can’t compare parties. All like-minded parties should join hands to take on the anti-people DMK.We welcome those who want to work with us to unseat the anti-DMK govt. What is wrong with that?They are unparalleled leaders. It is foolish to compare them with anyone. The party was nurtured by them and will always have their guidance. The AIADMK is now strong and vibrant. Party cadres are working enthusiastically.After Amma died, the party experienced a setback but it has risen from that trying period. Victory and defeat are common in electoral politics. Didn’t we return to office in 2001 after losing in 1996? Didn’t the DMK that lost its deposit in RK Nagar bypoll in 2017 and finished third, come to power in the last election? We contested alone in the 2024 LS polls and increased our vote share. In the 2026 election, we will record a resounding win and form the govt.I am not aware of celebrations with firecrackers. Election strategies must be tailored to the situation for a victory.We have condemned videos defaming Periyar and Anna.Since its inception, AIADMK has been committed to minorities’ welfare. It is false propaganda that they are against us.It is difficult to form an alliance against the authoritative power and money power of DMK. The AIADMK will overcome those obstacles and win.There is nothing wrong with using temple funds for education. Though colleges are functioning on temple funds, they will charge like self-financing colleges. Therefore, it is mandatory for poor students to pay higher fees when studying in HR&CE-run colleges. Running colleges is a recurring expense and the temple concerned must allocate a substantial amount every year. The state govt must take on the responsibility of higher education. Doesn’t the govt have the funds to do this?These are all publicity stunts. They don’t seem to have made any such progress.AIADMK that strives for welfare has the locus standi more than Stalin, who became CM with the only qualification of being Karunanidhi’s son, and ruined law and order. Are we allies to remain mute spectators to the anti-people activities of the incompetent DMK govt? In a democracy, every citizen has the right to question anyone. But elected representatives and the leader of opposition don’t seem to have the right. This is Stalin’s understanding of democracy.Should we continue borrowing assuming the state’s debt is within the prescribed limit? State govt debt in the 75 years since Independence until 2021 was ₹5 lakh crore. DMK’s borrowings in the past four years is ₹4.5 lakh crore. The debt burden will exceed ₹5 lakh crore by the time the DMK tenure ends. Is taking a loan an achievement? We oppose DMK govt’s incompetence, which has imposed a debt of ₹1.5 lakh on the head of every child to be born.","AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami in an interview with Jaya Menon and Julie Mariappan.

India’s Startup Capital Is Quietly Building Thoughtful Philanthropy

When wealth met willingness

New mindset for philanthropy

Opening up new opportunities

The road ahead





When people speak of Bengaluru, they typically discuss startups. A city where every second building houses a team of twenty trying to crack an idea, a prototype, a product market fit It’s not just the innovation that stands out, it’s the mindset. A certainrestlessness to ask: What’s broken? Why does it stay broken? What’s the smartest way to fix it? That instinct, this curiosity, I’ve come to believe, runs through more than just tech. It isn’t just building consumer tech or enterprise platforms.It’s quietly reshaping something else entirely: the way this city gives.I’ve spent the last 25 years working across both the corporate and development sectors. And in that time, I’ve seen a quiet but powerful shift in how philanthropy is thought about and practiced in Bengaluru. One that’s less about legacy and more about problem solving. A kind of giving that is as first-principles and design thinking oriented as the startups that made this city famous.Bengaluru’s philanthropic rise wasn’t just a result of intent; it was also about timing. It was the result of new money meeting new questions.Around 2013, as India’s startup ecosystem matured, many early founders were seeing wealth for the first time.Azim Premji had already set a benchmark, not just with the scale of his giving, but with the approach: longterm, institution-building philanthropy that worked with the state to strengthen public systems.Nandan and Rohini Nilekani invested in digital public goods- platforms that could serve as foundational layers for water, finance, and governance. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw focused on strengthening health systems and biotech capacity.These moves weren’t just generous; they were thoughtful and design-led. They inspired a newer generation of givers, including Prashanth Prakash of Accel, Nithin and Nikhil Kamath of Zerodha, Vidit Aatrey of Meesho, and many more. There’s been a shift in how the newer generations have started seeing philanthropy: not as charity, but as catalytic capital for solving wicked problems.Bengaluru’s philanthropic story is different from that of older Indian cities. In Mumbai, giving is often rooted in legacy- family foundations, inherited wealth, and decades-old institutions. In Delhi, it’s more often linked to proximity to the state, policy, and advocacy.Bengaluru’s giving culture is newer and in some ways, more experimental. Most of its wealth is first-generation. The volume of giving might not yet stand out. Mumbai still leads there. But it differs in the quality of giving. Many of its donors are engineers, product leaders, or founders who exited their startups and began asking what they could build next, not necessarily for the market, but for the country.They aren’t looking to support the next big NGO. They are looking to understand why some programs stick while others don’t. They question assumptions, challenge models, and most refreshingly, admit what they don’t know. They have the patience, the back-end focus. The willingness to fund the invisible yet crucial layers, organisational tech systems, measurement frameworks, leadership development, that will allow social impact to scale. That humility is part of what defines Bengaluru’s philanthropic identity.Along with a quiet appetite for collaborative bets, most Bengaluru funders are comfortable with iteration. They don’t expect linear progress or perfect outcomes. They’re okay with funding something that may fail, as long as it’s trying to solve a root problem.And most critically, there’s a bias for listening. I’ve seen people with enormous capacity sit silently through field reviews, only to ask one sharp question at the end. I’ve seen high-networth individuals defer to grassroots leaders because they know the latter holds the real insight.This culture, thoughtful, unassuming, and long-term in its lens, is what makes Bengaluru’s giving ecosystem not just promising, but instructive.Because of this ecosystem, we’re seeing philanthropy move into bold, underfunded areas—supporting rural micro-entrepreneurs, funding nonprofits that work in low-income geographies, investing in tech platforms that serve the public good, and backing public institutions like the Museum of Art & Photography (MAP), the Science Gallery, and the Bangalore International Centre (BIC) that nurture civic imagination, dialogue, and cultural capital.We’ve seen funders commit to 5–7year partnerships. We’ve seen government–nonprofit collaboratives flourish because donors were willing to support the back-end functions—capacity building, shared infrastructure, policy research. Karnataka, for instance, was the first state to back the Indian Administrative Fellowship (IAF), a pioneering public–private partnership anchored by The/Nudge, which embeds talent within state systems to drive governance innovation.There’s a new appetite for institutional resilience. No longer is it enough for an NGO to deliver services. It must be able to withstand external shocks, retain top talent, and evolve its model, all of which require flexible, long-term capital. That’s what philanthropists in Bengaluru are beginning to provide. This is a great turning point that will enable non-profits to move away from survival and become a centre for innovation. But this experiment is still nascent.Too little philanthropic capital still reaches women-led or Dalit- and Adivasi-led organisations. Rural changemakers don’t always have access to the networks that open doors in urban ecosystems. And while government partnerships are growing, we haven’t yet fully cracked how philanthropy can serve as an R&D engine for the state, especially at the last mile.We need to keep widening the circle. Keep investing in collective infrastructure. Keep learning from what’s not working. And perhaps most importantly, keep listening.Because the success of this ecosystem won’t be measured just in money moved or programs scaled. But in how resilient it becomes, how well it absorbs new voices, adapts to uncertainty, and builds trust at every level.As Bengaluru cements its place as a philanthropic hub, the next challenge is to widen the arc of giving. Karnataka is already India’s secondrichest large state by per capita income, and Bengaluru holds a disproportionate share of capital, networks, and institutions. The momentum now needs to extend beyond - towards underserved states, rural geographies, and communities that remain on the margins of this progress.","India’s Startup Capital Is Quietly Building Thoughtful Philanthropy. When wealth met willingness, a new mindset for philanthropy emerged. Many of its donors are engineers, product leaders, or founders who exited their startups. They aren’t looking to support the next big NGO.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122725273,imgsize-25576,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/122725273.jpg"
