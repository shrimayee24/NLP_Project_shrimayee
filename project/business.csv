In an interview in Germany, during his three-nation trip to Europe last week, the minister also said anyone who is not blind can see that terrorist organisations are openly operating from the cities and towns of Pakistan.""That is no secret. The UN Security Council terror list is full of Pakistani names and places, and these are the very places we have targeted. So please don't think that something is only going on behind the scenes,"" he said.Jaishankar also said all the focus on the nuclear-weapon issue between India and Pakistan was only encouraging terrorism, adding that at no point was a nuclear level reached during the recent India-Pakistan military conflict. ""There is a narrative as if everything that happens in our part of the world leads directly to a nuclear problem. That disturbs me a lot because it encourages terrible activities like terrorism. If anything, much more is happening with the nuclear issue in your part of the world,"" said the minister, adding that India sent a clear signal to the terrorists through Operation Sindoor that there is a price to be paid for carrying out Pahalgam-like attacks.""The firing was then started by the Pakistani military. We fired back in self-defence and once the Pakistanis understood that they were taking a harmful course, we were able to stop firing.

""I thank the Indian military because it was the Indian military action that made Pakistan say: We are ready to stop,"" he said.Asked about the differences between India and Germany over the Russia-Ukraine war and India's ties with Moscow, the minister said relationships do not develop because one partner simply adopts the concerns of the other as their own. ""Relationships are built on finding common ground. For you in Europe, other concerns and worries are important than for me in Asia. When you think of conflict, you think of Ukraine.

Bombay high court halts Mumbai airport's bid to replace Turkey's Celebi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-high-court-halts-mumbai-airports-bid-to-replace-turkeys-celebi/articleshow/121414031.cms,"File photo (ANI)

NEW DELHI: In a temporary reprieve for Turkish aviation firm Celebi, the Bombay high court on Monday directed Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) to hold off on awarding new contracts for ground and bridge handling services at the city's international airport.The interim order was passed by Justice Somasekhar Sundaresan, who said that no conclusive steps should be taken on the tenders until Celebi’s petitions are heard after the court’s summer recess in June, reported news agency PTI.The legal dispute stems from the recent revocation of security clearance for Celebi Airport Services India, a subsidiary of Turkey-based Celebi, by India’s Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS). The security clearance was rescinded earlier this month, citing national security concerns, prompting airports across the country to terminate contracts with Celebi’s Indian affiliates.The move followed diplomatic tensions after Turkey expressed support for Pakistan during India’s Operation Sindoor, a military offensive conducted in response to cross-border terrorism. In the aftermath, Celebi’s Indian operations, including those at key airports like Mumbai and Delhi, came under scrutiny.In Mumbai, Celebi Nas Airport Services India, which handles bridge and ground services, filed three separate petitions challenging both the BCAS's decision and MIAL’s termination of contracts. The company contended that the government’s actions were arbitrary and legally unsustainable. Celebi holds a 59 per cent stake in the joint venture operating at the Mumbai airport.The petitions request the high court to annul the BCAS’s order cancelling its security clearance and to reverse MIAL’s termination of key agreements, including the Bridge Mounted Equipment Service Agreement, Ground Handling Services contract, and the Concession Agreement. The firm also asked the court to suspend the tender process initiated by MIAL on May 17 for selecting a replacement agency.Meanwhile, two other group companies, Celebi Airport Services India and Celebi Delhi Cargo Terminal Management India, have approached the Delhi high court seeking similar relief following cancellation of their airport contracts in the capital.","The Bombay high court on Monday directed Mumbai International Airport Limited to hold off on awarding new contracts for ground and bridge handling services.

DGCA gives nod to Class 12 arts & commerce students becoming commercial pilots in India; seeks ministry approval,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-gives-nod-to-class-12-arts-commerce-students-becoming-commercial-pilots-in-india-seeks-ministry-approval/articleshow/121397712.cms,"Poll Should the DGCA further relax educational requirements for other aviation roles? Yes, it should promote inclusivity. No, maintain current standards.

NEW DELHI: In a major reform, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has given its nod to changing the educational requirements for becoming a commercial pilot in India by proposing to allow class 12 pass outs from arts and commerce streams to also pursue this course. And no longer limit commercial pilot licence (CPL) training to science students alone, as it has been for almost three decades now.The regulator has sent its recommendation to the Union aviation ministry, which after finalising the amendment, will send the same to the law ministry. That ministry is to notify changes in the current rules which, as of now, require a student to mandatorily have physics and maths in class 12 for CPL training. Once cleared, all class 12 pass outs — subject to clearing medical fitness and other tests — will be eligible to become commercial pilots in India.“The DGCA recommendation has been sent to the aviation ministry. Once they finalise it, this ministry will send in to the law ministry to notify the change. When that happens, the change will come into effect,” said a senior official. TOI had first reported the move to allow arts and commerce students to do CPL training in India on April 18, 2025.Since mid 1990s, CPL training in India is open only for science & maths students. Before that, 10th pass (matric) was the only educational requirement for doing CPL here. Senior captains say no country other than India has this requirement. They term it an archaic requirement that needs to go as the level of physics and maths knowledge required by pilots is imparted in junior classes itself. Over the last 30 years, many arts and commerce students were forced to give Class 12 exam for physics and maths from open school to be eligible for CPL training.Aware of the likely spurt in number of students opting for CPL training once this rule is amended, aviation authorities have already started work on improving flying schools in India. The long time for CPL flying along with questionable safety and training standards of many flying schools in India forces a large number of students to head abroad every year to pursue this expensive course.DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai on May 16 directed all flying schools in the country to “maintain a dedicated website for their organisation” which must have updated information regarding several parameters that include, among other things, the minimum and maximum time taken to complete 200 hours of flying; number of aircraft, instructors, designated examiners, availability of ground school & simulator. DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai wants to bring in transparency about flying training organisation (FTOs) so that the information being in public domain based on which students will choose them will make them competitive, safer and student-friendly.On their part, FTOs point out a number of things that DGCA must do to make flying training less painful in India. Becoming a pilot in India is anything but easy — right from training stage to eventually getting a job. Most student pilots come from middle-class families who have taken big loans to give wings to their children’s dreams.Senior pilots have a word of caution for all aspiring aviators. “Even after the expensive CPL traning and endorsement, getting a job can take a long time. If you are planning to become a pilot, the entire family must factor in the financial aspect and the time lag in getting a job after the entire training is complete. The reality is not as rosy as it seems for wannabe pilots.” they caution.","Since mid 1990s, CPL training in India is open only for science & maths students.

Odisha to seek trademark shield for Puri temple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odisha-to-seek-trademark-shield-for-puri-temple/articleshow/121422801.cms,"Experts, scholars back Odisha's trademark move on Puri temple

BHUBANESWAR: Odisha govt has decided to secure trademark rights for several words and phrases associated with Jagannath Temple in Puri.The decision comes in the wake of a recent controversy over the naming of a newly built temple in Bengal's Digha as 'Jagannath dham'. Odisha objected to the use of the word 'dham', arguing that 'Jagannath dham' refers exclusively to the Puri shrine - one of India's four sacred 'dhams' - and its use elsewhere diluted its religious and cultural significance.""The terms sought to be shielded include 'Jagannath dham', 'shree mandira', 'Purushottam kshetra', 'neelachal dham', 'bada danda', 'mahaprasad' and 'neela chakra',"" Arabinda Padhee, chief administrator of Shree Jagannath Temple Administration, said.The final list of words is being finalised. Once we get the trademark rights, their unauthorised use will be considered a violation and invite legal action. These terms are deeply rooted in ancient Hindu scriptures and are intrinsically linked to culture and traditions involving Jagannath, Arabinda Padhee, chief administrator of SJTA, said.State govt is currently gathering necessary documents and historical evidence to support its claims.SJTA further said that it would soon move the department for promotion of industry and internal trade under Union ministry of commerce and industry, which oversees the application process.Officials maintained that the absence of any existing trademark rights for these terms has limited their ability to legally challenge use of the name 'Jagannath dham' by Digha temple authorities.Cultural experts and religious scholars in Odisha supported the decision.Dibyasingha Deb, Puri king and chairman of Jagannath Temple managing committee, laid stress on preservation of exclusivity of Jagannath tradition. ""We support new Jagannath temples worldwide, provided they adhere to the main temple's traditions and culture,"" he said.","Odisha govt has decided to secure trademark rights for several words and phrases associated with Jagannath Temple in Puri.

'It's an exciting time to be part of space exploration': Peggy Whitson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-an-exciting-time-to-be-part-of-space-exploration/articleshow/121421855.cms,"You’ve seen spaceflight evolve dramatically. How different is the landscape now?

How do you maintain physical & mental health during extended space missions?

You’ve conducted many spacewalks. What’s one challenge that truly caught you off guard?

You’ve broken barriers throughout your career. What your advice to aspiring astronauts, especially women?

What makes the Axiom-4 mission stand out?

As commander of Axiom-4 Mission (Ax-4), veteran astronaut Peggy Whitson is no stranger to firsts. She’s spent more days in space than any other American or woman—675 in total—and now, she’s leading the most research-intensive private space mission to the International Space Station (ISS) yet. But this mission carries a special significance for India too: it includes Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, one of four astronaut-designates for India’s upcoming Gaganyaan mission, as the pilot of the mission. In this exclusive interview to TOI, Whitson talks about adapting to life in orbit, the rise of commercial spaceflight, and why diversity and resilience will shape the future of space exploration.Excerpts:It’s changed a lot. When I started, spaceflight was almost entirely government-led. Now, companies like Axiom Space are transforming how we explore space. They’re not only accelerating innovation but also opening doors for more people and more science. We’re seeing a diverse range of crewmembers, new research angles, and fresh collaborations that weren’t possible before. Private missions have added a new dynamism—bringing in speed, flexibility, and global participation.It’s an exciting time to be involved in space exploration.Staying healthy in space is a top priority. We follow a strict exercise routine to counteract the effects of microgravity—things like muscle loss and bone density reduction. Nutrition is key, too. Mentally, staying sharp means staying connected with loved ones and keeping ourselves intellectually engaged. Whether it's science, reading, or crew activities, it’s about finding ways to stay focused and fulfilled. The ground team’s support and the camaraderie with fellow astronauts play a huge role. Teamwork and resilience are essential up here.During one spacewalk, we unexpectedly lost a thermal and micrometeoroid shield. Despite meticulous planning, space has its surprises. The shield drifted away, and we had to rely on the ground team’s rapid thinking to come up with a workaround. It really underscored the unpredictability of working in space—and the importance of trust, teamwork, and problem-solving under pressure.Don’t let obstacles hold you back. Space exploration demands resilience, curiosity, and a deep commitment to learning. Embrace challenges—they’re chances to grow. Find mentors, build your support network, and never stop asking questions. Your unique perspective is a strength. Believe in your ability to contribute meaningfully. If space is your dream, chase it with everything you've got.Ax-4 is setting a new benchmark. We're conducting more research studies than any private ISS mission before. It’s not just about science—it’s about international collaboration. This mission includes astronauts from multiple countries, all contributing to low-Earth orbit research. It’s laying the foundation for future operations aboard Axiom Station, our next big leap. And for countries like India, which have bold space ambitions, missions like this demonstrate how commercial partnerships can help achieve those goals faster.","Peggy Whitson is leading the most research-intensive private space mission to the International Space Station (ISS) yet.

ED has made the CPM units accused in the latest prosecution complaint (chargesheet) filed before a special court. The other accused include senior party netas from the state, including Lok Sabha MP K Radhakrishnan, who was interrogated last month.CPM has become the second party (or its district unit) to be made an accused after AAP. AAP was made an accused after its senior neta Manish Sisodia, while seeking Supreme Court relief, argued that since his party, that was alleged to have received bribes, had not been made an accused, he could not be booked under PMLA. In both the cases, ED has treated the parties (AAP and CPM) like a company defined under section 70 of PMLA and booked them for laundering money or receiving bribes.According to officials aware of the investigation, rather than the central unit of CPM, it is the local district units that have been named in the chargesheet, as they, through their secretaries, opened accounts to receive funds from the ""proceeds of crime"".ED in its investigation report said the CPM units in question maintained at least 25 undisclosed accounts with several cooperative societies in the name of area committees, with a total balance of Rs 1.7 crore and fixed deposits of Rs 64 lakh, as of Nov 30, 2023.Many of these bank accounts were not disclosed by the party.

Did you expect to be Odisha's first BJP CM? Did you feel the pressure of stepping into a space dominated by Naveen Patnaik for over two decades?



How has your first year in government been?



But it is said the BJD govt left state finances in good shape.



There have been sensitive issues with neighbouring states, including Jagannath Dham in Digha. How are you addressing them?



What's your vision for Odisha by end of your term in 2029?



Nearly a year after creating history and becoming the 1st BJP CM of Odisha, Mohan Charan Majhi spoke to Manash Pratim Gohain and Dipak Dash on the twin challenge of meeting high public expectations & redefining state’s development narrative. Excerpts:I didn't expect or think I'd become CM. Honestly, I just hoped to be a good minister. I've always worked with intention of serving people, with nationalism in my heart. I have been elected four times as an MLA. As party's chief whip, I consistently raised people's issues and questioned the Patnaik govt's policies. Perhaps that consistent public service brought me here.There was no real challenge when I took over. If you have willpower and a strong leader like PM Modi backing you, anything is possible. Yes, people only knew Naveen babu as CM for over 20 years. But governance isn't about occupying a chair. Biju babu, his father (a big leader), had to wait for 27 years to become CM for the second time. Winning repeatedly does not equal meaningful leadership. He (Naveen) didn't speak Odia, didn't meet MLAs or MPs, and didn't visit the CM grievance cell for 16 years.I go there every week. I meet people at 3 am if needed. That's the kind of accessible governance people want - not isolation and silence.We've fulfilled 11 major promises out of our '21' programmes in the manifesto. We launched the Subhadra Yojana on Sept 17, 2024, in the presence of PM Narendra Modi. We gave Rs 10,000 each to 25 lakh women that day. We have exceeded our five-year target of 1 crore beneficiaries in just a few months.We also launched CM-Kisan - adding Rs 4,000 to the Rs 6,000 given under the scheme. We provided Rs 800 as input assistance per quintal of paddy, raising the effective MSP to Rs 3,100.If they had the money, why didn't they use it for the people? Why did they not give money to women and farmers? The credit goes to Modi ji, who amended the MMDR Act - turning lease-based mining into auctions with premiums. That's why Odisha is earning more today.n Puri is the abode of Lord Jagannath and is the only Jagannath Dham. It is one of the Char Dhams, established since the time of Adi Shankaracharya. No one, including any political leader, can replicate or shift that faith.By 2029, Odisha will be among the top five industrialised states.",Mohan Charan Majhi is the 1st BJP CM of Odisha.

Supporting healthy longevity with modern science





In a world where everyone searches for the secret to living a long and fulfilling life, the wisdom of those who have actually achieved extraordinary longevity is invaluable. Ethel Caterham, the world’s oldest living woman at the age of 115, offers a simple yet powerful insight into how she has managed to live such a remarkable life. Born in 1909, Ethel has witnessed immense global changes—from world wars to technological revolutions—and through it all, she has maintained a philosophy that has kept her peaceful, healthy, and vibrant. Her secret? One straightforward rule that she believes has helped her live over a century:This rule, rooted in calmness and self-respect, reveals much about the connection between emotional well-being and longevity.When asked about her secret to living beyond a century, Ethel’s answer was refreshingly simple: avoiding arguments and listening more. She said,This philosophy centers on emotional calmness and self-control, avoiding unnecessary conflicts that can drain energy and increase stress.Scientific research confirms the wisdom in Ethel’s words. Chronic stress and emotional turmoil are linked to an increased risk of heart disease, weakened immune function, and accelerated aging.By choosing to avoid arguments, Ethel likely protected her body and mind from these harmful effects, creating an environment where health and happiness could flourish.Ethel Caterham was born on August 21, 1909, in England's Shipton Bellinger village. Growing up as the second youngest in a family of eight siblings, her early years were shaped by simplicity and traditional values. Life at that time was markedly different — horse-drawn carriages, handwritten letters, and a world on the brink of World War I.Despite the many historical upheavals she experienced, Ethel maintained a steady and calm disposition throughout her life. This ability to remain composed and adaptable was a foundation that supported her health and longevity.Emotional health is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in overall longevity. Studies show that people who manage their emotions well and maintain stable, positive relationships tend to live longer and healthier lives. Chronic emotional conflict can lead to inflammation in the body, which is associated with many age-related diseases.Ethel’s ability to listen and remain composed reflects an emotional resilience that scientific studies link to longevity. By conserving her energy for positive experiences rather than arguments, she helped her body maintain a healthier internal balance.Ethel’s long life was also marked by boldness and curiosity. At 18, she visited India to work as a nanny, embracing new cultures and challenges. Later, she lived in Hong Kong and Gibraltar with her husband, a British army major. These experiences likely enriched her life and kept her mentally engaged, another important factor linked to healthy aging.Despite frequent moves and changes, Ethel’s calm demeanor never wavered. She raised two daughters in the UK and continued to live with strength and grace, even after the loss of her husband.Ethel recently celebrated her 115th birthday in the warm company of friends, family, and caregivers. More than just a milestone, her journey reminds us that living a long life is not only about the years but also about how they are lived. Her story shows that inner peace, emotional stability, and finding joy in everyday moments are key to lasting well-being and longevity.While we cannot all control our genetics or the eras we live through, Ethel’s simple rule offers actionable wisdom:Ethel’s philosophy aligns with scientific recommendations for longevity, which emphasize emotional health alongside physical health. Regular exercise, hydration, stress management, a balanced diet, and strong social connections are all essential. Emotional calmness and happiness have been shown to enhance immune function, reduce the risk of chronic disease, and improve overall life satisfaction.","Ethel Caterham is the world’s oldest living woman at the age of 115.

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricket team captain Sourav Ganguly's elder brother, Snehasish Ganguly, and his wife Arpita had a narrow escape while enjoying water sports in the Puri sea, police said on Monday. The incident took place on Saturday evening near the Lighthouse area, where the couple was on a speedboat ride.Video footage aired by local television channels showed the boat being struck by a massive wave, losing balance, and capsizing in the rough waters.""We were saved by the grace of God. I am still in trauma. This should not happen, and water sports in the sea must be properly regulated. I will write to Puri SP and Odisha Chief Minister after returning to Kolkata,"" Arpita said in a video message available with PTI.Recounting the terrifying experience, she said the boat was hit by a wave “almost ten-storey high,” which caused the vessel to flip over, throwing all passengers—including her and Snehasish—into the sea.""Thankfully, the quick action of the lifeguards saved our lives,"" she added.Local police said lifeguards deployed on the beach rushed to the spot and rescued all the tourists on board. Rubber floats were used to ensure the passengers' safety.A visibly shaken Arpita blamed the incident on the ""greed"" of the adventure sports operators. She alleged that the boat was unstable, carrying only four passengers on a vessel designed for ten, making it unbalanced and unfit to handle the strong tides.""Due to less weight, the boat lost balance and could not encounter the huge wave. The sea was already very rough,"" she said.""Though we raised concerns about safety due to the rough sea and high tide, the operators assured us it was safe. But shortly after venturing out, a huge wave hit the boat, and it capsized,"" she further said.Arpita demanded that the government tighten regulations surrounding water sports in the region and said authorities should even consider banning such activities altogether.Locals alleged that the speedboat was operated by untrained staff employed by a private adventure company.""The crew lacked proper skills to handle high tides and the company ignored essential safety protocols mandated for such activities,"" an eyewitness said.It was also alleged that the company had been conducting water sports activities without obtaining the requisite permission from the Puri district administration.","Former Indian cricket team captain Sourav Ganguly's elder brother, Snehasish Ganguly, and his wife Arpita had a narrow escape while enjoying water sports in the Puri sea.

Indian-origin New York politician Jenifer Rajkumar slammed Mira Nair's son Zohran Mamdani, the New York mayoral candidate from the Socialist Party, for a recent statement against India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an open forum. At the forum, he was asked a hypothetical question that if Indian PM Narendra Modi holds a rally in Madison Square Garden and then wants to address a joint press conference with the mayor of New York, would he join that? Mamadani, who has a strong connection with India as both his parents -- father Mahmood Mamdani and mother Mira Nair -- were born in India, said he won't join.Mamdani elaborated on his answer and said his father is a Gujarati Muslim, and then compared the Indian PM with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Jennifer Rajkumar strongly reacted to the statement and said such divisive language about foreign leaders should have no place in the New York mayoral poll when there are real issues. “At a time when New Yorkers are struggling with real issues—rising crime, a housing crisis, and growing hate—we cannot afford to be distracted by extreme, divisive language about foreign leaders,” Rajkumar said to New York Post.“Hinduism is a faith of peace, nonviolence, and interfaith harmony.Hindu voters want our leaders to build bridges—not burn them. We must reject hate—whether it comes from the far left or the far right. Our city deserves leaders who unite, not provoke—who build coalitions, not headlines,” Rajkumar said.Jaspreet Singh, a Sikh community leader and human rights lawyer, said to the NYP, “Hate has no place in our city. We believe in equality, love and respect for all. We believe all are children of the same God.“But Zohran has used his platform to amplify some of the worst anti-Hindu rhetoric imaginable. Words matter, and instead of uniting the Indian community, he seeks to divide us by religion, pitting Muslims and Hindus against each other. Associating Hindus with fascism and using derogatory words against them is highly objectionable.”A staunch critic of the BJP, Mamdani in 2020 led a mob of protesters in Times Square who called Hindus bast**ds.","Mira Nair's son Zohran Mamdani, the New York mayoral candidate from the Socialist Party, has been accused of Hindu hatred.

US-China tech tensions 'escalate'



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly praised President Donald Trump while sharply criticising the Biden administration ’s export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, calling the policy 'a failure' that cost US companies billions. Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang blasts Biden-era AI chip export policy.

India’s nominal GDP has more than doubled from 2014 to 2025 (projected). It’s a growth of 105% in just a decade. In 2025, India will also become a $4 trillion economy

India was the 10th largest world economy in 2014 - come 2025 it will be the 4th largest - a six places jump in rankings in just 11 years!

In a world of increasing global economic uncertainties, and amidst geopolitical conflicts and Donald Trump’s tariffs, India will still retain the tag of being the fastest growing major world economy with a GDP growth rate of 6.2% for 2025.

India achieved an average annual growth rate of 6.7% from 1990–2023 & in fact outpaced the US (3.8%), Germany (3.9%), and Japan (2.8%).

What’s worked for India?

The sobering picture

In fact, India doesn’t even rank in top 100 countries when it comes to GDP per capita, not even in the Purchasing Power Parity or PPP rankings.

Road Ahead: More reforms, reforms, reforms

India will become the world’s fourth largest economy by the end of 2025 (FY 2025-26), according to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ’s) World Economic Outlook report for April 2025. The IMF measures the size of an economy in nominal GDP terms. A few years ago, India overtook the United Kingdom to become the fifth largest, and is now well on its way to rise to the fourth spot in the list of the top 10 largest economies in the world by overtaking Japan.Recently a statement by NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam suggested that India has already become the world's fourth largest economy, however yesterday NITI Aayog member Arvind Virmani clarified that Subrahmanyam was referring to IMF's latest projections and that India is slated to become the 4th largest by the end of this year.To become the world’s fourth largest economy is no mean feat - India has gone from being the 10th largest in 2014 to 4th largest in 11 years under the Modi government. Its Gross Domestic Product or GDP has more than doubled in this time frame. How has the Indian economy achieved this remarkable growth? Why does the per capita GDP number present a sombre picture? And what’s the road ahead for India to become a $5 trillion economy, and the world’s third largest?Also Read | Explained: Why India is well positioned to deal with negative effects of Trump’s tariffs & top reasons it will be at an advantage India has been on the reform path in the last few years, with several major initiatives like the Goods and Services Tax, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, digitalization, manufacturing sector push paving way for sustained economic growth.Experts also say that prudent fiscal and monetary policies have provided the foundation for a stable GDP growth.Sachchidanand Shukla - Group Chief Economist, L&T believes that India is one of the top players in the global growth league table today.“It is a result of structural reforms, policy continuity, and leveraging demographic and digital advantages. Key factors also include reforms such as: Goods and Services Tax, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, Production-Linked Incentive and increased spending on infrastructure especially roads, railways, energy & defence,” he tells TOI.While the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has significantly improved the health of the banking sector in India, the Goods and Services Tax is widely seen as the biggest indirect tax reform since independence. India’s GST collections in April hit a record all time high of Rs 2.37 lakh crore!Radhika Rao, Senior Economist at DBS Bank says that India’s trend growth continues to gain traction, strengthened by catalysts like investments into physical infrastructure, emphasis on improving human capital, streamlining direct subsidy transfers to beneficiaries, productivity gains from digitalisation, widening footprint in high value-added sectors including semiconductors, and expanding presence in global value chains.Also Read | Why India can be a big winner of Donald Trump 2.0 era if it plays its cards right “Equity markets have provided corporates with growth capital for investments, besides active participation of banks, private capital, and efforts to deepen the domestic corporate debt market,” she tells TOI.Ranen Banerjee, Partner, Government Sector Leader at PwC India explains that the positive cycle of a large young population has supported the continued consumption growth feeding into per capita income increase and consequently further boosting consumption. “This has helped and will continue to help in the growth of the Indian economy,” he tells TOI.The services sector growth leading to large employment in the ITES sector has led to a significant increase in middle income families further aiding growth.India may become the world’s 4th largest this year, but with the highest population in the world, its per capita GDP remains abysmally low.A large population (1.4 billion) dilutes gains of the GDP doubling. Also, informal employment (~90% of workforce) and low female workforce participation (26% vs. global 47%) limit per capita gains, says Sachchidanand Shukla.Still, the per capita income has close to doubled over the last 10 years. “That is keeping pace with the overall GDP growth as the population growth is slowing down with fertility rates going close to the replacement rate of 2.2. However, there are regional disparities owing to differential population growth rates as well as pace of economic development,” says Ranen Banerjee.India will realise its dream of becoming a $5 trillion economy in 2027 and the world’s third largest in 2028 by overtaking Germany. But to be on the path of stable and sustained economic growth, experts stress on the need for continuous reforms.PwC’s Ranen Banerjee advocates for reforms that enable private enterprise to do business without the fear by decriminalising regulatory compliances with application of technology to support in compliances.“Progressive labour reforms incrementally to allow for greater acceptance of the changes should be the way forward making these changes in special business enclaves. A disproportionate investment in skilling will be key to make the youth employable as it will lay the foundation of social stability and prosperity,” Ramen Banerjee says.Also Read | India has the world's 7th highest gold reserves! Why is RBI buying gold and how does it help the Indian economy? “Enabling exports through common facilities for quality outputs by MSMEs and continued investment in infrastructure to bring down logistics cost and enhance evacuation capabilities will be needed,” he adds.L&T’s Shukla says, “Going forward India will need to undertake deep agricultural reforms, labour reforms, education & skilling at a scale along with judicial administrative & police reforms,” he says.Radhika Rao of DBS Bank sees the need to focus on employment generation. “Wheels of the structural engine will require to be oiled by keeping the development and reform agenda on track. Quality of growth is also likely to improve as macro balances remain in check alongside a changing trade composition. Lifting employment generation and by extension boosting incomes will be the vital objective for the administration in the rest of its term,” she says.There is little doubt that India is amongst the most important markets for all economies globally including the US and China. A stable political scenario at the central government level over the last 11 years along with continued reforms have bolstered global investors’ confidence. But for the fruits of this growth to trickle down to the entire population, it is important to ensure employment for the youth and a strong manufacturing sector base for sustained, stable, and reliable economic growth.","India was the 10th largest world economy in 2014 - come 2025 it will be the 4th largest - a six places jump in rankings in just 11 years!

MrBeast’s early life and how his career started

YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson , also known as MrBeast, has reportedly joined the ranks of billionaires, with Celebrity Net Worth estimating his net worth at $1 billion. This makes the 27-year-old content creator the eighth youngest billionaire globally, and the only one under 30 who built his wealth without inheritance. MrBeast began his YouTube career as a teenager, posting videos from his North Carolina home. His initial viral success came in 2017 with ""I Counted to 100,000,"" a video that took 44 hours to film and has since accumulated over 31 million views. Since then, he has gained recognition on the platform for his challenges, large-scale giveaways, and philanthropic content.In 2024, MrBeast was identified as a leading creator on the Forbes Top Creators list. While Forbes had previously estimated his net worth at $85 million, court documents from a 2024 lawsuit related to his food brand revealed his earnings were $223 million in 2023 and were projected to reach $700 million in 2024.His business ventures include Beast Burger , a delivery-only fast-food chain launched in 2020 that reportedly earned $2.3 million per month, though he later sued due to quality concerns. MrBeast also founded Feastables , a chocolate bar company that generated over $10 million in its initial months.Additionally, he co-created Juice Funds, a $2 million fund with Creative Juice that invests up to $250,000 in emerging creators. In the crypto and tech space, MrBeast holds Bitcoin and several CryptoPunks NFTs and is involved with platforms like Coinbase, Refinable, and the XCAD Network, which helps creators monetise videos with NFTs.His philanthropic efforts are equally extensive, as he established Beast Philanthropy, a nonprofit supporting large-scale charitable projects. MrBeast has donated over 100 cars, given away $1 million in a single video, and helped raise $20 million to plant trees through Team Trees.In 2023, he faced criticism for funding cataract surgeries for 1,000 blind individuals. In response, MrBeast reiterated his commitment, stating, “I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.”He made a similar pledge in 2019, outlining his life’s goal as ""make a bunch of money, and then give it all away while doing as much good as possible.""MrBeast's achievements have earned him various industry accolades, including a nomination for Vlogger of the Year at the Shorty Awards in 2019 and wins for Breakout Creator and 2020 YouTuber of the Year.His journey from counting to 100,000 on camera to building a multi-billion-dollar empire showcases a blend of creativity and generosity. MrBeast's career trajectory began in 2012 when, at just 13 years old, he started uploading videos under the username ""MrBeast6000.""His early content included gaming videos, often featuring Minecraft and Call of Duty, as well as videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers. He also created reaction videos and funny compilations, showcasing his willingness to experiment with different formats.By mid-2016, his main channel on YouTube had fewer than 30,000 subscribers, but his persistence led him to drop out of college later that year to pursue YouTube full-time.His growth accelerated through diverse real-world formats, including challenges, vlogs, and absurd tasks like watching paint dry for an hour or attempting to break glass with a hundred megaphones. He gained initial popularity with his ""Worst Intros on YouTube"" series.MrBeast is known for reinvesting nearly all his video earnings back into creating new content, allowing for increasingly ambitious productions. In 2021, he was the fastest-growing creator on YouTube, adding 37 million subscribers in one year.He has also expanded his content globally by launching separate channels for dubbed videos in over 10 languages, including Spanish, French, and Arabic, leading to substantial international viewership.

Here’s what Anand Mahindra said about India achieving a milestone in economic growth

Read Anand Mahindra’s post here

“When I was in business school, the idea of India overtaking Japan in GDP felt like a distant, almost audacious dream. Today, that milestone is no longer theoretical — we’ve become the world’s fourth largest economy.

It’s no small achievement. Japan has long been an economic colossus, with legendary productivity and resilience. That we’ve caught up is a testament to the ambition and ingenuity of millions of Indians — across sectors, generations, and geographies.



But as we celebrate, we must stay dissatisfied.

Because India’s next leap must be in per capita GDP, not just overtaking Germany…

For us to keep Rising, India needs sustained economic reforms — in governance, infrastructure, manufacturing, education, and capital access.”

India overtakes Japan to become the world’s fourth largest economy, says NITI Aayog CEO

Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra recently took to social media to acknowledge India’s achievement of becoming world’s 4th largest economy in the world.

"Tech layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike reshape workforce",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-layoffs-2025-over-61000-jobs-cut-as-microsoft-google-amazon-and-crowdstrike-reshape-workforce/articleshow/121359700.cms,"Tech layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike reshape workforce

Tech Layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut across more than 130 companies



Key stats (as of May 2025):

Total layoffs: 61,300+ employees

Companies involved: 130+

Sectors affected: Cloud computing, advertising, HR, devices, software engineering, sales

Microsoft: Streamlining leadership, prioritising engineers

Why Microsoft made the cuts:

Restructuring leadership layers to promote a flatter hierarchy

Investing more in engineering and product development

Optimizing global workforce by reducing duplication of roles

Google: Quiet workforce shifts behind the scenes

Strategic workforce realignment:

Focused layoffs across revenue-generating units

Elimination of redundant roles tied to aging product lines

A shift towards automation and generative AI technologies in advertising and consumer search

Amazon: Scaling back devices and emerging tech divisions

Behind Amazon’s cuts:

A realignment of priorities in consumer devices

Slower growth and usage rates of Alexa and Kindle platforms

Budget reallocation to cloud computing (AWS) and logistics optimization

CrowdStrike: Cutting 5% to focus on profitability

CrowdStrike’s layoff strategy:

Streamlining customer success and non-core support roles

Enhancing operating efficiency with AI-based threat detection tools

Reinvesting in international market expansion and enterprise sales

IBM: AI replaces jobs, but also creates new ones

IBM’s AI-driven workforce transition:

Use of AI automation in HR, reducing the need for traditional roles

Reinvestment in high-growth areas like quantum computing and hybrid cloud

Emphasis on reskilling and upskilling internal employees

Why are these layoffs happening? The 3 core reasons



1. Macroeconomic volatility

Global economic conditions remain unstable. Geopolitical tensions, high interest rates, and inflationary pressures have compelled tech companies to cut costs and bolster margins.

2. Post-pandemic growth corrections

During the COVID-19 pandemic, tech companies saw unprecedented growth and scaled their teams rapidly. As demand normalizes, many are right-sizing their workforces to match slower, more sustainable growth trajectories.

3. The AI revolution

Perhaps the most transformative factor is the rise of artificial intelligence. Tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot have already replaced or reduced the need for certain roles in coding, content creation, customer service, and HR. Companies are now prioritizing automation over expansion, leading to widespread redundancy across job functions that once required large teams.

What it means for the future of tech work

Emerging trends:

Fewer administrative layers, more direct reporting structures

Higher demand for AI literacy, even in non-technical roles

Greater reliance on contractors and fractional talent

Emphasis on remote and flexible work, with fewer full-time hires

Tech layoffs are defining the trajectory of the technology sector in 2025 — not solely due to innovation, but because of the sweeping workforce restructuring taking place across the industry. From global giants like Microsoft , Google , and Amazon to specialized cybersecurity firms such as CrowdStrike , companies are reducing headcounts in significant numbers. As of mid-May, more than 61,000 tech jobs have been cut across over 130 companies, according to data from Layoffs.fyi. Unlike previous downturns driven by financial collapses or market crashes, this wave is propelled by three powerful forces: slowing post-pandemic revenue growth, persistent global economic uncertainty, and, most notably, the rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in core business operations.These layoffs signal a broader transformation in how tech firms are responding to modern pressures. Rather than merely cutting costs, many are strategically reorganizing their internal structures, accelerating AI-driven automation, and reallocating resources toward long-term innovation and profitability.According to the data from Layoffs.fri, as of May 2025, over 61,000 workers have been laid off in the tech industry — a continuation of a trend that began in 2022 and escalated dramatically in 2023. Companies are now more strategic in their announcements, often avoiding large headlines by issuing smaller, staggered job cuts throughout the year. Still, the cumulative effect has created deep uncertainty among tech professionals worldwide.The layoffs are not restricted to startups or mid-size firms; the biggest names in tech — Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike — are among the most significant contributors to this tally. Let’s examine how each is navigating this reshuffling of talent and operations.In one of the largest individual cuts of the year, Microsoft laid off 6,000 employees, with nearly 2,000 roles eliminated in Washington state alone. This marked the company’s most substantial layoff since 2023. The job reductions span several business units, including support, administration, and middle management.According to an internal memo, the company is making these changes to “improve clarity of decision-making and better align teams with strategic priorities.” The layoff announcement also came with news of increased investment in AI-powered enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure.While Google hasn't made a single large-scale layoff announcement in 2025, it has been silently trimming its workforce across multiple departments. In May alone, 200 employees were laid off from its Global Business Organization (GBO) — a team that handles advertising sales and partner engagement. These cuts follow earlier reductions in the Pixel hardware team, Android division, Chrome operations, and Google Cloud.Google’s restructuring is part of a broader initiative to recalibrate its business model in the face of AI-led disruption in search and advertising, two of its most lucrative verticals. Rather than hiring aggressively, the company is being more selective, favoring AI talent over traditional business development roles.Amazon announced in April that it would cut around 100 jobs in its Devices and Services division, which includes Alexa, Kindle, and Zoox — its autonomous vehicle subsidiary.Amazon has long treated its devices division as an innovation lab. However, as pressure mounts to deliver profitability in every business line, the company is scaling back on experimental divisions and concentrating on proven revenue drivers like AWS and Prime logistics.Even high-growth cybersecurity companies aren’t immune. CrowdStrike announced layoffs impacting 5% of its global workforce, citing a shift towards long-term profitability amid rising costs and market volatility.CrowdStrike's decision is especially noteworthy as cybersecurity remains one of the fastest-growing segments of the tech industry. Yet even here, automation and AI are allowing firms to do more with fewer people, reducing the need for large support teams.IBM represents a hybrid approach to workforce management in the age of AI. While the company laid off several hundred employees, mostly from HR and administrative roles, it also announced new hiring plans focused on engineering, programming, and enterprise sales.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has been vocal about the company’s “AI-first” strategy, noting that while automation will eliminate certain roles, it will also create new demand for technical talent, especially in sectors where human insight remains essential.While the specifics vary by company, the underlying causes of the 2025 tech layoffs can be traced to three interwoven trends:The 2025 layoff wave is more than just a cost-cutting exercise — it is a strategic rebalancing of what work looks like in the digital economy. The shift isn’t just about reducing headcount; it’s about reshaping the types of roles that matter most.","Tech layoffs are defining the trajectory of the technology sector in 2025. As of mid-May, more than 61,000 tech jobs have been cut across over 130 companies. Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike are among the most significant contributors to this tally.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121360366,imgsize-148498,width-400,resizemode-4/Tech-layoffs-2025-Over-61000-jobs-cut-as-Microsoft-Google-Amazon-and-CrowdStrike-reshape-workforce.jpg"
"Donald Trump to Apple: That's Okay, you go to India but you're not going to sell in America without ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-to-apple-thats-okay-you-go-to-india-but-youre-not-going-to-sell-in-america-without-/articleshow/121404080.cms,"Poll Do you think tariffs will help boost US manufacturing jobs in the long term? No, it will hurt the economy. Yes, definitely.

President Donald Trump seems quite not-so-happy with Apple's decision to make in India. The US President Donald Trump announced that Apple can build factories in India but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the US if manufactured overseas. Speaking in the White House Oval Office during the signing of executive orders on nuclear energy, Trump referenced a discussion with Apple CEO Tim Cook , stating, ""I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn’t be doing this. He said he’s going to India to build plants. I said, ‘That’s okay, but you’re not going to sell into here without tariffs.’""Donald Trump stressed, ""We’re talking about the iPhone. If they’re going to sell it in America, I want it to be built in the United States."" Initially singling out Apple, he later broadened the tariff threat to include all smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung and Huawei, saying, ""It would be anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair."" The tariffs are slated to take effect by the end of June 2025.Earlier in a social media post on the same day, Donald Trump doubled down, writing, ""I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple to the US. American jobs come first!""During a recent trip to Doha, Trump had pressed Cook to focus on US manufacturing , noting India’s high tariffs make it a difficult market for US companies. He added, ""They’ve offered us a deal where they’re willing to charge us no tariff, but I told Tim, ‘I don’t want you building in India. Build here.’"" The US President highlighted that India’s tariff policies, among the highest globally, complicate market access, but he insisted on prioritizing domestic production.Apple CEO Tim Cook, addressing tariffs during Apple’s Q2 2025 earnings call, noted that they are determined by the product’s manufacturing location. Industry experts caution that relocating iPhone production to the US would sharply increase costs due to higher labor and operational expenses. If Apple passes these costs to consumers to maintain profit margins, iPhone prices could soar to $3,000 or more, potentially impacting demand. Analysts also point out that building a US-based supply chain would require significant investment and time, given the complex global network Apple currently relies on, primarily in Asia.The policy has sparked debate, with some economists warning that tariffs could raise consumer prices and disrupt global trade, while supporters argue it could boost US manufacturing jobs. The White House has not yet clarified how the tariffs will be implemented or whether exemptions might apply for companies investing in US facilities.In a related news, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly declined offer to join tech exectuives and representatives at Trump's recent trip to the Middle East. The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump, said a New York Times report.",President Donald Trump seems quite not-so-happy with Apple's decision to make in India.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Election Results 2025: Why AAP Lost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-election-results-2025-aap-lost-reasons-arvind-kejriwal-new-delhi-manish-sisodia-bjp-modi-incumbency-corruptio-sheesh-mahal-liquor-freebies-congress-rahul/articleshow/118023276.cms,"Here are 10 reasons behind AAP's defeat:



Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"
Donald Trump delays EU tariffs until July 9,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-delays-eu-tariffs-until-july-9/articleshow/121424819.cms,"



MORRISTOWN: US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he would pause his threatened 50-percent tariffs on the European Union until July 9, after a ""very nice call"" with European Commision president Ursula von der Leyen.Trump had threatened on Friday to impose the steep duties from June 1, voicing frustration that negotiations to avert a 20-percent ""reciprocal"" tariff were ""going nowhere"".But he agreed on Sunday to delay the tariffs until July 9 after von der Leyen said the European Union needed more time to negotiate.Von der Leyen ""just called me... and she asked for an extension on the June 1st date and she said she wants to get down to serious negotiation"", Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey.""And I agreed to do that,"" he added.Von der Leyen had earlier said on X that she held a ""good call"" with Trump but that ""to reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9"".""Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,"" said the head of the European Commission, which conducts trade policy for the 27-nation EU.European stock markets -- which had tumbled on Friday after Trump threatened the 50-percent tariff -- rallied on Monday as investors welcomed the delay.The Paris CAC 40 index rose 1.1 percent in morning deals while the Frankfurt DAX was up 1.6 percent. London and Wall Street were closed for holidays.Jochen Stanzl, analyst at trading platform CMC Markets, said the delay was a familiar ""Trump Pattern"".""The stock market seems to dance to Trump's tune -- first a threat, then a pullback, quickly followed by a rebound as speculative investors anticipate a concession from the US president,"" Stanzl said.Trump's trade policies have raised concerns that they could spark a recession and fuel inflation, while his stop-start tariff announcements have sent stock markets on a roller-coaster ride.- 'Serious negotiations' -Brussels and Washington have been negotiating in a bid to avert an all-out transatlantic trade war and had agreed to suspend tariff action on both sides until July.But Trump's threat on Friday dramatically raised the stakes.The US leader said on Friday he was ""not looking for a deal"" with the EU, repeating his oft-stated view that the bloc was created to ""take advantage"" of the United States.German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil called on Sunday called for ""serious negotiations"" with Washington, saying he had spoken to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the matter.""We don't need any further provocations but serious negotiations,"" Klingbeil, who is also Germany's vice chancellor, told Bild newspaper.""The US tariffs endanger the US economy just as much as the German and European economy,"" Klingbeil warned.The EU is subject to a 10-percent tariff that Trump imposed last month on imports from nearly every country around the world, along with 25-percent duties on cars, steel and aluminium.The US president originally imposed a 20-percent levy on the EU but subsequently suspended it, giving space for negotiations.EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic, who held talks with his US counterparts on Friday, said the bloc was ""committed to securing a deal"" but that trade ties should be based on ""mutual respect, not threats"".Brussels has announced plans to impose tariffs on US goods worth nearly 100 billion euros ($113 billion) if negotiations fail to produce a deal.The US trade deficit in goods with the European Union was $236 billion in 2024.But when taking account of services, where US firms are dominant, the European Commission calculates that the US trade deficit stood at $57 billion.Earlier this month, Trump reached a trade deal with Britain -- though he maintained the 10-percent ""baseline"" tariff on the country -- and he temporarily reduced his massive levies on China to give space for negotiations.","US President Donald Trump says he will pause his threatened 50-percent tariffs on the European Union until July 9.

Debt-stricken Sri Lanka and New Zealand discuss ways to deepen bilateral trade and investment ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/debt-stricken-sri-lanka-and-new-zealand-discuss-ways-to-deepen-bilateral-trade-and-investment-ties/articleshow/121411901.cms,"Winston Peters and Vijitha Herath (AP)





COLOMBO: Debt-stricken Sri Lanka hosted one of New Zealand's top ministers to discuss ways to deepen bilateral ties in areas such as trade, tourism and agriculture.Winston Peters, New Zealand's deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, met Sri Lanka's foreign affairs minister Vijitha Herath in the capital, Colombo, on Monday. The five-day visit by Peters is scheduled to continue until WednesdayThe visit comes as Sri Lanka struggles to emerge from its worst economic crisis, which began in the Indian Ocean island nation three years ago.The countries have improved relations in recent years, establishing a New Zealand embassy in Colombo in 2021 and a Sri Lankan embassy in Wellington this year.The discussion Monday focused on advancing ties in trade, investment, agriculture, education, and tourism, Herath said.""We also explored expanding trade links in high-potential sectors such as dairy, processed food, fresh produce and discussed improving market access for Sri Lankan products,"" Herath told reporters.He commended New Zealand's support in developing Sri Lanka's dairy industry, saying it had a ""transformational impact on rural livelihood.""Sri Lanka has embarked on an effort to expand and modernize its domestic dairy industry in recent years, but still produces only about 40% of the country's demand for milk and dairy products, while the balance is imported.New Zealand is a key supplier of those dairy products, especially milk powder.In 2024, New Zealand exported $335 million in goods to Sri Lanka, with dairy products forming the bulk.Trade balance between the nations favors New Zealand, which in 2024 imported goods worth $64 million from Sri Lanka, including tea, coffee, apparel and rubber products.The discussion included reducing red tape at the border and how to ""increase Sri Lanka's market access capabilities,"" Peters said.""We discussed the growing number of New Zealand companies working with and investing in Sri Lanka or looking to work with Sri Lankan partners,"" said Peters, adding that those collaborations will benefit Sri Lanka's tourism, agriculture and healthcare sectors.Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 with more than $83 billion in debt, more than half to foreign creditors. It sought the help of the International Monetary Fund, which approved a $2.9 billion, four-year bailout package in 2023 under which Sri Lanka was required to restructure its debt.In September last year, Sri Lanka said it had concluded the debt restructuring process after reaching agreements with bilateral and multilateral creditors and private bondholders. Sri Lanka is seeking to obtain $17 billion in debt service relief.Sri Lanka's crisis was largely the result of economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, along with 2019 terrorism attacks that devastated its important tourism industry. The pandemic also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad.","Winston Peters, New Zealand's deputy prime minister, met Sri Lanka's foreign affairs minister.
