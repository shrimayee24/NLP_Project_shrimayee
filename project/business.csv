Of course, the critical role that India plays on the global stage, working for peace, stability, security -- here as well, we are doing more and more together,"" he said.""So, coming off the UN General Assembly, coming off the meetings that we had with the QUAD and bilaterally, this is a good opportunity for us to take stock of the many issues that we are working together on -- working together in a way that betters the lives of our own people and I think makes a positive contribution to the world,"" Blinken added.Earlier in the day, Jaishankar had taken part in a discussion at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a top American think tank.He said of his meeting with Blinken, ""Let me begin by thanking you for a great meeting between the prime minister and the president in Delaware, for a very, very good QUAD meeting.

NEW DELHI: France has submitted its final price offer to India for the purchase of 26 Rafale Marine jets . This comes ahead of Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval 's visit to France. Defense sources told ANI that the French side has provided a significant price reduction after tough negotiations.India and France are in talks to buy the jets for deployment on the INS Vikrant aircraft carrier and various bases.A French team was in India last week to finalise discussions. The deal is expected to be discussed during the India-France Strategic Dialogue, where the Indian NSA is set to meet his French counterparts starting tomorrow in Paris.This deal is crucial for the Indian Navy as it aims to enhance its maritime strike capability. India has approved modifications in the letter of request, including integrating the indigenous Uttam radar in the jets. Although integration may take about eight years and be costly, it has been a point of negotiation.India had also requested France to integrate indigenous weapons on the plane, including the Astra beyond visual range missiles and the Rudram anti-radiation missiles. The deal's price is based on previous agreements, such as the rate of inflation, and the past deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets for the Indian Air Force.The Indian side will also receive a larger number of long-range air-to-air Meteor missiles and anti-ship weaponry in this project, which is planned to be concluded before the end of this financial year. Some of the Indian Air Force requirements have also been incorporated in the naval deal, including around 40 drop tanks and a small number of work stations for the planes.","India and France are in talks to buy the jets for deployment on the INS Vikrant aircraft carrier and various bases.

Why photo of IIT professor's 'torn socks' went viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-iit-professors-torn-socks-went-viral/articleshow/113856071.cms,"NEW DELHI: A photo of IIT Bombay professor Chetan Singh Solanki , sitting in a luxury hotel but wearing torn socks in New Delhi, has gone viral on social media, sparking a widespread conversation about sustainability and resource efficiency. Known as the ""Solar Man of India"" or ""Solar Gandhi,"" Solanki has responded to the viral attention, explaining the deeper significance behind his seemingly modest wardrobe choice.The picture, taken during a quiet moment before his speech at the Economic Times Energy Leadership Summit on 25th September, captured Solanki at the Hyatt in Delhi.Addressing the viral post, Solanki acknowledged his torn socks, saying, “Yes, my torn socks were exposed! I need to replace them, I will and sure, I can afford to – but nature cannot. In nature, everything is finite.”Solanki, a faculty member at IIT Bombay for over two decades, is well-known for his work in promoting solar energy and advocating for environmental sustainability. In his social media post, he explained that his decision to continue wearing the torn socks was a conscious effort to reduce waste and use resources more efficiently. “I may use the best gadgets to enhance my productivity, but I strive to use the least amount of material to reduce my carbon footprint,” Solanki wrote, emphasising his commitment to minimizing environmental impact.His efforts to promote sustainability go far beyond wardrobe choices. Solanki has travelled more than 43,000 kilometers across 20 states in India to raise awareness about solar energy and the need for environmental conservation. He compared his mission to that of a businessman seeking to maximize profits, saying, “Just as businessmen want to increase their profit on every investment, I as a ‘social worker’ want to maximize the impact of my time.”The professor’s remarks quickly resonated with social media users, with many praising his dedication to sustainability. One user humorously commented, ""Thanks, Chetan Singh Solanki, your example has given me the courage to come out of the closet as a fellow torn socks wearer! This is really reducing the carbon footprint!""Solanki’s post, accompanied by hashtags supporting sustainability, climate action, and minimalism, has further amplified his message of environmental responsibility. His work and personal choices continue to inspire others to rethink their consumption habits, making him a notable voice in India's efforts towards sustainability.","A photo of IIT Bombay professor Chetan Singh Solanki wearing torn socks in New Delhi has gone viral on social media.

India will be most rapidly growing economy: Professor Larry Summers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-will-be-the-most-rapidly-growing-economy-professor-larry-summers/articleshow/113825176.cms,"Photo/ANI

Larry Summers

, the Charles W Eliot University professor and president emeritus at

Harvard University

, believes that India is poised to be the fastest growing in the coming years, with the Modi govt laying the foundation. The former US treasury secretary, however, underlines the need to push ahead with reforms and suggests that India focuses on creating more jobs in services and construction.

China is seen as the big threat and the over-capacity impacting the global

economy

.

There are import restrictions on Chinese products due to strategic considerations, but it also means higher cost for consumers. Is there a need to strike a balance?

Do you see India ready to take advantage of the situation? How do you see the Indian economy playing out in the next five-seven years?

What are the big challenges?

Do you see generating jobs as a big challenge?

You and NK Singh had presented the reform roadmap for MDBs. How do you see the progress?

Is it time to undertake a similar exercise for the IMF?

Excerpts:China’s economic problems go back to the suppression of consumption. The US typically spends around 70% of GDP in household consumption and even during the second world war that number was close to 50%. China’s consumption has run somewhere in the less than 40% range. That means there is a large amount of resources that has to be devoted to something else. At some points that has been infrastructure but after laying more concrete in five years than the US did during the 20th century, infrastructure has run into diminishing returns.There is now clear overhang of residential real estate. China has been investing heavily in capacity for exports, often subsidized capacity, with very problematic implications for the rest of the world. This is an issue that is best addressed multilaterally by many countries rather than countries acting individually, but it needs to be addressed. Ultimately, I don’t see a way forward for the global economy that does not involve a more balanced Chinese economy with a substantially greater commitment to consumption-led growth. I am encouraged a bit by the steps that were taken but how forceful and effective those steps would be remains to be seen.It is very important, particularly when inflation has been a concern, to be very mindful of self-administered supply shocks. It is important that we avoid single points of dependence for key inputs. It is important that we are not overly vulnerable to China for technologies that are for our national defence. But it is also important that we minimise the cost of inputs that producers use, because it holds down prices and reduces inflation and makes our producers more competitive.The proposal for across-the-board large tariffs against China are almost completely misguided. The right policy involves finding a balance and confining protection to cases where it is motivated by resilience, national security, countervailing large subsidies. Simply seeking to protect because China has achieved a very high level of competitiveness is a strategy that is likely to boomerang in terms of the Chinese response and is likely to have adverse effects for inflation and purchasing power of working people.I am optimistic about India’s prospects to increase its GDP six-fold by the century of Independence and be the most rapidly growing economy in the world over the next five years, the next decade and the next generation among major economies. Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has been spectacularly successful as an energizer, putting in place infrastructure, establishing new initiatives in physical infrastructure and in intangible spheres involving payments or individual identities. I hope that in the years ahead, reform to assure strong and diverse incentives for initiatives allowing market forces to play can run strongly in the way that providing energy to broad public efforts has so far. It is in that way that the promise of the Indian economy best be realized.The geopolitics are substantial challenge. As there is an increasing axis between China, Russia and Iran, India will have to maneuver with great skill as its cooperates and seeks a more cooperative relationship with the US. India will have to work very hard in the age of AI to maintain its very strong presence in IT and all things digital. I also hope that India can continue the process where so much progress has been made of trying outwards and towards the world. The truth is that for most of the last 70 years the greatest barriers to India benefiting from globalization have been those put in place by the Indian govt and there is progress there, but there is still more room to grow in terms of reducing barriers.It is already a substantial challenge and is likely to be an increasing challenge. There is certainly a role to play in industry and manufacturing. My suspicion is that if India is ultimately successful, it will have a great deal to do with creating jobs in the service sector at a time when the service sector becomes much more expandable globally due to IT and also creating jobs in construction at a time when there is a great deal in India that needs to be built.The good news is I have welcomed the enthusiasm in the World Bank and other banks for accepting many of our recommendations and that is gratifying. On the other hand, the rubber meets the road in terms of resource mobilization and implementation, there it is less clear that the kind of transformative change to which Mr NK Singh and I aspired is yet in train. We will be watching very closely and offering our views in a candid and constructive way.Yes, the so-called resilience trust fund that was enacted after Covid moved only small amounts of resources to the developing world. There needs to be exploration of new facilities to support transformation to a green economy in some ways reminiscent of a system transformation facility that was enacted after the Berlin Wall fell when in a rather different way there were a set of economies that needed longer term support for structural transformation.There has been great emphasis on how volumes of lending from the World Bank can be increased within its current financial structure but rather less attention to those questions where the IMF is concerned. I am struck that no one was worried that the IMF was under-reserved when the value of its gold stock was half of what it was today. The financial capacity of the IMF can be substantially enhanced. It is important to insulate economies from external shocks and the type of facility IMF implanted during the oil shock period, where with low conditionality simply being in good standing, countries had ability to rapidly access financing if they suffered an important external shock from a change in interest rate environment or a change in the commodity price environment. It would be worth close examination at this moment.",Larry Summers believes that India is poised to be the fastest growing in the coming years. The former US treasury secretary underlines the need to push ahead with reforms. He suggests that India focuses on creating more jobs in services and construction.

"This winter may be harsh in North India due to La Nina conditions, indicates IMD",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/this-winter-may-be-harsh-in-north-india-due-to-la-nina-conditions-predicts-imd/articleshow/113863095.cms,"NEW DELHI: Summer monsoon, which ended on Monday in the 'above normal' category after recording nearly 8% higher than normal rainfall, is likely to fully withdraw from the country by mid-October and the winter monsoon will set in around the same time (by Oct 17) in the southeast peninsula, the IMD said on Tuesday. It also hinted at the possibility of a harsh winter in north India, specially northwest India, including Delhi-NCR and adjoining central region, as La Nina conditions are expected to form during Oct-Nov.La Nina is a climate phenomena associated with the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. Though it is linked to good monsoon rainfall in the Indian sub-continent, it remained absent during the southwest (summer) monsoon months despite forecasts by different global models.""There is a 71% chance that La Nina conditions will develop during Oct-Nov... The years when you have La Nina, temperatures in the northern part of the country, specially northwest India and adjoining central region, are below normal (colder than normal)... So, you can have cold wave conditions during winter months,"" said IMD chief, Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.He, however, underlined that its severity would be known only later as the La Nina condition is still weak and the Met department will have to monitor how much it will be strengthened in January or February. The IMD will follow it up and will be able to come out with a more precise forecast only in November.Good rainfall this year, however, was mainly due to other factors including six depressions, 14 'low pressure systems' in Bay of Bengal and one cyclonic storm 'Asna' in the Arabian Sea.Overall the ‘above normal’ rainfall during the season not only helped increase the acreage of the kharif (summer sown) crops beyond ‘normal’ (average of last five years) sown area, bringing hope of good crop output, but also filled reservoirs that take care of irrigation needs of rabi (winter sown) crops and hydro-power generation.Region-wise performance of the summer monsoon that technically ended on Monday showed a very unique feature of regional variation in rainfall this year with arid west Rajasthan receiving excess rainfall to the extent of 71% more showers than what it normally gets. Similarly, west Gujarat too received 75% more than its normal rainfall during the season.Mohapatra attributed ‘large excess’ rainfall in west Rajasthan and west Gujarat to formation of more numbers of ‘low pressure systems’ and ‘depressions’ that this year extended as far as Rajasthan and Gujarat. He also noted how the monsoon trough remained south of its normal position, bringing ‘large excess’ rains in both these meteorological subdivisions, covering 9% of the total area of the country.Out of the total 36 meteorological subdivisions in the country, two subdivisions received large excess rainfall, 10 subdivisions constituting 26% of the total area received excess, 21 subdivisions received normal rainfall (54% of the total area) and three subdivisions (Arunachal Pradesh, Punjab, J & K and Ladak) constituting 11% of the total area received deficient season rainfall.Data shows that Punjab and Arunachal Pradesh each received 28% less than normal rainfall whereas J&K and Ladakh got 26% deficit rainfall.",Summer monsoon ended on Monday in the 'above normal' category after recording nearly 8% higher than normal rainfall.

The commerce department recently expanded the import monitoring system for laptops and computers until Dec and may come back with a mandate to impose curbs later, sources indicated.The idea is to keep a close tab on devices that are part of Internet of Things , which are connected and there are fears that data may be accessible to firms and agencies across India's northern borders.As a result, checks on cameras, which now require mandatory certification by designated labs, came after gaps were noticed in the security framework in surveillance cameras. Some of the key components will need to be certified by the agencies before they can be used by Indian or other manufacturers, sources explained.Under the scanner is ""system on a chip"" or SoC, which is an integrated circuit (IC) that combines most, if not all, components of an electronic system onto a single chip.""The idea is to build a trusted supply chain for electronic goods as we do not want any weak links that can be tapped by foreign firms given that we are in a hostile neighbourhood,"" a source said.The change in stance from a tariff wall to a technical specification has been necessitated by the govt conceding policy space under WTO's IT Agreement-I (ITA-I). Besides, Chinese companies, which make the devices cheap, could have scaled the tariff wall and still controlled the majority of the market.Also, like the stipulation for CCTVs, which was first implemented for govt procurement, before being extended to the retail market, have helped Indian sellers prepare for the transition and develop the required supply chain to ensure compliance.This has emerged as a key learning given that the PC & laptop industry had last year sought to scuttle the govt's import checks on the grounds that the move would result in a short supply and push up prices, impacting consumers.","After security checks on CCTVs, govt may expand the ""trusted source"" mandate to other segments.

LAC situation 'stable but sensitive': General Upendra Dwivedi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lac-situation-stable-but-sensitive-general-upendra-dwivedi/articleshow/113862239.cms,"'Trust has become the biggest casualty'

NEW DELHI: The situation along the Line of Actual Control is “stable but sensitive and not normal”, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said on Tuesday, while stressing the armed forces “are operationally fully prepared to deal with any contingency” till China restores the status quo in eastern Ladakh as it existed before April 2020.“With China, you have to compete, you have to cooperate, you have to co-exist, you have to confront and contest,” Gen Dwivedi said.He also warned that India has to guard against the possibility that China was replicating its “grey zone warfare” tactics, underway in the South China Sea to lay claim to territory, along the 3,488-km LAC as well by relentlessly building and populating dual-use border villages there.In a candid fireside chat during a curtain raiser for the Chanakya defence dialogue, the Army chief said “trust has become the biggest casualty” in the continuing military confrontation with China after the People’s Liberation Army’s multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020.While “positive signalling” has come out from the flurry of political-diplomatic meetings over the last two months, the execution of any plan depends on the military commanders on the ground, he said, adopting a cautious approach.“What we have to understand is that the diplomatic side gives options and possibilities. But when it comes to the execution on ground, it is dependent on the military commanders on both sides to take those decisions,” he said.China has so far rebuffed India’s push for the sequential process of first disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok, followed by de-escalation and then de-induction of its over 50,000 troops from the frontier in eastern Ladakh. It also upped the ante in the eastern sector (Sikkim, Arunachal) as well, with another 90,000 soldiers deployed there.In the chat, Gen Dwivedi said, “We want the situation that existed pre-April 2020 to be restored, whether in terms of ground occupation situation, the buffer zones that have been created (after disengagement at other face-off sites) or the patrolling that has been planned.”“So, till the time that situation is restored, the situation will remain sensitive and we are operationally fully prepared to face any kind of contingency that will come,” he added.The Army chief said the “low-hanging fruits” -- the face-offs at Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso-Kailash Range and Gogra-Hot Springs -- had been resolved through a series of diplomatic and military talks.“Now, when it comes to the difficult ones (Depsang and Demchok), where we have different perceptions, both sides need to have a win-win situation. So, some kind of indications have been given from both the diplomatic sides,” he said.“Now, the military side will sit together and see how this can be translated on the ground. Everything we can think of is on the table along the northern front, and it includes Depsang and Demchok,” he added.As reported by TOI earlier, China has also been steadily building and populating as many as 628 dual-use `Xiaokang’ border villages along the disputed stretches of the LAC, especially in the eastern sector, to reinforce PLA positions as well as lay claim to territory.Asked about this, Gen Dwivedi said China was carrying out “artificial immigration and artificial settlements” through these border villages since there were no Chinese or Tibetan populations close to the LAC in most places. “In grey zone tactics, the causation may look very simple, but it may have a grandiose design behind it. That’s what we need to look into,” he said.“Do we call Doklam a war? Do we call Kargil a full-fledged war? Do we call Galwan a war? The answer is no. So all these are basically part of the grey zone battle. So, we need to be prepared for it,” he added","The situation along the Line of Actual Control is “stable but sensitive and not normal”, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said. He warned that India has to guard against the possibility that China was replicating its “grey zone warfare” tactics along the LAC.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113862245,imgsize-1483359,width-400,resizemode-4/113862245.jpg"

In 2017, CBI filed an FIR against the Roys and others, alleging criminal conspiracy, cheating, and criminal misconduct under various IPC sections and Prevention of Corruption Act.The FIR was based on a complaint by Sanjay Dutt of Quantum Securities Ltd, who claimed that RRPR Holdings Pvt Ltd, associated with the Roys, had obtained a Rs 500 crore loan from India Bulls Pvt Limited to acquire a 20% stake in NDTV through a public open offer.According to the FIR, RRPR Holdings also secured a Rs 375 crore loan (with Rs 350 crore disbursed) from ICICI Bank at 19% annual interest rate to repay the India Bulls loan. Dutt accused ICICI Bank of colluding, committing fraud, and conspiring with NDTV promoters to facilitate the transfer of ownership of a news broadcasting company to a shell company, violating various regulations and norms.The FIR stated that the Roys pledged their entire shareholding as collateral for this loan, failing to report the pledging to SEBI, stock exchanges, or Union ministry of information and broadcasting.Within a year, ICICI Bank agreed to a foreclosure of the loan, which allegedly resulted in a Rs 48 crore loss for the bank due to a partial interest waiver.In a separate case filed in 2019, CBI is investigating the Roys for allegedly violating foreign direct investment (FDI) rules between 2007 and 2009. The agency claims that an NDTV-incorporated company in London received a total FDI of US $163.43 million and invested the funds in various NDTV subsidiaries through complex transactions. The investigation in this case is ongoing.","The report cited ""insufficient legally admissible evidence"" regarding Rs 48 crore loss suffered by ICICI Bank during a loan settlement in 2009.

SC: We won’t allow ‘bulldozer justice’ for alleged crime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/authorities-have-to-justify-demolition-was-only-remedy-sc/articleshow/113862076.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court said Tuesday that it will soon frame guidelines on bulldozer action which will apply across the country and to all communities. It added that under these rules, there would be no restriction on govt authorities taking action against encroachers of public land, which can be done without prior notice.Even states of UP, MP, and Rajasthan, which have been accused of using bulldozers against alleged offenders, agreed that involvement in crime could not be a ground to take action.At the outset of the hearing, solicitor general Tushar Mehta , appearing for the three states, told the bench that involvement in a crime could not be the basis for bulldozer action and any demolition must be done as per municipal laws. He also said the practice of demolition notice being pasted on the house should be done away with and the notice should be delivered by registered post. But he said that if any restriction was put in place by the court, then it would be misused by real estate builders and violators and urged that the bench should consider that aspect also. He also said demolition drives were not confined to any particular community as was being projected.""We are a secular country. There cannot be different laws for different communities,"" the court added. The court said it would ensure that its order did not benefit encroachers and would not come in the way of authorities taking action against them. It said even religious structures built by encroaching upon public roads must be removed.Senior advocates C U Singh, M R Shamshad, Sanjay Hegde and Abhishek Manu Singhvi said municipal laws should not be allowed to be weaponised for law and order problems or to control crime. Agreeing with their plea, the bench said, ""We will clarify that demolition can't be carried out merely because someone is an accused or convict.""The court said the authority concerned would have to justify that demolition was the only remedy and added that a narrow window should be given to aggrieved persons to raise grievances before the appropriate forum.As the bench pointed out that about 4.45 lakh cases of demolition were reported in the country every year, the SG said the incidents brought to courts' notice (bulldozer justice) were less than 2% of that number.","Even states of UP, MP, and Rajasthan, which have been accused of using bulldozers against alleged offenders, agreed that involvement in crime could not be a ground to take action.

Sebi announces new measures to tighten F&O trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-announces-new-measures-to-tighten-fo-trading-effective-in-phases-from-november-20/articleshow/113858832.cms,"Upfront collection of option premium

Changes in contract size

Removal of calendar spread treatment on expiry day

Intraday monitoring of positions limit

Increase in tail risk coverage on the day of options expiry

Limiting weekly index expiry to one per exchange

Sebi study

NEW DELHI: The Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) on Tuesday introduced a more stringent framework for equity index derivatives consisting of six measures to protect retail investors from incurring major losses in equity index derivatives (F&O) trading.These measures are designed to ""protect investors and maintain market stability, particularly in the high-risk environment of index options trading on expiry days,"" as per the circular issued by the market regulator.The new framework introduced after Sebi's recent study on the the Futures & Options (F&O) segment of the market will be implemented in phases, starting from November 20.What are the six measures announced by Sebi:Sebi has mandated the collection of options premium upfront from option buyers by the Trading Member (TM) or Clearing Member (CM) starting from February 2025, in order to avoid any undue intraday leverage to the end-client, and to discourage any practice of allowing any positions beyond the collateral at the end-client level.The regulator further told that this shall also include net options premium payable at the client level.The market watchdog has also announced the increase in the minimum derivative contract size to Rs 15 lakh from which from Rs 5 lakh to 10 lakh which was last set in 2015, considering the threefold increase in broad market values and prices since the previous limit was established. This will be effective from November 20, 2024.""It has been decided that a derivative contract shall have a value not less than Rs 15 lakh at the time of its introduction in the market. Further, the lot size shall be fixed in such a manner that the contract value of the derivative on the day of review is within Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh,"" Sebi said.Sebi also announced that benefit of offsetting positions across different expiries, also known as 'calendar spread,' on the day of expiry for contracts expiring on that day will not be allowed from February 1, 2025.The regulator took this decision because substantial volumes observed on expiry days compared to other future expiry days and the increased basis risk associated with such volumes.""This would also align calendar spread treatment with a cross-margin framework on correlated indices having different expiries, wherein such cross-margin benefit is fully revoked at the start of the first of the expiring correlated indices,"" the circular stated said.Sebi has instructed exchanges to monitor intraday position limits for equity index derivatives, with at least four random snapshots to detect breaches, starting April 1, 2025. This was decided due the possibility of positions being created beyond the allowed limits, particularly on expiry day when trading volumes are significantly high.An additional 2 per cent extreme loss margin (ELM) will be levied on short options contracts on the day of expiry to address speculative risks, starting from November 20 due to increased speculative activity around options positions and the attendant risks.Sebi on rationalisation of weekly index derivatives announced that from November 20, exchanges can offer weekly expiry derivatives only for one benchmark index to check speculative trading.""Accordingly, in order to specifically address this issue of excessive trading in index derivatives on expiry day, it has been decided to rationalize index derivatives productsoffered by exchanges which expire on weekly basis.Henceforth,each exchange may provide derivatives contracts for only one of its benchmark indexwith weekly expiry,"" Sebi said in its circular.Futures and Options are financial derivatives that allow traders to speculate on asset price movements without owning the asset itself. The underlying asset can range from stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies to indices, exchange rates, or even interest rates.Although derivatives markets play an important role in price discovery, market liquidity, and risk management for investors, they also carry inherent risks. Sebi had formed an Expert Working Group (EWG) on derivatives to review the existing regulatory measures and suggest improvements in order to address these concerns and ensure investor protection and market stability.Later, a consultation paper was released by Sebi on July 30, based on the recommendations put forth by the EWG and the subsequent discussions held by Sebi's Secondary Market Advisory Committee (SMAC),Sebi then carefully reviewed the feedback received and engaged in further discussions with stock exchanges and clearing corporations before finalizing the measures to be implemented.A recent study carried out by the Sebi has highlighted concerning trends in equity futures and options (F&O) segment. The study reveal that around 93 per cent of individual traders consistently suffer major financial losses.Surprisingly, over 75 per cent of these loss-making traders continued their F&O trading activities, despite suffering losses year after year.The study further highlighted that the cumulative losses incurred by individual traders surpassed Rs 1.8 lakh crore during the three-year period spanning from 2021-22 to 2023-24.","Sebi introduced a more stringent framework for equity index derivatives.

Xionism In Lux: Why global luxury biz bosses will obsess over China’s communist boss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/xionism-in-lux-why-global-luxury-biz-bosses-will-obsess-over-chinas-communist-boss/articleshow/113855683.cms,"Xi signed off on a stimulus package for China, which, by its own record-breaking standards, is currently an economic laggard.

China’s boss hopes the stimulus will, among other things, get Chinese consumers to spend more.

Top end Chinese consumers have been especially spooked by serial blowups in the debt-ridden Chinese property sector. Real estate accounts for 70% of household wealth in China.

Xi’s periodic targeting of Chinese super-rich hasn’t helped consumer confidence either. If your govt is targeting you for being wealthy, getting the next ‘it’ thing in luxury loses its allure.

This was globally consequential because ever since its economic ‘miracle’, China has been a big spender on luxury goods . It accounts for nearly a quarter of global luxury sales.

. It accounts for nearly a quarter of global luxury sales. Most top-notch global luxury companies are European. Sluggish China sales had dampened their earnings and, therefore, stock prices.

More so because American, European, South Korean and Japanese luxury consumers started reducing their spending from last year.

Post-Xi’s stimulus, the hope was that Chinese will, sooner rather than later, spend more, including on luxuries.

In anticipation, stock markets pushed up share prices of major European luxury companies.

And that’s why the net worth of Bernard Arnault , boss of French luxury company LVMH (he and his family own 48% of the company) jumped. LVMH shares have risen 11% since Sept 24, when China made the stimulus announcement.

Not just luxury stocks

But bit of bad news for India

The $18 trillion question

'Xionism'

A hardnosed Chinese communist boss okays some policies, and an art-collecting French billionaire gets even richer. Weird? Not at all. Globally, the big money stuff often works like this.The link is demand. And it worked like this:Arnault isn’t the only luxury boss feeling richer. Top European luxury brands (the list includes British brand, Burberry) have all seen their stocks jump.Inof the extent of stock price jump betweenand, the list reads:Stocks of major auto companies, mining companies, and financial firms also jumped after the Chinese stimulus.It’s the same logic. If Chinese consumers start spending more, discretionary high-end products and services – diamonds to sleek cars to high-end investment advice – will see a jump in demand. Benchmark stock indices in the West rose for the same reason.Sensex and Nifty, despite some dampeners now and then, have been on fire. Thanks to good macro numbers, healthy GDP growth and a growing domestic investor class. But also, thanks to somnolent Chinese stock markets, which led global investors to put more money in Indian stocks. Post-stimulus, Chinese stocks staged a recovery. Result? Indian markets were hit on Monday and were flat on Tuesday.If Xi’s stimulus works as well as he hopes it would, a bull run in China’s stock markets may well get the Dalal Street bear out of hibernation. How bearish, will depend on how much FPIs switch from India to China and how much domestic investors can pump in.But will Xi’s stimulus really charge the nearly $18 trillion Chinese economy? As is frequently the case, economists don’t agree. Optimists argue that between making real estate financing easier and lowering mortgage and general lending rates, enough was done. Pessimists say Xi should have increased govt spending and okayed a bigger deficit to boost domestic demand.We don’t know who’ll turn out to be right. But we do know Europe’s luxury bosses will be obsessing over this question.The neologismwas created by The Times of India.","Xi signed off on a stimulus package for China, which, by its own record-breaking standards, is currently an economic laggard.

Elon Musk lost legal battle over unpaid severance to former Twitter employee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-lost-legal-battle-over-unpaid-severance-to-former-twitter-employee/articleshow/113852856.cms,"Elon Musk vs Ex-Twitter employee: Background on the case

Broader legal context

Musk's X facing legal troubles in Brazil

Also read

Elon Musk has recently lost a legal case involving unpaid severance to a former Twitter (now rebranded as X) employee who was laid off after Musk's acquisition of the company in 2022. As per reports, this legal ruling could significantly impact more than 2,000 ex-employees who have similar severance complaints following their layoffs after Musk's purchase of Twitter.The dispute arose after Elon Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, resulting in the mass layoff of over half of the company’s workforce.Former employees claimed they did not receive the proper severance pay they were owed after being terminated. These complaints have now culminated in various legal actions. One former employee took the case to arbitration, which led to a favourable ruling for the worker.The arbitration decision is a crucial development in the ongoing legal battles. Shannon Liss-Riordan, the attorney representing the former employees, stated that the arbitrator awarded full severance to her client. While arbitration proceedings are private, the ruling signals a significant victory for laid-off workers seeking compensation. Liss-Riordan expressed optimism about the potential for more favourable rulings, hoping that this decision would encourage Twitter/X to negotiate settlements for all affected employees.This case is not Musk's first legal challenge surrounding severance pay. In July, Musk's company won a separate lawsuit involving claims that it owed $500 million in severance to around 6,000 employees under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). While Musk’s company prevailed in that case, the recent arbitration ruling suggests that the legal battles are far from over, with 15 other cases having already gone through arbitration, and more expected to follow.In addition to severance disputes, Musk’s X platform faces separate legal challenges in Brazil. The Brazilian Supreme Court recently ordered the suspension of X’s services in the country, threatening a daily fine of over $900,000 if the company failed to comply. The court’s actions stem from X’s violation of a previous ban imposed by the court in August. X briefly restored access, which the Brazilian government deemed a violation of the court order. The court criticised X for ""unlawfully, persistently, and intentionally"" defying judicial orders and instructed the country's telecommunications agency, Anatel, to enforce the platform's suspension.Following the court's orders, X appointed a new legal representative, Rachel de Oliveira Conceicao, to comply with Brazilian laws. The company had previously lost its legal standing in the country after closing its offices in August, leading to the court’s decision to suspend X's services.","Elon Musk has lost a legal case involving unpaid severance to a former Twitter employee.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Malcolm Gladwell , the best-selling author ofone of the most important non-fiction books of the 21st century, is back with its dark sequelWhile discussing the new book with the Guardian, Gladwell calls out what he calls Harvard’s admission officers’ “bias towards affluent white students”.Pointing out the disparity between Harvard and an institution with a merit-based admissions process like Caltech compared to Harvard, he writes: “My suspicion is that for many people it’s unconscious, but there must be a point at which [Harvard admissions tutors] are confronting the fact that they have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their campus hasn’t become dominated by Asians and Indians.”In the book, Gladwell notes that Caltech, a highly competitive university with a merit-based admissions system, saw the proportion of Asian American students rise from 25% to 43% between 1992 and 2013.In contrast, at Harvard, where the admissions process is influenced by factors such as legacy, donor contributions, and athletic scholarships, the percentage of Asian American students has remained consistently between 15-20% during the same period. Indian applicants are even more likely to be excluded by Harvard’s application process.Gladwell goes on to argue: ""Meritocracy is one of the most beautiful inventions of the 20th century – it is a foundation of a free society.""Here are 10 other key points aboutand Malcolm Gladwell:Malcolm Gladwell was initially reluctant to revisit his debut work but ultimately chose to create an entirely new version, one that reflects today's more anxious world rather than simply updating the original.The foundational idea that social trends behave like epidemics, initially growing slowly before suddenly taking off, still holds true. However, some of Gladwell's original examples have not aged well.Gladwell now finds his earlier chapter on crime ""embarrassing,"" as he once credited New York City's crime reduction to 'broken windows' policing. He has since acknowledged that this approach led to over-policing in minority neighbourhoods and wasn't actually responsible for the drop in crime rates.Gladwell values the process of learning from errors, a trait he respects in his father. He proposes that authors should periodically reassess their original works every 25 years to stay aligned with new insights.The new book is darker and more nuanced than the original. It delves into how a small number of individuals can disproportionately influence significant events, such as the opioid crisis, where a minority of doctors were responsible for nearly half of all prescriptions.While The Tipping Point became a cultural phenomenon, Gladwell’s latest book explores how individuals with substantial influence can shape societal changes, both positively and negatively.Gladwell reflects on how male leadership failures over the past eight years make a strong case for female leaders, particularly in the current political climate.Gladwell has expressed his support for Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election, noting a personal connection through his mother, who shares Jamaican heritage with Harris's father.He argues that recent examples of male leadership failures have made it increasingly difficult to justify misogynistic attitudes and believes that America is ready for a female president.Now living with his partner and two young daughters, Gladwell views parenting as a journey of intellectual humility. He continuously adapts his understanding of his children as they grow and sees this phase of his life as a ""productivity mechanism"" that shapes his evolving perspective.","Malcolm Gladwell's new book, ""Revenge of the Tipping Point,"" is darker and more nuanced than the original.

'Must level playing field': California bans legacy admissions in higher education institutions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/must-level-playing-field-california-bans-legacy-admissions-in-higher-education-institutions/articleshow/113835915.cms,"California governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill on Monday that prohibits private colleges and universities from considering legacy preferences when evaluating applicants. The new law, effective in the fall of 2025, impacts some of the country's most renowned institutions, such as Stanford University and the University of Southern California .The legislation addresses growing concerns about equity in college admissions , particularly following a Supreme Court decision last summer that banned race-based considerations in the admissions process.The ruling shed light on how legacy status—an applicant's familial connections to alumni—has influenced admissions decisions at elite schools.Assembly member Phil Ting, a San Francisco Democrat and the bill's author, highlighted the importance of creating a level playing field in higher education, saying, ""If we value diversity in higher education, we must level the playing field.""By enacting this legislation, California joins Maryland as the only states to ban legacy admissions at private, non-profit universities. Other states, such as Illinois, Colorado, and Virginia, have implemented similar prohibitions, but only for public universities, the Guardian reported.To ensure adherence to the new law, private colleges and universities in California will be required to submit yearly reports demonstrating compliance. This oversight measure aims to ensure transparency and accountability within admissions processes as institutions adapt to the new legal requirements.California's legislation aligns with public opinion, as evidenced by a Pew Research study from April 2022, which revealed that 75% of Americans believe a student's relationship to an alumnus should not influence admissions decisions.","California governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill on Monday that prohibits private colleges and universities from considering legacy preferences when evaluating applicants.

Iran Launches Missile Attack On Israel, Causing Panic In Jerusalem | Watch

NEW DELHI: With Iran launching missile attacks on Israel late Tuesday night (India time) and the conflict set to worsen, airlines that used to overfly the region are scurrying for safety. Lufthansa ’s Tuesday flights from Frankfurt to Hyderabad and Mumbai returned to Germany as the airline decided not to venture in the war zone for safety reasons. Lufthansa’s Frankfurt-Hyderabad LH 752 and Frankfurt-Mumbai LH 756 were over Turkey when Iran launched missile attack on Israel.The aircraft turned back to Frankfurt. Consequently the return flights on these two sectors (India-Germany that these planes would have operated) early Wednesday have been cancelled.SWISS is avoiding the airspace over Iran, Iraq and Jordan. “This will increase flight times by up to 15 minutes on our Dubai, India and Southeast Asia services. Regardless of this short-term adjustment, Israeli and Lebanese airspace will be bypassed up to and including Oct 31,” SWISS said in a statement. Tuesday’s Zurich-Dubai flight diverted to Antalya in Turkey due to the longer route required to be taken. The aircraft will refuel in Antalya and continue its journey to Dubai outside the affected airspace.A Lufthansa spokesperson said, “Due to the current security situation, we are no longer flying through the airspace’s of Iraq, Iran and Jordan.” Tuesday’s Munich-Mumbai was able to operate.An Air India official said: “All our flights are assessed daily for any potential security or safety risks whether it is in the Middle East or any other part of our route network. Adjustments are made, if required, to avoid areas of risk with minimal impact on our non-stop operations.”Opsgroup — a global membership organisation for people in flight operations like pilots, flight dispatchers, schedulers, and air traffic controllers — had on Aug 1 released a “special briefing” on due to the increasing tension in the region. It said in the event of an “aerial attack” in the region, short notice closures of airspaces in Iran, Iraq and Jordan “are very likely.” It had advised members that “ongoing GPS spoofing, which can impact a multitude of aircraft systems, is predominant in two areas: Black Sea and Eastern Mediterranean.”This April also when the region as very tense, “GPS jamming and spoofing levels surged in the Middle East, with major blackout/interference spots apparent in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, as well as Israel. Traffic routing via Egypt and Saudi on a Middle East transit (Southern Route) should expect spoofing and be alert for early signs of that,” Opsgroup had said.Several pilots operating to the west say GPS spoofing and jamming is worsening by the day. “The moment we cross Iran-Pakistan border, jamming and spoofing start. This continues right till we clear Turkey in the west. The Russian airspace also has this issue, especially closer to the troubled regions,” say pilots.“We inform enroute ATCs about this and ask them to monitor aircraft position on radar. We are using the alternate DME-DME update that uses the plane’s last location to keep track of its location,” say multiple senior pilots. Airline crew are trained to deal with GPS jamming and spoofing. With multiple war zones and security theatres, this is becoming a real issue especially while crossing international borders and conflict zones as a bid to confuse crew. Airlines exchange notes on this issue in a real time basis.","Airlines that used to overfly the region are scurrying for safety.

"Royal Family News: Prince Harry is like mother Diana, seeking to entertain; William always jealous: Ex-bodyguard",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-harry-is-like-mother-diana-seeking-to-entertain-william-always-jealous-ex-bodyguard/articleshow/113855092.cms,"Just hours ahead of Prince Harry's UK event, William released an Instagram post

The Daily Beast

All eyes are on Prince Harry as he returns to the UK alone to attend a charity event but will not meet anyone from the Royal family -- amid reports that he wants a low key entry to the family. His former bodyguard who was also the bodyguard of Princess Diana, Ken Wharfe, said Prince Harry is like his mother to a great extent. Like Diana, Prince Harry is also an entertainer and he was like this since childhood.""Harry was always the court jester as a child,"" Wharfe said adding that Diana also liked to be entertained. ""People will say he’s actually very fun to be with, he’s very good in meetings, he’s always mindful and careful of how he speaks to his staff, which was a classic Diana,"" Wharfe said.""She was very generous, she was a gift giver, Harry is exactly the same. I do see similarities,"" Wharfe spoke about Diana.Before quitting royal duties, Harry was more popular that the Queen but now he has steadily become less popular among the British public since October 2019. At that time, Harry was liked by 71 per cent and disliked by 22 per cent of those polled but the latest poll conducted by Statista revealed that now Harry is liked by only 30 per cent and disliked by 60 per cent.Wharfe said Harry's popularity was a reason why Prince William was always jealous of him. And it seems nothing has changed as hours before Prince Harry attended the UK charity event, William posted his monthly rewind on Instagram -- a move to overshadow his younger brother's presence in the UK.William's friends, however, denied any link between his Instagram post and Harry's UK visit. The Prince and Princess of Wales’ social media accounts typically release a “monthly rewind” as a recap of each month. However, they often do so on the first of the following month. For example, the August rewind was posted on Sept. 1 and the July rewind was posted on Aug. 1. But the September rewind was posted on September 30.Prince William’s office declined to comment, though a friend of the prince’s told: “It’s the end of the month and at the end of the month they do release the rewind. I’m sure the time of day they did it had nothing to do with Harry. But I think what is notable is that it shows how much they do on a monthly basis, and if that has been inadvertently highlighted it’s no bad thing.”","Prince Harry is returning to the UK alone to attend a charity event but will not meet anyone from the Royal family.

UK shuts down its last coal power station,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-shuts-down-its-last-coal-power-station/articleshow/113827509.cms,"Image credit: AP

LONDON: Britain was the birthplace of coal power, the first country to build a coal-fired power station. It is now the first major economy to give it up.The last coal plant standing in the UK at Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire finished operations at midnight on Monday after powering the UK since 1967.The UK will now no longer use coal to generate electricity — ending its 142-year reliance on the fossil fuel — marking a major milestone in the country’s journey to net zero.The first public coal-fired power station in the world opened at London’s Holborn Viaduct in 1882, built by Thomas Edison’s Edison Electric Light Company.“This will be the first time since 1882 that coal has not powered Great Britain,” said Michael Lewis, CEO of Düsseldorf-based international energy company Uniper , which owns Ratcliffe.Ratcliffe has been a pillar of the UK’s energy security for decades and its cooling towers are an iconic site in the region. Built during a time when coal was the backbone of industrial progress, Ratcliffe powered over two million (20 lakh) homes and businesses — equivalent to the entire East Midlands region. It played a crucial role in boosting economic growth and supporting the livelihoods of thousands of people.“As we close this chapter, we honour Ratcliffe’s legacy and the people working here, while embracing the future of cleaner and flexible energy. Uniper aims to invest in technologies like CCS (carbon, capture and storage), renewables, and hydrogen. The goal is to decarbonize our remaining power assets and to deliver low-carbon fuel as well as green and reliable energy to our customers,” Lewis said.Ratcliffe’s countdown to closure began in 2015, when UK govt announced plans to end UK coal power generation. The govt confirmed the October 2024 end date in 2020.A local development order has been passed granting permission to turn the power station site into a low-carbon energy generation and advanced manufacturing space.Coal powered the industrial revolution, which began in Great Britain in the middle of the 18th century. The first coal mine in India was established by the British East India Company in Raniganj Coalfield, West Bengal, in 1774. Now, the UK has become the first major economy to end coal power and lead the world in moving away from fossil fuels and decarbonizing energy systems.Coal, considered to be the dirtiest fossil fuel and the world’s largest source of carbon emissions, accounted for only 1.8% of the UK’s electricity mix in 2020, compared with 40% almost decade ago.“It is an emotional day for me and the team,” Peter O’Grady, plant manager, said.“When I started my career 36 years ago, none of us imagined a future without coal generation in our lifetimes. I am incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved together over the years and to be part of this energy milestone, as the country focuses on a cleaner energy future,” O’Grady said.In January, all four of Ratcliffe’s 500MW units ran together for the last time. In June, the last delivery of coal by train arrived, carrying the final 1,650 tonnes shipment from the port of Immingham in Lincolnshire to the site. The percentage of the UK’s energy from renewables has grown significantly over the last 10 years — from 10.7% in 2014 to 39.5% in 2023.Michael Shanks, UK’s minister for energy, said, “The era of coal might be ending, but a new age of good energy jobs for our country is just beginning.”",Britain was the first country to build a coal-fired power station.

Osho: British woman reveals harrowing childhood abuse in Osho’s 'sex cult',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/british-woman-reveals-harrowing-childhood-abuse-in-oshos-sex-cult/articleshow/113824560.cms,"Prem Sangram opens up about her childhood experience in Osho's 'Ashrams'

A British woman spoke about the sexual abuse she has endured since the age of six across ' ashrams ' or ' Sannyasin ' communities. In an interview with the Times, the 54-year-old woman talked about the Indian mystic Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh , commonly known by his alias ' Osho '.Prem Sangram was allegedly abused and raped multiple times as a child in a sex cult .Sargam explained how her parents joined the Osho-led Sannyasin spiritual movement when she was a young child. The movement propagated that children should regularly watch sex and that girls going through puberty should be guided by adult men on their sexual journeys.'It was considered good for the children to be exposed to sexuality,' she told The Times, explaining how watching adults having sex was a regular occurrence for her.Sargam had moved to a Sannyasin commune in Pune, India when her family relocated from their home in Devon, UK after her father became disillusioned with his job and sought enlightenment from Osho.The movement believed that children were obstructions to their parents' sexual journeys.Sargam lived away from her parents in the children's quarters, where she received no education and would work 12 hours a day in the kitchen.After a year of coming to India, Sargam was groomed by an adult man at the age of 7, who would make her follow him around 'like a little dog' and bribe her with chocolate. 'It was only at 16 that I understood what had happened', she said.The sexual abuse on children in Osho's communes is explored in the upcoming documentary ' Children of the Cult ' . The film will tell the story of three British women, including Sargam, who managed to escape the cult.Sargam only opened up about her past three years ago on Facebook , when she wrote an open letter to her abuser.'Even in my [seven]-year-old mind, I thought what a strange thing to be doing. I was already becoming very mentally and emotionally confused.'Sargam said that she and her friends were expected to perform different sexual acts on grown men who lived in the commune at a very young age.By the age of 12, Sargam had relocated to the US to be with her mother, who was working in an ashram in Oregon.Hundreds of young children were subjected to in Rajneesh's global communes despite the abuse allegations.According to The Times, there was just one investigation by US Child Protection Services into the Oregon cult.Netflix released a documentary about the cult's Oregon branch in 2018 called 'Wild Wild Country', but there was no mention of the children's experiences of sexual abuse and neglect.Osho's unorthodox meditation techniques attracted tens of thousands of followers from all over the world, including celebrities and other famous personalities.Rajneesh's teachings were a bizarre mixture of pop psychology, ancient Indian wisdom, capitalism, sexual permissiveness and dirty jokes that he gleaned from the pages of Playboy magazine, according to a philosophy lecturer who, in 1970, founded a spiritual movement and commune in Pune, near Mumbai (formerly Bombay).Rajneesh argued that monogamous marriage was unnatural and restrictive. He encouraged unrestricted promiscuity, which is having multiple sexual partners, along with partner-swapping, from the age of 14.Osho was known as the 'Sex Guru' in India while in the US he was called the 'Rolls-Royce Guru' given the fact that he owned 93 luxury cars, according to the Daily Mail.Osho's followers were often highly educated professionals ready to reject the structures of middle-class norms and seek enlightenment first in India and later at other communes.A lot of followers left their spouses and children, while others donated everything they had to the cult.The Sannyasin spiritual movement attempted to build a $100 million city in Oregon. However, this utopic idea became the group's downfall in the Eighties.Indan authorities started an investigation over immigration fraud, tax evasion and drug smuggling on Osho when he moved to Oregon in 1981. The group bought a 64,000-acre ranch near Antelope, where 7,000 followers overwhelmed the town's 50 residents.The group initiated a construction on a self-sustaining 'Rajneesh' city intended for 50,000 residents. The settlements would include houses, shops, restaurants and even an airport. However, Osho faced strong opposition from local politicians who believed he was leading a dangerous cult.Rajneesh was charged with immigration fraud and deported back to Pune, India, where he died of heart failure in 1998. Despite the cult's downfall, a small number of Rajneeshi followers still exist today.",Prem Sangram was allegedly abused and raped multiple times as a child in a sex cult.

Mike Lynch: Widow of tech billionaire faces $250M lawsuit for ‘reputational damage’ following Bayesian Superyacht sinking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/widow-of-tech-billionaire-faces-250m-lawsuit-for-reputational-damage-following-bayesian-superyacht-sinking/articleshow/113610848.cms,"A lawyer representing the builder of the Bayesian superyacht , which sank off the coast of Sicily, has filed a lawsuit against the widow of tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch for nearly $250 million,on Friday, alleging that the accident inflicted “reputational damage” on the shipbuilder , according to the New York Post.The lawsuit lodged in Palermo by lawyer Tommaso Bertuccelli on behalf of The Italian Sea Group (TISG), places the blame for the vessel’s sinking on Lynch's widow, Angela Bacares , and the boat crew.It claims that TISG suffered significant business losses as a result of the sinking.However, TISG quickly distanced itself from the lawsuit, asserting that it had not authorised the filing and requesting that Bertuccelli withdraw the claim. “The Italian Sea Group … strongly denies the claims published in [Italian newspaper] La Nazione regarding a legal action following the Bayesian tragedy,” a spokesperson said. “Although TISG has given a generic mandate to the lawyers named in the article, no legal representative of the company has examined, signed or authorized any writ of summons.”Mike Lynch, a British billionaire, lost his life on August 19 when a fierce storm struck the $40 million yacht he was aboard. The incident also claimed the lives of six others, including Lynch's 18-year-old daughter, Hannah Lynch. Among the deceased were Jonathan Bloomer, Chris Morvillo, Neda Morvillo, Charlotte Golunski, Ayla Ronald and Angela Bacares.TISG has stated that it will not seek damages from the crew or Lynch’s widow. Giovanni Costantino, TISG's CEO, had previously branded the yacht “unsinkable” and indicated that human error was to blame for the disaster. However, he has faced backlash for his handling of the situation, with critics saying he is trying to shift blame amid a growing public relations crisis.","Lawyer representing the builder of the Bayesian superyacht has filed a lawsuit against the widow of tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch.
