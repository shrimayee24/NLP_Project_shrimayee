NEW DELHI: The central government is all set to be tabled the Waqf (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on Wednesday amid strong resistance from the opposition.While the BJP-led government claims that the bill would improve the administration and management of Waqf properties in the country, the opposition has termed it a ""targeted legislation"" and ""fundamentally against the Constitutional provisions.""BJP's allies -- TDP and JDU -- have offered their support to the bill, with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar-led JDU urging the legislation's implementation not be retroactive.The name of the two bills are- Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, and the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2024. It was introduced in the Lok Sabha on August 8, 2024.It aims to modify the Waqf Act, 1995, to address challenges in the regulation and oversight of Waqf properties. The proposed amendments focus on enhancing the administration and ensuring more effective management of Waqf assets across India.Following are the issues regarding the Waqf board, according to the central government:In central Waqf council, 2 out of 22 members (excluding ex-officio) can be non-Muslims.In state Waqf boards, 2 out of 11 members (excluding ex-officio) can be non-Muslims.Muslim-created trusts will no longer be considered Waqf, ensuring full control over trusts.A centralized portal will automate Waqf property management, improving efficiency and transparency.Only practicing Muslims, for at least five years, can dedicate their property to Waqf, restoring pre-2013 rules.Registered properties remain Waqf unless disputed or identified as government land.Women must receive their inheritance before Waqf dedication, with special provisions for widows, divorced women, and orphans.Mutawallis must register property details on the central portal within six months.An officer above the rank of Collector will investigate government properties claimed as Waqf.A structured selection process and fixed tenure will ensure efficient dispute resolution.Two non-Muslim members will be included in the Central and State Waqf Boards for inclusivity.Waqf institutions' mandatory contribution to Waqf Boards will be reduced from 7% to 5%.The Limitation Act, 1963, will now apply to Waqf property claims, reducing prolonged litigation.Waqf institutions earning over Rs 1 lakh must undergo audits by State-appointed auditors.Section 40 is removed, preventing Waqf Boards from arbitrarily declaring properties as Waqf.","The Waqf Act, 1995, and its 2013 amendment have been ineffective, leading to issues such as illegal land occupation, mismanagement, delays in registration and surveys, and a surge in litigation and complaints to the ministry.

Government set to push for Lok Sabha nod for Waqf Bill on Wednesday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-set-to-push-for-lok-sabha-nod-for-waqf-bill-today/articleshow/119887848.cms,"TDP, JDU & LJP say their suggestions on

waqf bill

accepted, set to vote in support

NEW DELHI: Defying resistance from opposition parties and Muslim bodies like All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), the govt has decided to seek passage of Waqf (Amendment) Bill in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, clearing the way for a showdown in the House.With the numbers arrayed on its side thanks to support from 'secular' allies TDP, JD(U) and LJP, the govt has also decided to push for the bill to be passed by Rajya Sabha on Thursday.The INDIA bloc met on Tuesday evening and decided to participate in the debate and oppose it with gusto, with the leadership agreeing against any disruption or boycott when the legislation is taken up.Sources said there was complete unanimity that opposition should put forth its viewpoint on Waqf (Amendment) Bill forcefully. They will seek voting on the bill.Govt's urgency and determination, significant in view of the 'black armband' protest by Muslim organisations in different parts during Eid prayers, was evident at the business advisory committee (BAC) meeting Tuesday with govt not agreeing to opposition's demand for a 12-hour discussion in LS, something which would have raised doubts about passage of the bill in Parliament by Friday when the Budget session concludes. Lok Sabha will now have an eight-hour debate which, by all accounts, is going to be a stormy affair.A teaser of what could unfold was on display at BAC meeting when opposition, unhappy with Speaker Om Birla's assurance that he was open to extending the debate depending on the views of the House, walked out.Majority of the parties, including BJP, Congress and their respective allies, have issued whips to their MPs to attend the House for the next couple of days, beginning with Wednesday noon when minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju is scheduled to introduce the bill, redrafted in accordance with the suggestions made by a joint parliamentary committee.However, the political heat and length of the debate are unlikely to have any bearing on the final outcome as the numbers heavily favour NDA. The strength of the alliance in LS is 293, comfortably ahead of the majority mark in the 542-member House.Even in Rajya Sabha, NDA has surpassed the majority mark with 126 members on its side in the House of 236 members, including two independents and six nominated members, who invariably vote in support of the govt. A few abstentions are not ruled out, sources said.Meanwhile, opposition bloc dubbed the bill ""unconstitutional, anti-minority and anti-Muslim"". It said the bill was brought with the idea of harassing one religious community. Led by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, it was decided that opposition should rebuff the possibility of disruption, and should not boycott or walk out. ""The House should run smoothly and all should speak on the bill,"" sources quoted Kharge as saying at INDIA bloc meeting.Arvind Sawant of Sena UBT said, ""Opposition is united. This bill is divisionary. We will take part in the discussion and see if govt has incorporated our suggestions and amendments in the bill.""BJP allies TDP, JDU and LJP, which had initially expressed reservations over some aspects of the bill, came around claiming that their suggestions, based on feedback from their Muslim constituents, were incorporated in the new bill.","Govt decides to seek passage of Waqf (Amendment) Bill in Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Funding by US Agency for International Development (USAID), which has been under attack from the Trump administration for promoting a ""left, liberal and woke"" agenda abroad, has come under ED's scanner in connection with an ongoing probe against hedge fund operator George Soros.ED, which was probing three Bengaluru-based companies for alleged breach of Foreign Exchange Management Act in receiving Rs 25 crore from Soros Economic Development Fund , has found that one of those, ASAR Social Impact Advisors, also received Rs 8 crore from USAID as foreign inward remittance in 2022-23.The three companies received Soros's funds between 2021 and 2024. Sources said ASAR explained that the USAID funding was reimbursement for the services it provided to a Delhi-based public policy think tank, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), which, according to its website, is focused on ""understanding global challenges and implications for India's development"".CEEW has former deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Suresh Prabhu, who served as a minister in the first Modi govt, as its trustees.ASAR officials were unable to explain the nature of services provided to CEEW and how USAID came into the picture. ASAR and CEEW did not respond to TOI's queries on the ED probe.Sources identified Rootbridge Services Pvt Ltd and Rootbridge Academy Ltd as the other two Bengaluru-based companies that had received funding from SEDF, which is the impact investment arm of Open Society Foundations, one of the several entities founded by Soros.ED is looking for the motive and purpose of these payments made by USAID. Sources said Open Society Foundations was placed under 'prior reference category' by the home ministry in 2016 on account of ""undesirable activities"" - a categorisation which required it to seek prior sanction from the ministry in order to contribute funds to any Indian non-profit organisation.With regard to ASAR and the two other Bengaluru-based entities, ED probe will also look into whether OSF complied with the mandatory requirement. The agency is also probing Soros's funding of Indian civil rights organisations, think tanks and other entities in the garb of foreign direct investments.","US Agency for International Development (USAID) has been under attack from the Trump administration for promoting a ""left, liberal and woke"" agenda abroad.

Why BJP pitch for Waqf reforms may find support among a section of Muslims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-bjp-pitch-for-waqf-reforms-may-find-support-among-a-section-of-muslims/articleshow/119875363.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Waqf Amendment Bill is all set for Parliament nod with the BJP managing to convince its allies about the benefits of backing the legislation. This even as the INDIA bloc of opposition parties have been very vocal and united in their opposition to the Bill claiming that it harms the interests of the Muslims.If the government succeeds in getting the Bill passed - in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, it will be the second big change that the BJP would have pushed to implement in the minority community after making the practice of triple talaq illegal in 2019.However, there is one major difference between then and now. In 2019, the BJP had absolute majority in Lok Sabha while it is now dependent on support of key allies for the survival of its government.So, how did the BJP managed to convince its key allies, especially Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar , who have enjoyed considerable support of the minorities over the years?Both Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U) have announced to support the Bill and have issued a whip to their MPs to vote for the legislation. Earlier in the day, the JD(U) had announced that it was against retrospective implementation of the law and had hoped that the government would consider its demand.Interestingly, there are a lot of similarities in the way the BJP has pitched for these legislations then and now.The Triple Talaq Bill found support of many parties as it favoured the women of the community by protecting them from arbitrary divorce by men - which was a common practice over the years.Similarly, the BJP now pitched the Waqf Amendment Bill as a reform measure that would help the poor among the Muslims, who, the party claimed, had no say in the affairs of the community.Jagdambika Pal, chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the Waqf Amendment Bill, summed up how the legislation would benefit the poor members of the community. ""We’ve now prepared a 400-page amendment, which addresses the needs of the country’s minorities. This law aims to support vulnerable groups, including the poor, women, orphans, widows, and economically backward Muslims,"" he said.Union parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju asserted that those opposing the Bill are ""powerful people"" who have encroached upon the Waqf properties.The Union minister asserted that the amendment bill was in interest of poor Muslims, children and women and would ensure accountability and transparency when it comes to managing properties under the Waqf board.BJP MP Dinesh Sharma claimed that the Waqf Bill was like a ""dream come true"" for the underprivileged Muslims.""Waqf is like a dream come true for poor Muslims. This is going to fix their plight. This bill is going to end the corruption prevailing in Waqf and the nexus of real estate and builders. This bill will be the roadmap for the underprivileged education, employment, house, and basic needs,"" Sharma said.""Government of India has made it very clear and even the committee chairman that they are not renewing the Waqf Board itself but they are only amending certain clauses and issues, which will enable the poor Muslims to have representation in the Waqf Board and women and other genders in Muslim community ,"" he added.Already, some BJP leaders have claimed that the opposition parties and some leading Muslim organisations are opposing the Waqf Bill as they fear a section of the Muslims would start voting for the saffron party.Perhaps, the BJP hopes to once again create a divide between the rich and the poor within the community by pushing through the ""reform"" legislation and eventually make some electoral gains.",Both Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U) have announced to support the Bill and have issued a whip to their MPs to vote for the legislation.

Giving the background of RSS's support for the movement started by ""sadhus and sants"" for construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and saying the Sangh would not stop its members from supporting the efforts of VHP and others for taking possession of sites of Kashi Vishwanath Mandir in Varanasi and Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura, Hosabale suggested that the push for mass re-conversion of mosques allegedly built on temple sites fell into a different category.""But if we talk about all the other mosques and structures, should we start digging up 30,000 mosques and attempt to reverse history? Would that not create more hostility and resentment in society? Should we move forward as a society or stay stuck in the past? How far do we go in history?"" Hosabale said in an interview with Kannada weekly, Vikrama.Delineating the stand which was first articulated by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, the Sangh general secretary said the demand for control of allegedly disputed mosque sites could only be pursued at a huge cost to society's other priorities like eradication and untouchability. ""If we keep doing this, when will we focus on other vital societal transformations? What about eliminating untouchability? How do we instil values in youth?"" he said.Hosabale, who is next only to Bhagwat in hierarchy, also seemed to caution that single-minded pursuit of the reclamation agenda could be at the expense of other issues which have been of equal concern for those pushing for it - preservation of culture and languages, conversions, cow slaughter, love jihad. ""The Sangh has never said anybody should ignore or not work on these issues,"" he said.Hosabale further said the movement for re-conversion of disputed sites was not in keeping with the conception of a temple. ""Consider the concept of a temple. Is a former temple that has been turned into a mosque still a divine space? Should we focus on finding Hindutva in remains of a stone structure, or should we awaken Hindutva within those who have distanced themselves from it? Instead of searching for traces of Hindu heritage in stone buildings, if we revive the Hindu roots within them and their communities, the mosque issue will resolve on its own,"" he told Vikrama.",RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale has made it clear that Sangh was against the idea. Sangh would not stop its members from supporting the efforts of VHP and others for taking possession of sites of Kashi Vishwanath Mandir and Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119887721,imgsize-1172514,width-400,resizemode-4/119887721.jpg"

The court emphasized that the right to shelter is a fundamental right and must be protected under the rule of law.

'These cases shock our conscience': SC on illegal Prayagraj demolitions

NEW DELHI: Noting that a message has to be sent to ""make govt authorities remember"" that right to shelter is a fundamental right and rule of law is part of the basic structure of the Constitution, Supreme Court Tuesday directed Prayagraj Development Authority to pay compensation of Rs 10 lakh each to five people whose houses were illegally razed in 2021, setting a benchmark for the fine to be paid for resorting to what has come to be known as "" bulldozer justice "".A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan rejected the state govt's plea to refrain from awarding compensation as the aggrieved people were not poor and owned multiple houses. Attorney General R Venkataramani, appearing for the state, said the constructions were illegal and illegality should not be compensated.The court said there was a procedure prescribed before demolition and the facts of the case were shocking as houses were razed within 24 hours of proper notices being served. The demolition was done on March 7, 2021, in which the houses of a lawyer, a professor and others were razed. Notice was served to them on March 6.Authorities, especially the development authority, must remember that the right to shelter is a fundamental right and an integral part of Article 21 of the Constitution. They should also know that there is something called rule of law which is a basic feature of the Constitution, the SC bench said.As stated earlier, no effort was made to serve them notices in person or by registered post. Only communication dated March 1 was sent by registry which was received on March 6 and demolition was carried out on March 7. The applicant was deprived to avail the appeal against the decision. Therefore, demolition is illegal, the bench added.""Considering the inhuman and illegal manner in which demolition was carried out, we quantify the compensation of Rs 10 lakh each to the appellants and direct the Prayagraj Development Authority to pay compensation to the appellants,"" court said.It added that the practice of affixing notice on the house had to stop which could be done as a last resort after notice could not be served in person.The bench said ""these cases shock our conscience and this should never happen"". Justifying its harsh order against Prayagraj Development Authority, the bench said this would discourage the authority from carrying out such exercises without following due procedure.The petitioners in the case are advocate Zulfiqar Haider, professor Ali Ahmed and three other individuals. They moved the apex court after Allahabad HC dismissed their plea against the demolition. Granting them relief, the court said Section 27 of UP Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973, states that if a building is constructed in violation of the master plan or without proper approvals, the development authority may order its demolition after providing the owner with a reasonable opportunity to show cause.In the previous hearing, the court had said that the state must act ""very fairly and must give reasonable time to enable the aggrieved person to file an appeal before the structures are demolished"".","The Supreme Court of India mandated the Prayagraj Development Authority to compensate five homeowners, whose houses were unlawfully demolished in 2021, with Rs 10 lakh each.

Ready to walk the tough road to rebuild India-China ties: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ready-to-walk-tough-road-to-rebuild-china-ties-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri/articleshow/119887176.cms,"NEW DELHI: The nascent warmth in Sino-Indian ties was on full display again Tuesday as President Droupadi Murmu and PM Narendra Modi exchanged messages with their counterparts, Xi Jinping and Li Qiang respectively, on the 75th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between the 2 countries and foreign secretary Vikram Misri joined an event hosted by Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong to mark the event. Speaking on the occasion, Misri said such celebrations would become even more meaningful if “promising beginnings” in the relationship are translated into tangible benefits for the people of India and China.The foreign secretary said that the road ahead – of rebuilding ties based on mutual respect, mutual sensitivity, and mutual interests – was not going to be an easy one but India was prepared to walk on it. “We are looking at the next steps to resume practical cooperation between our two countries, and amongst the first of these steps is the resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar yatra this year,’’ he said.According to a Chinese readout, Modi told Li in his message that progress in bilateral relations will contribute not only to global stability and prosperity but also to the emergence of a multipolar world.In his message to Murmu, Xi said both India and China are important members of the Global South and at a critical stage in their efforts to modernise, reiterating China’s position that an elephant-dragon tango will completely serve the fundamental interests of both countries. According to a Chinese readout, the 75th anniversary of ties was an opportunity to promote “strategic mutual trust…jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in China-India border regions, advance China-India relations on the track of sound and stable development”.Ties between the 2 countries have improved considerably since the agreement in October 2024 to complete the troop disengagement process in eastern Ladakh and the first Modi-Xi bilateral in 5 years in Russia’s Kazan that took place on October 23. Russian ambassador Denis Alipov was present at the event hosted by the Chinese embassy.Modi said recently in a podcast that normalcy had returned in the border areas since his meeting with Xi and he expected trust to return too in the relationship slowly but surely.Misri said that India and China had resolved several issues along the border areas, adding peace and tranquillity in the border areas is critical for the smooth development of overall bilateral relations.“And it is on the basis of this fundamental understanding, which was shared in the meeting between PM Modi and President Xi Jinping in Kazan, that both of us are now working together to chart a road map for our bilateral relations to return to a stable, predictable, and amicable path,’’ said Misri. In an interview with Global Times on Tuesday, the Chinese ambassador said that China was ready to import more goods from India to strengthen trade but also expected India to create a fair and transparent business climate for Chinese companies.","The nascent warmth in Sino-Indian ties was on full display again Tuesday.

BJP allies shift stance, back Bill



Christian organisations support Bill



Govt defends Bill as reform measure



Oppn, Muslim groups strongly oppose Bill



NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha is set to deliberate on the long-debated Waqf Amendment Bill on Wednesday, with the ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) pushing for its passage and the opposition strongly condemning it as ""unconstitutional.""""This Bill is unconstitutional. This Bill is a grave violation of Article 14, Articles 25, 26 and 29. This is not Waqf Bill rather it's a Waqf Barbaad Bill,"" said AIMIM 's Asaduddin Owaisi However, the ruling coalition holds the advantage in both Houses of Parliament, making the Bill's eventual passage likely possible despite the opposition's strong resistance.Minorities and parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said that the Lok Sabha’s Business Advisory Committee (BAC), chaired by Speaker Om Birla has agreed to an eight-hour debate.The session could be extended based on the House’s consensus.Tensions flared as Congress and several opposition INDIA bloc members staged a walkout from the BAC meeting, accusing the government of suppressing their voices. Congress deputy leader Gaurav Gogoi criticised the limited debate time and demanded discussions on additional issues, including the situation in Manipur and concerns over electors’ photo identity cards.Despite opposition resistance, the NDA is well-positioned to pass the Bill, holding 293 MPs in the 542-member House. Key allies include the Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) with 16 MPs, Janata Dal (United) with 12, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) with 5, and the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena with 7 MPs.In the Rajya Sabha, the NDA holds a total of 125 MPs representation, including BJP’s 98, JD(U)’s 4, Ajit Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)’s 3, and TDP’s 2. The Bill will be taken up by the Upper House following its passage in the Lok Sabha.The Congress has criticised JD(U) and TDP for supporting the Bill, calling it an ""attack on the Constitution."" The grand old party's Jairam Ramesh said, ""Every opposition party opposes it, but what is the stand of so-called secular parties JD(U) and TDP?""Initially, some NDA allies, including JD(U), TDP, and LJP (Ram Vilas), had reservations about the Bill.However, they later extended their support after a parliamentary joint committee incorporated their recommendations. JD(U) MP Sanjay Jha reiterated that his party opposed any retrospective implementation of the Bill but expressed hope that the government would address this concern.""Nitish Kumar has been working in Bihar for the last 19 years. During this time, the work he has done for the Muslim community is also visible. Our party had said that it should not be implemented with retrospective effect, and we hope that the government will consider it... As long as Nitish Kumar is in politics, the interests of the people will be protected,"" JD(U) MP Sanjay Jha said.Ending days of speculation, Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP has officially backed the Bill, despite opposition criticism and protests from various Muslim organisations.""The whole Muslim community is waiting for the Waqf Amendment Bill to be tabled. Our party will support it. Chandrababu Naidu has already mentioned that we will work in the interests of the Muslim community. Tomorrow, the Bill will be tabled, only then we will make any comments on it. I assure you that Chandrababu Naidu is in favour of Muslims,"" TDP national spokesperson Prem Kumar Jain said.Meanwhile, TDP & JD(U) have issued a whip to all its MPs, directing them for their presence in Lok Sabha on Wednesday.The Church of Bharat and the Catholic Bishops Conference of India have extended support to the Bill, strengthening the government’s defense against allegations of an anti-minority agenda.The government maintains that the Bill seeks to improve transparency and efficiency in managing Waqf properties. Initially referred to a joint parliamentary committee, the Bill underwent revisions before receiving cabinet approval.Opposition parties and prominent Muslim organizations continue to oppose the Bill, calling it unconstitutional and harmful to the Muslim community. AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi has labeled it an attack on religious freedoms and warned that BJP allies like TDP and JD(U) will face repercussions for their support.","The Lok Sabha is set to deliberate on the long-debated Waqf Amendment Bill on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Stand-up comic Kunal Kamra on Tuesday once again hit back at critics amid the row over his ""gaddar"" (traitor) remark targeting Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde . Kamra shared a satirical post on X titled ""How to kill an artist 'democratically'"", in which he condemned what he described as a systematic effort to silence artists.The post, structured as a step-by-step guide, outlined how outrage can be used to restrict artistic expression :""Now the artist is left with only two choices: Sell their soul and become a dollar puppet - or wither in silence. This isn't just a playbook, it's a political weapon.

The remarks triggered a strong backlash, leading to calls for action against the comedian.On Monday, Mumbai Police reportedly visited Kamra's ""residence"" in connection with the matter.

KOLKATA: Lawyers of Calcutta HC stayed away from the court from 10 am to 3.30 pm on Tuesday in protest of SC collegium's recommendation last week to transfer Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma from Delhi HC to Calcutta HC.Even as the lawyers were protesting, the Centre notified Justice Sharma's transfer, prompting the three lawyers' bodies of the HC - Calcutta HC Bar Association, Bar Library Club and Incorporated Law Society - to write to Chief Justice TS Sivagnanam that their members would boycott the swearing-in ceremony of Justice Sharma. The lawyers also threatened to stay away from Justice Sharma's court if he was allocated cases.Protesting the move to transfer Justice Sharma, the three lawyers' bodies had written to Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna last Saturday that Calcutta HC cannot be a 'dumping ground' for judges with 'questionable image or short stints', just days after lawyers of Allahabad HC had protested the transfer of Justice Yashwant Varma using the same term. Justice Varma is currently embroiled in a cash-recovery row and lawyers of Allahabad HC have been protesting his transfer from Delhi HC saying their HC can't be used as a 'dumping ground'.With Calcutta HC lawyers staying away, very few cases were heard during the day as judges made it clear they would not hear matters unless both sides were present during the hearing.Three lawyers' bodies wrote to CJI, appending whistleblower emails from Oct 28 and Nov 4, 2024, alleging Justice Sharma retained certain civil disputes as ""part heard"" despite a roster change.

NGOs can't stall every project citing ecological concern: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ngos-cant-stall-every-project-citing-ecological-concern-supreme-court/articleshow/119888896.cms,"NEW DELHI: Irked by obscure NGOs frequently conjuring environmental risks to seek stalling of development projects, Supreme Court on Tuesday came down heavily on such malpractices while apprehending the possibility of these being funded either by losing bidders or by those from outside to impede India's growth.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh dismissed an appeal by NGO 'Kahar Samaj Panch Committee' challenging the National Green Tribunal's decision permitting installation of 'floating solar power' projects at Jayakwadi Dam, declared as a bird sanctuary, by the Tehri Hydro Development Corporation (THDC).Even an environment-friendly solar power project was being questioned in the guise saving the environment, the bench said.THDC, a central PSU, had issued a tender for setting up a floating solar power project at Jayakwadi Dam, which is an earthen dam located on Godavari river in Paithan taluka of Sambhaji Nagar district in Maharashtra. The NGO had moved the NGT claiming that the floating solar power project would be detrimental to the area's biodiversity and create problems for birds as the area had been declared an eco-sensitive zone by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change.""No sooner was the tender floated, the NGO approached NGT saying it would harm the bird sanctuary and pollute its water,"" the Justice Kant-led bench said. It added that the NGT, after a scrutiny of the replies submitted by the ministry, found that under the Union govt's policy decisions, solar power projects were to be actively promoted.The NGO could not give a proper response to NGT's repeated query - Whether there existed a law that barred setting up of a floating solar power project in an eco-sensitive zone? The NGT rejected the petition and said the NGO was even unable to specify whether the floating solar power project fell within the eco-sensitive zone of Jayakwadi bird sanctuary.The bench said SC was sensitive to genuine environmental concerns expressed by well-meaning NGOs, but these days it had become a practice with rivals of project proponents to set up NGOs and challenge projects on the ground that it would cause irreparable harm to the environment.",Supreme Court apprehends possibility of these being funded either by losing bidders or by those from outside to impede India's growth.

Just incredible to look at night as well as during the day, highlighted, of course, by the Himalayas, which is just incredible as a forefront going down into India.”“Every time we went over the Himalayas, and I'll tell you, Butch got some incredible pictures of the Himalayas. Just amazing,” Williams said.William's praise for India brought back the memories of Sqn Ldr Rakesh Sharma, who had told the then Indian PM Indira Gandhi from space in 1984 that the country from space looks like “Sare jahan se achcha”.The view of India from space felt like a personal connection to Williams’s heritage. “I have described it before like this ripple that happened when the plates collided, and then, as it flows down into India, it is many-many colours,” she explained.Expressing happiness at Indian astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla going to the ISS under Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), Williams said, “I'm gonna be going back to my father's home country and visiting with people and getting excited about the first, or not the first, but the Indian national who's going up on the Axiom Mission coming up, pretty awesome.” Williams's father Deepak Pandya hailed from Gujarat and came to the US in 1958 where he did his internship and residency training in Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio. She was born in Ohio to Deepak and Ursuline Bonnie Pandya.On Shukla, she said, “They'll have a hometown hero there of their own who will be able to talk about how wonderful the International Space Station is from his perspective. But I hope I can meet up at some point in time. We can share our experiences with as many people in India as possible because it's a great country, another wonderful democracy that's trying to put its foot in space... We'd love to be part of that and help them along.”Lucknow-born Shukla will be India's second astronaut to go to space after former IAF officer Rakesh Sharma, who flew aboard Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984 as part of the Soviet Interkosmos programme.It is likely that she will meet PM Modi when she visits India in the near future. PM Modi had welcomed Williams and her fellow Crew-9 members when they returned to Earth after the prolonged mission to the ISS, saying their unwavering determination will forever inspire millions. “Welcome back, Crew9! The Earth missed you,” Modi had then posted on X.Williams joked about taking space crew members on a trip to India. “You might stick out a little bit. That is okay. We will get you all primed with some spicy food,” she said with a laugh.When asked if he would fly again aboard the Starliner that faced a technical issue in space and had to return to Earth without them, Wilmore said, “Yes, because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work. Boeing is completely committed. Nasa is completely committed, and with that, I'd get on in a heartbeat.""",Indian-origin Nasa astronaut Sunita Williams on returning to Earth after her 286-day-long stay at the International Space Station.

Sarma called Yunus' comments ""offensive"".""The statement made by Md Younis of Bangladesh's so called interim government referring to the seven sister states of Northeast India as landlocked and positioning Bangladesh as their guardian of ocean access, is offensive and strongly condemnable,"" Sarma said in a post on X.Chief advisor to Bangladesh's interim government, Muhammad Yunus, during his four-day visit to China, invited Beijing to expand its presence in the region. He highlighted that India's seven northeastern states are landlocked and suggested that Bangladesh could serve as a key gateway to the ocean for the region.In a widely shared video on social media, Yunus encouraged China to establish an economic base in Bangladesh, saying that Dhaka holds strategic access to the sea. He said, ""Seven states of India, eastern part of India, called seven sisters ... they are landlocked country, landlocked region of India. They have no way to reach out to the ocean.""Yunus further said, ""We are the only guardian of the ocean for all this region. So this opens up a huge possibility. So this could be an extension of the Chinese economy. Build things, produce things, market things, bring things to China, bring it out to the whole rest of the world.""Responding to Yunus's statement, Assam CM said, ""This remark underscores the persistent vulnerability narrative associated with India’s strategic “Chicken’s Neck” corridor. Historically, even internal elements within India have dangerously suggested severing this critical passageway to isolate the Northeast from the mainland physically.""Sarma also called for building alternative road routes to Northeast India. ""Therefore, it is imperative to develop more robust railway and road networks both underneath and around the Chicken’s Neck corridor . Additionally, exploring alternative road routes connecting the Northeast to mainland India, effectively bypassing the Chicken’s Neck, should be prioritized. Though this may pose significant engineering challenges, it is achievable with determination and innovation,"" he said.Earlier, on Monday, the Congress party called Yunus's statement ""very dangerous"" for the security of the Northeast region and alleged that the government is not taking care of the region including Manipur. ""Bangladesh is inviting China to encircle India. This attitude of the Bangladesh government is very dangerous for the security of our North East region.
