"""When will justice be delivered?,"" ask acid attack survivors as they demand stringent punishment for the culprit in Kolkata doctor's rape-murder case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-will-justice-be-delivered-ask-acid-attack-survivors-as-they-demand-stringent-punishment-for-the-culprit-in-kolkata-doctors-rape-murder-case/articleshow/112696651.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the country rages over the shocking case of rape and murder of a doctor at a govt run hospital in Kolkata, acid attack survivors have come forward in solidarity to raise the demand for speedy justice by ensuring that punishment is delivered without delay. In a stirring call for action, the founder of 'Brave Souls Foundation', Shaheen Malik, demanded to know from the authorities from a public platform that ""whether survivors like her will be able to see justice delivered during their lifetime"".She was speaking at the programme organised in the Capital to bring into focus the challenges acid attack survivors face at every step. Joining forces with women survivors of violence, Malik, who is herself an acid attack survivor, said that the Kolkata doctor 's case yet again brings into focus the vulnerability and lack of safety women grapple with everyday. ""Whenever we hear of such incidents, it forces us to relive our trauma, reminding us of our vulnerability. It reinforces the fear that perpetrators can easily disrupt our lives. The recent incident in Kolkata is particularly horrific and highlights the persistent danger we face,"" Malik said at a symposium focused on 'Reintegration - People & Policy that was organised by 'Brave Souls Foundation. Survivors called for a complete ban on sale of acid at retail shops.""Until strong and enforceable laws are in place to deter these heinous crimes, our commitment to fighting them must remain unwavering. We need to persistently work towards protecting survivors and advocating for justice, ensuring that these atrocities are not allowed to continue unchecked. Our efforts must be ongoing, focused, and resilient, as we push for meaningful change in the legal system and society,"" she added.Malik added that survivors often lose support from family and friends after an offence, whether it’s sexual assault or an acid attack, largely due to the social ostracism they endure. ""The process of obtaining compensation is equally challenging. First, survivors are often unaware of their eligibility for compensation. It is the state’s responsibility to provide adequate compensation, enabling survivors to live independently. However, the support offered is minimal. Additionally, the compensation process is lengthy and burdensome, filled with numerous formalities, causing many survivors to abandon their claims,"" Malik explained.Activists draw attention to the fact that under the current compensation scheme, a survivor of rape is entitled up to Rs 7 lakhs, a gang rape survivor can receive up to Rs10 lakhs, and an acid attack survivor can receive up to Rs 8 lakhs.""In acid attack cases, survivors typically require 15 to 20 surgeries just to survive. With each surgery costing around Rs 1 lakh, a survivor would need at least Rs 15-20 lakhs for medical treatment alone, excluding the costs of medication and legal expenses,"" Malik explained.Drawing attention to the legal concerns, advocate Choudhary Ali Zia Kabir said that to improve justice for survivors there is need to invest in judicial infrastructure by setting up more courts, appointing more judges and making way for better legal education. ""It is also important to increase awareness within the judiciary by including the issue of acid attacks as a part of curriculum at judicial academies and in training and awareness programmes,"" Kabir said. He also asserted the need to increase the representation of marginalised groups among judges to make the judiciary as diverse as the country.“Three things that activists could do is – to continue doing the wonderful work that they do; petition the courts afresh for banning acid sales; and petition the parliament via a private member’s bill encompassing prevention against acid attack and gender violence, and rights for their survivors,” Kabir said.Aam Aadmi Party's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh who was also present at the programme said that he will make every effort possible to raise the issue with government and parliament, and also explore the possibility of bringing the issue into focus through a private member's bill in the upper House."," acid attack survivors have come forward in solidarity to raise the demand for speedy justice by ensuring that punishment is delivered without delay.

Euthanasia: SC rejects parents’ plea for euthanasia for son,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-rejects-parents-plea-for-euthanasia-for-son/articleshow/112664558.cms,"SC Asks Centre To Examine Long-Term Aid For 30-Yr-Old

NEW DELHI: Unable to bear their only son ’s 11-year-long vegetative state , mounting expenses and doctors promising little chance of recovery, the parents of a 30-year-old man on Tuesday requested the Supreme Court to constitute a medical board to examine withdrawal of the Ryles tube , through which he has been fed, to relieve their lone child of suffering through passive euthanasia .A Ryles tube is a disposable tube inserted through the nose into the stomach, providing access to the nasogastric tract. It is used both to deliver food and medicine to the stomach.However, SC said, “Removal of the Ryles tube is not part of passive euthanasia. If the Ryles tube is removed, the patient will starve and die.” It also asked govt to “please find out if some institution can take care of this person”.Despite limited income, parents — 62-year-old Ashok Rana and 55-year-old Nirmala Devi — fought on to save their son who suffered severe head injury and quadriplegia (100% disability) after falling from the fourth floor of a paying guest accommodation at Mohali while pursuing a graduation course in civil engineering.While pleading that the meagre pension of the father was not enough to sustain the family, their counsel told a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra that they were forced to sell their house in 2021 to meet their son’s mounting medical expenses. The bench said Delhi HC had rightly dismissed their petition for passive euthanasia as was permitted by the SC, first in 2018 through a judgment and then last year by relaxing the procedure for removal of life support from terminally-ill patients in vegetative state with no real chance of revival. “Removal of the Ryles tube is not part of passive euthanasia. If the Ryles tube is removed, the patient will starve and die. Passive euthanasia is very different. Ryles tube is not a life support system,” the bench said.The bench, however, could not wash its hands of the heart-rending case, as the parents have struggled for more than a decade, spent their life’s savings and yet see no light at the end of a long and arduous journey.The bench requested additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati to consult the Union govt on whether some permanent solution can be found — to take care of the 30-year-old man in vegetative state and relieve the parents of their financial constraints. “It is a very hard case. The parents have struggled for 13 years and can no longer take care of their son’s medical bills,” the CJI said.“Please find out if some institution can take care of this person. We cannot permit passive euthanasia as he is not on life support system, even though fed through Ryles tube,” the bench said. Bhati said she would consult the health ministry and respond.",Parents of a 30-year-old man on Tuesday requested the Supreme Court to constitute a medical board to examine withdrawal of the Ryles tube through which he has been fed.

Vande Bharat Metro to run between Vadodara and Ahmedabad: Trial runs soon; new high-speed corridor announced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-bharat-metro-to-run-between-vadodara-and-ahmedabad-trial-runs-soon-new-high-speed-corridor-announced/articleshow/112679753.cms,"High-speed corridor to boost connectivity

Following the success of the Vande Bharat Express trains, Indian Railways is preparing to introduce the Vande Bharat Metro in Gujarat . This upcoming metro service will be the first of its kind in the nation and is set to start trial runs soon. The Vande Bharat Metro will operate between Vadodara and Ahmedabad, with trial runs scheduled to begin in the near future.According to the reports, JK Jayant, Chief Spokesperson of Western Railway, confirmed that the trials will commence within the coming days. This initiative aims to enhance connectivity and efficiency, particularly after recent upgrades to the railway route between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.The Vande Bharat Metro is designed to cater to the needs of daily commuters, providing a time-efficient travel option. Jayant emphasized that the final decision on the metro's route will be made soon, ensuring that the service is optimized for travelers.Recently, a 20-coach Vande Bharat train was tested at Kalupur railway station in Ahmedabad, reaching speeds of 130 kilometers per hour. The trial, overseen by Western Railway officials and engineers, demonstrated the train’s capabilities. Given the high demand and full occupancy of the current 16-coach Vande Bharat trains, the new 20-coach train is expected to significantly improve service.In addition to the metro service, Gujarat is set to benefit from a new 214 km High-Speed Corridor between Tharad and Ahmedabad. This six-lane corridor will enhance road connectivity for residents of these cities and neighboring states, including Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Delhi. The project has been approved by the Union Cabinet, with a budget of over Rs 10,500 crore allocated for its development. This infrastructure project aims to facilitate smoother and faster travel, further boosting the region’s connectivity.","Indian Railways is preparing to introduce the Vande Bharat Metro in Gujarat.

India should clearly speak out where international law is broken: German MP Jurgen Hardt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-should-clearly-speak-out-where-international-law-is-broken-german-mp-jurgen-hardt/articleshow/112687648.cms,"International eyes are again on India as Modi undertakes a visit to Ukraine two years after the beginning of full-scale war in that country.

Jurgen Hardt

, German MP and foreign policy spokesperson of the German CDU, spoke with

Rudroneel Ghosh

, about hot-button geopolitical issues and India's approach to them:

PM Modi is visiting Ukraine soon. With the Ukraine war in its third year, what needs to happen for a ceasefire?

Has EU reached a stage where it can’t have any ties with Russia for the foreseeable future?

But that strategy failed.

What are your thoughts about US elections? Will a potential return of Trump take us back to Trans-Atlantic confrontations?

Has Europe found a solution to China’s weaponisation of economic interdependencies?

But they keep threatening Taiwan.

How do you see India’s role in geopolitics today?

The curious thing about that conflict is that no one is talking about what Russia has to give for peace.The only demand on Russia is to respect the Ukrainian border and promise not to attack Ukraine again. Therefore, the negotiating position of Ukraine is clear but also probably weak. The only chance of bringing Putin to the negotiating table is through ensuring that he and his immediate coterie feel that they can risk losing in some way. For example, like losing Crimea. Putin then will not be able to continue his so-called operation against ‘fascists’ and it will shutter the whole Russian system. Thus, I see the chance that Putin himself, before it comes to a situation where he loses, will declare that he has actually won the war and stop fighting. Then the rest of the world has to smile to this lie and do something to ensure durable peace. But this will only happen if Putin believes failure is possible. We have to ensure Putin fails.Nobody in Europe wanted to cut ties with Russia the country. But we also see no chance of cooperating with the govt of Putin. This is not a legitimate govt in terms of democratic elections and rule of law. So it is possible that in future we might see a Russia that is totally different from what it is today. We did make a lot of attempts to bind Russia to Europe. We did economic associations, bought Russian oil and gas, because we believed that a weak Russia is a problem for us and we should stabilise this country.The strategy failed on account of Putin but it doesn’t mean that it isn’t a good strategy generally. Russia always skipped the opportunity to do most of the work with the EU. And the reason for that is Putin fears the rule of law. Because every closer cooperation with EU creates situations for independent justice. And Putin clearly doesn’t want rule of law and hopes to retain his oligarchical system.What we saw in the four years of Trump is that it took a relatively long time before he was able to make concrete demands on Europe. Because he wasn’t well prepared for office. I am sure that won’t be the case this time should he win. So in case of Trump presidency , we should be prepared for a more competitive scenario from day one.That said, we also have the experience of getting things done with him. You have to figure out what he really wants. For example, last time we had reached a situation where the automobile industry was secured because we made a deal with Trump on import of soya beans from the American Mid-west to EU. This is how Trump does politics. So EU should identify those items on which we can do deals with a potential Trump presidency.Meanwhile, I say we missed the chance to help Biden to give proof that his cooperative approach is better, even for the American people, than Trump’s confrontationist approach. The Biden-Harris team has been very good and stable on foreign policy and security issues, no matter what people say about Biden’s age.I agree that Chinese trade policy has become ‘martialised’. But we also see that the Chinese govt needs good trade relations to maintain the social contract in China. This social contract is under strain now, and if you talk to Chinese officials, they are very open about the fact that they face the risks of economic chaos, housing bubble, and several other questions. Their biggest problem is demography. So I think that they also don’t really want to do something disruptive, like attacking Taiwan.True, but they failed to influence the elections in Taiwan this year, they failed in blackmailing the Taiwanese and the rest of the world. Sure, there is muscle-flexing from Beijing. But it knows it needs good trade relations with the world. In response, we should combine approaches of US, G7 , Germany and friends like India. Then we will have the chance to get China to make compromises. The key here is reciprocity. If China can have stakes in the Hamburg port, why can’t we have stakes in the Shanghai port? Also, with respect to Chinese investment projects, should such projects also be financed by China? Because this runs the risk of China acquiring assets in case the project fails. So we have to think deeply about such things.India and Germany are among the top 5 economies in world. Given our economic power, both India and Germany should take a more engaged role in international affairs.I respect India’s traditional neutral, bloc-free approach. I also appreciate the role that India plays in Brics and G20. But we should be clear that neutrality should not hinder a govt from speaking out against breaking of international law. Because international law is global. This is the fairytale that Russian and Chinese presidents make up that international law is somehow a Western invention. Therefore, India should be encouraged to maintain its neutral position but clearly speak out where international law is broken, for example with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.","German MP Jurgen Hardt spoke with Rudroneel Ghosh about hot-button geopolitical issues and India's approach to them.

Similarly, the Muslim Jamadar community was recommended to be added to the list the day (April 21, 2010) it filed an application: a feat considering the pace with which govt machinery moves as also the intricate nature of the task.The OBC Commission matched the astonishing alacrity and took just a day to recommend inclusion of Gayen (Muslim) and Bhatia Muslim communities in the list, four days for Muslim Chutor Mistri community, and less than a month for inclusion of a dozen other Muslim communities to the OBC list.The affidavit of West Bengal govt, which is under fire for alleged arbitrary inclusion of 77 castes, 75 of them Muslims, was full of surprises. In some cases, the survey for sub-categorisation of communities was conducted even prior to community members filing an application before the Commission seeking their inclusion in the OBC list. Surveys for some Muslim communities - Kazi, Kotal, Hazari, Layek and Khas - were done in June 2015 but they had filed applications much later, in some cases after nearly a year or two.""It was only after a detailed enquiry and/or upon consideration of the material before it in oral or documentary nature, that a final report on each of the 34 communities was prepared along with the final recommendation by the Commission,"" the state said in response to the CJI D Y Chandrachud-led bench's Aug 5 order seeking information about the process adopted for inclusion in OBC list.On Aug 5, SC had asked WB to ""explain the process"" followed for designating 77 communities (75 of them Muslims) as OBCs between 2010 and 2012 and the nature of survey carried out on the twin aspects of social and educational backwardness and inadequacy of representation in services of the state. The Mamata Banerjee govt had appealed against a Calcutta HC decision to quash such inclusions in OBC list without following the procedure. SC had refused to stay HC order.The affidavit filed by Abhijit Mukherjee, additional secretary and ex-officio joint commissioner of reservation at backward classes welfare department, stated that the process commences with an application by individuals who seek inclusion in the OBC list detailing the name of class, size of its population, its place of concentration, along with social, educational, matrimonial, occupational and economic data. The affidavit said the three-tier process was scrupulously followed by the state.After submission of such an application, the commission carries out field surveys through its members (before 2012) or through state govt's Cultural Research Institute (CRI) and the anthropologists with them (after 2012). During such a survey, the commission issues public notice regarding hearing on the application as well as objections to the claim.At the hearing, the commission examines records, survey inputs, inquiries and material adduced during public hearings, to either accept the application or reject it. On acceptance, it recommends inclusion of a community in the OBC list, which the state said is ""ordinarily binding"" on govt. It is then placed for approval of the Cabinet. After such approval, it is published in the official gazette.","West Bengal govt is under fire for alleged arbitrary inclusion of 77 castes, 75 of them Muslims.

Despite this, girls outperform boys across all school management types - in class XII, 87.5% of girls in private schools passed the exam compared to 75.6% of boys, resulting in nearly nine lakh boys failing, compared to four lakh girls.Science remains the most popular stream, chosen by 43% of students, predominantly boys.

The pass rate for girls is marginally higher than that for boys in science and significantly higher in arts.Class X and XII board exam results for 2023 , covering 59 boards including three national boards, shows a worrying decline in student performance compared to the previous year. The failure rate is significantly higher for state boards (16%) than for national boards (6%) at the class X level. However, while the gap narrows at the class XII level, failure rates increase for both state (18%) and national boards (12%).The performance gap between students from different boards is evident, with state boards generally trailing behind central boards. The exams, across 59 examination boards, covered a wide range of curricula, with some boards not following the NCERT syllabus. Despite the large number of students, pass percentages indicate a worrying trend.At the secondary (class X) level, approximately 18.5 million students took the board exams, with an 84.9% pass rate. However, around 3.3 million students are not progressing to class XI due to failures or non-appearance, contributing to a lower retention rate.In senior secondary (class XII) exams, 82.5% of the 15.5 million students passed. The highest pass rate was among students taking the exams in Nepali and Manipuri (85.3% each). A significant number of students - 3.2 million - did not complete their class XII education, either failing or not appearing for exams.In total, over 5.5 million candidates failed to pass the class X and XII boards in 2023. ""This is one of the factors contributing to the low retention rate and gross enrolment ratio at the higher secondary level,"" the official noted.","Girls have a pass percentage that is over 6% higher than boys across all school management types. In class XII, 87.5% of girls in private schools passed the exam compared to 75.6% of boys.

CHENNAI: A corporation sports turf in Pallikaranai has been taken over by a group of men who illegally collect 800 an hour. Six months since the inauguration, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has yet to appoint a contractor or fix charges. However, the group has been running a ' sports academy ' there, illegally charging up to 800 an hour.The matter came to light when when civic activist M Radhakrishnan of Arappor Iyakkam recently tried to book the facility after spotting a ""Pallikaranai Sports Academy"" board at the turf entrance on Kamakoti Nagar 6th Street.""When we went to book it, the men there demanded 800 an hour. The local councillor was often seen at the booking area, and we learned he had set up an unofficial sports academy at the GCC turf,"" Radhakrishnan said.Following this, the activist filed an RTI petition with the GCC, the reply to which on Aug 2 revealed that no permission had been granted to any sports academy. The GCC stated that an official rate card would be released soon.Councillor Babu claimed he did not collect money but only intervened to manage the space and resolve conflicts between locals who play there. ""People from different areas play here and end up fighting. So they call me to solve the issues. I never collected any money. There are one lakh residents in Pallikaranai and anyone could have collected money. It is the GCC's responsibility to identify them,"" Babu said, adding that he had responded to a govt inquiry.When TOI contacted the phone numbers listed on the old academy board, a representative said they were no longer accepting bookings.

Rajasthan Bharat Bandh: Educational institutes remain closed

NEW DELHI: "" Bharat Bandh "", the nationwide strike, has been called on August 21, in response to a recent Supreme Court ruling on SC/ST reservations by Dalit and Adivasi organisations demanding stronger representation and protection for marginalised communities.The Supreme Court recently in a 6:1 ruling said that the states can create sub-classification within Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST).The apex also permitted states to create creamy layer within these categories ensuring that those who are most in need within these groups receive priority which was later turned down by the Centre.However, this ruling sparked widespread controversy and opposition from several social and political organisations. Critics argue that it undermines the principles of reservation and could lead to increased division among communities.The National Confederation of Dalit and Adivasi Organisations (NACDAOR) has put forth a list of demands, which includes justice and equity for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs).The organisation has appealed to Dalits, Adivasis, and OBCs to participate in a peaceful agitation on Wednesday, emphasising the importance of their collective action in achieving their demands for justice and equality.The NACDAOR said that the recent judgement undermines the earlier ruling of a nine-judge bench in the landmark Indira Sawhney case, the cornerstone of India's reservation framework.The organisation has called upon the government to reject this judgment, asserting that it jeopardises the constitutional rights of SCs and STs.Addtionally, the NACDAOR is advocating for the enactment of a new Act of Parliament on reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs, to be safeguarded by inclusion in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution. This measure, they contend, will protect these provisions from judicial interference and foster social harmony.The organisation has also demanded the immediate release of caste-based data on SC/ST/OBC employees in government services to ensure accurate representation and are pushing for the establishment of an Indian Judicial Service to recruit judicial officers and judges from all sections of society, with a target of 50 per cent representation from SC, ST, and OBC categories in the higher judiciary.The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Congress, and the Rashtriya Janata Dal announced on Tuesday their support for the Bharat Bandh call given by various organizations on Wednesday. Left parties have also backed the call for the strike.JMM has instructed all its leaders, district presidents, secretaries, and district coordinators to actively participate in the 14-hour nationwide strike and show their support.Vinod Kumar Pandey, JMM general secretary, said, ""The recent verdict given by the Supreme Court on the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe reservations would prove to be an obstacle in the path of upliftment and strengthening of the SC/ST classes.""Kailash Yadav, RJD state general secretary and media in-charge, confirmed that the party has decided to support and participate in the day-long strike. Similarly, Rakesh Sinha, the state Congress spokesperson, also announced the party's support for the bandh call.The organising group has requested that all business establishments remains close on Wednesady. However, Market committees have not yet confirmed widespread closures.Additiobally, public transport, including metro services, may experience disruptions. Educational institutions such as schools and colleges are expected to remain open despite the bandh.Government offices and banks are likely to function normally. There may be some impact on services due to reduced staff and increased security measures.Further, emergency services, including medical services, ambulances, drinking water supply, public transport, rail services, and electricity services, will remain operational.All the educational institutions will remain closed in seven districts of Rajasthan on August 21 in the wake of the Bharat Bandh call given by the Aarakshan Bachao Sangharsh Samiti.The shutdown will be witnessed in the districts of Jaipur, Alwar, Dausa, Sawai Madhopur, Deeg, Jaisalmer and Bharatpur.Kota University examinations have also been postponed.Congress and Scheduled Caste-Tribe Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti have also supported the Bharat Bandh.Aarakshan Bachao Sangharsh Samiti has formed 25 units for the Jaipur bandh, which will ask traders to shut down their shops. A rally will also be held by the bandh supporters.Rajasthan's DGP, UR Sahoo, has instructed district Superintendents of Police to maintain order and engage with local organisations. ""We have asked our officials to organise meetings with groups calling for the bandhand with market associations to facilitate better cooperation,"" said Sahoo.In Jaipur, Police Commissioner Biju George Joseph has already initiated dialogue with groups supporting the strike. The authorities are taking proactive measures to prevent any potential conflicts or disruptions during the protest.","JMM, Congress, Left, RJD extend support to Bharat Bandh.

GM recently faced a few software incidents

General Motors is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division, the company confirmed on Monday. The job cuts , which include about 600 positions at GM's tech campus near Detroit, come as part of a review to streamline operations in the unit.""As we build GM's future, we must simplify for speed and excellence, make bold choices, and prioritise the investments that will have the greatest impact,"" GM said in a statement to CNBC.The layoffs represent approximately 1.3% of GM's global salaried workforce of 76,000 as of the end of 2023. The cuts primarily affect the automaker's US operations. Impacted employees were notified Monday morning.""We are grateful to those who helped establish a strong foundation that positions GM to lead moving forward,"" the automaker added in its statement.""As a result, we're reducing certain teams within the Software and Services organisation,"" GM stated. The division, currently led by executives Baris Cetinok and Dave Richardson, covers areas such as vehicle infotainment, OnStar services, and GM's Super Cruise advanced driver-assist system.The change comes less than six months after leadership shifts in the unit, including the departure of former Apple executive Mike Abbott in March due to health reasons.The job cuts follow GM's efforts to reduce costs amid industry concerns of a potential downturn and significant investments in electric vehicles and software-defined vehicles. GM has recently faced challenges with software issues in its new Chevy Blazer EV, including blank infotainment screens and charging error messages. The company issued a stop sale notice last December due to these problems, which was lifted in March.The layoffs also come after GM cancelled its ""Ultra Cruise"" programme, a competitor to Tesla's Full Self-Driving system, in January. The company merged the FSD team with its regular Super Cruise team.Despite the layoffs and recent setbacks, the company says it continues to work on expanding its hands-free driving system, with plans to broaden its capabilities by the end of 2025.","GM is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division.

Bangladesh: Dozens Of Hasina's Party Members Chased & Killed In Mob Attacks; 29 Bodies Found

Heavy rains in Brazil have led to a remarkable paleontological discovery that will astound one and all: a 233 million-year-old dinosaur fossil . This significant find was made in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , near the town of São João do Polêsine. The fossil, which is almost fully preserved, was unearthed next to a reservoir after torrential rains eroded parts of the fossil site.The dinosaur, believed to be a member of the Herrerasauridae family , roamed the Earth during the Triassic Period when all the continents were part of a single landmass known as Pangea, also often referred to as a ""super continent"".Herrerasaurids were among the earliest carnivorous dinosaurs, and this particular specimen is estimated to have been about 2.5 meters (8 feet) long. The discovery was made by a team led by Rodrigo Temp Müller , a paleontologist from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM).The site where the fossil was found has been a focus of paleontological research for about 20 years. The region is known for its rich deposits of Triassic fossils, which have provided valuable insights into the early evolution of dinosaurs . The recent heavy rains accelerated the erosion process, exposing the fossil that had been buried for millions of years. According to Müller, the fossil was initially thought to be just a few isolated bones, but further excavation revealed an almost complete skeleton.This discovery is particularly significant because it is one of the oldest dinosaur fossils ever found. The oldest known dinosaur fossils date back to around 231 million years ago, making this find potentially one of the earliest examples of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s excellent preservation allows scientists to study its anatomical details, which could provide new insights into the characteristics and behaviors of early dinosaurs. Truly an exciting find!The Herrerasauridae family, to which this dinosaur belongs, includes some of the first known carnivorous dinosaurs. These dinosaurs were bipedal, much like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, meaning they walked on two legs, and had free hands with sharp claws for catching prey. The newly discovered fossil is expected to shed light on the evolutionary adaptations that allowed these early dinosaurs to thrive in their environment.The discovery has generated excitement in the scientific community, as it could help fill gaps in our understanding of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s advanced age and preservation make it a unique and valuable addition to the fossil record, offering a rare glimpse into the past. Researchers are now working to carefully extract the fossil from the surrounding rock and conduct detailed analyses to determine whether it represents a new species of dinosaur.The region where the fossil was found has been subject to increasingly severe weather events, including the heavy rains that led to this discovery. In June 2024, the state of Rio Grande do Sul experienced three months’ worth of rain within just two weeks, causing widespread flooding and displacing over 500,000 people. While the rains have accelerated the erosion process, they also pose a threat to newly exposed fossils, which can be damaged or destroyed if not promptly rescued.The Federal University of Santa Maria and other research institutions are now focused on preserving the fossil and conducting further studies. The findings from this discovery are expected to be published in scientific journals, contributing to our knowledge of early dinosaur evolution and the conditions that shaped their development.For the unversed, dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago. They were some of the most successful and varied animals ever to have lived, ranging from the small, bird-like Velociraptor to the gigantic, long-necked Brachiosaurus. Paleontologists study dinosaur fossils to learn about their behavior, diet, and appearance. Fossilized bones, teeth, footprints, and even eggs have been found, offering insights into these ancient creatures. There were over 1,000 different species of dinosaurs identified so far, ranging from the plant-eating sauropods to the fierce carnivorous theropods, showcasing their incredible diversity.Did you like this article?

Tech solution? Govt plans long-term fix to Delhi’s flooding woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/govt-plans-long-term-fix-to-delhis-flooding-woes/articleshow/112691430.cms,"Govt has also highlighted the need to fix the interconnection of stormwater drains with the sewerage and vice-versa.

NEW DELHI: Delhi govt has proposed long-term solutions to resolve the persistent problem of waterlogging in the city during the monsoon season. These measures focus on enhancing technology for monitoring the drainage system , resolving the conflict of multiple authorities, finding permanent solutions for chronic waterlogging at specific points, removing encroachments and effectively managing construction, demolition and dairy waste.The state govt has prepared a report based on assessments conducted by various agencies and govt departments, including the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and Delhi Development Authority, to identify lasting solutions. The report highlights several key drawbacks, such as the presence of multiple agencies , lack of stormwater outfall in many unauthorised colonies and slum clusters, and the buildup of silt in drains that reduces their carrying capacity.A govt official said on Wednesday, ""In a step to fix multiplicity of authority, we have assigned responsibility, management and operations of 22 drains that have their outfall in the Yamuna to a single department - irrigation & flood control."" Delhi govt is also taking other steps to resolve the issue of multiple agencies.For two chronic waterlogging points, Zakhira underpass and Karala Kanjhawala, the report suggests specific solutions. At Zakhira, water accumulation is primarily due to rainwater flowing from the adjacent railway tracks. It will, therefore, necessitate the construction of an additional drain on railways land. Delhi govt has deposited its share of the required funds for this and construction of the drain is under way. For Karala Kanjhawala, the proposed long-term solution involves remodelling the existing drainage along the stretch.The state govt also plans to increase the use of technology for monitoring drainage, including implementation of online monitoring systems to track the parameters of drains and rivers in real-time. Another focus area is expediting the rejuvenation of waterbodies for groundwater recharge through district-wise committees responsible for executing the plan.Removal of encroachments has been identified as a crucial factor, with the Survey of India conducting a drone survey of the O zone of the Yamuna banks since June this year. Improper disposal of construction and demolition waste often clogs the drainage system, hindering water outflow. To address this, govt proposes to develop a large facility to convert 100% of the city's C&D waste into aggregate tiles and paver blocks for use in public infrastructure.Govt has also highlighted the need to fix the interconnection of stormwater drains with the sewerage and vice-versa. Out of 191 points where sewage enters the stormwater drains, 159 have been trapped, but 32 still require attention. Dairy waste management also contributes to clogged drains, preventing the flow of stormwater. Delhi govt has instructed MCD to expedite the construction of biogas plants near all nine authorised dairies in Delhi for the creation of dry manure, biogas fuel and compressed biogas production, with an action plan and a timeline provided.","The state govt has prepared a report based on assessments conducted by various agencies and govt departments.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

DHAKA: Bangladesh's main opposition party BNP on Tuesday urged India to extradite deposed PM Sheikh Hasina to face trial in murder and other cases registered against her since she took flight on August 5 in the face of a student-led uprising. ""It is our call to you that you should hand her over to government of Bangladesh in a legal way.The people of this country have given the decision for her trial.Let her face that trial,"" BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said in Dhaka after paying tribute to the party's founder president Ziaur Rahman.Alamgir said Hasina being allowed to take refuge in India isn't aligned with the country's commitment to upholding democratic principles. ""Staying there, she has started various plots to thwart the revolution that happened in Bangladesh.""Bangladesh and India have extradition treaty based on which they are required to hand over people against whom proceedings have been initiated in courts for any ""extraditable crime"", including financial offences liable to invite a minimum punishment of a year in jail.BNP, whose ailing chairperson and ex-PM Khaleda Zia was freed from house arrest after Hasina fled, said the murder and extortion cases filed against the latter were in the ""extraditable"" category.The bilateral treaty isn't applicable to cases that are ""political in nature"", although this exemption is not available to those charged with serious crimes like murder, sources said.India can turn down any request for Hasina's extradition by citing Article 8 of the treaty, which allows the signatories to refuse requests that have ""not been made in good faith and in the interests of justice"". The BNP secretary general alleged that Hasina's Awami League was ""still conspiring in New Delhi to falsify the victory"" of students and other citizens of Bangladesh. ""I am saying this strongly, and we want to make it clear that I do not think that India can get much love from the people by sheltering the enemy of the people of Bangladesh, who had to flee from the country,"" Alamgir said.Awami League has criticised Bangladesh's interim government for cases registered against Hasina, terming them ""false and politically motivated"".","Bangladesh and India have extradition treaty based on which they are required to hand over people against whom proceedings have been initiated.

Elon Musk's Neuralink says implant working effectively in 2nd trial patient: What it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-neuralink-says-implant-working-effectively-in-2nd-trial-patient-what-it-means/articleshow/112695718.cms,"Neuralink , a brain technology startup of Elon Musk , announced that its implant is functioning effectively in a second trial patient. The implant is designed to enable paralysed individuals to operate digital devices solely through thought .The company said that the second patient named Alex did not experience ""thread retraction"" issues, which contrasted with the experience of Noland Arbaugh, Neuralink's first patient who received the implant in January.Arbaugh encountered a significant decrease in the number of electrodes capable of measuring brain signals due to the retraction of the implant's tiny wires post-surgery.However, Neuralink stated that the threads have now stabilised for Arbaugh.To prevent similar complications in their second patient, Neuralink implemented several measures, including minimising brain motion during the surgical procedure and reducing the space between the implant and the brain's surface.Currently, Neuralink is in the testing phase of its device, which aims to assist individuals with spinal cord injuries . The first patient has demonstrated the ability to engage in various activities using the device, such as playing video games, navigating the internet, posting on social media, and controlling a laptop cursor.Neuralink had successfully implanted the device in the second patient last month. Since then, the patient has been utilising the device to play video games and acquire skills in designing 3D objects.The Nueralink implant device is nearly the size of a coin and is implanted beneath the skull.According to Neuralink, the device uses 64 tiny wires (or threads) and is equipped with over 1,000 electrodes that help it to read neuron activity in the brain and connect with a computer or smartphone.In 2016, Elon Musk along with a team of scientists and engineers founded Neuralink. The company claims that its mission is to ""create a generalised brain interface to restore autonomy to those with unmet medical needs"".","Neuralink announced that its implant is functioning effectively in a second trial patient.

'I want to study'

DADU: As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan , 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.""I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier,"" Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life.""But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible.""Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity .The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage.Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests.""This has led to a new trend of ' monsoon brides ',"" said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage.""Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money.""Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon -- 15 of them in May and June this year.""Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area,"" said village elder Mai Hajani, 65.""They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done"".Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money.Shamila's mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave 200,000 Pakistan Rupees ($720) to the young bride's parents -- a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day.Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan.""My husband gave my parents 250,000 rupees for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now,"" she said.""I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery,"" she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby.""Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat.""Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water -- its stench overwhelms the area.""We had lush rice fields where girls used to work,"" said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma's mother.""They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022,"" she added.""The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless.""Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December.The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced.Unicef has reported ""significant strides"" in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk.""We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,"" it said in a report after the 2022 floods.Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.""When I was there, I thought to myself 'we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities',"" the daily wage labourer told AFP.Mehtab was just 10 years old.""The night I decided to get her married, I couldn't sleep,"" said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married.An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education.But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive.""I have told my father I want to study,"" she said. ""I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don't want this for myself.""","Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years.

The first trial was carried out in July, which resulted in the slowing down of social media platforms.PM Shehbaz Sharif’s government had allocated more than 30 billion Pakistani rupees in the development budget for the acquisition and installation of this filtering system.However, the adverse impacts after installing the firewall drew criticism from netizens and digital rights groups, who expressed fear about the future of internet-based businesses in Pakistan.government authorities had so far feigned ignorance over the internet disruptions being linked to firewall installation, and had blamed telecom and internet service providers for connectivity issues.On Thursday, however, IT minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja said her ministry was addressing complaints of slow internet speed, even though she did not link the problem with thecybersecurity firewall .“There have been complaints of slow internet and I have asked the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to provide data of the last two weeks to look at the data traffic to know the speed issue,” she told reporters.Asked about the installation of a firewall, the minister said it was a cybersecurity matter and that countries around the world used the technology. “Previously, government was managing the web system, but with increasing international cybersecurity attacks on the country, there is a growing need for the state to strengthen its ability to prevent these attacks,” Khawaja said.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.The association of internet service providers have blamed the slow internet speed and outages on increased security and surveillance. “It’s a very discouraging situation for our customers. Many are leaving the smaller ISPs because they cannot sustain the poor service quality any more. If this continues, we will see a mass exodus of businesses from Pakistan,” read a statement issued by service providers.","Pakistan government confirms that it is upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats.

Millions of people across Pakistan have been facing trouble accessing internet services for some time now due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions.So far, official stakeholders in Pakistan have either been feigning ignorance in response to public outcry and media queries, or claiming that the problems were because of telecom and internet service providers, or even Meta.While talking to reporters after the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and Tele­communi­cation meeting on Thursday, Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja said the government had sought a report from Pakistan Telecommunication Authority and other institutions over the internet disruption.""The internet should never be slow.
