'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: Delhi continued to struggle with toxic air on Sunday, with several areas recording ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ air quality levels, as a dense layer of smog blanketed the city.The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi on Sunday reached 391, entering the 'severe' category, with some regions exceeding 400, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Morning visuals from Akshardham Temple showed the iconic structure fading into a thick, dense layer of smog that drastically reduced visibility.The AQI (Air Quality Index) in the area stood at 445, placing it in the ‘severe’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Around AIIMS, the AQI was measured at 340, categorised as ‘very poor’. Meanwhile, visuals from the ITO area showed the city shrouded in a thick blanket of smog, with hazy conditions reducing visibility.The AQI there had crossed 400, also falling under the ‘severe’ category.Meanwhile, in Mumbai, a light layer of fog enveloped the Bandra Kurla Complex, where the AQI was measured at 123, classified as ‘moderate’.Authorities have invoked Stage III measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which include restrictions on construction and industrial activities.The ‘No PUC, No Fuel’ rule is being enforced to curb emissions.Officials attributed the worsening conditions to a combination of cold weather, calm winds, and dense fog that trap pollutants close to the ground. Experts warn that the cycle of poor air quality is expected to continue under current weather patterns.The Commission for Air Quality Management has advised vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, and people with respiratory issues, to limit prolonged outdoor exposure and wear masks.","The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi on Sunday reached 391, entering the'severe' category, with some regions exceeding 400.

"Hair-loss drug under lens over threat to infants, eye disorders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hair-loss-drug-under-lens-over-threat-to-infants-eye-disorders/articleshow/126195368.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: Minoxidil, a widely used over-the-counter drug to treat hair loss, has been linked to unintended exposure in infants & a large number of eye-related side effects, according to a global safety analysis that has flagged dozens of baby-related cases and more than 1,600 eye disorder reports worldwide.Researchers identified more than 45 reports of excessive hair growth in infants aged up to 23 months linked to exposure to minoxidil. In several cases, exposure was not due to direct application but occurred unintentionally within the household, including contact with caregivers or contaminated surfaces.Globally, the analysis found 2,664 suspected cases of excessive hair growth linked to minoxidil use during pregnancy. Among infant cases, maternal exposure accounted for 22.2%, accidental exposure for 44.4%, while the route of exposure was unclear in 33.3% of cases.Though no infant cases were reported from India, the authors of the study cautioned that this likely reflected under-reporting rather than absence of risk, given the drug's widespread use.The study also raised concerns about eye health. A total of 1,660 reports of eye-related adverse effects associated with minoxidil use were recorded globally, including 25 reports from India.Frequently reported problems included eyelid swelling and blurred vision.More serious eye conditions were also noted, including central serous chorioretinopathy. After removal of duplicate reports, four serious eye cases remained - three involving central serous chorioretinopathy and one case of retinal artery occlusion.The findings are based on a post-marketing safety analysis of adverse drug reports submitted to VigiBase, the global drug safety database maintained by WHO, covering data up to March 2025.The study was authored by Dr V Kalaiselvan and Dr Jaishree Suresh of the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission, health ministry, and Dr Rohit Saxena of the Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS.Minoxidil was originally developed as an oral medicine to treat high blood pressure. Hair growth was later observed as a side effect, leading to its reformulation as a topical drug used to treat hair loss. Its effectiveness against androgenetic alopecia has since made it one of the most commonly used treatments worldwide.The authors warned easy over-the-counter availability, aggressive online promotion and limited counselling had allowed use to expand faster than safety awareness, particularly among pregnant women and households with infants.The study underlined that minoxidil was contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but awareness of this warning remained low. With topical formulations commonly used at home, unintentional exposure through skin contact or household surfaces may place infants at risk.Calling for action, the authors recommended clearer warning labels, stricter oversight of over-the-counter sales and routine counselling by pharmacists and healthcare providers.Caregivers were advised to store products safely and avoid use around infants and pregnant women.While minoxidil continues to benefit adults using it to treat hair loss, the authors stressed public awareness and pharmacovigilance must keep pace with growing use to prevent avoidable adverse effects.","Minoxidil, a widely used over-the-counter drug to treat hair loss, has been linked to unintended exposure in infants & a large number of eye-related side effects.

NEW DELHI: Union culture and tourism minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Sunday urged senior Congress leader Sonia Gandhi to return correspondences and documents of the country’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru—the father of her mother-in-law and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi—to the Prime Ministers’ Museum and Library (PMML).He asserted that the documents “belong to the country” and “not to any individual.”“We have requested the return of around 57 cartons containing roughly 26,000 documents that were taken from the museum. Sonia Gandhi has said she will look into the matter. Naturally, these ministerial documents cannot be the personal property of any individual. We have written two letters to her, and we once again urge that they be returned,” Shekhawat told news agency PTI.He recalled that in April 2008, on Gandhi’s instructions, her representative MV Rajan wrote a letter stating that she wished to take back all the “private family letters” and notes of the Congress stalwart.The minister elaborated, “Over a 20-year period, from 1970 to 1990, all the non-official documents related to Nehru were brought to the museum. This included personal letters he wrote to people, the replies received, and his personal comments and notes.Similar documents of all the prime ministers are preserved in the museum. There are approximately 2.5 crore such documents, of which 4 lakh relate to Pandit Nehru alone. ”While documents of other prime ministers remain the museum’s permanent property, Nehru’s were meant only for “safe custody,” he said, adding that it was therefore decided to return to the family any letters they requested.The Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) was established in April 1966, following Nehru’s death in May 1964. In June 2023, its name was changed to the Prime Ministers’ Museum and Library Society to recognise all of India’s prime ministers.",Culture and tourism minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat urges Sonia Gandhi to return documents of Jawaharlal Nehru.

34-year legal battle ends in win for wrongfully terminated man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/34-year-legal-battle-ends-in-win-for-wrongfully-terminated-man/articleshow/126222300.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Sometimes judicial proceedings are too slow and protracted to deliver justice in one's lifetime.This is reflected in a case in which the three-tier judicial system took 34 years to decide the validity of an ITDC employee's job termination. The litigant passed away a year before the final word was spoken on the litigation by the apex court, which delivered a verdict in his favour.D K Sharma was terminated in 1991 and the litigation started from the labour court. It then went before a single bench of Rajasthan HC, whose order was challenged before a division bench and the proceedings culminated in the Supreme Court.The labour court had passed an order in his favour and directed his reinstatement with 100% back wages after the management failed to lead evidence to prove the charges against him. It, however, passed the order in 2015, almost a quarter of century after his job was terminated.Aggrieved by the order, ITDC moved HC whose single bench modified the order to the extent that back wages awarded by the labour court were reduced to 50%. But a division bench of HC set aside the order of his reinstatement as well as payment of back wages. Sharma thereafter moved SC in 2020 which now directed the hotel to give 50% of back wages.Sharma had died last year and the litigation was pursued by his legal heir.""Insofar as the claim of the appellant for full back wages is concerned, having regard to the fact that there was no specific statement before the labour court that the appellant was not gainfully employed elsewhere in the interregnum as also the fact that Hotel Ashoka has changed hands, taking into account the long period that has elapsed since termination till passing of the award, we are of the view that award of 50% of back wages as directed by learned Single Judge of HC shall meet the ends of justice,"" said a bench of Manoj Misra and Ujjal Bhuyan while allowing his appeal.Granting 50% back wages to his family, the court said he had filed an affidavit stating that he was not gainfully employed in the interregnum and there was no evidence placed before the court by the opposite party to rebut his claim.The top court said that the order of the single judge bench of the HC was just and proper as a workman who had served for long would not be able to get employment if one crosses the age bar.""No doubt, a person may do odd jobs to survive but that cannot be a ground to deny back wages, particularly when termination of his service is by way of punishment,"" it said.","D K Sharma was terminated in 1991 and the litigation started from the labour court.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: A day before Supreme Court hears the suo motu civil case on the new definition of Aravali hills and ranges, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh on Sunday wrote to environment minister Bhupender Yadav, asking him four questions pertaining to assessment of Forest Survey of India (FSI) and views of one of the members of the central empowered committee (CEC) on the issue.Claiming that the acceptance of the new definition of the Aravallis will lead to fragmentation and undermining of the geographical and ecological integrity of the range, Ramesh said there were understandably widespread concerns with the redefinition of the hills that restricted them to landforms having an elevation of 100m or more.The environment ministry has clarified that the uniform definition would leave out only a fraction (nearly 0.2%) of the Aravalis for mining, FSI on Dec 23 refuted the claims that it carried out a study showing 90% of the hills would be left unprotected following the Nov 20 judgment.Nevertheless, Ramesh raised the question. ""Is it not a fact that the FSI, in a communication to the ministry of environment, forests and climate change dated Sept 20, 2025 had stated the following: The smaller hill formations of the Aravalis serve as natural barriers against desertification... Because the protective effect of a barrier against windblown sand scales directly with its height, even modest hills of 10 to 30 m act as strong natural wind breaks?""He further asked, ""Is it not a fact that the definition of the Aravali Hills and Ranges in Rajasthan since 2012 had been based on a report of the FSI of Aug 28, 2010 that had said the following: All such areas having a slope of 3 degrees or more shall be delineated as hills... Is it not a fact that CEC, constituted by the SC, had in its report of Nov 7, 2025, concluded that 164 mining leases in Rajasthan were inside the Aravali Hills and Ranges as defined by the then-prevailing FSI definition?""",Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh wrote to environment minister Bhupender Yadav.

PM Modi Praises Gen Z Confidence, Sees Them Leading Viksit Bharat

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Sunday flagged the growing threat of antibiotic resistance and urged people to stop using these drugs without medical advice, saying ""antibiotics are not medicines that should be taken mindlessly"".Speaking in his monthly radio address 'Mann Ki Baat', Modi cited a recent report by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that showed antibiotics are increasingly proving ineffective against common infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections. He said the trend should worry everyone.He pointed to indiscriminate consumption of antibiotics as a major driver of rising resistance and warned the belief that ""one pill can cure everything"" is making infections stronger than the drugs designed to treat them.Urging restraint, he appealed to citizens to avoid self-medication, particularly with antibiotics, and to consult doctors before taking such medicines. ""Responsible use,"" he said, ""is essential not only for individual health but also to preserve effectiveness of life-saving drugs for society at large.""Modi said greater public awareness and discipline in medicine use are crucial to reversing the trend. ""Following medical advice will prove helpful in improving your health,"" he said.Health experts have repeatedly cautioned that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is emerging as one of India's most serious public health challenges. ICMR has flagged irrational antibiotic use, often without prescriptions, as a key factor accelerating resistance, raising concerns that routine infections could become harder to treat.Adding clinical perspective, Dr Hitender Gautam, professor in department of microbiology at AIIMS, said antimicrobial resistance has become one of the most pressing global health threats of 21st century. ""Indiscriminate use of antibiotics delays treatment, increases healthcare costs and forces doctors to shift to higher-end drugs with greater side effects, raising risk of serious illness and morbidity and mortality,"" he said.Often described as a ""silent pandemic"", AMR requires urgent action, he said. ""Without preventive measures, projections suggest AMR could become one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide by 2050,"" he added.",PM Narendra Modi on Sunday flagged the growing threat of antibiotic resistance.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: Over the past two decades, Supreme Court has protected the Aravalis from activities that can harm ecologically sensitive zones, including in 2002 when it banned mining and pumping of groundwater within 5km of the Delhi border, and subsequently banned illegal mining in Haryana and Rajasthan.Even the PMO, on two occasions in April 2014 during the Manmohan Singh government and even last year, stepped in to stop the dilution of provision of 0.5% restriction on construction and other non-forest activities in Natural Conservation Zone (NCZ) in NCR which largely includes Aravalis and water bodies.""From 2002, SC has consistently passed orders restricting non-ecological activities in Aravalis. The PMO has also stepped in from time time to time to stop dilution of environmental norms. Surprisingly, the report submitted by the environment and forest ministry in the current case before the court seems to facilitate mining rather than conservation,"" said M D Sinha, former principal chief conservator of forests in Haryana government.The series of SC orders from 2002 to 2019 shows that the court did not allow mining activities and even put Haryana's PLPA Act, which would have resulted in large tracts of the Aravalis and Shiwaliks losing the legal forest tag, in abeyance.Activists fighting for protection of Aravalis said there had been consistent efforts by government entities, particularly in Haryana, to allow non-forest and real estate activities in the guise of creating recreational facilities.In 2014, then Haryana government's push to relax the construction limit in Aravali beyond 0.5% during mid-term review of the NCR Regional Plan 2021 was stopped after the PMO directed the NCR Planning Board to take the environment ministry's concerns on board.Again in 2022, Haryana pushed for doing away with mention of Aravali and NCZ in the Draft Regional Plan 2041 with a less restrictive ""Natural Zone"", the provision that would remove this mandatory conservation requirement. When the matter came before the PMO and a Group of Ministers, they directed the housing and urban affairs ministry not to dilute the provision of NCZ and Aravali.","Supreme Court has protected the Aravalis from activities that can harm ecologically sensitive zones.

'Abrupt Variation In Chenab River Flow': Pakistan Cries Over Indus Water Treaty Suspension

NEW DELHI: Paving the way for the construction of a project of strategic significance following suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a panel of the environment ministry has approved the 260 MW Dulhasti State-II hydropower project on the Chenab river in Kishtwar district of Jammu & Kashmir.It comes two months after a similar approval was granted for construction of the 1,856-MW Sawalkot hydroelectric project on the same river in Ramban district of the UT. Approvals to the project came from the expert appraisal committee of the ministry on hydel projects.Both these projects will harness the potential of the Chenab - one of the western rivers along with Indus and Jhelum whose waters currently flow unchecked to Pakistan despite India's right to use it for non-consumptive purposes, including hydro-power generation.Estimated to cost Rs 3,200 crore, Dulhasti State-II is an extension of 390 MW Dulhasti State-I, which has been successfully operating since 2007. Under the plan, water will be diverted from Stage-I through a separate tunnel.The project will require over 8 hectares of private land to be acquired from two villages, Benzwar and Palmer, in Kishtwar district.So far, only 3,482 MW capacity of hydro-power generation units has been constructed by India out of an estimated potential of about 20,000 MW in Jammu & Kashmir which could be harnessed from power projects on its western rivers.IWT was signed between India and Pakistan for sharing of waters of the Indus Basin. Under the treaty, signed in 1960 with the mediation of World Bank, the total waters of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas and Ravi - was allocated to India for unrestricted use while the waters of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - was allocated largely to Pakistan. India has, however, not been fully utilising its legal share due to lack of storage capacity.","The 260-MW Dulhasti State-II hydropower project will be built on the Chenab river in Kishtwar district of Jammu & Kashmir.

The Collapse Of The Red Corridor: How India Broke The Back Of Maoist Extremism | I Witness

Set up ‘

deregulation cells

’ in offices, PM tells top bureaucrats

NEW DELHI: PM Modi has asked chief secretaries to ensure Maoism does not relapse in areas freed from the extremist entities, by accelerating saturation of infrastructure works and welfare schemes, report Dipak Dash and Manash Gohain.At a meeting of chief secretaries in Delhi on Saturday and Sunday that he chaired, the PM said the challenge now is to see that those who have joined the mainstream don't go back to the fold of Maoism, TOI has learned.He stressed the focus must be on all-round development, from roads and water supply to rehab for those who have surrendered, an official said.The PM asked the top bureaucrats to set up “deregulation cells” in their offices on the lines of the Cabinet Secretariat to accelerate the reforms agenda and improve “ease of living and doing business”. Modi also asked them to replicate the Centre’s model of Pragati in states for review of major infrastructure projects which are delayed.The meeting took note of achievements made in ease of doing business in the past year with five states — Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Tripura — completing all 23 reforms. The presentation by the Cabinet Secretariat mentioned that overall progress was over 75%.Officials who were present at the meeting said the PM asked them to focus on development of areas that are now free from Maoist terror. “He said the focus must be on all-round development (Vikas Ganga) in every front — road, water supply, education, healthcare, employment, rehabilitation and security of those who have dropped arms,” said an official. The Telangana govt made a presentation on “post-left wing extremism future”.The PM’s observation gains significance considering that Maoism had found support for lack of basic facilities and Maoists were able to hold on to this by ensuring that development never reached locals and towards that end they bombed schools, other infrastructure and did not allow construction of roads.There have also been acknowledgements from Maoist leaders — who have surrendered as well as those still holding out — of success of govt’s welfare schemes, such as free ration and development activities under the aspirational districts programme, resulting in losing their grip over locals.Officials said on the risk of relapse, the PM was of the view that victories will be complete when those who have come to the mainstream are not entrapped by Maoist propaganda again. Those who have surrendered have cautioned that there may be a relapse for non-fulfillment of promises such as cash reward, personal security, gainful employment and local development areas.The fifth chief secretaries conference on the overarching theme of ‘Human Capital for Viksit Bharat’ saw discussion on early childhood education, schooling, skilling, sports and extracurricular activities.PM asked chief secretaries to ensure that all PM Shri Kendriya Vidyalayas and Eklavya schools get toilet for females by March 8. Modi also shared his concerns over irregularities in Jal Jeevan Mission, sources said.","PM Modi has asked top bureaucrats to ensure Maoism does not relapse in areas freed from the extremist entities.

The foundation's initiatives, like Read for 15 and Volunteer for 15, foster positive development in young people.

How Patrick Mahomes’ foundation became a source of pride beyond football

As the Kansas City Chiefs grind through a demanding NFL season, Brittany Mahomes has increasingly drawn attention for something far removed from wins, losses, or playoff math. While criticism and pressure often follow Patrick Mahomes on the field, his work away from football has continued to grow quietly and steadily.Recent recognition tied to his charitable efforts highlighted a side of the Chiefs quarterback that doesn’t show up on stat sheets. For Brittany, that impact appears to matter just as much, if not more, than the weekly noise surrounding the team..Patrick Mahomes’ 15 and the Mahomies Foundation has reached a stage where its influence is measurable, visible, and increasingly community-driven. Its partner organization, Youth Volunteer Corps has recently published annual estimates of 92, 714 hours of volunteer work done by young people equating to the community value of an estimated 3.2 million dollars..Brittany Mahomes made the most of such an achievement with a very modest yet informative gesture, as she interacted with the post, expanding its popularity.The numbers only tell part of the story. For many volunteers, Patrick Mahomes’ example has become personal motivation. Luke from Hampton explained why the quarterback’s leadership resonates with him.“Patrick Mahomes has inspired me to volunteer because of the way he uses his platform to give back to the community (being a core sponsor of Youth Volunteer Corps).“Beyond his talent on the field, he demonstrates leadership, generosity, and a commitment to helping others, showing success comes with the responsibility to make a positive impact,” Luke said.The philosophy has formed the growing programs of the foundation. Programs such as Read for 15 will help young children develop the reading habit on a daily basis, and Volunteer for 15 will expose older students to organized community service. Another branch, 15 for 15, provides funding across academics, science, athletics, and the arts.Earlier this fall, Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes hosted the sixth annual 15 and the Mahomies Foundation Gala, drawing more than 900 supporters and raising $1.5 million for 27 local charities. As football narratives fluctuate, the foundation’s steady growth offers a reminder that Mahomes’ influence and Brittany’s pride in it extends well beyond Arrowhead Stadium.Also Read: Randi Mahomes’ powerful reaction to Brittany’s holiday surprise quickly caught fans’ attention","Patrick Mahomes' 15 and the Mahomies Foundation is making a significant community impact.

Social media permit

Sugar Tax





As the New Year’s fireworks fade over the Burj Khalifa, UAE residents aren't just waking up to a new calendar, they are waking up to a new way of living. January 1, 2026, marks the launch of a major ""regulatory reset"" across the Emirates.Whether it’s what you find in your takeaway bag or how long your kids stay in school on a Friday, the country is getting a significant upgrade. Here are the top five changes you need to know to stay ahead of the curve.This is the second major phase of the nationwide environmental push. Starting January 1, 2026, the UAE is banning an expanded range of single-use plastic items, including beverage cups and lids, cutlery (spoons, forks, knives, chopsticks), plates, straws, stirrers, and food containers or boxes made of Styrofoam. The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) through Ministerial Decision No. 380 of 2022.The ban applies to the import, manufacture, and trade of these items. If a product is made of conventional plastic (not plant-based or recycled), it is prohibited.Businesses found violating this ban face a starting fine of AED 2,000. This amount can be doubled for repeat offenses within the same year, up to a maximum of AED 10,000.To avoid these fines, residents and businesses should switch to reusable alternatives or plant-based (PLA) products, which remain exempt.Starting the first week of January 2026, the timing for Friday Jumu'ah prayers and school dismissals is changing nationwide to accommodate the standardized 12:45 PM prayer time. The General Authority for Islamic Affairs, Awqaf, and Zakat announced the prayer shift, and the KHDA (Knowledge and Human Development Authority) confirmed the specific Dubai school changes.In Dubai, all private schools must finish the school day by 11:30 AM on Fridays starting January 9, 2026. This allows students and staff enough time to reach mosques before the 12:45 PM sermon begins. Schools for older students (Grade 6/Year 7 and above) may offer online learning options for Fridays, provided they get KHDA approval.While there are no direct ""fines"" for parents, schools that fail to comply with these dismissal times risk regulatory action and warnings from education authorities for non-compliance with the national academic calendar and student wellbeing guidelines.New updates to the Tax Procedures Law take effect on January 1, 2026, introducing a strict ""use it or lose it"" rule for tax refunds and a much longer window for the government to audit suspected tax evaders. The Ministry of Finance through Federal Decree-Laws No. 16 and 17 of 2025 announced.Businesses and individuals can no longer carry forward overpaid VAT or credit balances indefinitely. You must claim your refund within 5 years from the end of the tax period, or the right to that money expires. Additionally, the Federal Tax Authority (FTA) can now audit cases of suspected tax evasion for up to 15 years, a massive increase from the previous 5-year limit.Failure to conduct ""due diligence"" on your suppliers can lead to the denial of VAT recovery if that supplier is found to be part of an evasion chain. Furthermore, natural persons (freelancers/sole traders) with a turnover exceeding AED 1 million who fail to register for Corporate Tax face an administrative penalty of AED 10,000.The deadline for individual social media influencers and content creators to obtain a professional permit is January 31, 2026. This applies to anyone who accepts payment (cash or gifts) to promote brands or services on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.Influencers must apply for an ""individual"" permit to legally conduct advertising activities. This move aims to professionalize the industry and ensure that advertisements are clearly disclosed to the public.Operating without a valid permit after the deadline can result in a fine of AED 10,000. In some cases, the influencer's social media accounts may be suspended or their business license revoked. To stay safe, you should apply for the permit through the UAE Media Council's official portal before the end of the month.The Ministry of Finance via Cabinet Decision No. 197 of 2025 announced that sweetened beverages are being taxed is shifting from a flat rate to a tiered system based on sugar content. Beginning January 1, 2026, the more sugar a drink contains per 100ml, the higher the tax (and price) will be.The Details: High-sugar drinks (8g or more per 100ml) will be taxed at AED 1.10 per liter, while moderate-sugar drinks (5g to 7.99g) will be taxed at AED 0.79 per liter. Drinks with less than 5g of sugar or those using only artificial sweeteners will be taxed at 0%.Manufacturers and importers who fail to provide required lab reports for their products will see their drinks automatically classified into the highest tax tier. Additionally, businesses failing to register for excise tax or file returns correctly face standard administrative penalties, which typically start at AED 10,000 for late registration.January 2026 brings smart, people-friendly changes across taxes, environment, workplace, and travel. Many rules help make life greener and more efficient, but they come with clear compliance requirements and fines if ignored.","UAE introduces new rules starting January 2026.

Matt Hardy’s wrestling career and long-term earnings

Reby Sky’s media work, business ventures, and lifestyle

Matt Hardy continues to stand as one of professional wrestling’s most recognizable figures due to his career spanning over multiple eras and multiple promotions. Whether it was his rise as part of The Hardy Boyz or the re-inventions that kept him relevant long into his forties, Hardy has long known how to capitalize on his name. As of the year 2025, wrestling contracts, merchandise, licensing, and digital appearances remain the basis of the wealth he created.That foundation is complemented by the streams of income brought in by Reby Sky, legally Rebecca Hardy. With a modeling/television/online media career that came before and through wrestling (and continues to exist), she has become a brand unto herself outside the ring. Considering how standalone earnings will translate into 2025, most industry watchers put them in a single net worth window of $3 million to $6 million apiece, depending on how private assets and ongoing business income are counted.The key to Matt Hardy’s wealth is immortality. It's hard for many wrestlers to stay active and stay relevant as we see three decades pass, but Hardy has done just that. It led to big WWE contracts, lengthy stints in Impact Wrestling, and, eventually, every so often, a return to major promotions for consistent paydays at multiple points in his career.In addition to base salaries, Hardy experienced the upsides of merchandise royalties, pay-per-view bonuses, and foreign tours.Well into his later career, his ability to reinvent himself, often through character-driven storylines, maintained the demand for appearances and allowed him to remain a commercially viable brand long after many peers quietly exited the scene.Most of Reby Sky's contribution to the couple's net worth comes outside of the ring. From her modeling career, television exposure, and powerful presence on social media platforms, she brings in advertising and partnership revenue. Working with brands and on her own media projects has given her ongoing revenue.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Hardy and Sky share a lifestyle somewhere in the ballpark upper end of upper-middle-class; no one is reading about them in that section of the N.Y.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

From December 26, mandatory biometric checking of all non-US citizens, including Green Card holders, at border points comes into effect. This means their photographs would be taken by US Customs and Border Protection officials at every entry and exit point across airports, land crossings and seaports. This new rule is applicable to all non-US citizens entering or exiting the country. Children below 14 years and adults over 79 years are also included.The biometric system aims to address security and visa-overstay concerns. DHS says it is not for broad surveillance, though critics remain wary.This is not entirely new. Biometric collection at exit for the US was limited to pilot programs at select ports.

Damage to CIBIL score

Bank slapped with Rs 2k costs

BENGALURU: A Bengaluru-based fintech company employee's life turned upside down after he was hounded for over Rs 14 lakh bill for a credit card that he never received or used.However, the legal route that he explored has provided him relief: The Bengaluru additional district consumer disputes redressal commission has restrained the bank from recovering the amount from him, holding that the transaction was ""obviously fraudulent"" and marked by glaring lapses on the bank's part.Polepally Avinash, a ClearTax employee since 2019 and a resident of Nayandahalli, said his troubles began on Jan 31, 2023, when a person identifying himself as Rizwan, an Axis Bank representative, called him with a credit card offer. The bank collected his Aadhaar, PAN and salary slips. Soon after, Avinash was told his application had been rejected and no card reached him.However, he received shockers when recovery agents started turning up at his doorstep between July and Aug 2023, demanding close to Rs 14.2 lakh in credit card dues. Avinash insisted he had never received a card, let alone spent such a sum.Bank officials, however, claimed the card was active and that payments had been made — allegedly by an unknown personWith recovery calls, visits and threats mounting, Avinash approached the Bengaluru East cybercrime police on July 6, 2023, filing a complaint against the bank's authorised agent.Avinash also wrote to Axis Bank on Jan 10, 2024, flagging that the alleged fake card had damaged his CIBIL score.Though the bank initially assured action, it allegedly went silent. The recovery pressure, however, did not stop. Avinash was forced to file a consumer complaint in 2024, accusing the bank staff of unfair trade practices.Despite receiving notice, Axis Bank failed to appear before the commission and was proceeded against ex parte. The bench noted that the bank neither conducted a proper probe nor lodged a police complaint, yet continued recovery efforts despite glaring inconsistencies.Citing WhatsApp chats with the alleged agent, recovery records and the police endorsement, the commission observed: ""There is something fishy in the transaction, and it is obviously fraudulent.""In its order dated Nov 25, the bench — comprising president Syed Anser Kaleem and members Sharavathi SM and Jyothi N — directed Axis Bank to stop all recovery attempts for about Rs 14.2 lakh and pay Rs 2,000 as litigation costs.","Polepally Avinash, a ClearTax employee since 2019, said his troubles began on Jan 31, 2023, when a person identifying himself as Rizwan, an Axis Bank representative, called him with a credit card offer.

Does India have a rabies problem?

BUDAUN: Nearly 200 residents of Piprauli village in Uttar Pradesh’s Budaun district were given anti-rabies vaccines as a precaution after learning that raita served at a funeral was prepared using milk from a buffalo that later died of suspected rabies.Villagers said a funeral ceremony was held on December 23, during which raita was served. A few days later, it emerged that the buffalo whose milk had been used had been bitten by a dog earlier. The buffalo died on December 26, triggering panic in the village over possible infection, according to news agency PTI.Following this, villagers reached the Ujhani community health centre and got vaccinated.Chief Medical Officer Dr Rameshwar Mishra said on Sunday that authorities received information that the buffalo had been bitten by a rabid dog and had shown symptoms of rabies before its death. It was also reported that villagers had consumed raita made from the animal’s milk.""Prevention is better than cure. Everyone who had any doubts was given the anti-rabies vaccine. Normally, there is no risk of rabies after boiling the milk, but the vaccination was done to prevent any potential risk,"" he added.The health department said no disease has spread in the village so far and the situation is completely normal.The CMO added that anyone who approached the Ujhani Community Health Centre was immediately given the vaccine. The primary health centre and community health centre were kept open on both Saturday and Sunday for this purpose.He also said the village is being monitored to prevent the spread of rumours or panic.Villager Dharmpal said that the buffalo was bitten by a dog, due to which it fell ill and later died. The fear of infection arose because the 'raaita' was made from the milk of that same buffalo, so they got the rabies injection.","Nearly 200 residents of Piprauli village in Uttar Pradesh’s Budaun district were given anti-rabies vaccines as a precaution.

The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Meet Google executive 'responsible' for Sam Altman sending 'Code Red' to OpenAI employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-google-executive-responsible-for-sam-altman-sending-code-red-to-openai-employees/articleshow/126187250.cms,"Google's Josh Woodward has jolted OpenAI, forcing a 'code red' with his Gemini app's rapid success. Gemini's user growth and image generation capabilities have challenged ChatGPT's dominance, leading to a significant shift in the AI landscape. Woodward's ability to cut through bureaucracy and his team's innovative approach are credited for Google's AI resurgence, impacting Alphabet's stock and OpenAI's strategic plans.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The numbers tell a brutal story for ChatGPT

The secret weapon: Breaking Google's legendary bureaucracy





Josh Woodward isn't a household name in Silicon Valley, but the 42-year-old Google veteran has accomplished what seemed impossible just months ago—he's made the world's most powerful AI company sweat. The executive leading Google's Gemini app triggered such alarm at OpenAI that CEO Sam Altman declared an internal ""code red"" in early December, forcing the startup to abandon lucrative projects and scramble to defend its eroding market position.Woodward's impact has been devastating for OpenAI. Since taking charge of the Gemini app in April while simultaneously running Google Labs, he's orchestrated a comeback that's transformed Google from AI afterthought to existential threat. His team's viral Nano Banana image generator crashed Google's own infrastructure in August, generating so much traffic that the company's custom AI chips nearly ""melted,"" according to CNBC reports from a November all-hands meeting.Google's resurgence under Woodward's leadership has fundamentally rewritten the competitive landscape. Gemini's monthly active users grew from 350 million in March to 650 million by October, coming close to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly users. By September, Gemini had dethroned ChatGPT atop Apple's App Store after generating 5 billion images.The impact runs deeper than raw user counts. Data from Similarweb reveals that Gemini has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months, surging from 5.4% to 18.2%.This gain came directly at ChatGPT's expense—OpenAI's flagship product plummeted from commanding 87.2% market share to just 68%, a staggering 19-point drop.The blow came in late November when Google announced Gemini 3, a LLM model that outperformed OpenAI's flagship products on industry benchmarks and sent Alphabet's stock soaring. Within days, Altman issued his ""code red"" memo, delaying OpenAI's planned advertising business, e-commerce expansion, and AI agent development to pour resources into improving ChatGPT's core experience. The desperation was palpable—this was OpenAI's most decisive admission yet of the competitive pressure threatening its $500 billion valuation.Woodward's success stems from an unusual talent in Google's notoriously slow-moving culture. Colleagues told CNBC he's mastered the art of demolishing bureaucratic barriers through systems like ""block,"" where employees flag roadblocks for his team to immediately resolve. Former Google Labs co-lead Clay Bavor says Woodward's ability to ""move fast, break down barriers and execute"" has landed him ""right at the center of the most important work at Google. ""His track record speaks volumes. NotebookLM became an instant hit after its July 2023 launch. His quarterly newsletter grew so influential that Google executives routinely seek his reading recommendations. He responds directly to user complaints on X and Reddit, bringing feedback to engineers for rapid fixes—a level of user engagement that's helped Gemini gain trust and momentum.OpenAI fired back earlier this month with GPT-5.2, claiming benchmark superiority once again. But Woodward holds structural advantages that terrify OpenAI: Google's massive cash reserves, custom AI chips, and nine products with over 1 billion users each. While OpenAI burns through funding rounds to survive, Woodward's operation runs on profits from YouTube and search. Alphabet's 62% stock surge in 2025 outpaced all megacap peers—a dramatic reversal from its brutal first quarter that vindicated Woodward's strategy.","Google's Gemini app has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months.

Living it up

A sound investment

Picture this: You step out of the airport and into the open doors of a chauffeured car. You are driven to a sleek building in an upscale neighbourhood, where staff greet you with a cool drink as the manager checks you in. You are shown your room, wallpapered, wainscoted and well provisioned, and introduced to the amenities: a rooftop pool, gym, community lounge, reading and dining rooms.A run-through of weekend activities follows: coffee parties by the pool, Pilates sessions, barbeques. ""And here's the call button for the concierge,"" smiles the manager.Driven by competition and shifting Gen Z aspirations, the student hostel has had a glow-up.""These are nothing like your conventional hostels and PGs,"" says Rohan Gupta, co-founder and chief marketing officer at Colstay Ltd, which owns the luxury student residence brand Aurus and Hive Hostels, a mid-range variant. The hostel described above is Aurus Chapter 1 in Vile Parle, a 275-bed facility for female students, run by a staff of 75.""We launched Aurus two years ago when our students at Hive wanted a more elevated experience.We now have four of these properties in Mumbai - two for girls and two for boys - and plan to launch in Ahmedabad, Noida and Pune next year.""Premium residences are the newest segment in student housing, with monthly rentals starting at Rs 50,000 for a single bed in a triple-occupancy room, along with a three-month deposit.Student hostels today offer conveniences that, until a decade ago, were associated mainly with overseas campuses, including professional housekeeping and laundry services, AC rooms, snack vending machines, lounges, pickleball courts, swimming pools, jacuzzis, community events, college drop-offs and doctors on call. There is usually a property manager to deal with everything from a broken bolt to glitchy WiFi.""Everything's included in the rent,"" says Gaurav Bhathena, director of Student Housing India Ltd, a company his father Kamlesh Bhathena founded in 2015 with just 20 beds and few frills, in Juhu. Today, the company operates more than 1,100 beds across 15 facilities, complete with its own pools and pickleball courts. Depending on the neighbourhood and room configuration, annual rentals range from Rs 5 to 7 lakh.Upscale hostels are also appearing in emerging education hubs such as Jaipur, Vizag, Noida, Ahmedabad and Dehradun. According to the All India Survey on Higher Education 2021-22, student enrolment rose 4.6% from the previous year to nearly 4.3 crore. Meanwhile, the Economic Survey 2024-25 reported a 13.8% increase in higher education institutions between 2014-15 and 2022-23. On-campus housing, however, has not expanded at the same pace.The India Brand Equity Foundation estimates an 80% gap between on-campus housing capacity and the student population, a shortfall the private student housing market aims to bridge. Valued at Rs 6,822 crore by 2030, the sector is positioning itself as a crucial extension of campus infrastructure.It's a win-win for both companies and colleges, says Shivansh Gambhir, marketing manager at Delhi-based Communezen Ventures, which runs Uniliv, a premium student housing brand, and Huddle Stays, a more affordable one.The rapid growth of the sector has drawn investor attention. Hive Hostels, which plans to launch its IPO soon, is valued at $35 million after securing seed funding of $1.15 million from Anchorage Capital Group earlier this year. Communezen Ventures raised $2.78 million in its latest funding round through a combination of equity and debt.Developers are also looking to strike deals. ""Some of them prefer a rental portfolio to selling because they want to hold onto their inventory, perhaps to retain it as a family asset,"" says Mayank Bajaj, founder of The Livlit, a co-living company where students, interns and working professionals cohabit. ""When a builder leases their property to a student housing or co-living space, they earn a 6-7% rental and 5-7% capital appreciation every five years. The average yield is a comfortable 13%.""Today, many student housing companies are also acquiring land themselves and constructing built-for-purpose properties with compact rooms and large common areas.There's nothing basic about the student housing business today; the brief is simple: floor 'em.","Student hostels offer conveniences that, until a decade ago, were associated mainly with overseas campuses.

Traders continue to price in two US rate cuts next year, a backdrop that tends to favour non-yielding assets. The US dollar hovered near the two-month lows reached last Wednesday, offering some support to bullion, which has enjoyed a strong rally in 2025, climbing 72% so far.Geopolitical developments also remained in focus.US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were “getting a lot closer, maybe very close” to an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.Among other precious metals, spot platinum slipped 0.8% to $2,429.10 an ounce after earlier rising to a record $2,478.50, while palladium edged up 0.1% to $2,003.83 an ounce.","Spot silver jumped 3.8% to $82.15 an ounce, after earlier hitting an all-time high of $83.62.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in green on Monday. While Nifty50 was above 26,050, BSE Sensex was above 85,000. At 9:17 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,074.75, up 18 points or 0.069%. BSE Sensex was at 85,082.51, up 41 points or 0.048%.Stock markets are likely to see increased volatility in this week as calendar year 2025 ends and a new year begins, coinciding with the December derivatives expiry. Investors will closely track a string of domestic data releases, including November industrial production numbers, government budget value figures, external debt data and the final HSBC Manufacturing PMI reading, which are expected to guide near term sentiment.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The standout feature of 2025 has been India’s stark underperformance compared to most developed and emerging markets. This underperformance is set to change in 2026 supported by solid fundamentals: India’s macros are in Goldilocks setting with robust economic growth and stable financial construct. The more important factor from the market perspective-earnings growth- is set to recover from Q3 FY26 onwards.“Even though these are favourable factors, these are not sufficient to trigger a rally soon. A strong rebound in the market needs a trigger like a US- India trade deal with favourable thrills for India. There is no clarity yet on when this will happen. Therefore, a consolidation phase is likely in the near-term, and investors can utilise this consolidation phase to slowly accumulate high quality stocks giving priority to largecaps. ”Global markets provided mixed cues in thin holiday trade.

Australia Enforces World’s First Under-16 Social Media Ban, Sparks Global Debate| Global Pulse





LONDON: A frustrated father in Spain, whose teenage daughter regularly sidesteps parental controls that block social media, wants the government to ban apps like TikTok and Instagram for children. In France, a mother of three worries about social media's effect on young people and will not give her children smartphones until they are 15. But she is sceptical a government prohibition is the answer. A mother in Chile says it is a parent's job, not government's, to teach children how to use social media responsibly.Since Australia this month barred children under 16 from using social media, parents around the world have been debating whether similarly tough action is needed in their own countries. In Australia, surveys show most parents support the new rules, while young teenagers have talked about using VPNs and other workarounds. Several countries are weighing whether to adopt similar laws.Malaysia has announced plans to bar children under 16 from using social media starting 2026. Denmark could impose Europe's toughest restrictions, though the measures would not go as far as Australia's. In the US, several states have passed laws to restrict children's social media use.Many parents said they were aware of the impact of smartphones on their own lives, and wanted to protect their children from the most harmful effects. But many also said they felt as if they were fighting a losing battle and were worn down by the time, arguments and technological know-how needed to keep their digitally savvy kids off social media. Parents who feel that way welcomed government action.Israel Perez, a designer in Barcelona, said his 14-year-old daughter was constantly pestering him to lift the restrictions he has imposed on her social media use. He said an Australia-like law would give parents more support in pushing back against such an online culture. ""I really see it as necessary, not as a drastic or excessive measure,"" he said.In Denmark, Anne Kroijer, a mother of four persuaded about three-quarters of the parents in her daughter's class not to buy smartphones for their children. They got older flip phones instead that do not have many apps or a large touch screen. ""It's so incredibly uninteresting that she forgets it half the time,"" said Kroijer. Justine Roberts, founder of Mumsnet, an online community for parents in Britain, said screen time was one of the most common topics on the site's message boards. In a poll, Mumsnet found 83% said they would back an Australia-like ban in Britain.Not all parents believe new laws are needed, and some worry about government overreach. Others see new technologies and social media as an inevitable part of children's daily lives. Charlotte Valette, a mother of three in Paris, said: ""I am not so enthusiastic about the idea of a state taking such a drastic measure."" In Kenya, a country betting on technology to bolster its economy, it will be hard to persuade parents to take away their children's smartphones, said Calvin Odera, a social worker in Nairobi, the capital.In Germany, a yearlong review of a petition brought by parents to parliament calling for an age limit on social media use showed opinion was split. One respondent wrote: ""So, you're supposed to register on social media with a digital ID card now, or some other method to verify your actual age?... The clock can't be turned back."" Verena Holler was one of the parents supporting the petition. ""It's a global crisis.""","Australia this month barred children under 16 from using social media.

Red Line From New Delhi: India Calls Out Yunus Govt As Minority Attacks In Bangladesh Escalate





DHAKA: National Citizen Party (NCP) - founded by leaders, mostly students, of the '2024 July Uprising' that led to the Sheikh Hasina govt's collapse - is in the grip of an internal turmoil with 30 members formally opposing its move to ally with Bangladesh's largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) for the Feb 12 national polls, citing its controversial historical role and ""recent divisive activities"".The Islamist party had collaborated with the Pakistan army to commit genocide during the 1971 war and was opposed to Bangladesh's independence. The ban, put on it during Hasina's tenure, was lifted last year after Muhammad Yunus took charge of the interim govt.The members wrote to NCP convener Nahid Islam after joint convener Tajnuva Jabeen announced her resignation and senior joint member secretary Tasnim Jara stepped down from her post. Sources said many NCP members may move to rival BNP or contest the polls as independent candidates.In a Facebook post, Tajnuva said she would not contest the upcoming elections as she is objected to NCP's decision to ally with JeI. Tasnim said she will contest as an independent candidate from Dhaka-9.JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman has announced at a press conference Liberal Democratic Party - headed by former BNP-era minister Col (retd) Oli Ahmed - and Nahid-led NCP had joined the JeI-headed eight-party coalition.Shafiqur said the alliance has nearly finalised its nomination list for all 300 constituencies through talks with the partners. On NCP's absence from the briefing, he said, ""The party's leaders were unable to attend due to time constraints. But they have clearly informed us of their decision to join the alliance. They will announce it to the media through a separate press conference,"" he said.Tajnuva said many had assumed her objection stemmed from ideological concerns, but she was troubled by the process through which the alliance was formed. She said after inviting nationwide nominations and selecting 125 aspirants, NCP was now finalising a seat-sharing arrangement for about 30 constituencies. Tajnuva added, ""I have left NCP, not politics.""",National Citizen Party (NCP) is in the grip of an internal turmoil. 30 members formally opposing its move to ally with Bangladesh's largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami for the Feb 12 national polls.

UAE salaries 2025: What workers really earn without a minimum wage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-salaries-2025-what-workers-really-earn-without-a-minimum-wage/articleshow/126200767.cms,"The UAE is gradually moving toward structured wage regulation, with benchmark salaries and mandatory payment systems shaping worker protections despite the absence of a national minimum wage/Image: Pexels

What workers typically earn: A benchmark view

de facto minimums

Domestic workers:

Construction and skilled trades:

Retail and service staff:

Office and administrative roles:

University graduates and skilled technicians:

Visa rules and wage enforcement

Family visa sponsorship: The UAE mandates a minimum salary of AED 4,000 (or AED 3,000 plus accommodation) for an expatriate to sponsor dependents.

Golden Visa applicants in employment-based categories must earn at least AED 30,000/month (₹701,100), particularly in scientific or technical fields.

Employment contracts must specify wages in UAE dirhams and be registered with MoHRE to be legally recognised.

Rising costs and reform pressures

The road ahead: Formal minimum wage in sight?

Free zones may begin enforcing internal wage floors for certain industries to standardise competition.

Sector-specific minimum wages could emerge in healthcare, hospitality, and logistics where migrant workers dominate and wage disparity is high.

Public-private harmonisation efforts may also push for parity, as Emirati workers often earn significantly more than expatriate counterparts in similar roles.

Verdict





As of 2025, the UAE has not enacted a formal nationwide minimum wage for all private-sector workers. The current labor framework, outlined in Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021, provides the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) with the legal authority to establish a national wage floor but no binding law has yet been implemented.Instead, salaries are regulated through employment contracts and visa-related requirements. Employers must pay wages via the Wage Protection System (WPS); a government-monitored payroll platform. Failure to comply can result in suspension of new work permits, fines, and company blacklisting.Recent reforms have expanded WPS coverage to include domestic and semi-professional workers like private teachers, caregivers, nannies, and farm technicians. This shift reflects a broader move toward labor standardization and income protection across job categories.Although no legally enforced floor exists, salary benchmarks function asin many professions. These reflect industry standards, cost of living, and immigration thresholds.Housemaids, nannies, and drivers employed in homes now fall under stricter payment rules, with most salaries ranging from AED 1,200 to AED 1,800/month (₹28,044–₹42,066), depending on experience and nationality.WPS compliance is mandatory for these roles, ensuring regular wage transfers and legal accountability for employers.Labourers and tradesmen form the backbone of the UAE’s infrastructure sector. While base pay for unskilled labourers often starts at AED 1,200–1,500/month (₹28,044–₹35,055), skilled tradespeople such as electricians, plumbers, and masons can earn between AED 2,000 and AED 4,500/month(₹46,740–₹105,165). Many of these roles are protected under labour laws that mandate written contracts, paid leave, and access to dispute resolution.Workers in retail outlets, supermarkets, cafes, and delivery platforms typically earn AED 2,500 to AED 4,000/month (₹58,425–₹93,480). In these sectors, wage variability is influenced by location (Dubai salaries often exceed those in Sharjah or Ajman), nationality, and employer size.Clerical staff, receptionists, and data entry assistants generally receive AED 3,000 to AED 5,000/month (₹70,110–₹116,850), with larger companies or public sector institutions offering higher packages. For visa eligibility especially family sponsorship—employees must earn a minimum of AED 4,000/month (₹93,480), or AED 3,000 (₹70,110) plus housing.For professionals with technical or university qualifications, MoHRE guidelines recommend salaries of at least AED 5,000 to AED 12,000/month (₹116,850–₹280,440), depending on the nature of the role. Engineers, IT professionals, and finance specialists typically command salaries within or well above this range.Though no national wage law exists, immigration requirements act as an indirect filter. For example:The Wage Protection System ensures salaries are paid into local bank accounts within 10 days of the due date. Any delay beyond 15 days triggers automatic alerts, and repeated violations can lead to bans on new hiring.Over the past few years, Dubai and Abu Dhabi have seen substantial increases in rent, school fees, and healthcare costs. As a result, there is growing pressure on authorities to formalise wage protections and align pay standards with inflation.While some companies voluntarily adjust salaries to retain talent, many low-income workers remain vulnerable to economic shocks today. Calls for an indexed minimum wage system adjusted annually to match living costs are growing increasingly louder, particularly from labour advocates, unions in labour-sending countries, and international policy observers worldwide.Although the UAE has avoided a one-size-fits-all national wage model, change is on the horizon:MoHRE has already hinted at “exploring mechanisms” to address income disparities. If implemented, a flexible minimum wage varying by sector or emirate which could strike a balance between labour protection and economic competitiveness.While there is no official minimum wage in the UAE today, the country is moving toward greater wage transparency, stronger payment enforcement, and benchmark-based income protection. Domestic workers, skilled labourers, and administrative staff now operate under more structured payment conditions—backed by technology and labour law.As the UAE positions itself as a global employment hub, expectations for formal wage regulation will continue to rise. A future where salaries are legally anchored to fair benchmarks seems not only possible but likely.","As of 2025, the UAE has not enacted a formal nationwide minimum wage for all private-sector workers.

Saudi Arabia is taking a firmer stance against banned and counterfeit pesticides, with a draft regulation proposing jail terms, hefty fines, and strict enforcement measures. The new rules aim to protect public health, the environment, and agriculture, while giving authorities clear powers to penalize repeat offenders.The proposed regulation introduces strict consequences for anyone involved in manufacturing or importing banned or counterfeit pesticides. Under the draft, violators may face up to five years in prison, fines reaching SR10 million, or one of these two penalties. The Public Prosecution will investigate all violations and bring the cases before the competent court to enforce the penalties outlined in the regulation. In situations where the offender repeats the violation, the prosecution is authorized to double the penalties to ensure stronger compliance and deterrence.Not all violations will lead to immediate jail time or fines. The draft clarifies that if a violation is minor and does not cause significant harm to humans, animals, plants, the environment, or public health, the violator will first receive a warning. Authorities may then provide a grace period for the issue to be corrected before applying penalties.The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) will play a central role in reviewing violations related to public health pesticides. Responsibilities of the SFDA under the draft include:Additionally, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture can require violators to remove the cause of the violation. Repeating the offense within three years of a previous violation is considered a repeat offense, which can lead to doubling of fines.The draft also outlines strict measures for dealing with the materials involved in violations. These include:Beyond fines, the draft also allows authorities to temporarily close the facility for up to six months or even permanently shut it down in severe cases. Those penalized have the right to appeal the decision in the Administrative Court in accordance with its regulations.","Saudi Arabia proposes up to five years jail and SR10 million fine for banned pesticides.

After they reached India for their scheduled visa appointments in January, they were told that their appointment dates had been rescheduled to 2026, starting from March-April. This leaves a chunk of H-1B workers at a lurch, as now they can't enter the US without a new stamping and are also uncertain as to whether they would be allowed to work from India.Many Indians with valid H-1B visa traveled to India for holidays only to find out that their visas had been revoked. They have been told that they won't be able to enter the US without a new stamp. Given the present situation, it may take at least six months in India. From December 15, H-1B and H-4 (H-1B dependent) applicants have been subject to social media vetting.Despite many MAGA activists calling for H-1B ban, the administration is overhauling the system and proposed a wage-based selection instead of random H-1B lottery. In the proposed wage-based selection, higher wage will get higher priorities.","Hundreds of H-1B visa holders flew to India to get their visa stamping done as the administration made it mandatory to get the stamping now in the country of origin.

"Saudi Arabia leads GCC in Indian deportations: Over 13,000 workers sent home in 2025",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-leads-gcc-in-indian-deportations-over-13000-workers-sent-home-in-2025/articleshow/126202625.cms,"Saudi Arabia deported about 11,000 Indian workers in one year, mostly low-skilled labourers employed in construction, domestic work, and caregiving.

Why Saudi Arabia dominates the numbers

The compliance challenge

Recruitment practices and India’s response





Saudi Arabia emerged as the single largest source of Indian deportations in the Gulf in 2025, overtaking even the United States, according to the figures tabled by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in the Rajya Sabha. The data shows that more than 24,600 Indians were deported globally in 2025, spanning 81 countries, with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations accounting for a substantial share of removals.Among GCC countries, Saudi Arabia alone accounted for 10,884 deportations in 2025, out of a regional total of 13,133, followed by the UAE (1,469), Bahrain (764), and Oman (16). Figures for Kuwait and Qatar were not listed in the MEA’s Annexure-I for the year. The same annexure shows that between 2021 and 2025, total Indian deportations from GCC countries reached 56,460, with Saudi Arabia accounting for 49,084 across its Riyadh and Jeddah missions, again far outstripping the UAE (3,979), Bahrain (3,202) and Oman (195).Saudi Arabia hosts one of the largest concentrations of Indian blue-collar workers in the Gulf, particularly in construction, domestic work, caregiving and other labour-intensive sectors.This is closely linked to the Kingdom’s aggressive build-out under Vision 2030, with mega-projects such as NEOM, Qiddiya, the Red Sea Project and Diriyah Gate driving sustained demand for foreign labour across infrastructure, housing and services.MEA data shows that Indian blue-collar workers are present across 14 countries, accounting for about 1.6 million people between January 2020 and June 2025, with the Gulf as the core destination. Among these, Saudi Arabia has the highest number of Indian workers, estimated at 695,269, followed by the UAE (341,365), Kuwait (201,959), Qatar (153,501) and Oman (116,840).Employers and officials say recruitment accelerated sharply after the pandemic, particularly in 2022 and 2023, when labour demand rebounded alongside stalled projects restarting. In 2023 alone, 398,000 workers were sent abroad, with Saudi Arabia employing 200,713 labourers that year and a further 167,598 in 2024. The scale of this intake, experts note, also increases exposure to regulatory enforcement, especially as the Kingdom tightens compliance checks around visas, permits and residency status.That pace continued into 2025. Between January and June, Saudi Arabia recruited 71,175 Indian workers, while the UAE hired 96,401, the highest among Gulf states in that period. Experts note that at such volumes, even limited instances of visa or permit non-compliance can translate into large absolute numbers of deportations once enforcement tightens.As recruitment volumes expanded across the Gulf, enforcement followed. Authorities across the region tightened scrutiny of migrant workers, with overstays, visa violations and work-permit issues emerging as the primary triggers for deportation. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain together accounted for thousands of removals as monitoring increased in step with large-scale labour intake and more systematic compliance checks.Bheema Reddy, vice-chairman of Telangana’s NRI advisory committee, said the scale of migration itself often increases exposure to enforcement action. Speaking to TOI, he said: “Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia attract a huge influx of Indian workers, many of whom are low-skilled and come through agents. In the pursuit of better earnings, minor violations of local laws can quickly escalate into deportation cases. ”After Saudi Arabia, the UAE recorded the second-highest number of Indian deportations in the GCC in 2025, with 1,469 nationals sent home, followed by 764 from Bahrain. As in Saudi Arabia, common causes included overstaying visas, working without valid permits, absconding from employers, or breaching labour regulations.Officials say enforcement has become increasingly systematic, with closer monitoring of visa timelines, employer records and residency compliance. “Indian workers must track their visa timelines carefully and understand local laws,” Naga Bharani of the Telangana Overseas Manpower Company told TOI, adding that “simple awareness and timely extensions can prevent deportation.”A recurring theme across GCC deportations is the role of recruitment agents in India. Misrepresentation of job roles, salaries or visa categories often leaves workers exposed abroad, sometimes without a clear understanding of host-country labour laws.Reddy told TOI that misleading recruitment practices remain a recurring problem. “Many cases arise from workers being lured by promises of better pay or conditions, only to face legal consequences when regulations are breached,” he said, adding that “education before departure is crucial.”The Government of India has repeatedly stressed that only legal migration routes should be used. Overseas recruitment is regulated under the Emigration Act, 1983, and since 2015, emigration to Emigration Check Required (ECR) countries has been processed through the eMigrate portal, a digital system for registering recruitment agencies and issuing emigration clearance.The MEA has also rolled out schemes such as the Pravasi Bharatiya Bima Yojana (PBBY), Pre-Departure Orientation and Training (PDOT), and the ‘Surakshit Jayen, Prashikshit Jayen’ campaign to improve awareness and reduce vulnerability among migrant workers. India has additionally signed Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreements with six countries, including the UK, France and Germany, and Labour Mobility Agreements with 12 countries, including several GCC states.Despite these recent measures, the latest figures underline the persistent scale of the challenge. With Saudi Arabia continuing to dominate both Indian labour inflows and deportations overall, experts say stricter robust compliance, better recruitment oversight and stronger pre-departure awareness will be critical to safely reversing the trend.","Saudi Arabia deported about 11,000 Indian workers in one year, mostly low- skilled labourers employed in construction, domestic work, and caregiving.
