Runway relief? Man in kurta-pajama squats to pee next to aircraft; pilot‚Äôs viral video divides internet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/runway-relief-man-in-kurta-pajama-squats-to-pee-next-to-aircraft-pilots-viral-video-divides-internet/articleshow/123689329.cms,".

A strange event involving an old man urinating close to an airplane on the runway at Bihar's Darbhanga Airport has gone viral. The concerning incident occurred when a man in traditional white kurta-pajama attire was spotted squatting dangerously close to an aircraft on an active runway. The event was captured on video by the pilot from the cockpit, showing the individual positioned in a grassy area just meters away from the aircraft.The individual's positioning in the grassy area adjacent to the runway suggests a breach of multiple layers of airport security measures. Such areas are typically restricted and monitored to prevent unauthorized access due to the critical nature of aircraft operations. Airport authorities maintain multiple security layers, including perimeter fencing, surveillance systems, and security patrols, to prevent such unauthorized access. This incident may prompt a review of these security measures. However, the 9-second video has been viewed more than 285,000 times, with social media users responding in a combination of laughter and worry.These are some wacky reactions:One of the users said, ""Accha hai na itna samanya darje k log b plane me travel kar rahe hain.""Which roughly translates to,""Its good that even common people are traveling by plane.""Another user said, ""Accurate way to urinate.""In the backdrop, other passengers are lined up to board the aircraft while a voice that is perceived to be the pilot laughs.Another said, ‚ÄúMera desh badal raha hai aage badh raha haiüòÇüòÇ. Biharis never fail to surprise us.‚ÄùSome went on to school the man and the pilot.A user commented, ‚ÄúAirport terminals have sufficient toilets, but still these idiots would do it in the open. Disgusting civic sense of some Indians, they would never learn.‚Äù‚ÄúPilots making fun of old person. Old people have problems controlling the bladder. Shameful‚Äù, said another.The proximity of the individual to active aircraft operations created a hazardous situation that could have impacted flight safety. Aircraft movements require clear and unobstructed runway areas to ensure safe takeoffs and landings.The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is yet to release an official response to the incident. It is as yet unknown whether the man was a passenger or a staffer, or from which airline's cockpit the clip was shot.",A man in traditional white kurta-pajama was spotted squatting dangerously close to an aircraft on an active runway.

Sullivan on Trump‚Äôs India-Pakistan remarks



Trump & Pakistan business







NEW DELHI: Former US National Security Advisor (NSA) and attorney Jake Sullivan has accused President Donald Trump of sacrificing Washington‚Äôs ties with India to further his family‚Äôs business interests in Pakistan In an interview with MeidasTouch YouTube channel, Sullivan described the development as ‚Äúa huge strategic harm‚Äù to the United States itself.He was asked about America‚Äôs trade row with India and Trump‚Äôs repeated claims about resolving the India-Pakistan conflict, which resurfaced after the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir.‚ÄúI think this is one of the more under-reported stories in Trump's foreign policy, and I'm really glad that you raised it,‚Äù Sullivan said in response to the host‚Äôs question, which also mentioned the Trump family‚Äôs Bitcoin business with Pakistan and Tim Cook‚Äôs Apple factories in India.The former NSA stressed that the US has for decades worked on a bipartisan basis to strengthen ties with India, ‚Äúthe world's largest democracy,‚Äù and a country it should be ‚Äúaligned with on technology, talent, economics, and so many other issues, and aligned with in dealing with the strategic threat from China.‚ÄùSullivan noted that Washington had made significant progress in developing these ties. ‚ÄúAnd now, in no small part, I think because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family, he has thrown the India relationship over the side.That is a huge strategic harm in its own right because a strong US-India relationship serves our interests,‚Äù he added.He warned that such moves would worry US allies worldwide. ‚ÄúBut imagine every other country in the world, your Germany, your Japan, your Canada. You look at that and you say that could be us tomorrow. And that only reinforces your view that you got to hedge against the United States,‚Äù Sullivan said.According to him, America‚Äôs credibility was at stake. ‚ÄúAnd having all of our friends and countries around the world decide they just can't rely on the US in any way, shape or form. That is not in the interest of the American people long term. Our word should be our bond. We should be good for what we say. Our friends should be able to rely on us. And that has always been our strength. And what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts. But it also has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world.‚ÄùDuring the conversation, Sullivan was reminded of Trump‚Äôs earlier claims about being ‚Äúbest friends with Modi‚Äù and promising that the first deal he would sign would be with India. The host said Trump then began ‚Äútaking credit for resolving the India Pakistan war which is a very big sensitive topic for India saying you did not do that stop taking he does that every day and that like you know hurts their hurts everything there and it like crushes them that's not they go that's not true. ‚ÄùThe host further alleged, ‚ÄúDonald Trump took like his family took Bitcoin from the Pakistani Bitcoin sovereign fund and they brought in the general from the Pakistan to be there and India's like what the hell are you. And then meanwhile, you still have Apple building new factories because Tim Cook came in with the gold bar and he's building the factories in India. What do you make of what's happening there?‚ÄùSullivan reiterated, ‚ÄúI think this is one of the more under reported stories in Trump's foreign policy and I'm really glad that you raised it on a bipartisan basis going back decades.

I'll have to come back at some point in the future and, you know, hit the next 10 topics that we didn't get to today.‚Äù The host thanked him, saying, ‚ÄúJake Sullivan, former national security adviser. Thank you as always.‚ÄùThe controversy comes amid Trump‚Äôs increasing business engagements with Pakistan. In April, the World Liberty (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by Trump, signed agreements with the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to promote investment and blockchain innovation.

Semiconductor Factories Rising in India, First Chip Ready by End of Year: PM Modi





India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world‚Äôs chip design engineers, placing it as a key player in the global semiconductor design ecosystem, according to a report by Bastion Research.According to news agency ANI, the report underlined India‚Äôs strong position in the global semiconductor chain, noting, ‚ÄúIndia is already an important piece in the global semiconductor design. You may be surprised to know that approximately 20 per cent of the world's chip design engineers are based here.‚ÄùGlobal technology leaders, including Qualcomm, Intel, Nvidia, Broadcom, and MediaTek have set up large R&D and design centres across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Noida. This strong presence has enabled India to emerge as one of the world‚Äôs leading hubs for chip design, as per ANI.Explaining the division of work worldwide, the report said engineers in the United States define the high-level chip architecture, such as deciding the type of chip, its end use, features, and launch strategy.Indian engineering teams, by contrast, take on the critical execution work ‚Äî translating architecture into logic, simulating and testing chips, optimising performance, writing drivers and firmware, and fine-tuning electronic design automation tools.The report stressed this was not a ‚Äúboss versus worker‚Äù setup but rather complementary roles between US and Indian teams.The Bastion Research findings also noted India‚Äôs policy push to strengthen its semiconductor ecosystem. The government launched the Semicon India Programme in 2021 with incentives worth around Rs 76,000 crore to attract global manufacturers.India‚Äôs semiconductor consumption is projected to rise sharply. ‚ÄúWe consume about $24 billion worth semiconductors and it is expected to rise to upwards of $100-120 billion by 2030. When India starts to produce those chips, our share will definitely rise,‚Äù Sandeep Kumar, CEO of L&T Semiconductor Technologies and chairman of the Semiconductor Product Leadership Forum, was quoted as saying by ANI.The Forum, launched by the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), aims to build an ecosystem for product design, IP creation, and high-value innovation. It is targeting the launch of around 100 new companies by 2035, expected to absorb nearly five lakh workers, including a large number of engineers.Meanwhile, India recently rolled out its first domestically produced chip at CG Semi‚Äôs Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) facility in Sanand, Gujarat. Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who inaugurated the facility last week, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will ‚Äúsoon‚Äù dedicate the country‚Äôs first chip produced there.The government has so far approved 10 semiconductor manufacturing projects worth over Rs 1.60 lakh crore across six states. Work is also underway on Semicon 2.0, the next phase of India‚Äôs semiconductor mission.","India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world‚Äôs chip design engineers.

Trump‚Äôs New Message To India As Modi Hails ‚ÄòPrivileged‚Äô Ties With Putin; ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Getting Late‚Äô

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday strongly criticised US counterpart Donald Trump for using tariffs as a bargaining tool with China and India in the current geopolitical landscape.Putin said both Beijing and New Delhi have their ""own domestic political mechanism and laws"" and noted that the two nations have endured difficult periods in their history, marked by colonialism and repeated attacks on sovereignty.""When somebody [Donald Trump] tells you that they are going to punish you...you have to think about the leadership of those big countries,"" Putin said.""You have countries like India with 1.5 billion people, and China, both with powerful economies. They also have their own domestic political mechanism and laws. When somebody tells you that they are going to punish you...you have to think about the leadership of those big countries, which had a difficult period of their history too...that had to deal with colonialism, attacks on their sovereignty during prolonged periods of time,"" the Russian President said at a press briefing.He futher said: ""You have to understand that if one of them shows weakness, his political career will be over, which influences his behaviour"".Putin, however, expressed hope that everything will ultimately be sorted out for the normal political dialogue to begin.""Just as the colonial era is over, they have to realise that they [the US] cannot use this term when speaking with partners. But ultimately, things will be sorted out, and we will have normal political dialogue again,"" he said.Last week, on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in China's Tianjin, leaders from India, China, and Russia projected an image of warmth and strategic convergence that rattled Washington.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Russia a ""special and privileged partner"".Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs two most populous countries need to be friends.‚Äù And Russian President Vladimir Putin clasped PM Modi‚Äôs hand, addressed him as ‚Äúdear friend,‚Äù and whisked him away in his armoured Aurus limousine.The optics told a story of deepening chemistry: Xi and PM Modi smiling together after years of tension, PM Modi leaning into Moscow even as Trump slapped tariffs on Indian goods, and Putin positioning himself as the indispensable broker of this triangular courtship.The move was subtle but seismic. While Trump met Putin in Alaska on August 15 to persuade him to drift from China's orbit, Beijing welcomed PM Modi just two weeks later. On August 30, Modi was in Beijing. The next day, he stood smiling next to Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the SCO summit in Tianjin - a public relations coup for Beijing and Moscow.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a pointed remark seen as a veiled dig at Trump, said: ""India had achieved a 7.8 per cent GDP growth despite ""challenges created by economic selfishness"".Earlier, in support of India, Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong wrote: ""Give the bully an inch, he will take a mile"".Feihong said this a day after Trump slapped an additional 25 per cent tariff on India for its trade with Russia.The remark was seen by some as expressing solidarity with countries like India and Brazil, at the receiving end of Trump's trade war.Xu's post also tagged Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi's remarks, after his talks with the Brazilian president's chief advisor Celso Amorim, that using tariffs as a weapon to suppress other countries violates the UN Charter, undermines WTO rules and is both unpopular and unsustainable.","Vladimir Putin criticises US counterpart Donald Trump for using tariffs as a bargaining tool with China and India. Putin said both Beijing and New Delhi have their ""own domestic political mechanism and laws"" He noted that the two nations have endured difficult periods in their history, marked by colonialism and repeated attacks on sovereignty.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123681645,imgsize-23006,width-400,resizemode-4/putin.jpg"

Jaishankar Urges Stronger India-EU Ties As Trump‚Äôs Tariffs Shake Global Strategic Landscape

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday said predictability has a huge premium in global politics, a remark made as India looks to readjust its relations with China while manoeuvring through US tariffs.The foreign minister also said the world is witnessing sweeping changes in the global strategic landscape. ""Changes we see in the world today do influence our policy and do influence the manner we approach other countries,"" he said.Speaking at a press briefing with German counterpart Johann Wadephul, Jaishankar further said: ""We are seeing sweeping changes in the global strategic landscape. We are also seeing volatility on the global economic landscape, and together they make a very powerful case for India and the European Union (EU) and Germany to work more closely with each other.""Jaishankar's remark could also be implied as a jibe at US President Donald Trump, who recently described India's economy as ""dead"" and has upended the global economy with his numerous contradictory tariff diktats.Wadephul said the only demand the Western nations have with regard to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is that ""weapons fall silent"". He said that Russia has ""not been willing"" to sit down at the negotiating table despite ""enormous efforts"" by Trump.""We have right from the outset been pursuing a policy that has the objective of Russia and Ukraine following the path of negotiations. However, what we have noticed of late is that despite the enormous efforts that the American president has invested, Russia has not been willing to sit down at the negotiating table, whereas the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has expressed his immediate readiness to negotiate and sit down at the negotiation table,"" the German foreign minister said.He further said that Ukraine has been attacked ""without having done anything"" to trigger the Russian attack, while choosing to skip Moscow's apprehension of Kyiv joining the US-led Nato alliance, which is argued as a key reason Russian President Putin decided to invade Ukraine.""In a way, it has taken a first step. We're talking about a country that has been attacked without having done anything to trigger that attack. The only demand is that weapons fall silent. No more than that... The German approach and the European approach are that we want to do whatever we can to make President Putin sit down at the negotiating table,"" Wadephul said.On Friday, Jaishankar said India should not be ""unfairly targeted"" in the context of the Ukraine war, as New Delhi continues to face pressure over its oil trade with Russia.""Had a telecon today with Finnish Foreign Minister,"" Jaishankar posted on X. ""Our discussions centered around the Ukraine conflict and its ramifications. India should not be unfairly targeted in that context. We have always advocated dialogue and diplomacy.""The remarks come as India is facing 50 per cent tariffs from the United States for purchasing Russian oil. The US administration has accused New Delhi of ""funding the war"" by continuing trade with Moscow.India has strongly criticised Washington‚Äôs decision, calling the tariffs ""unjustified and unreasonable"". The Trump administration recently raised duties on Indian goods to over 50 per cent as a penalty for India‚Äôs oil imports from Russia.Last week in Moscow, Jaishankar defended India‚Äôs position during a joint press briefing with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. He questioned the rationale behind Washington‚Äôs move.","Jaishankar's remark could also be implied as a jibe at US President Donald Trump, who recently described India's economy as ""dead"" The remarks come as India is facing 50 per cent tariffs from the United States for purchasing Russian oil.

NEW DELHI: At an age when many women are busy caring for their grandchildren, a 55-year-old from Rajasthan‚Äôs Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.The birth at the Community Health Centre in Jhadol block has turned Lilavas village into a talking point. Relatives, neighbours and villagers crowded the hospital to see Rekha, amused at the unusual sight of grandchildren greeting their new baby aunt, PTI reported.Rekha, married to scrap dealer Kavara Ram Kalbelia, has given birth 17 times over the years. Five of those children ‚Äì four sons and one daughter ‚Äì died soon after birth, leaving the couple with 12 surviving kids: seven boys and five girls.Their household spans three generations under one roof. ""Two of my sons and three of my daughters are married. Each of them has two or three children,"" Kavara said, his voice carrying both pride and weariness.This means while Rekha tends to her newborn, she is simultaneously grandmother to several toddlers.Behind the curiosity, however, lies hardship. Kavara makes a meagre living by selling scrap and admits to taking high-interest loans to pay for his children‚Äôs weddings. ‚ÄúNo member of the family has ever gone to school,‚Äù he said, highlighting how poverty continues to dominate their lives.Doctors at the Jhadol centre described the delivery as a challenge. Rekha initially told them it was only her fourth pregnancy. Block CMHO Dr Dharmendra noted that the case reflects the difficulties in tribal-dominated areas, where lack of education and awareness often fuel such situations.‚ÄúThis is a nomadic family that keeps moving. Eleven surviving children were found with them. We will work to link them with government schemes and provide support,‚Äù he said.Gynaecologist Dr. Roshan Darangi, who handled the delivery, confirmed the truth later: ‚ÄúIt turned out to be her 17th childbirth. Now, we will counsel her for sterilisation.‚ÄùAnother doctor, Mukesh Garasiya, added that Rekha had been admitted on August 24 without sonography or pre-delivery tests. ‚ÄúShe could have died from excessive bleeding. With so many deliveries, the uterus weakens and the risk of haemorrhage rises. Thankfully, this time, everything went smoothly,‚Äù he explained.","Rekha Ram Kalbelia, 55, from Rajasthan's Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.

Centre to build dozens of Ring Roads across cities to decongest urban highways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-to-build-dozens-of-ring-roads-across-cities-to-decongest-urban-highways/articleshow/123682779.cms,"Centre to build dozens of Ring Roads across cities to decongest urban highways

NEW DELHI: It‚Äôs not just metros like Delhi and Bengaluru where vehicle speeds drop sharply as highways enter city limits. Govt data shared with states on Wednesday show that even in smaller cities such as Madurai in Tamil Nadu, the average speed on NHs can fall to just 27 kmph inside the city due to traffic congestion, compared to 55 kmph on highway stretches outside it.Aiming to remedy this growing problem of urban congestion, the Centre will take up development of around 34 new access-controlled Ring Roads, in addition to such 36 ongoing projects across cities. On Wednesday, road transport and highways ministry shared the roadmap with states while seeking support for fast-tracking the development of Ring Roads with a design speed of 100-120 kmph.Targeting to decongest NHs in urban areas, the road transport and highway ministry has identified agglomeration and cities with more than five lakh population for construction of the greenfield Ring Roads. These include Kolkata and Amaravati agglomerations, Nashik, Thiruvananthapuram, Ajmer, Warangal, Mangaluru, Udaipur and Tirunelveli. The details were shared with state PWD and urban development secretaries at a meeting chaired by road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.To ensure that new Ring Roads don‚Äôt end up becoming new choke points, 15 metres on either side of these stretches will be notified as Development Control Zone (DCZ) where no construction will be allowed, except for public utilities and green zone.States will allow regulated development in 2 km beyond the DCZ.For financing these capital intensive project, the states will have five different options to provide financial support, including upfront payment of 50% of cost and getting 50% of toll revenue for 15 years; payment of 50% of the land acquisition cost; and providing land pooled through land pooling scheme. Since states are the biggest beneficiary of such projects, they need to provide some share of the project cost, an official said.The ministry has also shared the details of 15 legacy municipal dump sites close to upcoming NH projects across states, which can provide inert waste for construction embankment of such roads. ‚ÄúSome of the high speed corridors and urban decongestion road projects have been mapped that are within 50 km of the top 15 landfill sites. Around 277 lakh tonne of inert waste from these dump sites can potentially be utilised (for highway construction),‚Äù said an official.In the closed door meeting, Gadkari said NH projects can significantly address the issue of legacy solid waste issues faced by cities. ‚ÄúSuccessful pilot projects, including UER-II in Delhi and Ahmedabad‚ÄìDholera Expressway, have demonstrated the technical feasibility and economic benefits of the initiative,‚Äù his office said.","The average speed on NHs can fall to just 27 kmph inside the city due to traffic congestion, compared to 55 kmph on highway stretches outside it.

He also said EU doesn‚Äôt want Russia to use ‚Äúdetours‚Äù for its oil. The US accuses India of profiteering from its export of refined Russian oil to Europe and other places. In Europe,countries like Germany and France are pushing for secondary sanctions that would target entities in third countries they see as backing Russia‚Äôs war.Jaishankar said in a joint press conference the world‚Äôs facing the twin challenges of economic volatility and political uncertainty India believes that a multi-polar world with strategic autonomy can best respond through more intensive cooperation among key member states.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no question that the changes we see in the world today do influence our policies and do influence the manner in which we approach other countries. And I think together they make a very powerful case for India and the EU and India and Germany to work much more closely with each other,‚Äù he said. Backing Germany‚Äôs desire to double its Euro 50 billion trade with India, Jaishankar said India would pay special attention to any concerns German companiesmight have about operating in India.There was also discussion on the Indo-Pacific as Wadephulstressed India and Germany are united by the objective to preserve the rules-based international order and China‚Äôs aggressive behavior in the Indo-Pacific was a cause for concern for both our countries. ‚ÄúMore generally, we aim to further expand our cooperation in the areas of defense, security and armaments,‚Äù he said, adding Germany agrees with India and others that there‚Äôs a need to defend the rules-based order from China.Jaishankar also thanked Wadephul for the understanding shown by Germany on India‚Äôs fight against terrorism. ‚ÄúMinister Wadephul has himself been explicit about our right to defend our people against terrorist attacks. Our Parliamentary delegation that visited Germany in June after Operation Sindoor was also warmly received,‚Äù he said.Jaishankar said he raised the issue of Ariha Shah, an Indian child who has been in foster care of German authorities for years, saying it is essential that her cultural rights are ensuredand she grows up in Indian surroundings. ‚ÄúSo. this matter needs to be resolved without further delay, and I think we have had some discussions today on that subject,‚Äù he said.",The leaders discussed the Ukraine conflict as Wadephul urged India to convince Russia to join peace efforts.

School bells stop ringing in flood-hit North India as water cuts off access,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/school-bells-stop-ringing-in-flood-hit-north-india-as-water-cuts-off-access/articleshow/123684989.cms,"Suresh Rawat (15) still wakes at 6 am - he has never needed an alarm. Not because school is in session or a bell might echo through the hills, but because his routine - wake, wash, dress - is a habit rooted in pre-monsoon normalcy. Comb hair, button shirt, pack school bag. But he has nowhere to go. No teacher has checked its contents in over 60 days, after a bridge connecting his village in Uttarakhand to the local school was washed away in June.Across flood-hit north India - Punjab, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Jammu, parts of UP and now Haryana - students have been missing school and college because waters won't allow them, teachers can't reach and buildings won't stand.""The path to my school, 7 km from Kupda village in Uttarkashi, lay across that bridge,"" Suresh said. ""On June 28, the Yamunotri highway link disappeared. Now I'll have to study a lot on my own to make up for lost classes."" He despairs at the gap in front of him, with no sign of repair or even a temporary bridge - only the weight of an academic calendar slipping away.Punjab ordered schools shut in late August until September 7 - a 12-day stretch overlapping with peak harvest, compounding family losses.Himachal staggered its orders through July and August, as repeated landslides cut off access to schools and staff housing.In Jammu, schools were shut on Sept 1 and 2 after heavy rain warnings and flood risks. The order expanded the next day to Kashmir, where flood alerts followed the Chenab and Jhelum crossing danger marks. The Srinagar-Jammu highway stayed closed for days, severing supply routes and classroom routines alike.The storm has erased not just structures - Himachal alone reported damage to 500 schools - but the scaffolding of education. In Mandi, where 300 schools were affected, functioning buildings became shelters. Teachers vanished from WhatsApp groups, not by choice but because they were stranded. Unit tests were pushed into vagueness, then abandoned. Online lessons were announced for Sept 1, but for most, the only thing that arrived was another rain alert.Sunil Negi, who teaches in Kullu, tried to hold a class. ""The power went within minutes. Then signal dropped. We stopped trying,"" he said. Leena Kapoor in Mandi was more blunt: ""We've taught nothing new. Half the staff haven't returned. The school was a ration camp for two weeks.""In places where classrooms hadn't collapsed, access became the barrier. Rakesh Kumar, a govt teacher, described walking 5 km along a landslide-prone path just to reach his students. ""The road was blocked, but we tried anyway. It's the kind of risk no one wants to take, but we do it because otherwise, the children lose everything.""The more remote the school, the worse the loss. In Bharmour, paths once curving through hills have been wiped out. ""We used to carry the younger children on our shoulders,"" said Vikram Rana, a village elder. ""Now even the elders can't reach them."" Students relocated from landslide-prone areas are now simply unreachable.Makeshift arrangements haven't always worked. A sudden lake formation behind the school in Syanachatti, Uttarakhand, forced 56 students out; 25 were sent to Bajri Primary, others to rented rooms. But 18 children were never relocated. ""They've disappeared into a crevice in the system,"" a local education officer said. ""And that widens every day.""No meaningful plan has followed. There's been no revision of the exam calendar, no guidance on syllabus cuts, and no plan for remediation. Authorities have floated ideas - weekend sessions, compressed holidays - but without any infra, internet or staff, those promises ring hollow.The east hasn't been spared. In Assam's Majuli island, floodwaters returned for third time this season. Rashmi Das, 16, had just resumed classes when her school was converted into a shelter again. ""They said we'd reopen soon. Then the water came back.""And beyond ridgelines of Ladakh, where Aug brought rainfall 930% above normal, teacher Jigmet Tundup continued to show up to a classroom half-submerged each morning. ""We sweep water out,"" he said. ""Then we begin. Sometimes with the alphabet.""(With inputs from Rohit Mullick in Kullu, Ashish Mishra in Uttarkashi, Yogesh Nagarkoti in Bageshwar, and Tanmayee Tyagi in Dehradun)","Across flood-hit north India, students have been missing school and college because waters won't allow them, teachers can't reach and buildings won't stand.

LONDON: A blogger from Navi Mumbai on a solo round-the-world tour has slammed British police for failing to stop crimes after his motorbike, loaded with his passport and belongings, was stolen from a park in Nottingham.Yogesh Alekari (33) was 24,000km and four months into his world motorbike tour. He had by then motorbiked to 17 countries, having set off from India at the start of May.""In this journey my bike was everything, my dream, my soul, my passion, it was my home and now my home has been stolen,"" he said.""It was a fully loaded bike. I have lost everything. I have just my riding jacket, riding shoes and helmet. I am on a tourist visa and there is no safety or security in this country for tourists. If this incident had happened with any foreigner in India, the entire police force and Indian govt would have left no stone unturned to investigate the matter and catch the thieves. I am going through the worst time of my life,"" Alekari said.Sgt Daniel Sheasby of Nottinghamshire police said: ""Our policing teams have been conducting local inquiries since last Thursday but have unfortunately not yet been able to locate the bike.We completely appreciate how much upset this will have caused to the bike owner but want to assure him the police are taking this seriously.""On Aug 28, Alekari had parked his KTM 390 Adventure motorcycle in a secure paid-for parking area in Wollaton Park, Nottingham, whilst he went for breakfast at 11am. After 20 minutes when he returned, the bike was gone. His laptop, camera, money, passport, credit cards, were also taken.Alekari said when he called the police from the park to report the crime, they did not come out and just sent him a crime number.A group of girls videoed the theft on their mobiles. ""The video clearly shows that the thieves broke the lock with a hammer, installed a fake number plate and made off.

The extensive 56th GST Council meeting, spanning 10.5 hours, provided a platform for the Centre and states to deliberate and discuss crucial tax proposals.The GST Council endorsed a transition from the existing four-tier GST framework (5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent) to a simplified two-rate structure of 5 and 18 per cent.Additionally, certain items like high-end vehicles, tobacco and cigarettes will attract a special 40 per cent rate.The revised rates will come into effect from September 22, coinciding with Navratri, except for gutkha, tobacco and tobacco products and cigarettes.Essential food items will remain tax-free, whilst various everyday food products and beverages will likely see reduced rates from 18 per cent to 5 per cent. This includes butter, ghee, dry nuts, condensed milk, sausages, meat, sugar boiled confectionery, jam, fruit jellies, tender coconut water, namkeen, 20-litre packaged drinking water, fruit pulp, juice, milk-based beverages, ice cream, pastry, biscuits, corn flakes, cereals and sugar confectionery.The tax rate for all varieties of chapati and paratha will be reduced from the current 5 per cent to nil.The modifications to the GST structure are crucial for boosting domestic consumption and helping businesses counter the impact of the United States' 50% import duty on Indian products.Also read | GST reforms: 0% GST on individual health and life insurance; reduced from 18% PM Narendra Modi in his Independence Day address had announced the upcoming GST reforms and rate cuts, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman led these deliberations.The rationalisation of rates would entail a financial impact of Rs 48,000 crore, which would be ""fiscally sustainable for Centre and state"", as confirmed by Revenue Secretary Arvind Shrivastava during a press briefing.He emphasised that revenue implications are variable figures that fluctuate based on consumption patterns.

In what the government on Wednesday called a Diwali gift, the GST Council has approved sweeping rate cuts across key sectors. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that daily-use items like hair oil, shampoo, toothpaste, soap, toothbrushes, and shaving cream will now attract just 5% GST, down from 18%. GST on individual health and life insurance has been scrapped entirely. Farmers benefit too, with tractor tyres, parts, and tractors now taxed at only 5%.The changes in GST rates on services and goods other than cigarettes, chewing tobacco products, unmanufactured tobacco and beedi will be effective from Sept 22.E-way bills currently in transit will continue to remain valid as per their original validity period.Principle behind the recent rate rationalisation is to keep similar goods at the same rate to avoid issues of misclassification and disputes.Bread was already exempt while pizza bread, roti, porotta, paratha attracted different rates. All Indian breads have been exempted even though only a few goods have been mentioned as examples.These goods attracted compensation cess in addition to GST. Since it has been decided to end compensation cess levy, the tax has been increased to maintain pre rate rationalisation level of tax.Prior to rate rationalisation, paneer sold in other than pre-packaged and labelled form already attracted nil rate. The changes have been made only for paneer supplied in pre-packaged and labelled form. Paneer is an Indian cottage cheese. This is mostly produced in the small scale sector. The measure is intended to promote Indian cottage cheese.Admission to other sporting events, including recognised sporting events, where the ticket price is not more than Rs 500 continues to be exempt, and if the ticket price is more than Rs 500, it continues to be taxed at the standard rate of 18%.

Los Angeles Clippers‚Äô salary cap controversy involving Kawhi Leonard mirrors Joe Smith's Minnesota Timberwolves scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/los-angeles-clippers-salary-cap-controversy-involving-kawhi-leonard-mirrors-joe-smiths-minnesota-timberwolves-scandal/articleshow/123684337.cms,"Kawhi Leonard is currently in hot water (Image via Getty Images)

Alleged secret payments to Kawhi Leonard put Los Angeles Clippers under scrutiny

Exploring the Joe Smith scandal and its impact on the Minnesota Timberwolves

If the recent accusations against the Los Angeles Clippers are accurate, then they are going to be in a lot of trouble. According to the shocking information released on Wednesday by investigative journalist Pablo Torre, the franchise has allegedly been participating in a shell corporation plan that has been paying their star player, Kawhi Leonard, under the table and below the salary cap for years. They got him to sign a $28 million endorsement contract for a ""no-show job"" with a fake tree-planting business that team owner Steve Ballmer was allegedly funding. Now, this incident brings back memories from the Minnesota Timberwolves‚Äô Joe Smith trade.It all started with Aspiration Partners, a technology and sustainable growth firm that arranged carbon emission credits for major corporations such as Microsoft and Meta. Aspiration was compelled to divulge its outstanding debt in their bankruptcy filings, including a $7 million payment to ""KL2 Aspire LLC,"" a company whose manager is identified as Kawhi Leonard At this point, Torre started looking into the payments and posing inquiries about the business. He got documents of the agreement between Aspiration Partners and Kawhi Leonard. The documents specified that Aspiration allegedly paid Leonard a total of $28 million, planned in four annual payments of $7 million.To persuade Kawhi Leonard to come to Los Angeles, they exchanged most of their draft capital. It is not until 2030 that the team fully owns their first-round pick. Additionally, the LA superstar was getting $28 million from a business that Clippers owner Steve Ballmer supported for doing nothing. It seems like a way to increase Kawhi's compensation without having to deal with NBA salary cap restrictions.After this mess is cleaned up, the Clippers will probably suffer a similar fate to the Minnesota Timberwolves, as they have had similar luck. If the Clippers are found guilty of what Torre alleges, the league will probably punish them harshly, just as it did Minnesota.In 1999-00, Joe Smith played for the Minnesota Timberwolves . In order to have wage cap flexibility, the organization paid him underhandedly for the three veteran minimum deals he signed, each worth less than $3 million.After everything came to light, the Wolves received a severe penalty from the NBA. The Wolves were forced to pay a $3.5 million fine, forfeit five first-round draft picks for the following five years, and have their owner and general manager suspended. This was for signing Smith to three short-term contracts before agreeing to give him a huge payout after securing his Bird Rights.In an attempt to build around Kevin Garnett , Minnesota violated the regulations. With KG in the forefront, the Wolves never lived up to their full potential. They were ousted in the first round seven times, but they made the playoffs eight times in a row. Prior to Anthony Edwards' arrival, Minnesota qualified only once in 17 seasons and missed the playoffs for 13 consecutive years beginning in 2005.Also read: ""I was super excited""- Terance Mann embraces new chapter with Brooklyn Nets after Los Angeles Clippers stints","Alleged secret payments to Kawhi Leonard put Los Angeles Clippers under scrutiny.

HYDERABAD: Amid stricter visa enforcement and shrinking work opportunities, Indian students in the US are struggling to make ends meet. Official records show that more than 4,700 student visas were revoked in recent months for irregular attendance or unauthorised employment. Workplace inspections in several states have forced students to abandon part-time jobs that once covered rent and daily expenses.Students told TOI they have either cut back drastically on spending or turned to family for help.""Earlier, I managed to balance studies and a job at a restaurant. I worked at least eight hours a day. But after the checks began, my employer let go of all student workers. I found another restaurant job, but they allow us to work for not more than three hours a day. My earnings don't even cover groceries,"" said a 25-year-old student in Los Angeles pursuing a master's in cyber security.The financial crunch has forced many to share cramped housing. ""I used to earn about $1,200 a month, enough to manage my living costs. Now I make less than a quarter of that. There are six of us in a two-bedroom apartment. It's the only way to keep expenses down,"" said a 27-year-old computer science student from Atlanta.With tuition and living costs rising, he added, ""I've stopped eating out, cancelled subscriptions and cut everything possible. Every dollar counts.""Beyond survival, future prospects are also fading. The Optional Practical Training (OPT) programme, once a reliable pathway to gain US job experience, now offers fewer opportunities. The tightening of norms is also reflected in official numbers. Active student enrolments from India fell by 28% year-on-year until March 2025, underlining how hostile the environment has become.""I came here thinking this was an investment in my future. Instead of focusing on learning, I'm constantly worried about rent and rules. If things don't improve, going back to India might be my only option,"" said a 25-year-old from Atlanta who recently completed a master's in IT but is struggling to find work.City-based consultants say they are keeping prospective applicants informed. ""This intake was the worst in decades. Students in the US are already struggling, and those planning to move there are in no better shape. We are making sure they know the ground reality. The next couple of years are going to be tough,"" said Chirandeep Patnaik of Lemma One Consulting.","Official records show that more than 4,700 student visas were revoked in recent months.

NEW DELHI: As heavy discharge from Hathnikund barrage continued to push water levels up, Yamuna crossed the 207-metre mark in Delhi at 1pm Wednesday.By 10pm, it had swelled to 207.43m - the third highest level reached since systematic record-keeping began in 1963 - inundating numerous villages and areas such as Ring Road, parts of Civil Lines, Bela Road, and Sonia Vihar, among others, and displacing around 12,000 people.Central Water Commission expects Yamuna to rise further and touch 207.48m by 8am Thursday, very close to the mark of the historic Delhi floods of Sept 1978.Read also: Delhi-NCR Rains Live Updates Flood waters reached Ring Road and Outer Ring Road, impacting traffic between Majnu ka Tilla and Salimgarh bypass. MCD stopped cremations at Nigambodh Ghat and the Geeta Colony ground due to flooding.River water also entered Vishwakarma Colony in Jaitpur and Civil Lines' Monastery market, while a simultaneous rescue operation continued at southwest Delhi's Geetanjali Enclave in Jharoda Kalan. A breach in Mungeshpur drain, a subsidiary of Najafgarh drain, flooded the area with neck-deep water late Tuesday night.District magistrate East Amol Srivastava, the nodal officer for the flood situation, said NDRF teams were deployed based on requests made by the southeast, central, and east Delhi districts. ‚ÄúBetween 10,000 to 12,000 people have been rescued so far, with the number of people in tents fluctuating as some leave to stay with their relatives.Relief camps have been set up at 38 locations. While over 2,000 people are in permanent shelters, the remaining are in tents,‚Äù said the official.On Wednesday, Hathnikund barrage in Haryana released about 1.6 lakh cusecs of water at 3 pm, up from 1.1 lakh cusecs late Tuesday night, following intense rainfall in the upper Yamuna catchment in the Himalayas. The discharge rose to 1.78 lakh cusecs by 7pm, Wednesday. The usual discharge at Hathnikund barrage is less than 50,000 cusecs.The India Meteorological Department has forecast some relief, with rain intensity in Uttarakhand likely to decrease from Thursday onwards, potentially easing the flow upstream.‚ÄúToday (Wednesday) is the last day of extreme weather conditions in Uttarakhand as by Thursday onwards we expect a gradual return to normalcy. Significant respite from ongoing extreme rainfall conditions is expected over the Himalayan region and adjoining plains of Haryana, Punjab, Delhi and UP. But over eastern Rajasthan, rainfall will continue over the next three days,‚Äù said IMD senior scientist Krishna Kumar Mishra.In July 2023, when Delhi saw its worst floods, the discharge from Hathnikund had remained well above 1 lakh cusecs for five days, while the peak discharge was observed at 3.59 lakh cusecs on July 11. The city was flooded by July 13, 2023, with water reaching Red Fort.Officials at the irrigation and flood control department, Delhi, however, said that they are better prepared this time, with all ITO barrage gates open and important regulators closed. In 2023, while a regulator at ITO broke, five ITO barrage gates were also jammed, impacting the flow of the river.","Yamuna reaches third highest level since record-keeping began in 1963. Floods inundate villages and areas such as Ring Road, parts of Civil Lines, Bela Road, and Sonia Vihar. Around 12,000 people have been displaced by the floods.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123688732,imgsize-109636,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/yamuna-level-ani-photo.jpg"
"Doctors in Pune report unusual surge in RSV cases this monsoon, many kids in ICUs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/doctors-in-pune-report-unusual-surge-in-rsv-cases-this-monsoon-many-kids-in-icus/articleshow/123664319.cms,"



Pune: Paediatricians across the city have flagged an unusual surge in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases this monsoon, with many children requiring intensive care and even ventilator support.Doctors said the outbreak was proving more severe than in recent years. RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms such as cough, runny nose, fever, and breathing difficulty. While most patients recover in one to two weeks, the infection can be dangerous in infants, especially those born premature, with congenital heart disease or weakened lungs.Dr Sagar Lad, senior paediatric intensivist at Jehangir Hospital and Sahyadri Mom Story Hospital, Shashtrinagar, said, ""RSV is usually seen during the winter and monsoon months, but this time the surge is much more pronounced with a higher number of cases. This season, RSV seems very severe. In the past week alone, I have had 8-9 children with RSV, some requiring paediatric ICU with ventilatory or respiratory support. The infection usually affects infants less than a year old. It is not clear why the virus is causing such severe disease this time, may be virulence is more. But it is also leading to prolonged hospital stays.""Dr Rajesh Kulkarni, a paediatrician at YCM Hospital and executive board member of National IAP, said: ""Periodically, we see a resurgence of RSV.The last major outbreak I witnessed was in 2010-2011, when there were very severe cases and even a few deaths. This year, it is rampant again. Paediatric ICUs across Pune are full of RSV cases. I have treated 30-40 babies who required intensive care this season, some needing ventilator support. Fortunately, we haven't seen any mortality yet. But the disease is quite severe.""While severe RSV mainly affects young infants who are born premature or have congenital heart disease, doctors cautioned that even seemingly healthy babies can develop serious illness. The virus spreads easily through droplets and contaminated surfaces, and symptoms can escalate from a common cold to wheezing and respiratory distress within days.Dr Kulkarni said a new preventive option for high-risk babies has recently become available in India. ""A monoclonal antibody called Nirsevimab was launched in India about three months ago. It offers around 70% protection against RSV and is very safe. The only drawback is the cost. One injection costs about Rs 40,000. It's imported and not affordable for many families,"" he said.Maharashtra health department officials said they did not maintain separate data on RSV cases. Till Aug 21 this year, the state has recorded 698 influenza cases. Influenza and RSV are different viruses, though both can cause respiratory illness and sometimes look similar clinically.Dr Amita Kaul, head of paediatrics at Surya Mother and Child Super Speciality Hospital, said: ""We are seeing RSV in a very severe form this season, especially in younger children. Many of them are coming in with high-grade fever and prolonged cough. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment available. Supportive care is needed, and quite a few children require oxygen. Some of the smaller babies even need ventilation, though most recover with treatment. ""She added, ""What is unusual is that RSV is now affecting older children too. Typically, it is seen in babies under one year, but this time we are also admitting children in the 3-6 year age group, some of whom need oxygen support and hospitalisation. There has been a nationwide surge in RSV cases this year, indicating increased circulation likely driven by seasonal patterns such as increased humidity and environmental factors like pollution. Out of 170 samples sent last month, 70 children were positive. This is the highest-ever number of RSV cases seen in recent years.""Dr Prateek Kataria, consultant paediatrician and neonatologist at Sahyadri Hospital, said: ""Most of the RSV cases are in children under one year of age, though we are also seeing some in slightly older children, including three-year-olds. RSV is a viral infection and does not have a specific curative drug. Treatment is largely supportive, including nebulisation, hydration, and oxygen or high-flow nasal cannula if the child has respiratory distress. ""He added: ""A new monoclonal antibody has been introduced recently,. It can provide protection for up to a year, but it is expensive and not widely used yet. We are also witnessing repeated RSV infections ‚Äî children who had the virus in one season are getting it again this year. The cases this year appear more severe. At present, I have several children with RSV admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.""","RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms.

DK Shivakumar proposes border towers to demarcate 5 new corporation in Bengaluru,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/dk-shivakumar-proposes-border-towers-to-demarcate-5-new-corporation-in-bengaluru/articleshow/123684015.cms,"



Bengaluru: With Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) now having formally replaced Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), citizens are vexed by a question: How exactly will the limits of the five newly created city corporations be marked on the ground?Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar has suggested installation of border towers to clearly demarcate the jurisdiction of each corporation.Speaking at the inauguration of the GBA headquarters here on Tuesday, Shivakumar said the state will also lay the foundation stones for new municipal offices on November 1, coinciding with Kannada Rajyotsava.""Boundary towers will be erected along the limits of all five corporations to make the divisions visible,"" he said. The move, officials say, will help citizens know which civic body to approach for services or grievances.The initiative echoes Kempegowda's vision, who, more than four centuries ago, had marked Bengaluru's territorial limits by erecting four iconic watch towers with the Dharmarayaswamy temple as the central edifice. These include the Lalbagh (South East), Gavipura (South West), Mehkri Circle (North West), and Ulsoor (North East) towers, which continue to symbolise the city's heritage.In 2014, BBMP had announced plans to construct Kempegowda towers on 10 major arterial roads connecting Bengaluru, with each tower estimated to cost around Rs 10 crore.The project, though, never moved beyond announcements.By reviving the concept in a new form, Shivakumar has drawn a symbolic link between the city's founder and Bengaluru's expansion under GBA.He also announced major administrative restructuring under the GBA, including the addition of 300 engineers to strengthen civic works. ""We are appointing one engineer for every ward. Around 500 engineers at lower levels will ensure transparency and proper groundwork,"" Shivakumar said.A proposal to increase the number of wards from 198 to 500 was submitted, with Rs 300 crore allocated for administrative expenses, salaries, and pensions.""Elections must first be held in the newly formed municipalities. Only later will mergers be considered,"" the deputy CM clarified.BOXName suggestionsOn the demand to include Kannada words in the GBA title, deputy CM D K Shivakumar said: ""I would like to ask for advice on what name to give. The same situation had arisen in other places, including Mumbai. There is no question of ignoring the mother tongue, but if we find a good [alternative] word, let's change it.""INSET‚ÄòPatience' over potholes is GBA chief's mantraTimes News NetworkAs motorists continue to struggle on crater-filled roads all across the city, GBA chief commissioner Maheshwar Rao urged Bengalureans to ""be patient"", citing multiple urban challenges delaying road repair work.The newly appointed GBA chief, under whose jurisdiction the five new corporations operate, made the statement in response to criticism over poor execution of pothole-filling works.Speaking to the media, Rao ruled out any issue with the quality of bitumen used for pothole repairs, saying there were other factors, including incessant rain, especially in low-lying areas.""In urban areas, five to six agencies often work simultaneously on different projects. On stretches where BWSSB is laying out pipelines, we cannot begin road construction until their work is completed,"" he said, citing Bannerghatta Road, Silk Board Junction, and other major city chokeholds.He also noted that it takes 12-24 hours for the work to properly settle in once repair work is done, but motorists start using the roads right away, setting the repair work at naught.",Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) has formally replaced Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar has suggested installation of border towers to clearly demarcate the jurisdiction of each corporation.
