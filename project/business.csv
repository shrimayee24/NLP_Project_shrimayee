MUMBAI: At least 11 persons, including six cabin crew members, felt dizzy and nauseated on an Air India flight from London to Mumbai on Monday, said sources. Air India confirmed the incident but said only five passengers and two crew members took ill.The flight AI-130 was operated with a Boeing 777 aircraft.

During this time, he contributed to the development of the unique propulsion system and low observable capabilities of the B-2; he also continued to work on classified matters as a contractor with the with the United States government until 1997, when his security clearance was revoked.Evidence displayed at the trial showed that Gowadia visited China six times between June 2003 and July 2005 to provide defense services in the form of design, test support and test data analysis of technologies for the purpose of helping Beijing build a cruise missile system by developing a stealthy exhaust nozzle.At the time of his arrest, Gowadia had been paid at least $110,000 by the Chinese.Gowadia was found guilty in August 2010, following six days of deliberation after a trial spanning nearly four months in Honolulu.

N EW DELHI: Stopping an aircraft with worn out tyres from taking off and allowing it to do so only after changing the same to finding the centre line of a major airport’s runway faded. Ineffective repairs carried out on aircraft leading torecurrence of snags and vehicles on tarmac without speed governors. The DGCA’s ongoing audit of the “Indian aviation ecosystem” is already throwing up several such findings. “This process of comprehensive surveillance will continue in future to detect hazards in the system,” said a senior official.The audit was announced on June 19 and since then two teams of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) led by joint DGs have fanned out at major airports including Delhi’s IGIA and Mumbai’s CSMIA for a “focussed assessment”.“A simulator was checked and found not matching with the aircraft configuration. Also the software was not updated to the current version,” the DGCA said in a statement.“All the findings observed during the surveillance have been communicated to the concerned operators for taking necessary corrective actions within seven days.”The critical areas under surveillance include: flight operations, airworthiness, ramp safety, air traffic control (ATC), communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems, and pre-flight medical evaluations. “Throughout the surveillance, ground activities and aircraft movements were closely monitored to check the compliance of regulatory requirements and to identify weak areas for improvement,” an official said.The action comes after the DGCA on June 19 ordered a focused assessment of the aviation ecosystem to strengthen safety measures across the sector.","The audit was announced on June 19 and since then two teams of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) led by joint DGs have fanned out at major airports. “This process of comprehensive surveillance will continue in future to detect hazards in the system,” said a senior official.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122048257,imgsize-664894,width-400,resizemode-4/122048257.jpg"
Gender equality In Indian workplaces remains uneven,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gender-equality-in-indian-workplaces-remains-uneven/articleshow/122081764.cms,"India is facing increasingly grave consequences of climate change, with approximately 5.4 million people internally displaced due to floods, droughts or erratic weather. Ranked sixth globally in terms of climate vulnerability, India must navigate the challenge of balancing development with sustainability.India accounts for 7.4% of global emissions, making it the world's sixth largest emitter. The primary sources are electricity and heat production, followed by the transport sector, which contributes 12.9% of emissions. Although renewables now contribute 47.4% of installed capacity, coal use continues to rise - production has grown 58% between FY 2013-14 and FY 2022-23, still fuelling over 70% of CO2 emissions.In response, India introduced the Panchamrit strategy at COP26, which outlines key climate goals for 2030 and 2070. These include installing 500 GW of non-fossil energy capacity, sourcing 50% of energy from renewables, reducing carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes, cutting carbon intensity by 45%, and reaching net-zero emissions by 2070.Regulatory mechanisms are being put in place to support these targets. These include a carbon market framework, GHG Emission Intensity Target Rules for high-emission sectors, and a Climate Finance Taxonomy to steer investment into sustainable projects across nine national missions.Environmental disclosures through frameworks such as Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) are now mandatory for the top 1,000 listed companies. Compliance with international standards like the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is increasing.Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) has emerged as a frontrunner in corporate climate action. The company aims to be carbon neutral by 2040 and has committed to substantial reductions in Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. M\&M's efforts include using 100% renewable energy by 2030, expanding its electric vehicle fleet, and afforestation through Project Hariyali, which has planted over 1 million trees.Start-ups are also contributing to the climate movement. Takachar, for example, has developed portable technology that converts agricultural waste into bioproducts, offering alternatives to harmful stubble burning and opening new revenue streams for rural communities.Despite these advances, challenges remain. While 92% of SMEs surveyed consider ESG a priority, over half cite cost as a major barrier. Other obstacles include fragmented regulations, limited resources, and insufficient awareness. Overcoming these will require coordination among businesses, regulators, and civil society.The Times of India, over the years, has launched hugely impactful campaigns and organised summits with powerful messaging and impact on the social sector. To recognise and reward work in the CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) space, The Times of India is holding a two-day Social Impact Summit on July 11 and 12, 2025, in Mumbai. The event, presented by Malabar Gold & Diamonds, has Ernst & Young as the knowledge partner.The Summit will see business leaders, NGOs, and policymakers address these issues. As Madhav Pai, CEO of WRI India, recently remarked this decade presents a crucial opportunity for India to steer its infrastructure investments toward climate resilience and low-carbon growth.","India accounts for 7.4% of global emissions, making it the world's sixth largest emitter.

Each one of the stakeholders in the process was aware as to what the offence was, what the crime number was and the sections under which the man was charged with and the punishment section.

It asked the UP govt to pay the compensation of Rs 5 lakh by Friday.UP's advocate general Garima Prasad informed the court that jail authorities had moved the trial court on May 28 for correction in the released order to include Section 5(1) of the anti-conversion law, but the trial court did so only on June 24, following which Aftab was released on Tuesday evening.The SC asked the state not to look for typographical errors in matters relating to liberty and said, ""Otherwise, we (judges) in the SC will be doing proof-reading while most of the country will be behind bars.""","Supreme Court orders judicial inquiry into lapses on the part of Ghaziabad jail officials.

The music soothes the nerves of the astronauts and helps them relax in order to focus on the lift-off.The ode-to-life song in the Ashutosh Gowarikar film that Shukla chose, coincidentally, centres around a Nasa scientist.The music playlist also had tracks curated by the rest of the crew: Commander Peggy Whitson (US) picked ‘Thunder’ by Imagine Dragons, Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski (Poland) went with ‘Supermonce’, a Polish track, and Tibor Kapu (Hungary) listed ‘Bvhely’, a traditional Hungarian song, as per a post by Axiom Space on X.The boy from Lucknow, which is famous for its varieties of mango, is carrying mango nectar with him to ISS. While astronauts are usually advised to travel light, Shukla is also carrying some mouth-watering Indian sweets — gajar (carrot) ka halwa, and moong dal halwa — with him to satiate his cravings for home-made food in space.After the 1999 Kargil War, Lucknow boy Shubhanshu Shukla was inspired to join the IAF. So, he applied for the National Defence Academy (NDA) exam and cleared it.He completed his military training and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science from NDA in 2005. He was then selected for the flying branch and underwent training at the IAF Academy.In June 2006, he was commissioned into the fighter stream of IAF as a flying officer. Shukla logged over 2,000 flying hours across a range of aircraft, including the Su-30 MKI, MiG-21, MiG-29, Jaguar, Hawk, Dornier 228, and An-32.Selected in 2019 for Isro's Gaganyaan mission, Shukla, along with three other selected Indian astronauts, went to Russia in 2020 for basic training at Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. After completing basic training in 2021, Shukla and others returned to India and attended training at Astronaut Training Facility in Bengaluru. During that time, he completed his Master of Technology degree in aerospace engineering from IISc Bangalore.Shukla’s name as a member of the Gaganyaan team was officially announced on Feb 27, 2024, when PM Narendra Modi announced the names of the astronaut-designates for India's first human space mission at Isro's Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapuram.Last year, he was chosen to pilot the Axiom mission 4 to ISS, becoming the first Indian astronaut to do so.",Shubhanshu Shukla is the Group Captain of India's Gaganyaan mission.

When The Namesake found its Gogol

The Namesake.

A son, a phone, and some persistence

From fanboy to front-runner

A childhood shaped by culture and conviction

Progressive campaign earns a movement’s backing





In a sweeping upset, Indian-American lawmaker Zohran Kwame Mamdani has won the Democratic primary for New York City Mayor, defeating political heavyweight and former governor Andrew Cuomo. But long before Mamdani was hailed as a rising political star with Bernie Sanders in his corner and a grassroots campaign that shook the establishment, he was just a teenager begging his mother, acclaimed filmmaker Mira Nair , for a favor, to meet Kal Penn The year was 2005. Mira Nair had just acquired the rights to Jhumpa Lahiri’sKal Penn, born Kalpen Suresh Modi, best known at the time for stoner comedy Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle, was desperate to audition.He wanted to land the role of Gogol Ganguli, a character whose struggles mirrored his own, born to Indian immigrant parents, bilingual, and navigating identity in America. But it wasn’t just the character he related to. Penn actively chased the project, even trying to acquire the rights to the novel before learning Mira Nair already had them.But it wasn’t Hollywood agents or industry insiders who opened the door.It was Zohran Mamdani, a teen with a plan and a phone.“I started calling her office nonstop,” Kal Penn once recalled. “Eventually Mira gave in, apparently because her son Zohran and his friend Sam were obsessed with Harold & Kumar,” Penn later admitted in an interview.The rest, as they say, is history. Penn landed the lead role of Gogol Ganguli, and The Namesake went on to become one of the most defining South Asian diaspora films in Hollywood.Now, two decades later, Zohran Mamdani has gone from film-nerd teen to the Democratic nominee for New York City Mayor.That early influence shaped Zohran’s sense of conviction, a quality that has defined his political career.Born in Kampala, Uganda in 1991, Mamdani moved to New York at age 7 with his mother, Mira Nair, and father Mahmood Mamdani, a noted Ugandan academic of Indian origin.As a State Assemblyman from Queens and democratic socialist, Mamdani led hunger strikes with taxi drivers to secure $450 million in debt relief, fought for $100 million in subway funding, and launched a fare-free bus pilot.His mayoral campaign promises include a rent freeze for stabilized tenants, universal childcare for kids aged six weeks to five years, and a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on affordability.“The cost of living is crushing working people,” his campaign site says. “Zohran believes government can lower costs and make life easier.”His revenue plan is just as ambitious, raising the corporate tax rate to match New Jersey’s 11.5%, taxing the top 1% of earners a flat 2%, and ending no-bid contracts to save billions more.“New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier,” the campaign declares.Senator Bernie Sanders hailed Mamdani’s win, saying, “You took on the political, economic and media establishment, and you beat them.”At his victory party in Queens, Mamdani quoted Nelson Mandela, saying, “It always seems impossible until it’s done. My friends, it is done.”Even Cuomo, conceding with grace, said, “Tonight is his night. He deserved it. He won.”The general election is scheduled for November 4, 2025. Until then, Mamdani’s campaign will likely keep pushing boundaries, just as he once did when he helped Kal Penn land a career-defining role.His mother, Mira Nair, best known for films like Monsoon Wedding and Salaam Bombay!, once said that she looks for actors “who live truthfully in the moment.” It’s a description that might now apply to her son, a politician who refused to play it safe, challenged the old guard, and won.","Zohran Kwame Mamdani has won the Democratic primary for New York City Mayor.

After years of red-carpet glam, family vacations, and public admiration, the once-adored friendship between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift has reportedly come to a painful end—this time, for good. According to multiple insider sources, the fallout is not only personal but now tangled in legal drama, forcing Lively to surrender private texts to the legal team of actor Justin Baldoni . The emotional toll appears to be heavy on Lively, while Swift remains distant—and firmly supported by her current inner circle, including NFL star Travis Kelce The bond between the ""Gossip Girl"" actress Blake Lively and the global music sensation Taylor Swift had been iconic. Swift, godmother to Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ three children—James, Inez, and Betty—was often seen vacationing and celebrating milestones with the couple. But those memories have now faded into silence.“After months of radio silence, Blake has stopped trying to reach out. She’s heartbroken, but she knows it’s time to let go. Taylor’s not coming back,” a source told Radar Online.Another insider close to Swift confirmed the emotional rupture: “The friendship is done.” The source alleged that Lively “exploited the Godmother of her children and manipulated the public into thinking that she was watching out for her best interests.”The emotional heartbreak coincides with a troubling development in the legal arena. Lively has been ordered by a judge to submit her text exchanges with Swift in connection to Justin Baldoni’s ongoing sexual harassment case.The ruling stems from Lively herself identifying Swift as someone with whom she discussed workplace grievances.Reports also suggest Blake Lively may have allegedly used her connection with Swift as leverage. Rumors swirled that Lively had threatened to release past messages unless Swift publicly supported her during the controversy.Taylor Swift, who was dramatically subpoenaed in the case, has attempted to maintain her distance. Yet, her silence has been interpreted as a deliberate break from the actress she once trusted.Through the storm, Swift isn’t alone. Travis Kelce, her current partner and Kansas City Chiefs star, has remained low-key but steady in his support. While Kelce hasn’t spoken publicly about the situation, insiders close to the singer say he’s been a “calming force” during the fallout.With Taylor Swift preparing to release her next album, rumored to address themes of betrayal and trust, Kelce’s presence has reportedly been “grounding” for the Grammy-winner.Also Read: Taylor Swift breaks from Blake Lively after shocking betrayal as Travis Kelce becomes her emotional shield While the headlines continue to swirl, one thing is certain—this is no longer just celebrity gossip.

Dubai: 21 convicted and fined Dh25.2 million in one of the biggest residency visa fraud schemes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-21-convicted-and-fined-dh25-2-million-in-one-of-the-biggest-residency-visa-fraud-schemes/articleshow/122050073.cms,"The convicted individuals established 33 fictitious companies with fake addresses to unlawfully obtain 385 residency visas, which they then sold to recipients/ (Representational Image)

How the Scheme Operated



Investigation and Arrests











In a landmark ruling, Dubai’s Citizenship and Residency Court has convicted 21 individuals of various nationalities in a massive residency visa fraud case, described as one of the largest of its kind in the emirate’s history. The court imposed a fine of Dh25.2 million on the defendants, who were found guilty of illegally obtaining and selling 385 UAE residency visas through a complex network of fraudulent commercial establishments.According to official details released by authorities, the accused set up 33 fake commercial establishments, businesses that existed only on paper, to illegally obtain 385 residence visas. These companies were used as fronts to recruit individuals under false employment pretenses. Once the visas were issued, the businesses were quickly shut down, leaving the recruited individuals in a legally vulnerable position without any effort to regularise their residency status.“The companies were set up solely to obtain residence visas illegally,” said Dr Ali Humaid bin Khatem, Senior Advocate General and Head of the Citizenship and Residency Prosecution.The case highlights the strategic and deliberate misuse of the UAE’s labour and residency systems for profit, with many of the business licences found to have been obtained using fake addresses.This was clearly a planned effort to bypass residency and labour regulations, authorities confirmed.The General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) in Dubai initially flagged the suspicious activities, which led to the Public Prosecution launching a detailed investigation. This involved meticulous monitoring, repeated follow-ups, and on-ground inspections of the alleged offices of the fake companies, all of which were ultimately found to be non-existent.Once arrested, the accused were referred to the Citizenship and Residency Prosecution, which carried out further investigations. According to Dr Bin Khatem, prosecutors secured solid evidence to support a watertight case that led to the convictions.“The Public Prosecution will continue to work closely with its partners to address any violations of laws governing the entry and residence of foreigners as well as labour regulations in order to preserve the stability of society and the integrity of the labour market,” Dr Bin Khatem added.Following the trial, the Dubai Citizenship and Residency Court delivered its verdict, convicting all 21 individuals involved and slapping them with fines totalling Dh25.21 million.","Dubai's Citizenship and Residency Court has convicted 21 individuals of various nationalities in a massive residency visa fraud case.

70% of Indian teens spend 7 hours online: ISKCON monk warns of mental health fallout

A spiritual path grounded in scientific wisdom



Gauranga Das’s unique approach to leadership



Books that bridge the gap between worlds



The Art of Resilience

The Art of Focus

In a moment that appealed to seekers of spirituality as well as tech enthusiasts, there was an unforgettable exchange between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The discussion between them, which had started lively with a jocular remark about being youthful, soon turned into an introspective discussion on the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility.Gauranga Das, a graduate from IIT Bombay, who now heads programs in sustainable living and spiritual education, used the moment to highlight some of the most pressing concerns of our digital times - mental health and the increasing digital addiction epidemic.The difference between these two IIT graduates was more than physical or professional; it was philosophical. While one sits at the head of one of the most influential tech giants in the world, the other has dedicated his life to leading people to inner understanding and spiritual direction. The meeting wasn't merely a reunion; it was a comparison of two radically different directions based on the same intellectual heritage. It was an effective metaphor for the decisions contemporary society must make today: progress without equilibrium, or innovation backed by internal wellness.Gauranga Das and Sundar Pichai, though having started at the same time at IIT, followed different career paths early on in life. Pichai went into technology and became the CEO of Google, a company that is at the heart of the digital revolution. Das instead went down the path of spiritual discovery and service, becoming an ISKCON member and dedicating himself to bringing ancient wisdom into modern settings.Their meeting at the India Global Forum 2025 was noticed when Pichai noted the way young Gauranga Das looked compared to his age. Das responded with an answer that went viral instantly for its simplicity and profundity:This one sentence highlighted a wider discussion regarding what it means to live from purpose rather than performance. It also spawned a wider debate regarding how spiritual tools can assist with coping with rising levels of stress inflicted as a result of round-the-clock digital interaction.In his address to the forum, Gauranga Das reported shocking statistics regarding digital addiction, specifically social media. Based on the information he provided, more than 230 million individuals globally are addicted to social media. In India alone, 70% of adolescents spend as much as seven hours per day on the net, a figure that indicates increasing worry for parents, teachers, and mental health professionals.Das linked these figures to the wider problem of declining mental health worldwide. Referring to world trends, he identified that one in seven individuals is presently suffering from some sort of mental health difficulty. These are anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and chronic stress; maladies that are increasingly being attributed to excessive exposure to digital content and a mindfulness deficit in daily life.This was not simply an attack on technology, but a call to awaken to how we engage with it. Das leveraged the platform to promote a more holistic digital life, one that includes frequent breaks, mindful use, and spiritual anchoring.Gauranga Das is not only a monk who has spiritual wisdom; he is also an engineer who has been trained and who has a deep understanding of how technology functions and how it may affect human psychology. This makes him uniquely qualified in matters that lie at the interface between science and spirituality.Das is also a senior member of the Governing Body Commission of ISKCON and the director of Govardhan Ecovillage (GEV), a green living community that was established under the inspiration of Radhanath Swami. GEV is not only an ashram, it is a widely acclaimed model of how to apply ancient wisdom to modern sustainability practices. It won the UN World Tourism Organization Award in 2017, and it is also accredited with key United Nations organisations such as UNEP, ECOSOC, UNCCD, and CBD.Under Das's stewardship, GEV has turned into an exemplar of the way communities can be in harmony with nature yet maintain essential spiritual principles. It should not be astonishing that numerous young professionals, such as engineers, physicians, and policy makers, now journey to the Ecovillage for leadership training and retreats.Aside from his work in the Ecovillage, Gauranga Das also heads the Govardhan School of Public Leadership, an institution that prepares wannabe civil servants of India. The founder created the school to develop resilient leaders imbued with ethical values by the integration of Vedic wisdom alongside contemporary public policy training.Das also leads the Bhaktivedanta Research Centre, where ancient manuscripts are kept, translated, and analysed in academic contexts. This centre offers postgraduate studies in philosophy and comparative religion, providing students access to systems of knowledge that are both ancient and extremely useful today.Through such platforms, Das prioritises staying resilient, focused, and mentally clear; qualities that are typically undervalued in demanding corporate settings but are key to sustained success and satisfaction.To make spiritual insights more common, Gauranga Das has written two influential books:Both books borrow from scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita but touch on very contemporary issues like office burnout, distraction, and individual discontentment. These books have spoken to spiritual seekers as well as working professionals seeking down-to-earth, real-life counsel on surviving life's stress.In interviews and talks, Das has consistently emphasised that spiritual tools are not exclusive to monks or renunciants. They are equally relevant to CEOs, students, and anyone navigating the complexities of modern life.",Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das met at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The pair discussed the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility. Das is not only a monk who has spiritual wisdom; he is also an engineer who has a deep understanding of how technology functions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122067493,imgsize-39158,width-400,resizemode-4/Sundar-Pichais-IIT-batchmate-Gauranga-Das-who-turned-monk-looks-younger-than-him.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Thiruvananthapuram International Airport will now calculate a parking fee for the British Royal Navy F-35 fighter jet as it continues to be grounded following a hydraulic snag.Airport sources, however, said they are yet to calculate the amount that needs to be charged for the jet, which has been stranded for close to 10 days. It is parked in Bay 4, used by VIP aircraft. It is not hampering aircraft movement at the airport because the flight traffic is low.Usually, the airport operator charges a parking fee based on the aircraft's weight. But the fighter jet is lightweight and it is not a scheduled flight. So the same yardstick may not be applicable in this case. Nevertheless, the authorities may have a bill which the Union govt may pay because it is a defence aircraft.A team of engineers from the UK and the US will arrive soon to rectify the snag. If it is not successful, arrangements may have to be made to move the jet out using a freighter plane.A British High Commission spokesperson said: ""We are working to repair the UK F-35B at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport as quickly as possible.We thank the Indian authorities for their continued support.""There was a move to shift the jet to the hangar as it may have to be here for a some more time, but British Navy authorities were reportedly not in favour of it.This is the first time that the US-made, most sophisticated fighter jet is stranded in a foreign country. It is part of the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales. The aircraft carrier carried out at-sea exercises along with the Indian Navy recently.The F-35 is renowned for its short take-off and vertical landing capabilities, allowing it to operate from aircraft carriers and short runways.","The F-35 has been stranded for close to 10 days.

GURGAON: A 74-year-old retired bank manager watering plants fell 14 floors to his death after stepping onto a corroded portion of an iron bridge that connected two towers of a residential complex in Faridabad Sector 88 on Tuesday morning.Police said no sooner had Khulwant Singh stepped on the rusted portion of the bridge, it gave way, sending him plummeting to the ground below through the gap. He landed face down and his hands and head were severed. The bridge where Singh was tending to plants connected Towers 8 and 9 of RPS Savana society.Originally from Himachal Pradesh, Singh had been living in the society with his only son Harshit, an IT engineer, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren after his wife passed away a few years ago. He had two daughters living abroad. A police team that reached the society took custody of the body and sent it for an autopsy.The bridge, originally designed as a fire escape, had been repurposed by residents as a makeshift garden. Police officials pointed out that regular watering of plants, combined with rain, had accelerated the bridge's corrosion over time.The structure, made of iron with tile blocks, had been showing visible signs of rust, particularly in areas where plants were maintained.""The continuous exposure to water, both from flowerpots and natural weather conditions, had severely compromised the bridge's structural integrity,"" said Arvind, the SHO of BPTP police station.At the time of the incident around 8.30am, Singh's family members were inside their flat. Despite retiring from State Bank of India 15 years ago, he was known in the community for his active lifestyle.SHO Arvind said Singh's family had lodged a complaint, alleging lack of maintenance despite the iron structure rusting away. ""We are investigating the matter from all angles, including possible negligence by the society's RWA, which is responsible for maintenance,"" he added.Other residents, too, complained of maintenance issues at RPS Savana. ""There are issues with the quality of construction too. We have been pointing this out to the developer from the moment we bought our flats, but to no avail,"" said a resident.An RWA member said residents had been asked to not place pots on the bridge. ""We are deeply saddened by the demise of Singh ji. It's an extremely unfortunate incident. However, we have been asking residents to not keep anything on the bridge that hamper emergency rescue efforts,"" he added.

Senator Bernie Sanders has criticised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for spending millions on his wedding celebrations in Venice, Italy. Sharing a post on microblogging site X (formerly known as Twitter), Sanders condemned the extravagant spend on the wedding, saying “This is oligarchy. This is obscene.” He pointed out that while a large number of Americans “live paycheck to paycheck” and faces issues like hunger, Bezos “goes to Venice on his $500 million yacht for a $20 million wedding & spends $5 million on a ring”. The comments have added to ongoing protest against Bezos’ marriage with fiance Lauren Sanchez . Locals and activists have raised concerns about the disruption caused by the extravagant wedding preparations and the impact of overtourism on the historic city.In the X post, Sanders wrote “This is oligarchy. This is obscene. While 60% live paycheck to paycheck & kids go hungry, Jeff Bezos, worth $230 billion, goes to Venice on his $500 million yacht for a $20 million wedding & spends $5 million on a ring while his real tax rate is just 1.1%. End this oligarchy.”Recently, Greenpeace took part in protests in Venice against the wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez. Protesters held a large banner in St. Mark’s Square that read, “IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX”. According to an Associated Press report, local police quickly removed the banner and asked the small group of demonstrators to leave.The protest is part of the “No Space for Bezos” campaign, which includes local housing groups, student organisations, and anti-cruise activists. They say the wedding is a symbol of the city’s ongoing problems with overtourism and poor local planning. Last week, the group also hung banners from major landmarks and put up posters around the city.","Senator Bernie Sanders has criticised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for spending millions on his wedding celebrations in Venice, Italy.

Third major cut this year at Microsoft; to affect sales and marketing division also

Microsoft will conduct another round of major layoffs in its Xbox gaming division next week as part of a broader company-wide reorganization, according to sources familiar with the plans. Managers within Xbox are expecting substantial cuts across the entire gaming group, marking the fourth significant layoff at the division in 18 months.The upcoming cuts will target thousands of employees primarily in sales divisions, with Xbox bearing a significant portion of the reductions. Bloomberg reported that the layoffs coincide with Microsoft's fiscal year end on June 30, following the company's pattern of making organizational changes during this period.Xbox has faced mounting pressure from Microsoft executives to boost profit margins since the company's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard closed in 2023. The gaming division has experienced a series of workforce reductions, including 1,900 layoffs in January 2024, 650 cuts in September, and the closure of several game studios including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin.Sources indicate Microsoft is restructuring Xbox distribution across central Europe, with some regional operations ceasing entirely. The Verge reported that these changes aim to align the business for next-generation console development while streamlining operations.The Xbox layoffs represent the third major workforce reduction for Microsoft in 2025, following 6,000 cuts in May and over 300 additional eliminations weeks later. The company previously announced plans to eliminate approximately 3% of its total 228,000-person workforce as part of efforts to flatten management structure and control costs.Microsoft's sales and marketing division, employing roughly 45,000 workers, will face the heaviest impact from the upcoming cuts. The restructuring reflects the tech giant's strategy to balance massive AI investments, estimated at $80 billion for data center spending this fiscal year, with operational efficiency across other business units.Microsoft declined to comment on the planned layoffs.","Microsoft will conduct another round of major layoffs in its Xbox gaming division next week, according to sources familiar with the plans.

The voice over in the background urges viewers to “keep working so your millionaire bosses become billionaires,” and warns them not to apply for the fifth season of the show.The teaser simply conveys the message that don’t give up on your dreams for corporate burnout .The new promo of the show aligns with the viewpoints of some of the judges on show. Recently, Shark Tank India judge Namita Thapar publicly criticized the concept of a 70-hour work week. Thapar said that the idea of a 70-hour work week is unsustainable and is not good for the well-being of the professional. She also advocates the ideal of work-life balance . Anupam Mittal, another judge on the show also weighed in with a sarcastic remark about AI potentially eliminating jobs, easing concerns about long work hours.However, not all the judges on the show disagree with this sentiment of long working hours. Recently, Boat co-founder and Shark Tank India judge Aman Gupta acknowledged the significant time he dedicated to building his business, which inevitably meant less time for his family, particularly during his daughter's formative years.Speaking on the podcast Prakhar Ke Pravachan, Gupta said, “I know I have missed out on many things in my daughter’s life. If I look back now, I realise how many events I have missed. However, I am very much okay with it and I don’t regret it at all.” He added, “Had I not missed out on those occasions, my life would have been much different.”However, Gupta mentioned that these sacrifices were important and necessary for him to succeed. ""I'm very much okay with it. I don't regret it at all. Had I not missed out on those important occasions, my life would have been much different,"" he explained. He further added, ""I worked very hard and that is the reason I'm where I am. I must have missed out on many things in life, but that is what it takes to reach such a level.""","Shark Tank India recently posted a teaser of the upcoming fifth season of the show on Instagram. The now viral teaser takes a sly dig at the 70-hour work week comment made by Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy. The promo can be seen mocking the long working hours, but it also draws parallels with Shark Tank India judge Aman Gupta.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122082209,imgsize-60474,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-jpg-4.jpg"
Bumble layoffs: 30% global workforce axed; CEO pushes reset to revive growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bumble-layoffs-30-global-workforce-axed-ceo-pushes-reset-to-revive-growth/articleshow/122081877.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Bumble Inc. has announced plans to lay off nearly 30 per cent of its global workforce, affecting 240 employees, in a move aimed at cutting costs and repositioning the online dating firm for long-term growth.The company said it would reinvest savings of around $40 million into product innovation and technology development.The layoffs, confirmed in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, mark the latest shakeup in a struggling dating app sector grappling with economic headwinds and stagnating user growth.According to news agency Reuters, Bumble’s decision aligns with its broader strategy shift under CEO and founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, who returned to lead the firm in March amid mounting investor pressure.“This is an inflection point,” Wolfe Herd told employees in an internal email, as reported by CBS News. “We need to take decisive action to restructure to build a company that's resilient, intentional and ready for the next decade.”Bumble, which went public in 2021 with a $15 billion valuation, now trades at less than $7 per share, slashing its market capitalisation to just over $500 million. Shares jumped more than 23 per cent following the layoff announcement and even rose 21 per cent in midday trading, according to news agency Associated Press.The company also raised its second-quarter revenue forecast to $244 million–$249 million, up from the earlier guidance of $235 million–$243 million. While Bumble met Wall Street’s first-quarter expectations in May, it still reported a nearly 8 per cent revenue drop from a year ago, reported AP.During the same earnings call, Wolfe Herd admitted the platform had lost traction with users and promised improvements in match quality and user experience.“We are accelerating our efforts to improve our member base and show members a more thoughtful selection of high-quality, relevant profiles,” she had said, as cited by CBS News.Founded on the premise of women making the first move, Bumble has since adjusted its signature rule to drive growth. The firm also owns Badoo and had around 4.1 million paying users at the end of 2024, up 11 per cent year-on-year.However, overall revenue growth remained sluggish at under 2 per cent, and the company has continued to report losses, BBC reported.The strategic overhaul comes as the online dating space sees declining investor confidence and increasing competition. Rival Match Group, which owns Tinder, recently cut 13 per cent of its workforce.According to Reuters, Bumble's new direction under Wolfe Herd emphasises user experience over short-term revenue or growth metrics.Chandler Willison, analyst at M Science, was quoted by Reuters as saying that the restructuring reflects Bumble’s push to become more agile and return to a “startup-like” model. The company expects to incur $13 million–$18 million in one-time severance and related costs across Q3 and Q4 of 2025.A Bumble spokesperson said the layoffs align with the firm’s strategic goals. “Our focus now is on moving forward in a way that strengthens our core business, continues to serve our members effectively, and positions us for future growth,” the spokesperson said, as cited by CBS News.With this reset, Bumble hopes to navigate industry turbulence and reclaim its footing in a space increasingly defined by evolving user expectations and economic caution.","Bumble Inc. announced plans to lay off nearly 30 per cent of its global workforce, affecting 240 employees.

But since the reciprocal tariff issue remains to be addressed, sustained rally would be difficult. The market focus in the near-term will be on what transpires around July 9th when the 90-day pause of the reciprocal tariff ends.

Disappointment on this front will constrain the rally.”“FIIs are likely to press selling in the market since Indian valuations have got stretched at above 22 times estimated FY 26 earnings while the PE for Chinese stocks ( Hang Seng Index) is around 15. This kind of differential in valuations may revive the ‘Sell India, Buy China’ strategy of the FIIs.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
