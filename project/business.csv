India’s Space Dream: PM Modi Vows To Build Nation’s Own Space Station After Gaganyaan On Space Day

What is a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)?

A rare opportunity for observation

Background: The Chandrayaan-2 mission

NEW DELHI: In a remarkable scientific achievement, India’s Chandrayaan-2 lunar orbiter has made the first-ever observation of the effects of the Sun’s Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on the Moon, the Indian Space Research Organisation ISRO ) said on Saturday.The finding was made using Chandra’s Atmospheric Composition Explorer-2 (CHACE-2), one of the scientific instruments onboard the orbiter. The observations showed a significant increase in the total pressure of the Moon’s dayside exosphere or its extremely thin atmosphere, when a CME impacted the lunar surface.According to ISRO, the total number of neutral atoms and molecules, known as “number density” increased by more than an order of magnitude during this event. This confirmed long-standing theoretical models that had predicted such an effect but had never been directly observed before.“This increase is consistent with earlier theoretical models, which predicted such an effect, but CHACE-2 onboard Chandrayaan-2 has observed it for the first time,” the space agency said in its statement.A Coronal Mass Ejection is a massive burst of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun’s corona, its outer atmosphere that ejects high-energy particles, mainly Hydrogen and Helium ions, into space.When such emissions reach planetary bodies, they can affect their atmospheres and surfaces.For Earth, its magnetic field offers a layer of protection against these effects. However, the Moon has no atmosphere or global magnetic field, making it highly exposed to the Sun’s activity.The rare observation occurred on May 10 last year when a series of CMEs were hurled from the Sun toward the Moon. This powerful solar activity caused atoms on the lunar surface to be knocked off and released into the Moon’s exosphere, temporarily increasing its density and pressure.ISRO said this direct observation offers valuable insights into how solar activity influences the Moon’s environment, knowledge that could prove crucial as humans plan to build future lunar habitats and scientific bases.ISRO highlighted that such extreme solar events can temporarily alter the lunar environment, posing potential challenges for establishing long-term bases on the Moon.Launched on July 22, 2019, from Sriharikota aboard the GSLV-MkIII-M1 rocket, Chandrayaan-2 is India’s second lunar exploration mission. The mission carried eight scientific payloads to study the Moon’s surface, atmosphere and mineral composition.While the Vikram lander lost communication during its September 7, 2019, landing attempt, the Orbiter remains fully functional and continues to orbit the Moon at an altitude of around 100 km. It has been conducting valuable scientific observations for over five years.The CHACE-2 payload, part of the orbiter’s suite of instruments, is specifically designed to study the composition and variability of the lunar exosphere.This first-of-its-kind observation not only enhances scientific understanding of space weather and its effects on the Moon but also has broader implications for future lunar missions.","India's Chandrayaan-2 lunar orbiter has made the first-ever observation of the effects of the Sun's Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on the Moon.

Government to pay bail surety of poor undertrials: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-pay-bail-surety-of-poor-undertrials-sc/articleshow/124678809.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Framing a unique standard operating procedure, Supreme Court has directed that if a poor person, arrested for an offence and lodged in jail pending trial, is unable to furnish monetary surety for bail, government concerned through district legal services authority will provide it to ensure release, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. The new SOP was framed by SC after incorporating suggestions from amicus curiae.The new SOP was framed by a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and S C Sharma after incorporating suggestions from amicus curiae and senior advocate Sidharth Luthra and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati.The case was taken up suo motu by SC after learning that thousands of undertrials are languishing in jail despite being granted bail just because of their inability to fill bail bonds with or without sureties. The bench said district legal services authority (DLSA) can fill a surety amount up to Rs 1 lakh and if the trial court has fixed it higher than Rs 1 lakh, then it would file an application to get it reduced. In the new guidelines, the bench said if an undertrial prisoner is not released from jail within seven days of grant of bail, then the jail authorities would intimate to DLSA secretary, who will immediately depute a person to verify whether the undertrial has funds in his prisoner’s savings account.If the accused did not have money, then “district level empowered committee will direct release of funds for surety on DLSA’s recommendation within a period of five days from the date of receipt of the report”.“For cases where empowered committee recommends that undertrial prisoner be extended the benefit of financial support under ‘Support to Poor Prisoners Scheme’, then requisite amount of upto Rs 50,000 per case for one prisoner, can be directed to be drawn and made available to court concerned by way of fixed deposit or any other prescribed method, which district committee feels appropriate within five days of its decision pending integration in inter-operable criminal justice system,” SC said.",The new SOP was framed by a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and S C Sharma.

Role of GTPRO:

Why GTPRO needed?

Next steps:

The road covered so far

NEW DELHI: The government’s in-principle go ahead to setting up of an apex federal agency for planning and monitoring of all modes of surface transport, railways, shipping, civil aviation and mass transit at national level, and logistics sector is set to bring a paradigm shift in the country’s infrastructure planning and accelerated development. The new entity — GatiShakti Transport Planning and Research Organisation (GTPRO) — to be housed in the Cabinet Secretariat will eliminate at least two layers of project approval process, which take around 60 days.TOI on October 9 had first reported the go ahead given for GTPRO at a meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi, which was attended by five cabinet ministers and secretaries from related ministries, and other top officials. Sources said DPIIT has been tasked to prepare a proposal for the Cabinet for setting up of the new entity, which will be headed by a senior officer designated as secretary (transport planning).Proposed to be set up under Section-8 of the Companies Act, the GTPRO will include PM GatiShakti framework, logistics and supply chain, transport sector (research and planning), transport big data, project monitoring and impact assessment for all infrastructure projects.The agency would be responsible for roll out of Master Plan or integrated plan; it will appraise sectoral plans such as rail, road and aviation, appraise all projects that cost over Rs 500 crore, monitor projects and assess their impact, and to have a repository of Big Data.The ministries concerned will prepare sector plans for five and 10 years, execute and monitor them as well.Govt expects that the new entity will bring a system of structured framework to initiate master planning and will have datasets that are required for planning and research. It is also expected to put a well placed mechanism for continuous flow of expertise and promote knowledge-sharing in planning.The need to have an Integrated Transport Planning Authority (ITPA) was mooted by three empowered Group of Secretaries in November 2023 and the presentation on transformational change before PM Modi. They had suggested the ITPA could be akin to the establishments in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Japan to deal with all issues relating to transportation.They had proposed that the new entity would help take the best decisions for creating the right infrastructure keeping in mind the value for money. Then it was envisaged that the agency will coordinate with states for key infrastructure projects. They had proposed integrated transportation solutions with a target to achieve over 42% movement of freight by rail or waterways by 2030. The plan envisaged to increase the average speed of freight trains to 40 kmph by 2030 as compared to the current speed of 24 kmph and also to to increase the average speed of trucks from current 25-40 kmph to more than 40 kmph by 2030.At present, there is no apex agency to deal with transportation issues as a whole in India. Each ministry has its own vision document, there is no brainstorming among ministries and no defined 5-year or 10-year plans. PM Gatishakti National Master Plan has played in project evaluation, but the impact was not as per expectation. There is monitoring by different agencies and by different frameworks while no agency to suggest global best practices, new technologies, no agency to do policy advocacy and recommend changes in Acts and Rules.The government felt the need for transport planning considering that India needs a direction with infrastructure investment, which has been increasing over the past decade. Sources said there is a need for a super specialised expertise in transport planning as China and South Korea.The administration also realised that the current planning is primarily consultant-driven, with minimal collaboration among ministries and states. Also, there is no central agency responsible for policy advocacy or recommending changes to Acts and Rules to improve planning and project implementation. Sources added that there is no mechanism for mid-course correction in case of project failures.As per proposal, GatiShakti division, project monitoring and logistics division of DPIIT may be placed in Cabinet Secretariat. Proposal to seek cabinet nod for the organisation may be completed within 90 days.* Oct 2013: PM GatiShakti National Master Plan covering seven sector — road, rail, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport & logistics infrastructure — focussed on integrated planning & evaluation* Dec 2023 to Aug 2025 : Meetings conducted with various countries & institutions, including Korea Transport Institute, Infrastructure Australia, World Bank, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport & Tourism of Japan, IITs, IIMs & ADB* Studies have found the need for strong institutional mechanism for transport planning, need for transportation and sectoral plans, scientific research by government-funded institutions & close coordination of ministries and research institutions","The new entity — GatiShakti Transport Planning and Research Organisation (GTPRO) — to be housed in the Cabinet Secretariat will eliminate at least two layers of project approval process.

Bihar polls: Parties' caste arithmetic vs caste survey — who is living upto Karpoori's dream?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-parties-caste-arithmetic-vs-caste-survey-who-is-living-upto-karpooris-dream/articleshow/124671495.cms,"'Jiski jitni sankhya bhari utni uski hissedari?'

Sabka sath sabka vikas?

NEW DELHI: It has been more than three decades since former Bihar chief minister and a flag bearer of backward classes, Karpoori Thakur bowed out from the stage of Bihar politics. However, his disciples, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar, still swear by Karpoori's name on the issue of social justice.When RJD and JD(U)-led Mahagathbandhan came to power in 2022, they conducted a caste survey to identify the exact population of the state’s Other backward castes (OBC) and Extremely Backward Castes (EBC), to push demands for policies such as expanded quotas. After initial opposition, BJP also came around and supported the exercise.The survey found out that the EBCs constitute the largest portion at 36 per cent, along with the other backward classes at 27 per cent, which amounts to 63 per cent of the total 13.07 crore population of the state; together, they constitute the socially hefty segment of backward classes. Meanwhile, the “upper caste” groups among Hindus account for only 10.6 per cent.After the caste survey report, political parties claimed that the exercise would ensure representation proportional to each community’s population. However, this seems unlikely in the upcoming Bihar elections, as parties appear to be prioritising their traditional voter bases and other factors over population-based representation during the screening of the candidates.Catering to its traditional vote banks of Yadavs and Muslims, Rashtriya Janata Dal distributed tickets to 28 Yadavs and 6 Muslims. It also included candidates from the upper caste and EBC communities. However, the exact number is unknown as Tejashwi is yet to make an official announcement.While the seat-sharing deal with RJD and Left parties is still in limbo, Congress also announced a list of 48 candidates for the upcoming elections. Out of the 48 candidates, 17 tickets (35.4%) were given to upper castes, which include 8 to Bhumihars, 6 seats to Brahmins and 5 seats to Rajputs. Meanwhile, 10 seats (20.8%) are given to OBCs, which include 5 Yadavs, 1 Kurmi, 1 Goswami, 1 Kushwaha and 3 Vaishyas. The party has also fielded 5 candidates (10.4%) from Muslim communities, 5 (10.4%)from EBC, 9 (18.8%) from the SC community and one (2.1%) from the only reserved seat for the ST community in the stateAdditionally, the Left parties are contesting a total of 29 seats. Among these, 15 seats are allocated to OBC candidates, 1 to an EBC candidate, 8 to SC candidates, 2 to minority candidates, 2 to Bhumihars, and 1 to a Rajput. In terms of party distribution, the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) is contesting 10 seats, the Communist Party of India (CPI) 6 seats, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) 4 seats.Meanwhile, BJP and JD(U) are contesting on 101 seats under the banner of NDA. The remaining 41 seats have been distributed among the minor allies.The screening seems lopsided in the NDA camp too, as BJP, which is contesting on 101 seats in the upcoming election, has fielded almost half of the candidates coming from the upper caste community.Riding on the vote banks of the upper castes, 49 tickets (48.5 per cent) were given to upper caste candidates. Meanwhile, 34 candidates (33.7 per cent) from the OBC community are fielded, including 6 Yadavs, 15 Vaishyas, 7 Kushwahas, and 2 Kurmis. 10 EBC (9.9 per cent), candidate and 12 SC (11.9 per cent) candidates are also in the poll fray with BJP's symbol.Meanwhile, chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) has fielded the most candidates from the OBC, EBC and SC communities. Nitish, who has positioned himself as the poster boy of non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs, has fielded 37 candidates from the OBC community (36.6%), while 22 candidates from the EBC community (21.8%). Additionally, 15 candidates from the SC community (14.9%) and 1 candidate from the ST community (1.0%) are fielded in the poll fray. JD(U) has also distributed tickets to 22 (21.8%) candidates from the upper caste community in the upcoming assembly elections.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and achieved 0.9% of the vote share.","RJD and JD(U) conducted a caste survey to identify the exact population of the state’s Other backward castes (OBC) and Extremely Backward Castes (EBC) EBCs constitute the largest portion at 36 per cent, along with the other backward classes at 27 per cent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124671526,imgsize-1537635,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Gold and silver price prediction today:MCX Gold prices are currently trading around the ₹1,27,000 mark, reflecting strong bullish momentum. On the international front, COMEX gold is comfortably holding above the $4,000 level, further reinforcing the positive trend. This price behaviour indicates that gold is consistently forming higher lows, which is a classic sign of strength in technical analysis. The ability to protect previous support levels suggests that buyers are active at lower levels, absorbing selling pressure and preparing for potential upside moves.From a short-term trading perspective, gold prices have the potential to move towards the ₹1,30,000 level if the current momentum continues. Traders can consider accumulating positions near the ₹1,26,000 support zone, where buying interest has previously emerged. A strong support base is seen at ₹1,23,500, and any dip toward this level may offer a good risk-reward entry for bullish positions.Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary concerns, and a weak global economic outlook, gold remains a preferred safe-haven asset.These factors are likely to keep demand strong and prices buoyant in the near term. As long as prices sustain above the key support levels, the outlook for gold remains optimistic with further upside potential.MCX Silver has shown significant strength and has outperformed MCX Gold in recent sessions, currently trading around ₹1,60,000 levels. This rally reflects robust bullish sentiment driven by a combination of industrial demand, investment interest, and a positive technical setup. Silver's strong price action suggests that market participants are confident in its upside potential, especially as it continues to make higher highs and higher lows, a clear sign of an ongoing uptrend.Compared to gold, silver tends to exhibit more volatility, which can offer attractive trading opportunities. Any corrective move or dip toward the ₹1,57,000 level can be seen as a buying opportunity, supported by strong demand and momentum. On the upside, prices have the potential to move toward ₹1,63,000 in the near term. Traders should maintain a stop-loss at ₹1,54,000 to manage risk effectively in case of unexpected price reversals.Silver's dual role as both a precious and industrial metal makes it a favored asset in times of economic uncertainty, as well as during periods of industrial recovery. With favorable fundamentals and technical strength, silver remains well-positioned for further gains, and buying on dips strategy could prove rewarding in the current market environment.","Both gold and silver prices are exhibiting strong bullish momentum.

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



EPFO subscribers take note! The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","EPFO has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

Congress vs BJP:Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge Sparks Debate on RSS Event in Public Institutionss

NEW DELHI: Congress MLA K N Rajanna on Saturday raised questions over whether the Karnataka government would require Muslims to seek permission for performing 'namaz' (prayers) on roads, amid a new directive banning RSS activities in public places and government institutions without prior permission.Reacting to the order, Rajanna said he would watch how far it can actually be implemented. “We have to see to what extent it can be implemented,” he said.The former minister, who was sacked a few months ago, emphasised that only rules which can be enforced should be made, otherwise they will remain only in the books.Noting that the government order was based on a letter from minister Priyank Kharge, Rajanna said the minister had only stated that the RSS could hold events in public places after obtaining permission and had never suggested a total ban.“Now, we have Idgah. They (Muslims) offer Namaz on the road only. Do they take permission?

A shifting bloc



2020: Return of vote splits



Same forces, new dynamics



In the 1990s, the powerful ""MY"" (Muslim-Yadav) vote bank propelled Lalu Prasad Yadav to the summit of Bihar politics. Today, as his eldest son Tejashwi Yadav aims to repeat that feat, the crucial question is: which way will Muslim voters swing? With Prashant Kishor 's pledge to field 40 Muslim candidates and Asaduddin Owaisi ’s Grand Democratic Alliance, the answer might be more complex than ever.Filing of nominations for the first phase of polling closed on Friday, with over 1,250 candidates entering the fray for 121 seats to be contested on November 6. The remaining seats will go to the polls on November 11. The NDA, led by chief minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) and the BJP, appears united and confident, while the opposition Mahagathbandhan, comprising the RJD, Congress and Left parties, is struggling with internal rifts and overlapping candidacies.JD(U) has released its complete list of 101 candidates, giving prominence to backward and extremely backward classes, but only four tickets to Muslim candidates. This limited representation has raised questions about whether Nitish Kumar’s party has moved away from its earlier efforts to engage minority voters, given its long-standing alliance with the BJP. In contrast, Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj has pledged to field 40 Muslim candidates, while AIMIM, led by Asaduddin Owaisi, has joined hands with smaller outfits under the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), announcing plans to contest 64 constituencies.The Election Commission’s 2022 caste survey revealed that Muslims make up 17.7% of Bihar’s population, about 23 million people, and hold significant influence in nearly 70 of the state’s 243 constituencies, particularly in Seemanchal districts such as Kishanganj (68%), Katihar (43%), Araria (42%) and Purnia (38%). With multiple parties now targeting the same voter base, the split in the Muslim vote could once again shape the outcome.Muslim voters have historically been pivotal in Bihar’s electoral politics, often voting as a bloc in support of secular coalitions. The 2010, 2015 and 2020 elections reveal how shifts in alliances and vote splits have impacted their representation.In 2010, the RJD fielded the highest number of Muslim candidates at 30, but only six won. Congress performed even worse, with only three of its 49 Muslim candidates winning all from Muslim-majority constituencies like Kishanganj, Kasba and Bahadurganj. The JD(U)-BJP alliance, then riding high on Nitish Kumar’s first term as chief minister, won a large share of seats, including in areas with substantial Muslim populations, mainly due to the consolidation of non-Muslim votes.Five years later, in 2015, the political landscape shifted dramatically. The RJD, JD(U) and Congress came together under the Mahagathbandhan banner, drawing nearly 80% of Muslim votes. This alliance resulted in the election of 24 Muslim MLAs, up from 19 in 2010. The RJD had 12, Congress six, JD(U) five, and the CPI-ML one. Four MLAs came from Muslim-dominated Kishanganj, three each from East Champaran and Purnia, and two each from Araria, Darbhanga and Katihar.Notably, the AIMIM failed to make a mark despite contesting six seats in Seemanchal. The BJP, which had fielded only two Muslim candidates, saw both lose. As RJD’s Abdul Bari Siddiqui pointed out at the time, the increase in Muslim representation was welcome but still fell short of reflecting their 16% population share.The 2015 results reaffirmed the strength of the “MY” (Muslim-Yadav) coalition, long seen as the backbone of RJD’s social base, and marked a period of renewed confidence among minority voters in mainstream alliances.The 2020 assembly election once again saw fragmentation in Muslim voting patterns. The Grand Alliance, now led by Tejashwi Yadav, weakened as Owaisi’s AIMIM gained ground in Seemanchal, winning five seats. Although four of those MLAs later defected to the RJD, AIMIM’s performance underscored its growing appeal among young Muslim voters disillusioned with both the RJD and Congress.The RJD fielded 18 Muslim candidates, out of which eight won, while the Congress had 11 Muslim candidates and managed only four victories. The JD(U), despite being part of the NDA, failed to elect any Muslim MLA. In total, 19 Muslim legislators made it to the assembly, five fewer than in 2015.The 2020 election marked the end of a decade-long trend of consolidation and a return to fragmentation. While the Grand Alliance retained support in several mixed constituencies, AIMIM’s entry in Seemanchal altered traditional vote patterns, cutting into the secular coalition’s base and indirectly benefiting the NDA.As the 2025 election nears, political alignments are shifting. The RJD-Congress alliance remains the largest opposition bloc but is struggling with clear disagreements over seat-sharing. At the same time, AIMIM has formed the Grand Democratic Alliance with Chandrashekhar Azad’s Azad Samaj Party and Swami Prasad Maurya’s AJP, introducing fresh competition for the Muslim vote.Meanwhile, JD(U) and BJP’s joint strategy seems aimed at consolidating the majority vote while conceding limited ground to minorities. With Muslims influencing nearly one-third of Bihar’s constituencies, how this community votes, united or divided, will once again determine not just the number of seats won, but who governs the state.","Muslim voters have historically been pivotal in Bihar’s electoral politics, often voting as a bloc in support of secular coalitions.

'India-China Partners, Not Rivals': PM Modi Stresses 'Strategic Autonomy' In Talks With Xi Jinping

NEW DELHI: China Eastern Airlines will be the first Chinese carrier to resume direct India flights after an over five-year lull with a thrice-weekly service between Shanghai and Delhi from November 9. IndiGo is the first Indian carrier that will resume China service with a daily between Kolkata & Guangzhou from October 26 and then Delhi & Guangzhou from November 10.

What is the case against Mehul Choksi?



A Belgian court on Friday ordered the extradition of fugitive Mehul Choksi to India, news agency PTI reported citing officials. Choksi faces charges related to the massive Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.""The order has come in our favour. The court has termed his arrest by the Belgian authorities on India's request valid. The first legal step in getting him extradited is now clear,"" a senior official told PTI.Officials stated that the order marks a significant validation of India's efforts to secure Mehul Choksi's extradition, although he still has the option to appeal the decision in a higher Belgian court. Prosecutors argued before the court that Choksi poses a flight risk and should not be released from custody, the officials told PTI.Choksi, who relocated to Belgium in 2023 after leaving Antigua and Barbuda, was arrested there in April following India’s extradition request. He and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused of defrauding the bank of over Rs 13,000 crore.India had earlier assured Belgian authorities that if extradited, Choksi will be housed in Barrack No. 12 at Arthur Road jail, Mumbai, with adequate space and no risk of overcrowding or solitary confinement.The Union home ministry, in a September 4 communique, confirmed that the cell meets the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) of Europe’s minimum space standards.Choksi fled to Antigua and Barbuda, where he acquired citizenship, before being apprehended in Belgium. India’s agencies swiftly coordinated to secure his extradition. The cell assigned to Choksi measures roughly 20 by 15 feet, with a separate toilet, ventilation, and security measures. Inmates receive daily cleaning, fresh water, outdoor exercise, board games, yoga sessions, and access to media and telemedicine. Weekly family visits and daily legal consultations are permitted.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused in a Rs 13,000 crore fraud involving fraudulent Letters of Undertaking issued by Punjab National Bank. Nirav Modi, a declared fugitive economic offender, is currently jailed in London and contesting extradition. The CBI’s extradition request cites the UN conventions against corruption and organised crime, supported by arrest warrants from Mumbai courts. The fraud involved PNB issuing 165 LoUs and 58 Foreign Letters of Credit in 2017 without limits or proper records, leading to massive losses covered by the bank.Authorities allege that loans were obtained from overseas banks across locations including Mauritius, Hong Kong, Antwerp, and Frankfurt based on these fraudulent guarantees. When the companies failed to repay, PNB was forced to pay over Rs 6,300 crore, including interest, to these foreign banks.","Fugitive Jeweller Mehul Choksi faces charges related to the massive Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.

Rajnath Singh, Yogi Adityanath Flag Off First Batch of BrahMos Missiles from Lucknow Unit

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday warned Pakistan that every inch of its territory is now within the range of India’s BrahMos missiles, calling Operation Sindoor “just a trailer” of India’s capabilities. The operation showed that victory has become a habit for India, he added.Singh, along with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, flagged off the first batch of BrahMos missiles manufactured at the BrahMos Aerospace unit in Sarojini Nagar, Lucknow.Describing BrahMos as a symbol of India’s rising strength, Singh said, ""BrahMos is not just a missile, it is proof of India's strategic confidence. From the Army to the Navy and the Air Force, it has become a key pillar of our defence forces.""He added that India’s defence capabilities now serve as a strong deterrent. ""Every inch of Pakistan's territory lies within range of BrahMos. What happened during Operation Sindoor was just a trailer. It made Pakistan realise that if India could create Pakistan, then if the time comes... I need not say more, you all are wise enough,"" he said.Operation Sindoor, Singh said, proved that ""victory is not just a small incident for us but it has become a habit.""He said the operation instilled confidence among Indians and demonstrated BrahMos’ effectiveness to the world. ""Maintaining this confidence is now our collective responsibility. The entire world now recognises India's capability. BrahMos has strengthened our belief that India can turn its dreams into reality,"" he said.Operation Sindoor, carried out in May, targeted terror infrastructure and defence installations in Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir on April 22 that killed 26 people. Armed forces used indigenously developed BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to strike Pakistan’s air bases during the operation.On the manufacturing of BrahMos at Lucknow, Singh said the project represents India’s growing confidence and capability in defence production. “Lucknow is not just my parliamentary constituency, it resides in my soul. Today, it has become a city of technology and industry, apart from culture and tradition. The successful production of BrahMos missiles here shows that what was once a dream has now become a reality. The project represents patience, hard work and determination,” he said.UP CM Adityanath said the event is a proud moment for Uttar Pradesh and reflects Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ vision. “Under the Defence Industrial Corridor, Uttar Pradesh is emerging as a major hub of indigenous defence manufacturing. The BrahMos unit is a shining example of that. With a missile like BrahMos, India is now not only able to meet its own security needs but also those of its allies in the world,” he said.The UP CM added that his government is committed to supporting projects that strengthen national security and create employment and technical expertise in the region.Inaugurated on May 11, the state-of-the-art BrahMos Aerospace unit includes facilities for missile integration, testing, and final quality checks. After successful testing, the missiles are prepared for deployment by the armed forces.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh warns Pakistan that every inch of its territory is now within the range of India’s BrahMos missiles.

The seat-sharing surprise

The bargaining power

The kingmaker potential

Beyond caste politics - the youth factor

NEW DELHI: When Ram Vilas Paswan, Bihar's legendary political ""weatherman,"" passed away in 2020, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) seemed at a crossroads. His son, Chirag Paswan, stepped in to lead the party, inheriting both the mantle and the expectations of a Dalit political legacy.Since taking over, Chirag has sought to modernise the party’s image, balance traditional constituency support, and stake a claim in the larger NDA alliance. His induction into the Union cabinet added national credibility and signalled his clout within the NDA. Now, he faces another test, the 2025 Bihar assembly elections — a test of both his leadership and political strategy.However, even before November 14, when votes are counted, Chirag has already emerged as a winner in terms of influence and positioning within the NDA alliance.Chirag’s negotiation skills were on full display during NDA seat-sharing talks. Engaging in multiple rounds of discussions with senior BJP and JD(U) leaders, Chirag held firm on his demands until favourable terms were agreed upon.As a result, LJP(RV) secured 29 seats, making it the largest junior ally in the NDA. As BJP and JD(U) settled for 101 seats each, other smaller allies, Jitan Ram Manjhi's HAM and Upendra Kushwaha's RLM, were allotted only six seats each.This elevated seat share signals Chirag's rising clout in Bihar politics and marks him as a key player in post-election arithmetic, irrespective of the NDA’s overall performance.Chirag Paswan's electoral performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls strengthened his bargaining position. LJP(RV) contested five seats in Bihar and won all five, registering a 100% success rate. The party also secured a nearly 6% statewide vote share, demonstrating that Chirag can mobilise voters beyond the party’s traditional Paswan-Dalit base.In previous assembly elections, LJP(RV) had a mixed record, but the Lok Sabha sweep has cemented Chirag’s reputation as a vote-getter. This electoral credit seems to have not only boosted his confidence during alliance talks but also forced larger NDA partners to accommodate his demands on both the number and strategic importance of constituencies.The BJP is probably looking at Chirag not merely as a junior partner but also as a strategic asset. With chief minister Nitish Kumar seeking a 10th term, the 29 LJP(RV) seats could prove pivotal in government formation.Chirag's willingness to challenge, renegotiate, or even realign his party at short notice adds another layer of influence. Political insiders suggest that the LJP(RV) leader could emerge as a kingmaker, shaping both cabinet formation and NDA’s legislative strategy post-elections.Chirag is working to transform the party’s image, positioning LJP(RV) as a pan-Bihar force rather than a purely caste-based outfit. His ""Bihar First, Bihari First"" campaign is emphasising on development, youth employment and governance reform.The strategy resonated with first-time voters and women, especially in urban and semi-urban pockets, who have traditionally been ambivalent about caste-based politics. If this outreach succeeds, Chirag could translate his traditional base into a broader mandate, enhancing his bargaining power in future coalition politics.With more seats than any other smaller ally, a proven track record in the Lok Sabha, negotiation leverage, kingmaker potential, and a growing voter base beyond his traditional Paswan constituency, Chirag Paswan enters the 2025 Bihar assembly elections as the biggest NDA gainer.","Chirag Paswan has sought to modernise the party’s image, balance traditional constituency support, and stake a claim in the larger NDA alliance.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal (United)-led National Democratic Alliance have a 40 per cent chance of retaining power in the upcoming Bihar election, an opinion poll by C Voter predicted on Friday.According to the poll, Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan came a close second with 38.3 per cent chance of forming the government. Meanwhile, the new entrant in Bihar politics, Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj, came third in the preference list with 13.3 per cent.The scenario, however, changes when it comes to the preferred choice for chief minister. RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav emerged as the most popular face, securing 36.5% support in the opinion polls.He was followed by Prashant Kishor with 23.2%, incumbent chief minister Nitish Kumar with 15.9%, and Chirag Paswan with 8.8%.When asked who can solve Bihar’s problems, 36.5% of respondents chose the Mahagathbandhan, 12.8% opted for Jan Suraaj, 34.3% preferred the NDA, while 9.4% felt that no one could.Earlier, Tejashwi promised a government job for every household in Bihar and pledged to introduce the legislation within just 20 days of taking office.""NDA government could not provide jobs to the youth in 20 years, but we will bring the Act within 20 days of coming to power and also ensure its implementation within 20 months,"" Tejashwi told reporters at his residence.This comes as parties have geared up for what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Seat-sharing talks are in the final stages on all sides. However, constituents of the NDA and the INDIA bloc are grappling with differences over seat-sharing, with smaller allies in both camps jostling for more seats.Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj party declared a list of 51 candidates on Thursday.Amid growing unease in the ruling NDA over the seat sharing, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan reached Patna on Friday and will hold meetings with senior party leaders.According to news agency PTI, sources in the BJP said that the seat-sharing arrangements within the NDA will be finalized in a day or two, and the party will release its first list of candidates soon after that.The JD(U), another alliance partner of the NDA, is also expected to announce its list of candidates very soon, party sources said.According to sources in the NDA, the allies — JD(U) and BJP — are likely to contest 102 and 101 seats, respectively.Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which had earlier settled for around 20–22 seats, is now asking for 45 segments, they said.In the opposition bloc, sources said the RJD is likely to contest 135–140 seats.The party has offered the Congress 50–52 seats, lower than the party’s demand for 70 assembly segments.Sources in the RJD said a meeting of senior party leaders will take place in Patna later in the day to finalize the list of its candidates.In the 2020 assembly polls, the Congress had fought 70 seats but won only 19.The other big constituent of the INDIA bloc, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, also appeared unhappy with the reportedly 20–25 seats being offered to it.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 Assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share with a strike rate of 43.2%. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share and a 33.5% strike rate. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested 7 seats, winning 4, achieving 0.9% of the vote share and a 32.9% strike rate.","BJP, Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan have 40% chance of retaining power.

Bihar Elections: NDA Announces Seat Sharing Deal; BJP, JDU Get 101 Seats Each; LJP(R) Bags 29 Seats

NEW DELHI: The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Saturday announced that it will contest the Bihar assembly elections independently.JMM said it would “review” its alliance with the Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in Jharkhand after the polls in the neighbouring state.Addressing a press conference, JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said, “The party has decided to contest the Bihar polls on its own. It will contest six assembly seats – Chakai, Dhamdaha, Katoria (ST), Manihari (ST), Jamui and Pirpainti (SC).” These seats will go to polls in the second phase on November 11.Elections to the 243-member Bihar assembly will be held in two phases on November 6 and 11, with counting of votes on November 14.Bhattacharya said the JMM had on October 11 informed INDIA bloc leaders that it would decide independently on contesting the Bihar elections if “a respectful number of seats” was not allotted to it by October 14. The party had sought 12 seats as part of the coalition.“We had urged constituents of the INDIA bloc like the Congress, Left parties and the RJD, which is one of the largest parties in Bihar, to provide the seats demanded by the JMM.In the 2019 Jharkhand election, we had given our support to Congress and RJD. The party not only gave seven seats to RJD, but also made its MLA from Chatra a minister,” he said.“Even in the 2024 Jharkhand polls, JMM gave six seats to the RJD and accommodated an MLA as minister,” Bhattacharya added, as quoted by PTI.Commenting on the political scenario in Bihar, Bhattacharya said the contest will be multi-cornered and marked by internal divisions. “The battle of Bihar is a multi-corner fight where infighting prevails in the NDA as well as the INDIA bloc,” he said.“We will fight, win and make sure that without the JMM, no government is formed in Bihar,” he asserted. “And, after the Bihar polls, the JMM will have a relook at the coalition in Jharkhand.”The party also announced a list of 20 “star campaigners” for the Bihar elections, led by its president and Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren.

In the upcoming Bihar assembly election, multiple factors will come into play including caste dynamics, anti-incumbency sentiments, internal rifts in both major coalitions, the emergence of new political players like Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj Party and significant voter-driven issues like unemployment and development.Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in Bihar this year on 6 November and 11 November to elect a total of 243 members. Here are the key factors playing a role:Long-time chief minister Nitish Kumar, at the forefront for nearly two decades, faces increasing anti-incumbency sentiment and voter fatigue with his shifting alliances also raising questions about his credibility.RJD's leader Tejashwi Yadav is gaining popularity, particularly among the youth, by focusing on issues like jobs and migration. He was named the Mahagathbandhan's chief ministerial candidate, though some question his leadership experience and the party's legacy.The NDA government faces considerable anti-incumbency, but this is among the opposition, potentially neutralizing its effect. Both alliances are relying on welfare schemes to sway voters.The election features a close contest between the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the opposition INDIA bloc (Mahagathbandhan).Both major coalitions are dealing with internal conflicts over seat-sharing.The NDA has seen tensions between the BJP and JD(U), partly due to past actions involving Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), who was allegedly used as a 'vote-cutter' against chief minister Nitish Kumar in 2020 but is now a key NDA ally.Meanwhile, the Mahagathbandhan is seeing infighting, with candidates from its member parties, such as the RJD and Congress, contesting against each other in some constituencies.Traditionally, the NDA has relied on support from upper castes, non-Yadav OBCs, and Mahadalits, while the Mahagathbandhan has depended on a Muslim-Yadav (MY) vote bank.However, voting patterns are becoming more fluid. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Mahagathbandhan made inroads into the Scheduled Caste (SC) vote by focusing on social justice issues and reservations.The Dalit vote, which makes up 20% of the electorate, is complex and fragmented among different sub-castes. While some sub-castes align with the NDA through leaders like Chirag Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi, others are shifting toward the Mahagathbandhan.Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj Party (JSP) has emerged as a potential disruptor by appealing to youth and educated voters on a platform of development and non-traditional caste politics.Once among India’s most sought-after election strategists, Prashant however announced that he would stay away from contesting this year’s Bihar polls — a decision he said was taken 'in the larger interest' of his Jan Suraaj Party.His sharp criticism targets both NDA and Mahagathbandhan leaders, challenging their credibility and governance. He has described this election as a make-or-break moment for his party, stating it will either finish first or last, leaving no middle ground.Meanwhile, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has announced the launch of a new third front — the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA). The alliance brings together AIMIM, Chandrasekhar Azad’s Azad Samaj Party (ASP) and Swami Prasad Maurya’s Apna Janata Party (AJP). It plans to field candidates in at least 64 of the 243 constituencies.A recent statewide caste census found that Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) constitute over 63% of the population. This has intensified the focus on caste-based mobilization.Bihar's total population of approximately 13.07 crore is divided along caste lines as follows: Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) constitute about 36.01%, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) 27.12%, Scheduled Castes (SCs) 19.65%, Scheduled Tribes (STs) 1.68%, and General Category about 15.38%.BJP leans on upper-caste blocs, Brahmins, Rajputs, Bhumihars and Kayasthas, who, while a minority, wield outsized influence. However, the party, which is aiming to be self-sufficient in Bihar without relying heavily on the JDU alliance, has broadened its outreach to non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs by elevating leaders from those groups and secured roughly 30% of votes in recent contests through this social mix.The Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) in Bihar faces a complex caste and electoral landscape shaped by the state's diverse demographic composition. Together, this Muslim-Yadav combination makes up more than 30% of the electorate supporting RJD. The Indian National Congress garners support mainly from upper castes, some OBC sub-groups, and urban voters, forming a moderate but significant segment of the Mahagathbandhan.A major concern for voters is high unemployment and the ongoing out-migration of youth seeking better job prospects elsewhere.Both alliances have made ambitious economic promises that critics say the state budget can barely afford, raising questions about their feasibility.Women are emerging as a distinct voting bloc, with the NDA seeing stronger support among women voters partly due to welfare schemes.Bihar's significant Muslim population remains a decisive force, with the Mahagathbandhan largely backed by Muslim voters. However, AIMIM and JSP could potentially divide this vote.","Bihar will vote in two phases - 6 and 11 November. The election features a close contest between the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the opposition INDIA bloc (Mahagathbandhan) The Dalit vote, which makes up 20% of the electorate, is complex and fragmented among different sub-castes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124664342,imgsize-1464562,width-400,resizemode-4/october-17-2.jpg"

Can NDA hold its fort?

BJP's development push for the region

Ministers, stars in the polls fray

Mahagathbandhan's resistance

NEW DELHI: In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, despite the consecration of the Ram temple in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost the Faizabad seat to the Samajwadi Party . However, it retained all the seats in Bihar's Mithilanchal, considered the paternal home of Sita, Lord Ram’s wife.As Bihar gears up for the assembly elections, Patna may hold the throne, but the two Maithili-speaking regions — Tirhut and Mithilanchal — remain crucial.Bihar can be divided into five regions: Tirhut, Mithilanchal, Kosi-Seemanchal, Magadh, and Bhojpur. Tirhut and Mithlanchal send about 80 MLAs to the 243-member assembly.The Mithilanchal region consists of Madhubani, Darbhanga, Samastipur, Saharsa, and Supaul districts, where Maithil Brahmins, Yadavs, Extremely Backward Caste communities, Dalits, and Muslims are the key communities.Mithilanchal is considered a bastion of the NDA, which secured a narrow victory in 2020 due to its strong performance in this region. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, BJP and JD(U) outperformed RJD and Congress, claiming all seven Lok Sabha seats in the region.However, in the 2015 assembly polls, JD(U), as an ally of the RJD-Congress Mahagathbandhan, had won the maximum seats in this region with 19 seats, followed by RJD with 14, while Congress managed 11.The rest were won by other parties. BJP had won 18 seats in this region.Ahead of the upcoming elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party has long focused on this region, emphasising developmental policies. In August this year, Union Home Minister Amit Shah laid the foundation stone and performed Bhumi Pujan for the new Mata Janki Temple at Punauradham in Sitamarhi, which will be completed at a cost of more than Rs 883 crore across 67 acres.He also flagged off the New Delhi–Sitamarhi Amrit Bharat Express train.In 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation for a new civil enclave at Darbhanga airport, with Rs 912 crore allotted for its development.In the 2025 Union Budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the setting up of a Makhana Board in Bihar to support production, processing, and global marketing. Interestingly, the nine key districts in the Mithila region that are major Makhana cultivation hubs are Darbhanga, Madhubani, Purnea, Katihar, Saharsa, Supaul, Araria, Kishanganj, and Sitamarhi.In 2024, PM Modi also laid the foundation stone for the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Darbhanga, the second AIIMS facility in Bihar after the state capital, Patna. AIIMS Darbhanga will be built at an estimated cost of Rs 1,264 crore on 187 acres of land.Cabinet ministers are in the poll fray from this region, including Jibesh Mishra from Jale, Sanjay Saraogi from Darbhanga, Krishna Kumar Mantoo from Amnour, and Bijaendra Prasad Yadav from Supaul. Meanwhile, fresh face like folk singer Maithili Thakur has also been fielded by BJP from Alinagar in the region. She has been fielded from Alipur seat.On the other hand, the Mahagathbandhan is actively campaigning to improve its prospects in the region. Congress and RJD’s Voter Adhikar Yatra covered a major part of Mithilanchal, where leaders campaigned against chief minister Nitish Kumar and Prime Minister Modi. However, the campaign suffered a dent after abuses were allegedly hurled at PM Modi during the final leg of the yatra in Darbhanga, leading to a political showdown.RJD's Rabri Devi has also demanded statehood for the Mithila region. The creation of a “Mithilanchal” state is a demand raised intermittently by cultural activists of the region, though it has received only tepid support at times.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections . The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and achieved 0.9% of the vote share.","Mithilanchal is considered a bastion of the NDA, which secured a narrow victory in 2020 due to its strong performance in this region.

Left's striking show in 2020



Muslim & communist: Bihar's own Zohran Mamdani



Raising alarm on SIR



NEW DELHI: In Bihar’s ever-colorful political arena, where alliances shift as swiftly as monsoon clouds, the 2020 Assembly elections offered a rare sight — a showdown between saffron and red. The state, known for its complex caste equations and coalition compulsions, witnessed an unexpected surge from the Left, shaking up the familiar power equations.In 2020, the Left parties, particularly the CPI(ML), emerged as a formidable force, almost matching the BJP ’s strike rate and outperforming the larger allies within the Mahagathbandhan.Five years later, as Bihar heads to the polls again, the Left finds itself in a familiar spot, pushing for a fairer share in seat distribution, even as negotiations within the alliance remain uncertain. With no seat-sharing deal announced yet, CPI(ML) released a list of 20 candidates, with its general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya expressing that they ""deserved more"".But is their demand for greater seat-share is justified?With a strike rate of 63.2%, CPI (ML) was not far behind the BJP, which had a strike rate of 67.3%. It won 12 of the 19 seats it contested. Moreover, the Communist Party of India (CPI) had a strike rate of 33.33%.CPI and CPM contested six and four seats respectively, and one two each.The Left parties, undoubtedly gave a tough fight to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The then CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury had expressed that the Left would have performed better had it been given higher number of seats.The Left parties contested on 29 of 243 seats and won 16, pulling off a combined strike rate of over 50%.Five years later, one would wonder that the Mahagathbandhan would ensure a ""dignified"" seat share for the Left parties. With no announcement on the same yet, the situation doesn't look promising this time as well.Dipankar Bhattacharya said the party has fielded 20 candidates in the ""spirit of the coalition"", however, they wanted at least 24.""We have maintained the spirit of coalition. Although we deserved more seats this time, we finally decided to contest only 20 assembly segments. We wanted to contest at least 24 seats this time, but it could not be materialised,"" he said.Moreover, similar sentiments were expressed by CPI leader D Raja noting the party's ""great history in Bihar"".""We will try to get more seats. If other parties are demanding, our party has a great history in Bihar and it has a widespread presence and organisational strength and our party can decide the political course in different district. So we should get reasonable number of seats,"" he had said.Muslim, communist and the poorest of them all, CPI (ML)'s Mahboob Alam was everything a mainstream party avoids its candidate to be. Alam went on to bag Balrampur seat emerging victorious with one of the highest vote margins.The five-time MLA's success, however, did not translate into a tangible result, as this year, BJP did not include a single Muslim in its 101 candidate list. Moreover, its ally JD(U) too distanced itself from Muslim voters as it named only four minority candidates in its list.CPI(ML)-Liberation has been vocal about the SIR (Special Intensive Revision) exercise, arguing that the deletions from the voter list reveal a disturbing pattern of social exclusion. According to the party’s general secretary, Dipankar Bhattacharya, the cuts disproportionately affect vulnerable sections such as women, the poor, migrant workers, Dalits, and Muslims.He pointed out that the districts with the highest number of deletions — Gopalganj, Kishanganj, and Purnia — include Muslim-majority and Dalit-dominated areas, suggesting that these were not mere technical errors but a deliberate pattern of marginalization.","The Left parties contested on 29 of 243 seats and won 16, pulling off a combined strike rate of over 50%.

Jitan Manjhi

, Bihar NDA’s ‘Mountain Man’?

NEW DELHI: Since November 2005, Bihar has had only two chief ministers — Nitish Kumar and Jitan Ram Manjhi. The office has become almost synonymous with Kumar, who has now held it continuously for nearly 20 years.Yet, when Kumar temporarily stepped aside — for only nine months, as it turned out — he chose Manjhi as his successor. Today, the two no longer share that closeness, the trust, or a party, but remain in the same alliance. And Manjhi, a regional party leader whose support can still tilt the balance in favour of the state’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), continues to matter.The 81-year-old is a seasoned politician whose career spans over four decades. He began in 1980 with the Congress and later joined the Janata Dal, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and Janata Dal (United) before founding his own party, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) [HAM(S)].A former seven-time MLA, Manjhi has served in multiple Bihar governments and currently represents Gaya in the Lok Sabha. He is also the Union Minister of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in the BJP-led NDA’s central government.However, his biggest political breakthrough came in 2014, when he became the chief minister of Bihar.In February 2015, Manjhi had a bitter fallout with Kumar and the JD(U). Kumar had resigned as Bihar CM in May 2014, taking responsibility for the party’s poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections, where it won only 2 of Bihar’s 40 seats.However, within months, Manjhi was asked to step down to allow Kumar’s return. He initially resisted, but after being expelled from the JD(U), he tendered his resignation days later. Soon after, in May 2015, he launched the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) .Since then, the two leaders have been on-and-off allies, primarily within the NDA.The party has contested four elections so far - three as an NDA constituent and one as an ally of the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan (part of Congress-led United Progressive Alliance nationally).The party has been given 6 seats to contest in the upcoming elections, significantly fewer than the 15 seats it had initially demanded.Though the HAM(S) has a relatively small vote share, under 2 per cent, Manjhi’s position as a sitting Mahadalit Union minister could give the NDA a crucial advantage in a closely contested election dominated by just two major alliances, and in a state where caste dynamics remain decisive. In 2020, fewer than 12,000 votes separated the winners (NDA: 125 seats) from the runners-up (Mahagathbandhan: 110 seats).Manjhi’s identity and influence among Mahadalits could help the NDA gain ground against the RJD-Congress-Left alliance, which has already announced a 10-point manifesto for Extremely Backward Classes ahead of its full election agenda. He belongs to the Musahar community, part of the Mahadalit category (within the Dalits) introduced in 2007. According to the 2022 Bihar caste census, Dalits account for roughly 20 per cent of the state’s 13 crore population.Beyond caste-based support, he could also bolster the ruling alliance's prospects in the Magadh region, where he represents the Gaya Lok Sabha seat. This region includes 26 assembly constituencies, six of which fall under Gaya, giving him potential influence over multiple seats.For the NDA, every percentage point counts. And in a state where caste equations can tilt outcomes, Jitan Ram Manjhi’s modest but strategic influence could well prove the difference between holding power and losing the mountain.The Bihar assembly elections are scheduled for November 6 and 11, with vote counting on November 14.","The 81-year-old is a seasoned politician whose career spans over four decades.

NEW DELHI: A video showing the challenges of walking on Indian footpaths, especially for parents and pedestrians, has gone viral on social media.The 32-second clip, posted on Thursday by Canadian content creator and podcaster Caleb Friesen, shows him navigating a baby stroller along a footpath and highlighted the reality of being a pedestrian parent in India.In the video, Friesen struggles to manoeuvre the stroller around obstacles including electrical poles, power junction boxes and other common footpath obstructions.Sharing the video on X, he sarcastically listed the “descending order of importance” for things found on Indian footpaths, placing pedestrians and parents with strollers at the bottom. The list goes as:Friesen confirmed that the location was a footpath on 100 Feet Road in Bangalore. Explaining the issue further, he told one user that the problem was not the bollards, which prevent two-wheelers from entering the footpath, but the massive power junction boxes occupying half the space.The post has drawn widespread attention, garnering over 230K views. Many users empathised with Friesen’s experience, sharing their own struggles navigating uneven or blocked footpaths in Indian cities.One user wrote, “It’s brave of you to do this experiment. Last week in Pune, my father tried to roll a suitcase on the footpath and slipped because it got stuck in a pothole.Tier-1 cities don’t even provide a seamless 100m path.”Another user cautioned him, “For your kid’s safety, please avoid walking on the footpath. Better safe than sorry.”This is not Friesen’s first post highlighting footpath hazards. Last month, he shared a video of his 2.4 km walk from Majestic bus stand to a nearby Starbucks, pointing out obstacles such as tunnel juice, barbed wire, desire paths, bushwhacking, pavement pudding and a stairwell into a drain.Despite his wry commentary, he emphasised that his intention is not to criticise India but to raise awareness. He said: “I don’t just want to criticise India, I care deeply about this country.”",A video showing the challenges of walking on Indian footpaths has gone viral on social media.

Waqf Golden Visa: The UAE eyeing for strategic significance

Looking ahead: How to get started

Awqaf Dubai – for donation guidelines and nomination

GDRFA Smart Services – for Golden Visa application

Nearest Amer Centre in Dubai – for in-person support and document submission.





In a landmark initiative that underscores the UAE’s growing emphasis on humanitarianism and social sustainability, the country has announced that donors to Islamic endowments known as Waqf will now be eligible for the coveted UAE Golden Visa.The decision was unveiled following a strategic agreement signed between the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs – Dubai (GDRFA-Dubai) and the Endowments and Minors Affairs Foundation (Awqaf Dubai). The announcement came during GITEX GLOBAL 2025, one of the region’s largest technology and innovation exhibitions, held at the Dubai World Trade Centre.The initiative now enables both UAE residents and international donors to obtain a 10-year renewable Golden Visa under the specific category of “Financial Supporters of Humanitarian Work”, as clearly laid out in Cabinet Resolution No. 65 of 2022. The move is specifically aimed at encouraging high-impact charitable giving, positioning Dubai as a global hub of generosity, tolerance, and community-driven innovation.Officials say the Golden Visa will not just serve as a token of appreciation for philanthropists, but also as a strategic tool to attract global supporters of sustainable humanitarian work worldwide.“This agreement represents a pioneering model of government integration that empowers endowers to play a vital role in community development,” said Lt.Gen. Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of GDRFA-Dubai.Waqf, in Islamic tradition, refers to a perpetual charitable endowment. This could be in the form of land, buildings, cash, or other valuable assets set aside for public benefit—such as supporting education, healthcare, or religious institutions. The key feature of Waqf is that once donated, the asset cannot be sold or inherited. Instead, it is managed sustainably, with its revenue used for community development.In the UAE, Waqf is regulated and promoted by Awqaf Dubai, which ensures all endowments are Sharia-compliant, transparent, and channelled into meaningful causes.To qualify for the Golden Visa under this new category, donors must fulfil several conditions:According to officials, the scheme is expected to boost charitable contributions while offering donors several tangible benefits:Awqaf Dubai Secretary-General Ali Mohammed Al Mutawa called the initiative a “natural extension of Dubai’s vision to position endowment work as a key partner in sustainable development.”The Golden Visa scheme for Waqf donors is being seen as a forward-thinking policy that not only aligns with Islamic charitable values but also resonates with the UAE’s long-term vision of sustainable, human-centered growth.It also broadens the appeal of the Golden Visa, which is already available to investors, scientists, entrepreneurs, and outstanding professionals in fields like medicine and engineering.Officials believe the latest addition will attract global philanthropists, foster cross-border partnerships in social development, and further establish the UAE as a beacon of generosity and inclusive progress.With this move, the UAE is reinforcing its commitment to becoming a global humanitarian capital.

“The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”

“So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition.

So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”

“We are not chasing a target. We'll continue to evaluate everyone after all the investment in learning and development that we've done…..” he continued.





Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant.

We are currently at 1%, and we will continue to evaluate people whom we can redeploy -- whom we are not redeploy, and those are the people that we will release.”During the earnings call, TCS HR chief also talked about the new H-1B visa rule announced by Trump administration last month. Kunnumal said “...on H1B, we have significantly localized our workforce in the U.S. approximately just about 500 associates have traveled to the U.S. on H1B. We believe our business model will be able to adapt quickly to any changes in immigration policy.” US announced an annual fee of $100,000 on H-1B visa applications from September 21 onwards.Separately, the company has also announced a wage hike for over 80 percentage of our workforce with the effect from September 1.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant.

AI’s real value lies ahead







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu is the next to join the ongoing ‘AI bubble’ debate. Vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments. He described the market as a ‘financial bubble’ that could distort long-term innovation. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Vembu said that while AI holds enormous promise, the present wave of huge valuations and funding practices are becoming a cause on concern. “This boom makes me very uncomfortable,” he said. “While AI as a technology has enormous promise, much of today’s investment is speculative.”Along with this, Vembu also pointed to a round-tripping which a financial manoeuvre where companies fund each other to inflate revenue. This practice as per Vembu is a troubling trend for the AI sector. He further warned that such practices could lead to unsustainable valuations which is smilier to the past bubbles in dotcom and e-commerce. “Some people argue the multi-trillion-dollar valuations will be justified by productivity gains. But why aren’t those gains visible already?” he asked.However, despite all these concerns, Vembu stressed on the fact that the underlying technology of AI remains valuable and will continue to deliver real benefits in the long term.He advocates for measured, purpose-driven investment rather than hype-fueled speculation. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos may have agreed with Sam Altman over ‘AI Bubble’ warningRecently, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also pointed out that the current surge of investment in artificial intelligence (AI) constitutes an “industrial bubble” but stressed that the underlying technology is ""real"" and will bring immense societal benefits. Similar comments have been previously made by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who reportedly said earlier this year that he believes AI could be in a bubble but it’s “the most important thing to happen in a very long time”.“This is a kind of industrial bubble,” the Amazon founder said while speaking at Italian Tech Week.“The second thing that happens is that people get very excited like they are today about artificial intelligence,” Bezos added, noting that when they happen, stock prices are “disconnected from the fundamentals” of a business. He said that during bubbles, every experiment or idea gets funded.“The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas. And that’s also probably happening today,” Bezos said.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

High gold and silver prices had little effect on festive shopping this Dhanteras , with sales matching last year’s volumes and rising by more than 25% in value.Shoppers across the country flocked to stores to buy coins and lightweight jewellery, driven by hopes that prices will keep climbing.Industry executives said gold and silver coins were the top choice for many buyers this year as people saw them as a smart investment and a way to avoid the higher making charges on jewellery.Ten-gram, 24-carat gold coins , priced at around Rs 1.40 lakh each, were especially popular, according to ET.Jewellery sales were led by lightweight pieces in 22- and 18-carat gold, while younger customers opted for more affordable 9- and 14-carat options.Surendra Mehta, national secretary of India Bullion & Jewellers Association said, “There was a good rush, with queues in Mumbai's Zaveri Bazar to buy gold and silver coins. The trend from Saturday morning indicates trade will be able to achieve gold volumes of the previous Dhanteras.”Many shoppers had earlier postponed purchases, expecting prices to fall. But with no sign of a correction and indicators pointing to new highs, demand surged.“Now that there is no sign of a correction in prices and all economic indicators are pointing towards fresh highs, people have come out to purchase gold,” Colin Shah, managing director, Kama Jewelry, told ET.Jewellers also noticed growing interest from investors. “Despite record high gold prices , we are witnessing renewed enthusiasm this festive season. Consumers are viewing price volatility as a strategic opportunity to reinvest — whether through gold coins or by upgrading jewellery,” said Ajoy Chawla, CEO of Tanishq.Last year, India sold 39 tonnes of gold on Dhanteras. This year, the Muhurat spans two days, 18 and 19 October. Gold and silver were sold at Friday’s closing prices of Rs 1,34,800 per 10 gm and Rs 1,74,306 per kg, respectively, plus 3% GST, ET reported.Prices have risen sharply over the past year, with gold up 65% and silver up 81% since the last Dhanteras. Retailers in many areas even ran short of coins as demand exceeded expectations. “The trend shows that we will surpass last year Dhanteras sales both by volume and value,” said Baby George, CEO of Joyalukkas.Southern India, which accounts for over 40% of the country’s annual gold consumption of 800–850 tonnes, remained the largest market. But strong coin demand was seen across the country, showing how consumers are adapting their buying patterns in response to price trends.",High gold and silver prices had little effect on festive shopping this Dhanteras.

Political standoff hardens





The federal government shutdown in the United States is moving closer to becoming the second longest in history, with no signs of a breakthrough. Some lawmakers have even warned that it could soon surpass the record 35-day shutdown that took place during US President Donald Trump’s first term.The standoff began on October 1.The Trump administration is using the shutdown to advance its priorities and cut funding for programmes it opposes, while Democrats insist that any funding deal must include support for millions of Americans who risk losing health insurance or facing steep premium increases if Congress fails to act.Here's how it has affected workers, economy and government services:As of March 31, the federal government employed around 2.3 million civilian workers. Each day, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, about 750,000 of them are furloughed, forced to stay home without pay until the shutdown ends.Others are considered “excepted” and continue working in essential services.Both groups will eventually be paid retroactively, but many could miss a full paycheck later this month after already receiving only a partial one for late September.Active-duty military personnel, roughly 1.3 million people, narrowly avoided missing their pay on Wednesday, after Trump ordered the Pentagon to redirect funds, according to AP.However, officials say another temporary fix is unlikely.The CBO estimates that paying furloughed workers who are not working is costing the government about $400 million a day.In a break from how previous administrations have handled shutdowns, the current Republican administration is moving to lay off thousands of federal employees in departments it considers low priority. A first round of job cuts affecting 4,100 workers has already been announced, with the biggest reductions at the Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education, and Housing and Urban Development departments.White House budget chief Russ Vought told “The Charlie Kirk Show” that more layoffs are coming.“I think we’ll probably end up being north of 10,000,” Vought said, as quoted by AP.“We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy,” he added. “Not just the funding, but the bureaucracy, that we now have an opportunity to do that.”Lawmakers admit many federal employees live paycheck to paycheck. Food banks in some communities have increased support, with the Capital Area Food Bank announcing extra food distributions in the Washington region from Monday to help federal workers and contractors.Economists warn that the longer the shutdown continues, the greater the economic fallout. Oxford Economics estimates that each week of the shutdown cuts US economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points. A full-quarter shutdown, which has never happened before, could reduce growth by 1.2 to 2.4 percentage points.Tourism is among the worst-hit sectors. The US Travel Association expects losses of around $1 billion a week as visitors cancel trips to national parks, historical landmarks and Washington DC Many public sites, including Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, remain shut for visitors.Air travel is feeling the strain as well. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported shortages of air traffic controllers in cities including Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Houston. Flight delays have spread to airports in Nashville, Dallas, Newark and other locations.Small businesses are also affected. The US Chamber of Commerce expects the Small Business Administration normally backs around $860 million in loans for about 1,600 small firms each week, but new loans have stopped. The shutdown has also delayed mortgage approvals and property transactions by freezing the issue and renewal of flood insurance policies.Neither side appears willing to compromise. Historically, the party that ties funding bills to demands rarely gets its way, as Republicans experienced in 2013 and 2018.Public opinion is divided. A poll by The Associated Press–NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that six in ten US adults blame Trump and congressional Republicans “a great deal” or “quite a bit” for the shutdown, while 54% also hold Democrats responsible.The administration has frozen about $18 billion for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River and an extension of New York City’s Second Avenue subway. It also cancelled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants across 16 states that backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the last presidential election. Officials say these moves are unrelated to the shutdown.Negotiations remain stuck. Republicans want health care talks to happen only after the government fully reopens. “We’re not conducting negotiations in a hostage situation,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-SD.House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said Democrats “are not going to bend and we’re not going to break because we are standing up for the American people.”","The federal government shutdown in the United States is moving closer to becoming the second longest in history. Some lawmakers have even warned that it could soon surpass the record 35-day shutdown that took place during US President Donald Trump's first term. As of March 31, the federal government employed around 2.3 million civilian workers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124681537,imgsize-167576,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

'Had detailed discussions with Taliban foreign minister'







NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Thursday sharply criticised Pakistan over its recent hostilities with Afghanistan, while emphasising India’s commitment to Afghanistan’s sovereignty.Speaking on the tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan. ""In recent weeks, Pakistan has carried out targeted strikes in Kabul and other Taliban-controlled areas following a series of violent attacks by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Pakistani territory.The Taliban government had then launched the offensive in ""retaliation for air strikes carried out by the Pakistani army on Kabul.""The Taliban had carried out operations along parts of the border with Pakistan, prompting Islamabad to promise a strong response.A 48-hour ceasefire between Afghanistan and Pakistan took hold late on Wednesday.The Pakistan Taliban operates independently of Afghanistan’s Taliban, but the two groups share ideological alignment. Pakistan has accused Kabul of giving shelter to TTP leaders and other groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the ISIL affiliate in Khorasan Province (ISKP).TTP attacks have increased sharply since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, reflecting a growing trend in violence.During Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi's recent visit to India, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had announced that India will upgrade its technical mission in Afghanistan to a full embassy.When asked about the development and India’s stand on recognising Afghanistan’s Taliban government, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We had detailed discussions with foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi covering humanitarian aid, development cooperation, and upgrading our embassy. We donated 20 ambulances and plan further work in Afghanistan’s health sector. The transition of our technical mission in Kabul into a full embassy will take place in the coming days.
