PM Modi Calls For Self-Reliance As Tensions With U.S. Continue; Lauds GST Reforms | WATCH

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said India must chart its own path of development rooted in its sanatan values to overcome challenges amid US decisions on tariffs and immigration.Speaking at a book launch event, Bhagwat said the present situation confronting India and the world is the result of a ""fragmented vision of development and happiness"" that has dominated for the past 2,000 years. ""We can't turn our backs on the situation. We must do whatever is necessary to get out of it well. But we can't proceed blindly. We need to chart our own path,"" he said.""So we need to chart our own path. We will find a way out. But inevitably, we will have to face all these things at some or other point in future again. Because in this fragmented vision, there is an 'I' and the rest of the world, or 'we' and 'them',"" he added.Outlining India's traditional outlook, Bhagwat stressed the four goals of life — artha (wealth), kama (desire and pleasure), and moksha (salvation) bound by dharma.The RSS chief also recalled a conversation with ""a gentleman from America"" three years ago about Indo-US cooperation, where the emphasis was repeatedly on safeguarding ""American interests.""Bhagwat said such self-serving approaches inevitably fuel conflict.""Everyone has different interests. So, conflict will continue. Then again, it's not just the nation's interests that matter. I also have an interest. I want everything in my hands,"" Bhagwat said.""The one who is at the top of the food chain will eat everybody, and living at the bottom of the food chain is a crime,"" he added.On environmental commitments, Bhagwat said India has been the only nation to consistently fulfil its pledges. ""If we had to fight in every confrontation, we would have been fighting continuously from 1947 to today. But we endured, we prevented war, and even helped those who opposed us,"" he added.Bhagwat said if the country aspires to become a vishwaguru (global teacher) and vishwamitra (friend of the world), it must embrace its traditional worldview.""If we want to manage this, we will have to think from our own perspective. Fortunately, our country's outlook is traditional. This outlook on life is not old; it is 'sanatan' (eternal). It is shaped by the experiences of our ancestors over thousands of years,"" he said.""Our approach hasn't cancelled artha and kama. On the contrary, it's compulsory in life. The four goals of life include wealth and work. But it's bound by Dharma. Dharma doesn't mean method of worship.""And the law that oversees all this is natural law, ensuring that no one is left behind. Follow it. Follow its discipline,"" he added.","Mohan Bhagwat says India must chart its own path of development rooted in its sanatan values to overcome challenges.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu can't expect the Centre to relent on Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan funding while stubbornly refusing to accept the National Education Policy (NEP), Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Sunday while accusing the DMK govt of ""imposing its political priorities"" on students by sticking to its two-language formula.""I have said this repeatedly in the state, and also in the Parliament, that our country has adopted NEP.

PM Modi Calls For Self-Reliance As Tensions With U.S. Continue; Lauds GST Reforms | WATCH

NEW DELHI: Congress lashed out at govt on Sunday, alleging that PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation on Sunday evening to claim ""sole ownership"" of amendments made to GST regime by GST Council. Calling the latest reforms ""inadequate"", the party said the PM's talk of a ""savings festival of Rs 2.5 lakh crore"" was like ""applying band-aid after inflicting deep wounds"".The party has sought that govt apologise to the public for imposing GST on essential items. In a post on X, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge criticised the PM by citing a Hindi proverb, 'nau sau choohe khakar billi haj ko chali' ('After committing many sins, the cat goes on a pilgrimage'). ""Instead of the simple and efficient GST of Congress, your govt imposed 'Gabbar Singh Tax' by collecting from nine different slabs and collected more than Rs 55 lakh crore in eight years,"" he alleged.""Now you are talking about putting a simple band-aid after inflicting deep wounds on the public by talking about a 'savings festival' of Rs 2.5 lakh crore! The public will never forget that you collected GST on pulses, rice, grains, pencils, books, treatment, farmers' tractors, etc.Your govt should apologise to the public!"" he added.Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, said, ""PM addressed the nation today to claim sole ownership of the amendments made to GST regime by GST Council, a constitutional body."" He went on to say that Congress has long argued that GST has been a ""Growth Suppressing Tax"". ""We have been demanding a GST 2.0 since July 2017. This was a key pledge made in our 'Nyay Patra' for 2024 Lok Sabha elections,"" he added.Holding that the latest ""GST reforms are inadequate"", Ramesh stressed that the key demand of states ""made in true spirit of cooperative federalism - namely, extension of compensation for another five years to fully protect their revenues - remains unaddressed"".In a scathing attack posted on X, Congress' Supriya Shrinate said, ""Modi ji is cursing the old GST as if someone else had implemented it. You yourself imposed Gabbar Singh Tax and collected it for eight years. Have you forgotten?""Other outstanding issues enumerated by Ramesh include widespread concerns of MSMEs that, he said, must be ""addressed meaningfully"". ""Sectoral issues that have surfaced - for instance in textiles, tourism, exporters, handicrafts and agricultural inputs - must be tackled,"" he said, adding, ""States should be incentivised to move towards introduction of state-level GST to cover electricity, alcohol, petroleum, and real estate as well. """"Whether this round of GST changes - delayed by eight years - will actually boost private investment that is essential for higher GDP growth remains to be seen. Meanwhile, trade deficit with China has doubled in past five years to cross $100 billion.

"'We are lost': Indian-origin businessman Paramjit Singh, living in US for 30 years, detained by ICE; offence is using pay phone without paying in past",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-are-lost-indian-origin-businessman-paramjit-singh-living-in-us-for-30-years-detained-by-ice-offence-is-using-pay-phone-without-paying-in-past/articleshow/123946264.cms,"Newsweek

Poll Do you think Paramjit's detention is justified based on his past infraction? Yes, he should face consequences. No, the punishment is too harsh.

Kept inside airport for five days, taken to emergency room

'We are lost,' says Paramjit's brother





Paramjit Singh, an Indian who immigrated to the US more than 30 years ago, has been detained by the ICE and kept in custody for over a month now. Paramjit is a green card holder and has been doing business in Fort Wayne, Indiana, for the last three decades. He was detained at Chicago O'Hare Airport on July 30 as he was returning from a trip to India, as he makes trips to India several times a year.Singh's attorney Luis Angeles toldthat his detention was absolutely illegal and that the government is increasing his health risks as Singh has a brain tumor and heart issues.But why was Singh arrested in the first place? His attorney and family members said that the government cited an incident from the past when Singh used a pay phone without paying. It was a ""minor infraction for which he has already taken full accountability, served his time, and paid his debt to society,"" Angeles said.Also read: EB-5 investment visa cap reached for 2025, green card route paused till September 30 Narrating the harrowing details of what happened since Singh was detained, his family members revealed that he was kept inside the airport for five days. His health condition deteriorated to the point where he had to be taken to the emergency room. His family was not notified about his health and they only came to know when the ER bill was sent to them.""As a lawful permanent resident (green card holder), Mr Singh should never have been detained in the first place, as he has always followed the rules to the letter. We often hear the mantra of ""follow the rules"" to achieve legal status in this country. Well, that's exactly what he did: he entered the United States lawfully, adjusted his status properly, built his American dream through hard work, and has been a significant contributor to his community,"" his attorney said.Paramjit’s brother Charanjit Singh told WPTA that they were trying to post the bond after he won the bond hearing, but alleged that the DHS was using delaying tactics to keep him in detention. ""We're just trying to post the bond, we're just trying to speak to someone, trying to communicate with someone. We're lost,"" the brother said.","Paramjit Singh, an Indian who immigrated to the US more than 30 years ago, has been detained by the ICE and kept in custody for over a month now.

"Appointed, ignored & unpaid: Meet India's 'invisible' teachers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/appointed-ignored-unpaid-meet-indias-invisible-teachers/articleshow/124033011.cms,"In 1983, Md Aftab Alam was hired as a regular college lecturer - on paper. Forty-two years later, he's still waiting for his first salary. The appointment letter, issued by Sanjay Gandhi Mahila College in Gaya, promised pay and service conditions on a par with university faculty. What followed was four decades of unpaid teaching, no employee ID, no pension - just a man showing up to class every day with a PhD and no payslip.""I taught, I evaluated papers, I invigilated exams,"" he said. ""But officially, it's as if I was never there."" His only proof is a fading sheet of paper from 1983 and a lifetime of unacknowledged labour.Last month, in a sharply worded verdict, Supreme Court ruled that 18 assistant professors in Gujarat - hired on contract and paid far less than their regular colleagues - had been denied basic constitutional protections. The bench, led by Justice Abhay S Oka, invoked a line familiar to nearly every Indian classroom: ""Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara."" The words, the court said, mean little if teachers are paid a pittance. Alam and thousands of haplesss teachers like him would know.The truth is harder than what the verdict suggests: in places far from Gujarat, and in classrooms that do not appear in affidavits, teachers still work for Rs 3,000 a month.Or Rs 1,000. Or nothing at all.Alam lives in a rented two-room flat in Gaya, where the plaster peels and the only reliable light comes from a window that faces the street.Every morning, Alam folds his PhD certificate back into a drawer, picks up the same well-thumbed books he has taught from for years, and steps out toward a college that never recognised him as its own. His wife, Shamsun Nisa, said the only income now comes from occasional evaluation work during university exams. “Even private tuition stopped after Covid,” she said. “People think he’s too broken to teach. But he still reads. He still steps out in the morning dressed for work.”He began teaching English there in 1983, just after completing his master’s from Magadh University. Though formally hired under university-approved terms, the college denied him regular employee status. “When I asked for a salary,” he said, “they told me I was just a part-time teacher.” Magadh University, in response to an RTI application, confirmed Alam had indeed been appointed as regular faculty. In 2023, the state’s higher education director directed the university registrar to take necessary action. Nothing changed. “I couldn’t afford lawyers,” Alam said. “Sometimes I couldn't afford two meals a day.”India’s education system — vast, decentralised, often romanticised — rests on people like Alam. People who carry attendance registers without knowing whether they’ll be compensated for it. People who prepare lectures, invigilate exams, sign logbooks, evaluate answer sheets, and still have to take private tuition just to afford a sack of rice. Alam is not the only oneThe numbers alone tell a story that’s difficult to look away from. There are more than 10,000 teachers in 220 unaided affiliated degree colleges across Bihar. At Banwari College, commerce lecturer Deepak Kumar Singh teaches every day. His salary last year was Rs 9,000. In 2022–23, it was Rs 21,000. Before that, for four consecutive years, he received nothing. “No holidays, no leave. We come, we teach,” he said. “We mark attendance on the biometric machine like everyone else. ” The biometric scanner at the entrance does not care whether its data leads to a pay slip.Others never got even that far. Shankar Bhagat, who taught ancient Indian history in the same college, died of liver cirrhosis without treatment. Another colleague, Mukesh Kumar Mishra, is battling cancer in Muzaffarpur. His salary wasn’t enough to even consider a private hospital. “These are PhD holders,” said Arun Gautam, a senior teacher and media-in-charge of the Federation of Affiliated Degree College Teachers’ Associations of Bihar.This neglect, over time, has ossified into routine. A 2013 policy promised performance-based grants to unaided institutions — linking funding to student outcomes. But funds were never consistently released. Today, teachers are paid, if at all, from the internal revenues of their colleges: exam fees, certificate charges, hostel deposits. Many have no formal employment letters. Some earn barely Rs 1,500 a month.In Gujarat, the disparities played out on official contracts — but the outcome was no less punishing. Between 2008 and 2014, over 450 engineers were hired as assistant professors on fixed-term contracts. Some were placed in govt engineering colleges, others in polytechnics. They were paid Rs 30,000 or Rs 25,000, and told their tenure would end once Gujarat Public Service Commission filled the sanctioned posts.Naitik Gor was among them. He joined a govt polytechnic institute in 2013 and worked 32 hours a week — nearly double the regular load — and took on the full slate of responsibilities: practicals, examinations, even election duties. “There were no vacations, no earned leave. Same job, half the pay,” he said. In 2020, he walked away and took a position at a private firm in Ahmedabad.In 2018, over 300 contractual faculty like him went to Gujarat HC. They argued the disparity in pay violated Articles 14, 15, 16 and 19 of the Constitution. In 2023, a singlejudge bench agreed, calling it a “crying shame” that qualified lecturers, appointed by due process, were still kept on ad hoc contracts. The state appealed. Two division benches rejected its argument. A third overturned the decision. The matter reached SC.The apex court has now ruled in the petitioners’ favour. Gujarat govt has been ordered to pay arrears with 8% interest from 2015, and to align these teachers with the pay scale of regular assistant professors. But much of damage is already done. Gor said most of the original petitioners had left teaching.The erosion is not just economic — it is emotional, generational, institutional. Siksha Mitras — guest teachers recruited in large numbers in the early 2000s — were briefly regularised in 2015, drawing salaries of Rs 50,000. Two years later, the decision was reversed. Their salaries dropped back to Rs 10,000. “We were promoted, then demoted,” said Meenu Goswami, a Siksha Mitra in Bulandshahr, UP, who lives with a leg disability. She recounted at least a dozen suicides among demoted teachers in her district. “Some had loans, others lost homes. The salary cut killed them.” Shaily Sharma spent five years teaching at a small school in Amroha. She holds a postgraduate degree and a BEd. By 2015, she had become principal. Her salary was Rs 4,500 a month. “I loved the work,” she said. “But love doesn’t pay rent.” She left teaching in 2016.Teachers in Lucknow’s top-tier schools might earn Rs 60,000 or more. But those are few. Most private school teachers, even at well-known institutions, are paid Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000. “Even the fancy schools don’t offer more,” said Atul Srivastava, president of the Association of Private Schools, UP.The longer-term effects are showing across Uttar Pradesh. Since 2021, there has been no recruitment of govt school teachers. Thousands of schools now run entirely on guest faculty. “There’s no pipeline anymore,” said Dinesh Sharma, president of the Uttar Pradesh Primary Teachers’ Association. “People are migrating to other states.” The National Education Policy 2020 promised to restore dignity to the teaching profession. It called for better pay, regularisation, and a clear career path.","In 1983, Md Aftab Alam was hired as a regular college lecturer - on paper.

NEW DELHI: Amid instances of builders and their agents using “govt-style terminology” to make their projects resemble official housing schemes, the Centre has asked states and real estate regulators (RERAs) to take action to stop such advertisements to prevent buyers from being deceived. They have also been asked to submit reports to ensure the protection of buyers’ interests.Sources said there was a detailed discussion on the issue at a recent meeting of the Central Advisory Council (CAC) of RERA, chaired by housing and urban affairs minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Some samples of such misleading advertisements were also shared with all members, including representatives from state govts and RERA authorities.“This has been identified as a persistent issue, and hence, there is a need to address it immediately,"" said one of the CAC members. The ministry, in its presentation, pointed out that in some cases, advertisements did not disclose the names of publishers or promoters. “By doing so, such players bypass all mandatory norms, such as disclosing specific information related to projects. It appears that many of these advertisements are being disseminated by real estate agents,” a source said.Abhay Upadhyay, a member of the CAC and president of the homebuyers’ group FPCE, has written to Khattar, emphasizing the need to crack down on misleading advertisements to protect consumers. In fact, a study conducted by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) in Maharashtra last year found that out of 2,087 advertisements, 1,027 were in violation of the norms laid down by the Maharashtra RERA.FPCE has also raised concerns about data mismatches between RERA web pages, developers’ websites, and sanctioned plans, urging the govt to implement a system to eliminate such discrepancies.",The Centre has asked states and real estate regulators (RERAs) to take action to stop such advertisements.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation at 5pm on Sunday, the PMO confirmed earlier in the day.The PMO did not disclose the topic of the address.With Navratri beginning and GST reforms set to take effect from Monday, the PM's address on the eve of these events is expected to focus on the economic changes.He may also highlight his recent appeals to use ""Swadeshi"" products, promoting an 'Atmanirbhar' India in response to Donald Trump’s 50% tariff on India.Over his more than ten years in office, PM Modi has often addressed the nation to announce major decisions, from demonetisation to military operations. These speeches have served to inform citizens, explain government initiatives, and highlight major national milestones.On this day, PM Modi addressed the nation to announce the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. He said the move was aimed at tackling corruption, black money, and terrorism.

He said, ""In the journey of every nation there are moments that bring utmost pride and have a historic impact on generations to come.One such moment is today."" The operation made India one of the few countries capable of space-based missile defence.After Parliament passed the resolution to revoke Article 370 and reorganize Jammu & Kashmir into two Union Territories, PM addressed the nation. He highlighted that the special status of Jammu & Kashmir had long been a pending promise of the BJP, and the move would bring greater integration, development, and governance to the region.PM Modi frequently addressed the nation during the pandemic:On Guru Nanak Jayanti, PM Modi addressed the nation to announce the repeal of the three contentious farm laws, following almost a year of farmers’ protests. He urged farmers to return home, saying, ""I urge farmers to return home to their families and let's start afresh.""After India’s counter-terror action in response to the Pahalgam attack, PM Modi addressed the nation after Operation Sindoor. He strongly condemned the attack, saluted the Indian Armed Forces for their valour, and said the operation was “an answer to Pakistan’s terrorism.” He dedicated the success to “every mother and sister of our country.”","Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation at 5pm on Sunday.

Zubeen to be cremated with full state honours on Sep 23 near Guwahati: Himanta,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/zubeen-to-be-cremated-with-full-state-honours-on-sep-23-near-guwahati-himanta/articleshow/124031090.cms,"Zubeen Garg Death: CM Clarifies Cause, Fans Recall His Love For Water

NEW DELHI: Popular singer Zubeen Garg will be cremated with full state honours on September 23 at a village near Guwahati, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday.The decision to cremate Garg at Kamarkuchi NC village was taken during a cabinet meeting, considering the family's wish that his last rites be performed at a place in or around Guwahati, Sarma said at a press conference.There were also demands from the people of the Upper Assam town of Jorhat, where the singer had spent his formative years, that he be cremated there, he said.''We discussed both the proposals. Zubeen does not belong to the government, and so his family's choice should be given priority,'' Sarma said.His wife Garima Saikia Garg and sister Pamle Borthakur pointed out that it would not be possible for his 85-year-old ailing father to go Jorhat for the last rites and even later during anniversaries or other rituals, it would be difficult for the family to go there, the CM said.''Three of my cabinet colleagues - Ranoj Pegu, Keshav Mahanta and Bimal Borah - and also a delegation of the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) had discussed the matter with his wife and she had conveyed the family's decision to hold the last rites in Guwahati'', Sarma said.Besides, Garg had lived in Guwahati for the most part of his life, he added.''We, however, respect the sentiments of the people of Jorhat, with the Cabinet deciding that his ashes will be immersed there and a memorial will be built there,'' Sarma said.Regarding the request of the people of Jorhat to at least take Garg’s mortal remains there for one last time, the CM said that his body was not in a condition to be taken there and again brought back to Guwahati for cremation.A memorial will also be built at the place where he will be cremated near Guwahati, he added.The cremation site encompasses 3.3 acres of government land where some local people had set up a plant nursery, and they eagerly gave it for Garg’s funeral, he said.The CM said that he had visited the site while returning from Delhi on Sunday and will go there again on Sunday night to review arrangements for the cremation.He said that the place can accommodate around 5,000 people and appealed to Garg's fans to pay their last respects to him at the Arjun Bhogeswar Baruah Sports Complex, where his body will be kept till the morning of September 23.The state government had declared a three-day mourning till September 22, but it has been extended by another day for his cremation, the CM said.On the day of the cremation, the highway adjacent to the site of the last rites will remain closed for heavy vehicles.Sarma also said the Singapore government has issued the singer's death certificate, which states that he died due to drowning.''The Indian High Commission in Singapore has sent us the death certificate, and we have also requested that the postmortem report be also sent to us at the earliest,'' Sarma added.Garg died in Singapore while swimming in the sea on Friday.Regarding the investigations into the case registered by the CID following Zubeen's death, the CM said that statements of those who filed multiple FIRs against the two accused are being recorded.Both the accused - North East India Festival (NEIF) Chief Organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta and the singer's manager Siddhartha Sharma - are now not here, and ''my top priority now is to ensure Zubeen's last rites are conducted smoothly,'' he said.Besides, the place of occurrence is Singapore, so the police of that country will investigate the case, and ''we can only look into whether he was taken there as a part of a conspiracy'', Sarma said.''We shall proceed step by step, but let me first fulfil my duty and responsibility of giving Zubeen the farewell he deserves with dignity and respect,'' the CM said.","Zubeen Garg will be cremated with full state honours on September 23 at a village near Guwahati, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday.

Sarcophagus redraws Harappan age south-north trade map,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sarcophagus-redraws-harappan-age-south-north-trade-map/articleshow/124035553.cms,"Deposits at the archeological site in Tamil Nadu

Smoke from a funeral pyre over 3,700 years ago left behind a trail of charcoal. That faint trace, sealed inside a terracotta sarcophagus buried in Kilnamandi village of Tiruvannamalai district, has now rewritten Tamil Nadu's ancient past. Radiocarbon analysis in a US laboratory dated the deposit to 1692 BCE, placing this burial in the late Harappan age and hinting at trade links between southern India and regions as far away as Gujarat and Maharashtra.Burial offerings scattered around the stone coffin tell their own story. Etched carnelian beads, once prized in Harappan centres, lay beside graffiti-inscribed potsherds. ""Carnelian beads were available in Maharashtra and Gujarat regions. So, it clearly establishes a trade contact with the north during the later Harappan period,"" said K Rajan, professor and academic adviser to Tamil Nadu State Dept of Archaeology (TNSDA).Harappan or Indus Valley Civilization is generally dated between 3300 BCE and 1300 BCE. Rajan said the new dating also pushes TN's graffiti tradition further back. ""The grave goods contain graffiti-bearing pots, which indirectly places the date of the graffiti marks in TN to the 17th century BCE,"" he said.Symbols carved onto the shoulders of the pots include fork-like shapes, semi-concentric circles in a U-formation, and vertical strokes with wavering lines superimposed.Excavators G Victor Gnanaraj and M Suresh said in their field report that some graffiti appeared restricted to specific burials, suggesting they could belong to members of the same clan.A larger study by Rajan and TNSDA joint director R Sivanandam examined 140 archaeological sites and found striking parallels between TN graffiti and markings at Indus Valley locations - nearly 90% shared similarities. ""The AMS date of the sarcophagus gives authenticity to our study on graffiti marks,"" Sivanandam said.Objects unearthed at Kilnamandi, including iron tools and pottery finds, add to the picture of a complex society. State archaeology minister Thangam Thennarasu released on Saturday this AMS-dating result, one among 139 scientific dates collated by the department, alongside preliminary excavation reports at Keeladi near Madurai.",Radiocarbon analysis in a US laboratory dated the deposit to 1692 BCE.

Latest state poll rolls uploaded, mapping work underway

NEW DELHI: All states and Union territories (UTs), except Bihar , have been given time until September 30, 2025, by the Election Commission (EC) to complete mapping of their current electors with those who figured in the rolls published after the last intensive revision in the state/UT over two decades ago.This, sources said, indicates possible announcement of rollout of a nationwide special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls by EC in early Oct, with Jan 1, 2026, as the qualifying date.Sources said that though the EC, at its meeting with all state/UT chief electoral officers on Sept 10, had asked them to finish over the next 10-15 days preliminary activities for a nationwide SIR, with Jan 1, 2026, as the qualifying date, the deadline was extended to Sept 30 after some states sought more time.The chief electoral officers (CEOs) of all states/UTs have already uploaded the electoral roll from last intensive revision on their respective websites. All electors included in the roll on the date of issue of the nationwide SIR order by EC will be given enumeration forms by booth level officers (BLOs), and whoever signs and submits the form, with or without documents as required, either directly to the BLOs or through the parties' booth-level agents (BLAs), will be included in the draft roll.""The pre-SIR activities undertaken by the states/UTs identify electors who were there in the rolls from the last intensive revision, and they shall be presumed to be citizens, as will their children, and do not need to submit any documents. They may constitute 50-60% of the current electorate; it is only the remaining 40% of electors that the BLOs will need to focus on for making house-to-house visits and collecting their enumeration forms along with documents to prove their citizenship,"" said an Election Commission functionary.The EC had written to all state/UT CEOs on July 5, 2025, asking them to begin preparations for a Bihar-like SIR exercise with Jan 1, 2026, as the qualifying date.The states/UTs have since been busy with the digitisation and uploading of electoral rolls from the last intensive revision on the CEO's website, mapping electors in the roll from last SIR with the current roll, rationalisation of polling stations to cap electors at 1,200 and the training of officials involved in SIR.The special summary revision undertaken at the end of each year, with Jan 1 of the following year as the reference date, usually begins with pre-revision activities in Aug-Sept, followed by publication of draft roll in Oct-end, the filing of claims and objections by Nov-end and their settlement by Dec-end.

'With lower GST rates, fulfilling personal dreams will get easier for citizens'

'Buy swadeshi, sell swadeshi'

NEW DELHI: On the eve of the month-long festival season, which begins with the first day of Navratri, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday made a strong pitch for people to take advantage of the ""Bachat Utsav"" (savings festival) starting Monday, when the next generation GST reforms roll out, helping reduce prices, lower compliance and accelerate India's growth story.In a special address to the nation ahead of the rollout of the GST reforms, the PM also made a strong pitch for promoting 'swadeshi' goods and urged people to liberate themselves from ""the dependence on foreign goods"" and buy products that are 'Made in India'.""Tomorrow, on the first day of Navratri, at dawn, the next generation of GST reforms will be implemented. From tomorrow, the 'savings festival' begins. Your savings will increase, you will be able to purchase your preferred items more easily. With lower GST, it will be easier for citizens to fulfil their dreams,"" the PM said.""The poor, the middle class, the neo-middle class, the youth, farmers, women, shop owners and traders will all benefit. This means that in this festive season, everyone will get a sweet treat,"" Modi said, adding that most everyday-use items will become more affordable. PM Modi listed food items, medicines, soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste and health and life insurance among many goods and services that will either be tax free or attract only a 5% tax.He said of the items previously taxed at 12%, 99% - virtually all - have now been brought under the 5% tax bracket, and noted that shopkeepers are making efforts to ensure benefits of GST rate cuts reach consumers.Highlighting that the essence of serving people is clearly reflected in the next generation of GST reforms and recalling abolition of income tax on annual income up to Rs 12 lakh, PM Narendra Modi said when income tax relief and GST rate cuts are combined, the decisions taken over the past year will result in savings exceeding Rs 2.5 lakh crore for people of the country.He said that this is precisely why he calls it a 'Bachat Utsav'.The PM said with lower GST rates, fulfilling personal dreams will become easier for citizens - whether it's building a house, purchasing a TV or refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or car - all will now cost less. Travel will also become more affordable, as GST on most hotel rooms has been reduced, he added.Modi also emphasised the responsibility of state govts and merchants in ensuring the benefits of GST cuts reached the consumer.Against the backdrop of global trade tensions, the PM said just as the mantra of 'swadeshi' empowered India's freedom struggle, it will energise the nation's journey toward prosperity.He said many foreign items have unknowingly become part of a citizen's daily life, and they often do not even realise whether the comb in their pocket is foreign or indigenous.Modi called for every household to become a symbol of 'swadeshi' and every shop to be adorned with indigenous goods. The PM encouraged citizens to declare their commitment to 'swadeshi' - ""I buy swadeshi"", ""I sell swadeshi""- and stated that this mindset must become intrinsic to every Indian. He asserted that such a transformation will accelerate India's development.The PM appealed to all state govts to actively support 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' and 'swadeshi' campaigns by boosting manufacturing in their regions significantly and by creating a conducive environment for investment.He said when Centre and states move forward together, the dream of a self-reliant India will be fulfilled, every state will develop, and India will become a developed nation.","PM Narendra Modi made a strong pitch for people to take advantage of the ""Bachat Utsav"" (savings festival) starting Monday.

H-1B visa fee hike: A self-goal for US? How India stands to gain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/h-1b-visa-fee-hike-a-self-goal-for-us-why-its-good-for-india/articleshow/124013587.cms,"Representative image

Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive'

“America’s loss will be India’s gain”

Offshoring will accelerate

Trump's H1B Visa Shock: How It Will Hurt America, Not Just India | I Witness

The India angle







US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a hefty fee of $100,000 on H-1B visas has triggered widespread debate.Indian industry leaders, political voices and community representatives have all weighed in, warning that the move could backfire on the US while benefiting India.On Friday, Trump signed a proclamation introducing a mandatory fee of $100,000 on H-1B visas, effective from Sunday.Currently, H-1B filing fees range from $2,000 to $5,000, depending on the employer's size. The visas, valid for three years and renewable, are widely used by American companies to bring in highly skilled foreign professionals, many from India.Trump defended the decision as a measure to protect American jobs, arguing that outsourcing firms have used the programme to replace US workers with cheaper foreign talent. He described it as both an economic and national security issue.Former Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant was among the first to react strongly. “Donald Trump’s 100,000 H-1B fee will choke US innovation, and turbocharge India’s. By slamming the door on global talent, America pushes the next wave of labs, patents, innovation and startups to Bangalore and Hyderabad, Pune and Gurgaon,” he wrote on X.Kant argued that India now has an opportunity to harness the expertise of doctors, engineers and scientists who may otherwise have chosen to work in the US.Infosys veteran and investor Mohandas Pai said the cost would discourage fresh applicants. “It has got limited application, because... it doesn’t apply to all the H-1B visas which are already there. So there could be only impact for anybody applying in future, new applications will come down. Nobody’s going to pay $100,000, that is very true,” Pai was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.He added that US firms will increasingly shift work offshore, boosting India’s Global Capability Centres.“Now what will happen is everybody will work to increase offshoring... because it doesn’t make sense, first, you don’t get talent, second the costs are too high. That will happen over the next maybe six months to one year,” he said.Entrepreneur and Snapdeal co-founder Kunal Bahl also weighed in, saying the new rules would prompt many skilled professionals to return home.“Because of the new H-1B rules, a tremendous number of talented individuals are going to be headed back to India,” he wrote on X.“It will no doubt be tough in the beginning to move base, but will work out for them given the tremendous opportunities in India. The talent density in India is going up”, he added.In a separate post, he shared his personal account and wrote, “In 2007, sitting at my desk in Microsoft I got an email that my H1B visa was rejected. It was crushing and numbing at that moment, but life-changing eventually when I moved back to India. To those impacted today, be positive. There is something much bigger & better in store for you.”The move has also faced backlash within the US. Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi called it “reckless” and “unfortunate,” saying America risks cutting itself off from high-skilled workers who have historically powered its economy, according tor PTI.Community leader Ajay Bhutoria, based in Silicon Valley, warned that such a fee would deter top global talent, adding that it could weaken the region’s technology ecosystem.While Indian professionals looking to work in the US face an additional barrier, experts believe the long-term impact could be positive for India. With higher visa costs deterring mobility, companies may expand operations in India itself, fuelling growth in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and Gurgaon, as Kant pointed out.As Pai noted, salaries for H-1B workers are already high, often above $100,000, so the perception that the programme imports cheap labour is misplaced. Instead, the new rules may end up shifting innovation and startup growth to India.Data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) shows how significant Indian and global firms are in the H-1B ecosystem. For FY2025, Amazon topped the list with 10,044 approvals, followed by TCS (5,505), Microsoft (5,189), Meta (5,123), Apple (4,202) and Google (4,181).Other major beneficiaries included Cognizant, JP Morgan Chase, Walmart, Deloitte, Infosys, LTIMindtree and HCL America. Experts warn that the $100,000 fee could affect both Indian IT services and US tech giants that rely heavily on this talent pool.Trump’s proclamation may score political points domestically, but experts hav cautioned that it could erode America’s competitive edge. As Amitabh Kant summed up, “America’s loss will be India’s gain.”For India’s tech sector, this may well be the push that accelerates its transformation into a global innovation hub.","US President Donald Trump's decision to impose a hefty fee of $100,000 on H-1B visas has triggered widespread debate.

"Molly Qerim’s departure from First Take explained as ESPN cites contract, business, and financial factors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/molly-qerims-departure-from-first-take-explained-as-espn-cites-contract-business-and-financial-factors/articleshow/124008526.cms,"Molly Qerim (Imagn Images)

ESPN planned a transition before Molly Qerim’s contract expired

Salary expectations and ESPN’s financial focus played a key role

Molly Qerim’s sudden exit from ESPN’s First Take left many fans surprised, given her strong presence and years of consistency as co-host alongside Stephen A. Smith. But new details have shed light on the decision, showing that it was less about controversy and more about timing, business priorities, and financial realities at the network.Burke Magnus, ESPN’s head of content, recently addressed the matter, clarifying that Qerim’s contract was already set to expire by the end of the year. According to him, the company had long been considering a shift. “She was going to come off First Take either way and that was something [where] we had already crossed that bridge,” Magnus explained.He emphasized that the network wanted to expand Qerim’s versatility by getting her involved in other projects, rather than tying her exclusively to one show. Importantly, he praised her character and work ethic, stating, “She’s an awesome person,” while noting, “You know, it’s business.”Behind the scenes, salary dynamics also influenced the decision. With Stephen A. Smith recently signing a $105 million deal averaging $21 million per year, ESPN executives were reluctant to commit major dollars to Qerim’s role. While respected, her co-hosting duties were seen as replaceable by someone who could perform the same function at a lower cost.Reports indicate ESPN is now preparing for a 30- to 45-day casting process to find Molly Qerim’s successor, though no replacement names have been officially revealed.Also Read: ""Early next year"": Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s wedding could arrive sooner than fans expecte For loyal viewers, Molly Qerim’s departure marks the end of an era. She provided balance and professionalism on a show often dominated by fiery debates, helping cement First Take as a staple of morning sports programming. For ESPN, however, the move reflects the constant adjustments networks make to stay competitive in a shifting media landscape.","Molly Qerim's sudden exit from ESPN’s First Take left many fans surprised, given her strong presence and years of consistency.

In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New GST rates effective today: 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% Tax Brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury. Below is a full list of items that now attract 0, 5, 18% and 40%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124031450,imgsize-61380,width-400,resizemode-4/new-gst-rates-2025-full-list.jpg"

ITR filing : What false exemptions claims are being scrutinized?





ITR filing FY 2024-25: Wondering why your income tax refunds are taking a little longer this year? The Income Tax Department is cracking down on false tax exemptions being claimed by people in their Income Tax Returns. Most of these exemptions, under the old income tax regime, are for individuals who earn over Rs 20 lakh.The tax authorities have identified many instances of false exemption claims submitted by taxpayers, leading to enhanced risk evaluation procedures at the Central Processing Centre to stop incorrect refund disbursements, according to an ET report.The tax authority has implemented computerised verification systems to examine taxpayers previously identified for filing inflated claims. The department has enhanced its utilisation of sophisticated data analysis and AI technologies to detect inconsistencies in income declarations by individuals.The fraudulent exemption claims comprise fabricated medical expenses and fictitious donations to political and religious entities, with a significant portion of these claims originating from taxpayers who opted for the old tax structure.Sources knowledgeable about the matter told ET that the attempted tax avoidance through these deceptive practices amounts to approximately ₹700 crore.The processing of refunds might experience delays, particularly for claims exceeding Rs 10 lakh, according to these sources.""During the verification process, we detected that many taxpayers, mostly with income above Rs 20 lakh, were claiming wrongful refunds through fake exemptions. Interestingly, most of them were repeat offenders,"" a senior tax official was quoted as saying.Tax officials have confirmed that notifications are being dispatched to taxpayers, enabling them to amend their returns.“This verification is taking additional time, a reason why the refund process is slower compared to last year,"" the official said, adding that the department is closely monitoring the processing so that other pending income tax returns are cleared at the earliest.According to recent data, the Income Tax Department's refund disbursements decreased by 24% to Rs 1.60 lakh crore as of September 17, compared to Rs 2.10 lakh crore in the previous year.The department launched comprehensive verification exercises across multiple sites in July, targeting those who were helping others file incorrect tax deductions and exemptions in their returns.Following a recent compliance campaign as of June 18, taxpayers withdrew tax deduction claims amounting to Rs 963 crore and submitted additional taxes of Rs 409.50 crore. Additionally, 30,161 taxpayers disclosed foreign assets valued at Rs 29,208 crore and foreign income totalling Rs 1,089 crore.","The tax authorities have identified many instances of false exemption claims submitted by taxpayers.

Will UAE residents get five-day weekend for UAE National Day? Here’s why it’s possible this December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/a-rare-5-day-weekend-for-uae-national-day-is-possible-heres-why-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/124006129.cms,"UAE National Day holidays in 2025 are officially December 2 and 3, with possible shifts to extend the weekend/ Image: Dubai Media Office

UAE National Day 2025 – The possibility of a very long weekend

Commemoration Day is officially recognized on November 30, but is typically observed on December 1.



If December 1 (Monday) is also declared a holiday, either in addition to or replacing December 3, residents would get a 4-day or even 5-day weekend when combined with the Saturday-Sunday weekend before it.



Key dates to know:





Saturday, November 29, 2025 – Regular weekend

– Regular weekend Sunday, November 30, 2025 – Official date of UAE Commemoration Day(not typically a day off)

– Official date of UAE Commemoration Day(not typically a day off) Monday, December 1, 2025 – Observed Commemoration Day(could potentially be declared a public holiday)

– Observed Commemoration Day(could potentially be declared a public holiday) Tuesday, December 2, 2025 – UAE National Day (official public holiday)

– UAE National Day (official public holiday) Wednesday, December 3, 2025 – Second official day off for National Day (may be shifted to Monday, December 1, under the public holiday law)

The law that could give UAE National Day weekend a 5-day break





Key points of the law:





The law applies to non-Eid holidays, including New Year’s Day, Islamic New Year, Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), and National Day

The two major religious holidays, Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha, are excluded from this flexibility. If they fall on a weekend, they cannot be moved.





Commemoration Day – Its role in the holiday equation

If December 1 (Monday) is officially added as a public holiday in 2025, and paired with December 2 and 3, residents would get three consecutive weekdays off.



Combine this with the standard Saturday-Sunday weekend (November 29–30), and the result is a 5-day break.



Alternatively, a more probable scenario is that the Cabinet moves the December 3 holiday to Monday, December 1, effectively offering a 4-day weekend instead.





How the UAE celebrates National Day

Final word





Will UAE residents get a five-day weekend this December? With National Day falling midweek, a flexible holiday policy, and a perfectly timed calendar alignment, there’s a real possibility that 2025 could bring one of the longest breaks of the year.The UAE will celebrate its 54th National Day on Tuesday, December 2, 2025, marking more than half a century since the unification of the Emirates. National Day, also called Eid Al Etihad, commemorates the 1971 federation of six emirates, with Ras Al Khaimah joining in 1972, and symbolizes the country’s independence from British treaties and the start of nationhood under Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.By law, December 2 and 3 are official National Day holidays across the UAE. In 2025, these dates fall on Tuesday and Wednesday, placing the celebration midweek. However, due to updates in the UAE’s public holiday law, there's potential for this to turn into a much longer break.Here’s how it could play out:Nothing has been officially confirmed yet, but similar decisions in past years, and the UAE’s ongoing focus on improving work-life balance, make this scenario increasingly likely.In 2024, the UAE introduced a key revision to its public holiday law aimed at enhancing work-life balance.This legal amendment, announced in the summer of 2024, allows non-Eid public holidays to be moved to the beginning or end of the week if they happen to fall midweek or on weekends. The intent is to help residents benefit more from their holidays through longer, uninterrupted breaks.The official wording states:“With the exception of Eid holidays, the Cabinet may – pursuant to a resolution it issues – transfer any of the public holidays referred to in Article (1) of this Resolution to the beginning or end of the week.”Previously, if a holiday like the Islamic New Year fell on a Sunday, already part of the weekend, workers in the private sector didn’t get an extra day off. For instance, in 2024, Muharram 1 fell on Sunday, July 7, rendering the paid holiday ineffective for many. Under the new rule, that holiday could now be shifted to a Friday or Monday, ensuring residents still benefit.In short: the National Day holiday falling midweek in 2025, combined with Commemoration Day on Monday, sets the stage for either a 4-day or 5-day holiday, depending on how the government chooses to apply this flexibility.UAE Commemoration Day honors the memory of Emiratis who have given their lives in service to the nation. While officially designated as November 30, but usually not with a public holiday, it has been observed on December 1 in recent years, especially when aligning with National Day schedules.Here’s why Commemoration Day matters in this scenario:The UAE's local governments also have discretion to declare additional public holidays not explicitly listed in federal resolutions. This means that emirates such as Dubai or Abu Dhabi could theoretically extend the break by adding Commemoration Day to the public holiday calendar as part of the National Day celebrations.UAE National Day on December 2 is always a big deal, and 2025 is set to be no different. Expect the skies to light up with fireworks and laser shows across landmarks like Burj Khalifa, Dubai Festival City, and the Abu Dhabi Corniche.Streets and buildings will be draped in the national colors, red, green, white, and black, and everyone from kids to grandparents gets into the spirit with festive outfits and flag displays.Traditional dances like Al Ayallah and Al Harbiya, along with poetry and music, bring the country’s heritage to life. In Dubai, the Rashid Boulevard parade steals the spotlight with marching bands, eye-catching floats, and surprise characters. The highlight, though, is the official celebration attended by the rulers of all seven emirates, a powerful show of unity and national pride.While the official announcement is still pending, the calendar setup, holiday law, and past practice suggest there’s a good chance of an extended 5-day UAE National Day weekend. Whether it ends up being four or five days, UAE residents can likely expect a meaningful and festive holiday period this winter.Stay tuned for the official word, but maybe don’t book your December 1 meetings just yet.","UAE National Day holidays in 2025 are officially December 2 and 3, with possible shifts to extend the weekend.

Intel's $20 billion mistake now becomes survival strategy

XElectron Techno Review: Turn Any Wall Into a 200-Inch Screen





Twenty years after Intel rejected buying Nvidia for $20 billion, the roles have completely flipped: Nvidia is investing $5 billion in its struggling former takeover target and rescue Intel through a strategic chip partnership. The deal announced Thursday sees Nvidia purchasing Intel stock at $23.28 per share—a 6.5% discount—while the companies collaborate on PC and data center processors. Intel will embed Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics into consumer chips and manufacture specialized processors for Nvidia's AI systems.The partnership crystallises one of tech's most dramatic power shifts. Intel, once Silicon Valley's undisputed chip king with double Nvidia's revenue as recently as 2022, now has a market value under $100 billion. Nvidia has exploded to over $4 trillion, making it the world's second-most valuable company.Back in 2005, then-Intel CEO Paul Otellini pitched acquiring Nvidia to his board, recognizing that graphics chips might revolutionise data centers. Directors balked at the unprecedented price tag and Intel's poor acquisition track record, instead backing an internal project called Larrabee that burned hundreds of millions before collapsing in 2009.Nvidia seized the moment Intel missed. While Intel clung to traditional processors, Nvidia anticipated the AI revolution, developing specialised chips perfect for machine learning before ChatGPT made headlines. When tech giants raced to build AI infrastructure, they turned to Nvidia's ready-made solutions.Today, Nvidia approaches $200 billion in annual revenue—soon earning more each quarter than Intel generates yearly. Its data center business alone dwarfs entire chip companies.Intel has desperately chased the AI wave through acquisitions like Nervana Systems ($400 million) and Habana Labs ($2 billion), but gained little ground against Nvidia's dominance. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who replaced the ousted Pat Gelsinger this year, admits Intel won't compete with Nvidia's high-end systems ""anytime soon.""The Nvidia partnership represents pragmatic surrender disguised as collaboration. Intel acknowledges it needs the company it once could have owned to remain relevant in computing's AI-driven future.""This historic collaboration tightly couples Nvidia's AI stack with Intel's x86 ecosystem,"" said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, diplomatic language for Intel's dependence on its former potential acquisition target.The investment follows recent lifelines, including government backing and SoftBank's $2 billion injection as Intel struggles to fund its manufacturing ambitions.Intel shares jumped 22% after Nvidia announced $5 billion investment in the chipmaker.",Intel rejected a $20 billion bid for Nvidia in 2005.

What does the Trump administration’s H1-B order say







Soon after the Trump administration issued an executive order imposing a $100,000 fee on all H-1B visa applications, a move that has caused significant concern within the Indian IT industry, former NITI Aayog CEO and G20 Sherpa, Amitabh Kant, has stated that the new fee will ultimately serve to “choke US innovation and turbocharge India's.”In a post on X, Kant argued that by “slamming the door on global talent,” the US is pushing a massive wave of development toward India's major tech hubs.“America’s loss will be India’s gain,” Kant wrote, adding that the move presents an opportunity for India's best doctors, engineers, scientists, and innovators to contribute to the nation's growth and its vision of a “Viksit Bharat.”“By slamming the door on global talent, America pushes the next wave of labs, patents, innovation and startups to Bangalore and Hyderabad, Pune and Gurgaon,” he said, as these cities are home to offices of global tech giants like Google , Microsoft, and Infosys.“India’s finest Doctors, engineers, scientists, innovators have an opportunity to contribute to India’s growth & progress towards #ViksitBharat. America’s loss will be India’s gain,” he emphasised.President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose a $100,000 fee per H-1B visa petition for workers outside the US. The order, which takes effect on September 21, 2025, accuses companies of using the H-1B visa programme to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour.“Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields,” the order said.The new policy aims to direct higher prevailing wage levels for H-1B workers and prioritise those who are high-paid and highly skilled, signaling a dramatic shift in US immigration policy.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose a $100,000 fee per H-1B visa petition for workers outside the US.

MUMBAI: Professor Varun Bhalerao, a rocket scientist in the physics department at IIT Bombay , is determined to change something fundamental about Indian science.""The age of catching up is over, where we struggled to match the world's innovation. Now is the time to be world class,"" he says. The result of this vision is 'Daksha', a mission to develop and launch a pair of satellites housing the world's most powerful space telescopes. These telescopes will monitor an 1.81 million cubic megaparsecs of space-nearly five times the capacity of NASA's current leader, the Fermi Gamma Ray Telescope.'Daksha' is a collaborative effort led by IIT Bombay along with support from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Raman Research Institute (RRI), Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) and the Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA). ""If approved today, we can build the satellite in three years,"" says Bhalerao.The mission's origins trace back to 2018, when the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) sought new space missions it could undertake. A committee led by Prof Ajit Kembhavi, former director of IUCAA, shortlisted promising projects.""Daksha was the best candidate because we already had all the pieces in place-the technology is proven, the cost reasonable, and its performance surpasses anything else in the world.It's a technological and scientific sweet spot,"" says Kembhavi.Once deployed, the telescopes will study sources of gravitational waves, such as black holes and neutron stars, which emit gamma ray bursts. Understanding these phenomena could answer some of physics' most core questions.""What are the origins of the universe? How does it expand? Studying gamma ray bursts could reveal insights about the earliest moments of the universe and how it all began,"" says astrophysicist Prof Dipankar Bhattacharya from Ashoka University.Gaurav Waratkar, now a postdoctoral scholar at California Institute of Technology (Caltech), was part of the original student team behind the Daksha concept.""It is the fundamental driving force behind our plans, hopes and dreams for the last 7 years,"" he says.Although he started as a mechanical engineer, the challenge of building something new drew him into physics. At IIT Bombay, open lab access and approachable professors made it easy for students to get involved. The Space Technology and Research (STAR) Lab, led by Bhalerao, typically hosts 15 to 20 students from various disciplines working on projects. Bhalerao recalls discovering two students working through Ganesh Chaturthi, a state holiday.""They were there because they wanted to be, without any instruction or compulsion.""Following the 2018 shortlisting, ISRO provided seed funding for testing key systems and instruments. As more institutes joined the development phase, the project progressed steadily. By December 2022, ISRO certified that the mission 'met all technical requirements'. However, full financial and policy approval has been pending for over two and a half years now.As the race for deep space dominance intensifies, the appetite for space exploration has never been greater-but the window to lead is closing fast. Professor Varun Bhalerao says, ""NASA and other Western space agencies have shifted their priorities.The last major telescope NASA developed and launched was in 2008, and since then, this area of research has largely stalled. If we don't want to hand over deep space exploration on a platter to China, we must act now.""","'Daksha' is a mission to develop and launch a pair of satellites housing the world's most powerful space telescopes.

BENGALURU: The much-expected and controversial socio-economic, educational and political survey of Karnataka, which is expected to cost Rs 625 crore to the state exchequer, will begin on Monday.However, Madhusudhan Naik, who heads other backward classes (OBC) panel, said there will be a delay of two to three days in launching the survey in Greater Bengaluru following a request from Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) administration.""The survey - which is not to be confused with caste census - will begin on Sept 22 and end on Oct 7 as per our calendar,"" said Naik, adding caste will be part - not the sole criterion - of the survey.According to the chairperson, GBA authorities required more time for their officials' training due to the division of BBMP into five different corporations, which has resulted in more administrative issues that need to be addressed.""While we expect the delay to be around 2-3 days, it may even extend by a week. It will be completed within the stipulated time of 15 days from the date of commencement,"" said Naik.The survey - which will record the social, economic, educational, and political representation of every caste and community in Karnataka - is the second such in 10 years that Karnataka will be embarking upon.This time, the state is relying heavily on technology to help them complete the enumeration process in 15 days.A day prior to the survey launch, Naik said the panel has made all the preparations, with enumerators being given a mobile application that will record the responses to the 60 questions likely to be posed to every household in the state. The panel has also introduced Aadhaar authentication and geotagging of as many as 2 crore houses to ensure that there is no duplication of responses.“While the Aadhaar authentication will be used to ensure there are no double entries of responses, the geotagging will help in reducing the possibility of enumerators not visiting the houses,” said Naik and panel member-secretary B Dayanand. In addition, the panel is providing an option for people to upload responses online directly along with Aadhaar authentication.“If the Aadhaar authentication is completed with the linked mobile number, a unique house identification number (UHID) will be directly generated, and the same will allow people to upload their response online,” said Dayanand. Moreover, everyhousehold visited by the enumerators will see a sticker of survey completion or noncompletion on the doors of the residences.“In case a person or family is unavailable, even after multiple attempts by the enumerators, then a sticker with their phone number will be stuck on the door to call them when they are back,” said Naik.To increase public response in Bengaluru, the OBC panel said the GBA administration is working on a helpline which will allow‘slot booking’ for the enumerators to go to the particular household to record their responses.“There will be a permanent team of enumerators who will be attached to GBA, and a helpline will be provided to the public. In case any family is going out of town or will be delayed in returning from outstation during the holidays, then they can call this number, and a slot will be booked for the enumerator to reach their residence to record their responses,"" said the panel.","The socio-economic, educational and political survey of Karnataka will begin on Monday.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

A side door for skilled professionals



Pros and cons of O-1B visa



The advantages of O-1B visa include:

No lottery or annual cap

Faster processing available

Renewable indefinitely

The drawbacks of O-1B visa are:

More subjective than H-1B, requiring proof of “extraordinary ability”

Some employers hesitate due to uncertainty in approval

Application costs can be higher than pre-hike H-1B fees

Some real world examples of O-1B visa



Entrepreneurs like Soundarya Balasubramani, who launched an educational venture in the U.S., are among the new wave of Indian applicants using the O-1 to bypass the H-1B bottleneck. “I got my O-1A approved as the solo founder and 100% owner of an educational venture,” she told ET.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US. As the scrutiny around the traditional H-1B visa pathway making the process unpredictable, the skilled professionals are now planing to turn towards O-1 visa a lesser known route. The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals. The applicants of the O-1 visa much demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and meet atleast three out of the eight criteria:After the unpredictable nature of popular H-1B visa, the O-1 visa is gaining a lot of traction among Indians who wish to go and work in the US. As per the report by Economic Times, Indian were granted 487 O-1A visas in FY 2020, this number was increased to 1,418 in FY 2023. With this increase, India became the third largest recipient of O-1 visa after UK and Brazil.Unlike the popularly H-1B visa which is capped at 85,000 visas annually and allocated via a lottery, the O-1 visa has no cap and the applications for it are accepted around the year. The applicants can also expedite the application process by submitting additional fees.Immigration consultant and O-1 holder Logan Ullyott told Business Insider: “The O-1 is an occupation-agnostic visa. You could get it if you’re an engineer, a researcher, an influencer, or even a cook — as long as you can prove you’re at the top of your field.”","The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Stock market recommendations: According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, the top stock picks for this week are Lemon Tree Hotels, and Bharti Airtel . Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty for the week starting September 22, 2025:As we approach the vibrant Navratri season beginning Monday, it seems the market has already kicked off its celebrations a week early. Much like the rising energy of garba and dandiya that intensifies with each beat, the benchmark index Nifty has surged ahead with a Symmetrical Triangle breakout, followed by a sharp upward rally. By week’s end, the index closed above the 25,300 mark, gaining nearly 1%, and marking its third straight week of positive returns.This rally was very much in line with our earlier outlook, where we had indicated that Nifty was well-positioned for a breakout. From the recent low of 24404, the index has rallied over 1000 points in just 15 trading sessions, showcasing strong momentum. What adds further strength to this move is the broad-based participation, with both Nifty Midcap and Nifty Smallcap 100 indices closing in the green for 11 consecutive sessions—a sign of deep market conviction.Looking ahead, we anticipate a brief pause in the index’s upward journey, similar to a momentary lull between energetic dance beats, before the next leg of the rally resumes.Technically, the setup remains bullish, with moving averages trending higher and momentum indicators continuing to support the positive bias.In terms of key levels, the 25200–25150 zone is expected to act as immediate support, aligning with the 8-day EMA and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally from 24404 to 25448. On the upside, a sustained move above the 25450–25500 zone could pave the way for the next leg of the rally, with potential targets at 25750, and eventually 26000—a promising setup for the bulls.The Bank Nifty index wrapped up the week on a strong note, registering its third consecutive weekly gain. From the recent low of 53578, the index has rebounded sharply, adding over 2200 points in just 11 trading sessions, signalling a robust recovery in banking stocks.This upward move has propelled the index above its short- and medium-term moving averages, indicating a clear shift in momentum. Importantly, both the 20-day and 50-day EMAs have begun to slope upwards, which is a positive technical development and suggests strengthening trend dynamics in the short term.Looking ahead, the current chart structure points to a potential consolidation phase over the next few sessions. This pause could allow the index to absorb recent gains and establish a firmer base before resuming its upward trajectory.On the technical side, the 20-day EMA zone between 55000-54900 is expected to act as a key support level. Holding above this range will be critical to sustaining the bullish bias. On the upside, the 55900–56000 zone will be a crucial resistance area, as it aligns with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the previous decline from 57628 to 53561. A decisive breakout above 56000 could ignite a fresh rally, with potential targets around 56800, followed by 57500 in the short term.Lemon Tree Hotels is showing strong bullish signs as it continues to recover and gain upward momentum. Despite the consolidation at higher levels, stock has managed to hold above its key short-term moving average of 20-Day EMA, confirming a solid short term bullish strength. The RSI near 60 suggests healthy buying interest.Bollinger Bands are starting to widen, indicating increasing volatility that often accompanies strong moves higher. The DI lines in ADX have marginally started to widen, signalling that a strong trend is underway. Recent price action reveals a series of higher lows and higher highs, reflecting consistent buyer strength.This combination of technical indicators and price behaviour suggests that Lemon Tree Hotels is poised for a continued rally. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 172-176 with a stoploss of Rs. 167.

NEW DELHI: Members of the Yadav community have staged a protest in Gurgaon, blocking roads to demand a change in the title of actor Farhan Akhtar’s upcoming war filmThe protesters say the title should be changed toto reflect the contribution of the Yadav community in the 1962 India-China war.Mahendra Singh Patwari, one of the protesters, told ANI: ""I am a member of the Ahir Regiment. Our demand is that the name of '120 Bahadur' be changed to '120 Veer Ahir'. Our martyrs should be named in the movie, and the movie should end with a tribute; otherwise, this protest will take a larger form on 26 October.""Another protester, Tarun, accused the film’s makers of attempting to “suppress the history of the Yadavs”. He said: ""Yadav community has gathered here today. We have no complaints with the government. We are just opposing Farhan Akhtar starrer '120 Bahadur'. Our ancestors have sacrificed a lot for the country, but in this movie, the focus is on someone else. Our request is that either the title of the movie be changed to '120 Bahadur Ahir', or we will boycott the movie. This film is trying to suppress the history of Yadavs. When this movie is released in the South belt, then they will be unaware of Yadav's history due to the titwas first announced in September 2024, with Farhan Akhtar revealing his look as Major Shaitan Singh. The film is directed by Razneesh ‘Razy’ Ghai and produced by Ritesh Sidhwani, Farhan Akhtar, and Amit Chandrra.The project is described as a tribute to the indomitable spirit of the Indian armed forces, particularly the soldiers of the Charlie Company, 13 Kumaon Regiment, who fought at the Battle of Rezang La.The teaser, released last month, opens with rising tensions between India and China. In one scene, Farhan’s character says,Another dialogue underlines the sacrifices of Indian soldiers,The uniform not just asks for courage, but also sacrifice).Shot in Ladakh, Rajasthan and Mumbai, the film attempts to recreate the frozen terrain and battlefield silence of the 1962 conflict.The teaser describes the events as ""A moment in history where courage refused to fail,"" honouring the 120 soldiers who resisted an estimated 3,000 Chinese troops.Actor Raashii Khanna makes a special appearance alongside Farhan in the film, which is set to release in cinemas on 21 November 2025.","Members of the Yadav community have staged a protest in Gurgaon, blocking roads.

Impact of H-1B fee hike on US tech and economy





The H-1B visa, introduced by the United States in 1990, has long been a pathway for highly skilled professionals from across the globe to contribute to America’s technology sector. Many of today’s tech leaders, including Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella, entered the US through this programme, allowing them to innovate, lead companies, and create global impact. These visas have been instrumental in building Silicon Valley and advancing AI, cloud computing, and consumer technology. With the recent $100,000 fee imposed on new H-1B applicants, it’s more important than ever to recognise the pivotal role these H-1B holders have played in shaping the US tech ecosystem.Musk initially entered the US on a J-1 exchange visa and later obtained an H-1B to pursue academic training and business ventures. He has been central to the success of SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, and X Corp, employing thousands of engineers and professionals globally. Musk credits the H-1B programme for enabling him and other highly talented individuals to create groundbreaking technologies, from reusable rockets to mass-market electric vehicles.His advocacy for skilled immigration highlights the importance of global talent in driving innovation and maintaining America’s leadership in tech.Pichai came to the US as an international student before transitioning to an H-1B visa, which allowed him to join Google in product management roles. Over the years, he rose to become CEO of Alphabet, overseeing key innovations in AI, Google Cloud, and hardware like Pixel phones and Nest devices. Pichai’s leadership has guided Google through major technological shifts, expanding AI research, cloud services, and consumer applications, positioning Google as a global technology leader.Nadella moved to the US in the early 1990s and obtained an H-1B visa to work at Microsoft. Rising through the ranks, he became CEO in 2014, leading Microsoft’s transformation through cloud computing, AI, and enterprise solutions. Nadella emphasises the critical role of skilled immigrants in fostering innovation and growth, highlighting that many of Microsoft’s most transformative projects have been driven by talent brought to the US through H-1B.Srinivas arrived in the US as a student and leveraged his H-1B visa to work in AI research. He later founded Perplexity AI, a company valued at $9 billion, offering cutting-edge AI solutions globally. His journey highlights the link between skilled immigration and leadership in next-generation technology.Yuan, a Chinese immigrant, faced multiple visa rejections before securing his H-1B to enter the US. He founded Zoom, which became an essential tool for global communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting millions of remote workers, schools, and enterprises. Yuan’s story demonstrates how H-1B visas enable entrepreneurs to build companies that have a global impact.Bansal came to the US on an H-1B visa in 2000 and founded AppDynamics, a software monitoring company. AppDynamics grew rapidly and was acquired for $3.7 billion, creating significant employment opportunities and boosting the tech ecosystem. Bansal’s entrepreneurial success underscores the value H-1B holders bring to innovation and economic growth.H-1B holders have been vital in founding, running, and scaling technology companies, filling high-skilled roles, driving innovation, and creating trillions in market value. Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Indian-origin firms like TCS rely on these visas to access global talent that fuels growth and competitiveness in the tech industry.The recent $100,000 fee for new H-1B applications has caused global concern, with tech leaders warning that such measures could limit access to skilled talent and slow innovation. Despite these hurdles, H-1B holders continue to demonstrate their vital role in shaping America’s technology landscape, proving that skilled immigrants remain essential to the country’s innovation and economic strength.","The H-1B visa, introduced by the United States in 1990, has long been a pathway for highly skilled professionals from across the globe.
