‘Incorrect, Baseless’: India Rebukes NATO Chief’s Claim of PM Modi Calling Up Putin After US Tariff

NEW DELHI: India has asked Russia to release 27 more of its citizens who were recently recruited into the Russian military, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said on Friday.""As per our information, 27 Indian nationals are presently serving in the Russian army. We are also in close touch with their family members in the matter,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters at his weekly briefing.Jaiswal said the government has taken up the issue at the highest levels. ""We have strongly raised this matter with Russian authorities in Moscow and with the Russian embassy in New Delhi, and asked for them to be freed as soon as possible. We are trying to get them out,"" he said.The MEA also issued a fresh warning to citizens. ""We once again strongly urge all Indian nationals to stay away from the offers being made to serve in the Russian army as they are fraught with danger and risk to life,"" Jaiswal added, as quoted by PTI.One such case is that of Rakesh Kumar, a 30-year-old from Uttarakhand, who had travelled to Russia for higher studies. His family alleged that he was coerced into joining the Russian army and sent to the war front in Ukraine. They said they have had no contact with him since early September and are desperate for help. The family had written to the MEA, sought assistance from the Indian embassy in Moscow, and approached local officials in a bid to bring him back.Reports indicate that some Indians holding student and business visas were forced into joining Russian military units deployed on the frontlines in Ukraine. India has repeatedly asked Russia to release all Indians serving as support staff, including cooks and helpers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also raised the issue during his visit to Moscow last year.According to official figures, more than 150 Indians have been recruited into the Russian military. At least 12 have been killed, 96 discharged, and 16 remain missing.","India has asked Russia to release 27 more of its citizens who were recently recruited into the Russian military.

air quality

and

livelihoods

NEW DELHI: With its order banning crackers in Delhi and NCR openly breached during last Diwali, the Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to devise by Oct 8 a mechanism in consultation with stakeholders to ensure production and sale of only green crackers.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria said if the ban on bursting of crackers in Delhi NCR could not be enforced, it would be proper to allow sale of green crackers, which conform to norms devised by NEERI and Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO).Firecracker manufacturers through senior advocates Balbir Singh and K Parameswara pleaded for resumption of production of green crackers, saying workers are jobless. The Union govt, through additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, did not support a ban on green crackers.Amicus curiae Aparajita Singh told the bench that it is the enforcement which had been found to be lacking. There are instances where the green cracker manufacturing licence-holders sold labels to those producing non-green crackers, which emit noxious gases harmful to the infants, infirm and elderly, she said.The CJI-led bench said, ""As experienced, the Supreme Court's order imposing a complete ban on bursting of crackers could not be enforced. In one case where the SC banned mining, the illegal mafia took over and resorted to mining. Hence, it is necessary to adopt a balanced approach which safeguards both the ambient air quality and the livelihood of cracker unit workers.""The bench asked Bhati to communicate to the ministry of environment and forest to convene meeting of all stakeholders, and consult amicus curiae in arriving at a plan of action and mechanism to enforce green cracker only rule for Delhi and NCR, which from Diwali till major parts of the winter months get enveloped by a thick smog mainly because of burning of crop residue in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.SC permitted the manufacturers to commence production of green crackers strictly in conformity with the norms laid down by NEERI and PESO but barred them from selling these, for the time being, in Delhi-NCR. It said further orders on sale of these crackers in Delhi-NCR will be considered on Oct 8.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) informed the SC that there appear to be gaps in monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. ""A rigorous, transparent, and year-round enforcement and monitoring mechanism is required to oversee manufacturing, distribution and sale of firecrackers, whereby PESO and authorities must conduct random, surprise inspections and collect samples directly from firecracker manufacturing sites and selling premises for testing them to confirm whether they conform to the prescribed standards,"" it said.CAQM said given the extraordinary air pollution situation in Delhi-NCR, CPCB and CSIR-NEERI must assess the contribution of firecrackers to air pollution.NEERI favoured allowing green crackers across India based on the air quality status of different cities and regions. According to NEERI, ""The marketing of non-green fireworks should be controlled by PESO. CSIR-NEERI has provided a list of approved green firework manufacturers on its website. Any manufacturer not on the list and producing firecrackers should be making non-green (illegal) crackers, which require strict monitoring by the regulatory agency, PESO. ""","The Supreme Court has asked the Centre to devise by Oct 8 a mechanism to ensure production and sale of only green crackers. Firecracker manufacturers through senior advocates Balbir Singh and K Parameswara pleaded for resumption of production.

HYDERABAD: Rail connectivity between Telangana and Maharashtra is set to get a significant boost, as the railways have decided to introduce two new Vande Bharat trains — one between Hyderabad and Pune, and the other on the Secunderabad–Nanded route.These new services are expected to reduce travel times by two to three hours. This will be the third Vande Bharat connection from Hyderabad to Maharashtra, following the service to Nagpur.Hyderabad is currently served by four Vande Bharat trains, and adding these two routes aims to further strengthen connectivity and ease passenger movement between Telangana and Maharashtra.As part of the plan, the govt is considering replacing the Secunderabad–Pune Shatabdi Express with a Vande Bharat Express. The Shatabdi currently completes the journey in about eight and a half hours, operating six days a week (except Tuesdays) with limited stops and a composition of two AC executive class coaches, nine AC chair cars and two EOG cars.This comes in response to the overwhelming popularity of the existing Vande Bharat trains on the Secunderabad–Visakhapatnam, Secunderabad–Tirupati and Kacheguda–Yeshvantpur routes, which consistently run at high occupancy levels.Encouraged by this success, the railways have drawn up proposals for two more Vande Bharat services from Secunderabad, highlighting the growing demand from passengers for faster rail options.""With the addition of these two new trains, the South Central Railway (SCR) will operate seven Vande Bharat services, placing it among the zones with the highest number of these indigenous semi-high-speed trains.

'Both India, US-Based Firms Have Raised Concerns': Dhruva Jaishankar On H-1B Fee Hike

Firms will cut H-1B workers



Impact on startups







The Donald Trump administration’s sharp increase in visa fees for H-1B workers has triggered concern among US technology companies, with many considering moving more jobs overseas — the very outcome the policy aimed to prevent.US President Donald Trump announced on Friday a steep $100,000 levy for new H-1B applicants, a visa program long used by tech firms to recruit skilled workers and by international students seeking US employment after postgraduate studies.While the fee applies only to new applicants and not current visa holders, confusion around its rollout and cost has prompted companies to pause hiring and adjust workforce plans.“I have had several conversations with corporate clients … where they have said this new fee is simply unworkable in the US, and it's time for us to start looking for other countries where we can have highly skilled talent,” said Chris Thomas, immigration attorney at Colorado-based law firm Holland & Hart, as quoted by Reuters.“And these are large companies, some of them household names, Fortune 100 type companies, that are saying, we just simply cannot continue.”Previously costing employers only a few thousand dollars, the new $100,000 fee flips the equation, making hiring talent in countries like India, where wages are lower and Big Tech increasingly builds innovation hubs, more attractive.“We probably have to reduce the number of H-1B visa workers we can hire,” said Sam Liang, co-founder and CEO of AI meeting assistant startup Otter.ai.“Some companies may have to outsource some of their workforce — hire maybe in India or other countries just to walk around this H-1B problem,” he added.“Blanket rulings like this are rarely good for immigration,” said Deedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures, which has invested in startups including AI firm Anthropic.“For larger companies, the cost is not material. For smaller companies, those with fewer than 25 employees, it's much more significant. Big tech CEOs expected this and will pay. For them, fewer small competitors is even an advantage. It’s the smaller startups that suffer most,” he added, as reported by Reuters.Analysts warn the policy could reduce the number of talented immigrants who often go on to launch new firms. A 2022 report from the National Foundation for American Policy found that more than half of US startups valued at $1 billion or more had at least one immigrant founder.","US President Donald Trump announced on Friday a steep $100,000 levy for new H-1B applicants.

Calcutta High Court on Friday struck down Centre’s decision to deport two women and their families from Birbhum, West Bengal, to Bangladesh.The court said the deportation was illegal and ordered that all six people, including three children, be brought back to India within a month. The court also dismissed the Centre’s request for a temporary stay on the order.Petitions were filed by family members of Sonali Bibi and Sweety Bibi, both from Paikar in Murarai, Birbhum.The women said their husbands and children had been living and working in Delhi for over 20 years as daily wage earners. On June 18, Delhi Police detained them on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals. Nine days later, on June 27, they were deported across the border. Reports said they were later arrested by the Bangladesh police.Sonali’s family told the court that she was nine months pregnant when deported, raising fears about her newborn’s citizenship if the child was born in Bangladesh.Lawyers for the families argued that the deportation was carried out despite them showing proper documents, including land papers, voter ID cards of their parents and grandparents, and birth certificates of their children issued by government hospitals.The Centre, in its affidavit, said the plea was not valid before the Calcutta High Court since petitions had already been filed in the Delhi High Court. It also argued that Delhi Police acted under instructions from the ministry of home affairs, which had issued a memo in May 2025 detailing the process for deporting Bangladeshi or Myanmar nationals.After the judgment, Trinamool Congress MP Samirul Islam said the court’s order exposed the BJP’s attempt to brand poor Bengali families as illegal immigrants wrongly. Calling it a “victory for Bengal,” he said the deportation was part of an anti-Bengali, anti-poor agenda.","Calcutta High Court struck down Centre’s decision to deport two women and their families from Birbhum, West Bengal, to Bangladesh.

In the case of Harjeet Kaur, she also returned recently,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.""We want to promote legal pathways of migration. At the same time, India stands against illegal migration,"" he added.Jaiswal explained that Indian authorities verify the nationality of individuals referred to them and facilitate their return only after confirming their documents and legal status.He added that whenever a person does not possess legal status in any country and is referred to India with claims of being an Indian national, authorities conduct a background check, confirm the nationality and then arrange their return. This is how deportations from the United States have been handled.Harjit Kaur, a Sikh woman from Pangota village in Tarn Taran, Punjab, had lived in the US for more than three decades after moving there with her sons following her husband’s death.She worked in the San Francisco Bay Area and had applied for asylum multiple times, all of which were denied. Her case attracted widespread attention in the US, with hundreds of people rallying in California demanding her release.Kaur was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during a routine immigration check on September 8 this year. She was placed in handcuffs, transported in a van to Georgia under harsh conditions and held without her family or attorney being informed. After about 48 hours in custody, ICE deported her to India.During the ordeal, she said, “After living there for so long, you are suddenly detained and deported this way, it is better to die than to face this. In such a situation, one should not live.”She added, “I was in handcuffs the entire time, I couldn’t sit properly, and no one informed my family.” Kaur described the journey as harrowing, highlighting the lack of food, water and medical care.","In the last several months, since January 2025, we've had 2417 Indian nationals deported or repatriated from the United States.

NEW DELHI: In a decision that could have a salutary bearing on the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), Supreme Court on Friday reversed its eyebrow-raising May 2 verdict, directing liquidation of bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel Limited, to put back in place the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's Feb 2020 decision to allow Sajjan-Jindal-led JSW Steel revive the failed entity.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices Satish Chandra Sharma and K Vinod Chandran reversed the decision of a two-judge bench led by Justice Bela M Trivedi, since retired, accepting arguments of solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Committee of Creditors, and senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul for JSW, which invested Rs 20,000 crore to revive BPSL and make it a profit-making company.The two-judge Supreme Court bench had rejected the Committee of Creditors-approved resolution plan of JSW, which was concurrently found to be sound by both National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and NCLAT. Using exclusive powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, SC had directed NCLT to initiate liquidation proceedings of BPSL while deciding an appeal by one of the promoters of BPSL challenging the resolution plan.Writing the 136-page judgment on operation of various IBC provisions, CJI Gavai said, ""The legislature purposefully did not include a means to challenge the commercial wisdom exercised by the CoC.This makes a challenge to the same non-justiciable... Any interference in the paramount objective of the CoC of exercising its commercial wisdom would amount to the court rewriting the law and going against the very objectives of the IBC. "" Referring to takeover of BPSL by JSW, the CJI-led bench said that since the IBC's objective of ensuring corporate debtor continues as a going concern has been achieved and loss-making BPSL has been transformed to a profit-making entity, the clock cannot be put back to penalise JSW by ordering BPSL's liquidation. ""This will defeat the very purpose of IBC to confer sanctity to the finality of duly approved resolution plan,"" SC said.The court rejected the COC's late-in-the-day argument for distribution of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) amongst creditors. SC said since the request for resolution plan (RfRP) issued by the resolution professional for the corporate insolvency resolution process did not provide for distribution of EBITDA among creditors, the COC cannot demand it now.SC said sans a specific provision in RfRP regarding distribution of EBITDA, it is impermissible for CoC to raise such a plea five years after approval of the resolution plan.""A successful resolution applicant (JSW in this case) cannot be faced with undecided claims after its resolution plan has been accepted. That would amount to 'hydra heads popping up' which would throw into uncertainty the amounts payable by a prospective resolution applicant who would take over the business of the corporate debtor,"" it said.RBI, in 2017, had issued a circular identifying 12 large-scale corporate defaulters, with outstanding debts valued at Rs 5,000 crore and above, infamously known as the ""dirty dozen"",which included BPSL.",Supreme Court on Friday reversed its May 2 verdict directing liquidation of Bhushan Power and Steel Limited.

NEW DELHI: In a significant step to fast-track land acquisition and construction of the first-ever rail link between India and Bhutan — a project of major strategic importance — the railways has designated the proposed 69-km Kokrajhar-Gelephu rail line as a Special Railway Project (SRP).The Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) issued the notification this week under the Railways Act, 1989. Officials said the national transporter has put the project priority list as a part of the government’s Act East policy.In March 2024, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bhutan, both countries agreed to establish two rail links between India and Bhutan: Kokrajhar-Gelephu and Banarhat-Samtse. The 16-km Banarhat-Samtse stretch will connect West Bengal with Bhutan.These lines will give Bhutan its first-ever railway connectivity.Senior railway officials said that SRPs are important as they have strategic importance, strengthen national security and boost socio-economic growth through improved connectivity. “This is a strategic project as it will improve cross-border connectivity and strengthen bilateral ties. In this year’s budget, funds were allocated for preliminary engineering-cum-traffic survey and final location survey for the new line,” said an official.This classification helps in prioritising resource allocation for projects and funds for their timely completion.The NFR has completed the final location survey and the detailed project report which would cost around Rs 3,500 crore. The project includes construction of six new stations — Balajan, Garubhasa, Runikhata, Shantipur, Dadgiri and Gelephu. The corridor will have two important bridges, 29 major bridges, 65 minor bridges, one Road Over Bridge and 39 Road Under Bridges.

Ladakh Violence: Sonam Wangchuk Ends 15-Day Hunger Strike

NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs cancelled the FCRA- Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act certificate of Sonam Wangchuk-led Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh after the Central Bureau of Investigation had initiated an inquiry.According to official findings, SECMOL received and deposited foreign contributions in contravention of Sections 8, 12, 17, 18 and 19 of the FCRA . The ministry alleged that in FY 2021-22, Sonam Wangchuk deposited Rs 3.35 lakh in SECMOL’s FCRA account in violation of Section 17. While the association claimed the sum was the sale proceeds of an old bus purchased with FCRA funds and thus rightly deposited in the FCRA account, the government noted discrepancies between the transaction details in its returns and the actual bank credits, calling the explanation “untenable.”Authorities also flagged that in FY 2020-21, local contributions amounting to Rs 54,600 from three individuals were credited to the FCRA account instead of the local account, a violation admitted by the association as an “inadvertent” error.Further, SECMOL received Rs 4.93 lakh from Swedish organisation Framtidsjorden for youth-awareness programmes on migration, climate change and food security. While the NGO said the funds were used strictly for educational purposes, the ministry observed that part of the grant involved “study on sovereignty of the country,” which cannot be funded by foreign contributions under Section 12(4) of the Act.""We received RS.4,93,205/- from framstidjorden for educational program for youths under the FE project for creating awareness among youth on issues such as migration, climate change, global warming, food security and Sovereignty and organic farming through different workshops and trainings. The funds were utilized stricty in line with the organization's objectives and for the specific purposes for which they were allocated. Hence, all these activities were educational and there was no violation,"" association replied.The ministry also pointed to a Rs 19,600 foreign donation returned to a donor during the Covid lockdown and a Rs 79,200 deduction from staff stipends that was recorded as food-fee receipts instead of disbursed salaries, which it said reflected poor accounting and possible violations of Sections 18 and 19.""AND WHEREAS, in view of violations as enumerated above u/s 8(1)(a), 17,18,19 and conditions of registration under section 12(4)(f) (i) of the Act, the FCRA registration certificate of the association is liable to be cancelled in exercise of power u/s 14 of the Act,"" the statement read.""NOW THEREFORE, considering the facts and position narrated in preceding paras, the Competent Authority, hereby, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 14(1) of the Act, cancels with immediate effect the FCRA Certificate of Registration No. 152710012R granted to the association ""Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh,"" the statement added.The CBI 's investigation, based on a complaint from the Ministry of Home Affairs, began about 10 days ago when CBI officials visited the institution in Ladakh, PTI reported.Reacting to the MHA's statement, which had blamed him for provoking mob violence, Wangchuk stated that he is prepared to be arrested under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA).""To say it was instigated by me, or sometimes by Congress, is to find a scapegoat, rather than addressing the core of the problem, and this will lead us nowhere. They may be clever in making somebody else a scapegoat, but they are not wise. At this time, we all need wisdom rather than 'cleverness' because youths are already frustrated,"" Wangchuk told PTI over the phone.The activist, who has been leading the peaceful agitation for statehood and constitutional safeguards for Ladakh, also raised concerns over his personal safety.""I see they are building up a case to bring me under the Public Safety Act and throw me in jail for two years,"" he said, adding, ""I am ready for that, but Sonam Wangchuk in jail may cause them more problems than free Sonam Wangchuk.""Over CBI probe on his institute for alleged FCRA violation, Activist Sonam Wangchuk told ANI, ""In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk.""""A day later (after Leh protests), the Home Ministry of India issued a press release naming Sonam Wangchuk in it and blaming him... I had received a notice about a CBI inquiry stating that your organisation received foreign funding even when it did not have FCRA. We did not get FCRA because we don't want funds from abroad. United Nations team wanted to take our Passive Solar Heated Building to Afghanistan, and for this, they gave us a fee. We also got fees with tax from Switzerland and Italy organisations for supplying knowledge to them about our artificial glaciers...We are getting I-T summons. In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk,"" he added.The investigation coincides with recent unrest in Ladakh, where the protest turned the violent protests that erupted in Ladakh on September 24 over demands for statehood and inclusion of the region under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The protest took a violent turn with the BJP office and several vehicles set on fire and hundreds of people taking to the streets.The region experienced its worst violence since 1989 on Wednesday, with youth groups engaging in arson and vandalism at the BJP headquarters and Hill Council, including burning vehicles. Law enforcement had to use teargas to control the situation.","The ministry of home affairs cancelled the FCRA- Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act certificate of Sonam Wangchuk-led Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh.

Poll Should there be a review system for deportations involving elderly individuals? Yes, to ensure fairness and safety No, existing rules are enough





CHANDIGARH: A 73-year-old grandma, who lived in US for 30 years, ""did everything right, worked, paid tax, and never missed any immigration check date"" is heartbroken after being deported in cruel manner — denied access to even her medicines on flight and once handed a plate of ice as food during her detention.""After living there for so long, you are suddenly detained and deported this way, it is better to die than to face this. In such a situation, one should not live,"" Harjit Kaur said with anguish. Choking up while speaking to TOI on Thursday evening, she said: ""Look at my feet, they are swollen like cow dung cakes. I neither got medicine nor am I able to walk.""Kaur landed in New Delhi on Thursday afternoon and was on her way to her sister's house in Mohali when she narrated her ordeal to TOI. A native of Pangota village in Tarn Taran district of Punjab, Kaur moved to the US with her two sons around 33 years ago after her husband, Sukhwinder Singh, passed away.She lived in the San Francisco Bay area and worked at a cloth store in Berkeley till Jan this year when she had to quit because of complications from her knee surgeries.Kaur was taken into custody on Sept 8 during a routine check-in with immigration officials.Her asylum applications had been turned down, with the last rejection in 2012.Kaur was moved to Mesa Verde IC Processing Centre in Bakersfield. ""Despite the outrage over my detention and sympathy for me, the authorities in the US were simply unmoved,"" she said.She was flown from Georgia to Armenia and then to New Delhi, along with 132 others, many of whom were Punjabis, she said. She was the only one not shackled and handcuffed. ""I was the oldest, you see,"" Kaur said.Her lawyer in the US, Deepak Ahluwalia, put out a video narrating the 60-70 hours before her deportation flight to India. ""She was not given a bed and had to share a holding room. There was a concrete bench. She was made to sleep on the floor with a blanket. She was unable to get up when she would lie down because she had double knee replacement surgery.""Ahluwalia added, ""She would ask for food so she could take her medicines. Those requests were ignored. Not that she wasn't fed at all. She was given a cheese sandwich. When she asked again to have something or even water to take her medication, she was given a plate of ice. She explained she had dentures and could not eat them. The guard told her — ‘that's your fault'.""Kaur was even denied a shower the entire time, said the lawyer. ""Prior to the flight on Monday around 7pm, she and other detainees were given wet wipes and told to just clean up before they boarded. Throughout this entire ordeal, no food,"" he said.Ahluwalia said an officer was apparently going to cuff and shackle Kaur as they ""usually do on the plane,"" but another officer said not to because of her age. ""The point I am trying to make here is how a 73-year-old grandmother with no criminal record was treated. And everyone can keep saying she had a final order of removal and she was asked to leave. ICE has suggested in their response to media articles that she had exhausted all her appeal options. That's correct. What's completely incorrect is that she chose to stay here when her case was denied or the last appeal option ran out.""Kaur is heartbroken that she could not even bid a proper farewell to her home in the US. ""I couldn't go back even once to take care of my belongings, which were lying the way I left them,"" she told TOI.Now back in India, she said she was ""unwell"" and would stay with her sister in Mohali for the time being. ""Let's see what is in store for my life,"" she said.Kaur has all sympathy for those who were deported with her. ""They spent lakhs to go there. Some of them had spent 10 months to a year in detention and now return empty-handed. They were in distress as they had sold their land to reach US,"" said the elderly woman.Kaur's younger brother, Kulwant Singh, a farmer in Pangota village, told TOI that he and the entire family would take care of her.""We were able to get a travel document by ourselves and were trying to negotiate with ICE attorneys and US govt for her to depart on a commercial flight. That's all we were asking for,"" Ahluwalia said.""We had asked to release her for even 24 hours. You can put ankle monitoring, or do whatever you need to, but give her a chance to say her goodbyes and take care of what she needs to take care of, and she will depart from San Francisco on Monday. We had attached the flight ticket, but they stopped responding. And around 2am on Saturday, without notifying the attorney or anyone else, they took her from Mesa Verde and drove her to LA in handcuffs,"" he added.Ahluwalia said that a separate complaint would be given on the way Kaur was treated during her deportation. Kaur said whatever her counsel said in the video was true.Kulwant Singh, the younger brother, said that Harjit was second among four siblings. Their eldest brother Jasbir Singh passed away. ""It's sad the way she has been deported. She has been separated from her family. Now, I and our other family members will take care of her in Punjab, "" said Singh.","Harjit Kaur moved to the US with her two sons around 33 years ago.

'Thug' Indian Truck Driver Crash In Florida Sparks US Visa Freeze, Triggers Illegal Immigration Row

What are the new rules?



Only drivers who have either an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa will now be eligible to get a commercial driver's license. Just having an employment authorization document won't be enough. But the rules are not retroactive and won't impact those who already have a driver's license.

The case of Harjinder Singh



The case of Partap Singh







The transport department has decided to tighten the screws on the process of issuing commercial drivers' licenses to non-immigrants after three fatal crashes were reported this year -- all caused by non-citizen drivers. Transport secertary Sean Duffy said the current rules are not strict enough and a number of states are not following them. Citing examples of California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Washington, Dufft said rules are not being followed here properly.No commercial driver license will be issued to non-citizens unless the states comply with new rules.On August 12, Indian-origin Harjinder Singh killed two passengers who were in a minivan as he took a wrong U-turn on Florida's Turnpike. The minivan was traveling behind him and was unable to avoid the truck's trailer. Singh lived in California but he was originally issued a commercial driver's license in Washington before California issued him a license later. Charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations, Singh will be deported after he serves his sentence in the US.Partap Singh, another Indian-origin truck driver who illegally entered the US, caused a multi-car pileup in 2024, leaving five-year-old Dalilah Coleman with life-altering injuries. He drove at unsafe speeds and failed to stop for traffic and a construction zone. He was arrested last month and will remain in ICE custody. He entered the US in 2022 and as released into the country by the previous administration, the DHA said.",US issues new rule for getting a commercial driver's license.

America’s wealthiest philanthropists have seen their fortunes soar over the past two years, yet their charitable giving has not always matched this growth. According to Forbes, the top 25 US philanthropists collectively gave $241 billion through the end of 2024—a 14% increase over last year—even as their combined net worth rose 18.5% to $1.6 trillion. While this represents a massive contribution to society, it accounts for only 15% of their total wealth, the lowest percentage since tracking began in 2021, raising questions about philanthropic responsibility during global crises. Some, like Warren Buffett and George Soros, lead in lifetime donations, while others, including Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, give a smaller fraction relative to their fortunes. The following are the ten most influential US philanthropists shaping society and redefining modern philanthropy through innovation, public engagement, and large-scale impact.Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has contributed a staggering $62 billion over his lifetime, representing 30% of his net worth of $146.7 billion.

Tyler Robinson Murder Probe: Partner Lance Twiggs Helping FBI With Evidence





The transgender live-in partner of Tyler Robinson, accused of assassinating Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, has been described by friends and family as a “good kid” with no part in the plot, according to interviews with those who knew him.Lance Twiggs, 22, had been living with Robinson in St. George, Utah, before reportedly relocating to a “safe space very far away from St. George” for security reasons, Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby said. Twiggs has not been charged in connection with the killing and is reportedly cooperating with authorities.During his high school years, Twiggs clashed with his family over their Mormon faith and reportedly experimented with alcohol and drugs, leading him to move between homes.He eventually stayed with a family of friends, including brothers who sheltered him during his junior year in 2021. Braylon Nielsen, 19, the sister of the two brothers, described Twiggs as “hardworking” and a “straight A” student who “went out of his way to make sure everyone was included”.Nielsen recalled Twiggs’ generosity and was quoted by the New York Post as saying, “We went to a dance once, a high school dance, and he was very involved with it.Made sure everyone had rides. Made sure everyone had clothes. He just took care of people. My sister’s car broke down once, and he came out to help her.”She added that she had no idea Twiggs was transgender, but emphasised that he “would never do something like that” in reference to the assassination.Nielsen’s mother, Jackie, echoed her support and said, “I don’t believe Lance would have any part of that. He’s a good kid. He’s a kid. He’s compassionate. He minds his own business. I hope the world lightens up on him and stops being so hateful until they have all the facts”.“He doesn’t deserve this”, she added, as per the New York Post.Twiggs’ community ties remain positive despite the shocking events. UT Success Academy executive director Ben Kaufman, who did not overlap with Twiggs, said he had only heard “glowing reports” of him, “Everything I’ve heard about him, he was a great kid. He was nice. He worked hard”.","Lance Twiggs, 22, had been living with Robinson in St. George, Utah. He has not been charged in connection with the killing and is reportedly cooperating with authorities.

US Senator Eric Schmitt says outrageous if true, shoots off letter to USCIS",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h-1b-for-dei-us-senator-eric-schmitt-says-outrageous-if-true-shoots-off-letter-to-uscis/articleshow/124163065.cms,"Senator Eric Schmitt writes to USCIS to investigate if H-1Bs have been hired to fill DEI positions.

$100,000 H-1B visa fee







Amid the ongoing row over H-1B, Senator Eric Schmitt said he came across numerous examples of hospitals, universities and other employers hiring foreign H-1B workers as DEI staffing. Diversity, equity and inclusion of US companies ensure increased representation of underrepresented groups, while H-1B is an employment program based on skill. But Schmitt alleged that companies have been using the H-1B pool to fill DEI positions.As the Senator wrote to the USCIS to look into the matter, he cited examples of Yale New Haven Health which filed LCA for H-1B visas for the role of a DEI specialist in 2021.""Examples range from large banks and law firms to universities, healthcare systems, and even municipal park districts. Obviously, DEI positions are plainly non-technical and ideological in nature, and appear to fall outside the “speciality occupation” intent of the H-1B statute,"" the Senator wrote.""More to the point, in light of everything we know about DEI, it's alarming that American employers appear to be importing foreign workers to work in these roles — placing non-Americans in positions where they are tasked with policing the speech and thought of our own citizens.""DEI is a toxic and anti-American institution, Schmitt said, adding that DEI's marriage with H-1B is ""beyond the pale"".""Rather than recruiting genuinely exceptional top-level talent, in many cases the H-1B visa is now regularly used to staff middle management bureaucracies. Rather than 160+ IQ rocket scientists, it's being used to import HR managers, customer service representatives, and so on.""The Donald Trump administration, since the beginning, vowed to overhaul the H-1B program that allows tech companies to hire STEM graduates from other countries. Over the years, the program earned a bad name of stealing US jobs as hiring foreigners, notwithstanding their skill, became cheaper. The Trump administration hiked the fee to $100,000 which the tech companies will have to pay for hiring H-1Bs.","Senator Eric Schmitt writes to USCIS to investigate if H-1Bs have been hired to fill DEI positions.

Amazon faces growing AI competition pressure

New AI agent 'Quick' signals strategic shift





Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman delivered a pointed message to staff during an internal meeting, criticizing the cloud computing giant for slow product rollouts ahead of its flagship Reinvent conference in December. ""The first and very most important thing we've got to do is make sure that we deliver on the roadmap that we have,"" Garman told employees, according to a meeting transcript reviewed by Reuters.The AWS chief emphasized that customers expect immediate access to announced products rather than mere pre-announcements. ""Increasingly, we're finding that when we launch innovative new things at Reinvent it's valuable if we can actually launch them, as opposed to just pre-announce them,"" Garman said during the all-hands meeting.The internal critique comes as Amazon grapples with mounting criticism over its artificial intelligence strategy. During the company's most recent earnings call, a Morgan Stanley analyst questioned CEO Andy Jassy about Wall Street concerns that ""AWS is falling behind in genAI with concerns about share loss to peers.""Jassy defended Amazon's position in an unusually lengthy eight-minute response, arguing that AI development remains in early stages with room for multiple winners.However, the internal pressure from Garman suggests ongoing urgency within the organization to accelerate product delivery timelines.At the meeting, Garman demonstrated a new internal AI product called ""Quick,"" per Reuters, describing as an ""agentic"" AI system designed to perform tasks with minimal prompting. The tool can analyze documents and web pages while automating customized workflows for regular business processes.Quick will soon be available for testing across all AWS employees, representing the company's latest effort to compete in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Garman also stressed the importance of customer attendance at Reinvent, targeting over 60,000 attendees to match last year's conference turnout.However, an Amazon spokesperson disputed the Reuters report, calling it a ""gross misinterpretation"" of what was described as an ""inspiring internal conversation.""","Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has urged his staff to expedite product rollouts, particularly in AI.

What will be the impact if tariff gets imposed?







The Donald Trump-led US administration is considering a plan to impose tariffs on imported electronic devices depending on the number of chips in each one of them, Reuters reported, citing three sourcesUnder the proposal, the US commerce department would calculate tariffs as a percentage of the product’s estimated chip value, in a move designed to push manufacturers to shift production to America.""America cannot be reliant on foreign imports for the semiconductor products that are essential for our national and economic security,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told Reuters, regarding the matter.""The Trump administration is implementing a nuanced, multi-faceted approach to reshoring critical manufacturing back to the United States with tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and energy abundance,"" Desai added.Uncertainty remains about the scope of products that would be affected, tariff rates, and possible exemptions.The commerce department was weighing a 25% rate on chip content, and 15% for electronics from Japan and the EU, though figures were still preliminary, a source told the agency.If implemented, the policy would apply to a broad range of consumer goods, from toothbrushes to laptops, potentially raising costs for US households.Economists warned it could also worsen inflation. According to Michael Strain, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, the move would push up consumer prices ""at a time when the US has an inflationary problem, with inflation clearly above the Fed's target and accelerating.""He added that even domestically produced goods could get costlier due to higher tariffs on imported inputs.Trump has already rolled out sweeping tariffs this year, including 100% duties on branded drugs and 25% on heavy-duty trucks. Earlier in April, his administration launched probes into pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, calling foreign reliance a national security threat.A potential exemption linked to investments in US manufacturing, dollar-for-dollar credits only if a company shifts half its production to America, has been discussed but not finalised.Meanwhile, earlier proposals to exempt chipmaking tools faced pushback from the White House, with sources saying Trump dislikes carve-outs.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, the world’s biggest non-US chipmakers, could be among the hardest hit.","The US commerce department would calculate tariffs as a percentage of the product’s estimated chip value.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Divorce trends in Kuwait : Rising cases and new patterns





Marriage and divorce numbers: Contrasting realities in Kuwait





Ministry of Justice steps up family support and prevention efforts





Raising awareness and inter agency cooperation in Kuwait









Between January and July 2025, Kuwait witnessed a significant number of divorces among its citizens, with detailed statistics revealing new patterns in family dynamics. Despite these rising divorce figures, marriage rates remain robust. In response, the Ministry of Justice has implemented improved mediation strategies aimed at preserving family cohesion and addressing underlying social challenges.New data from Kuwait’s Ministry of Justice highlights 222 cases of khula (divorce initiated by wives) recorded between January 1 and July 31, 2025. Notably, 287 Kuwaiti women divorced before consummation of their marriages in the same period, outnumbering those who divorced after cohabitation. This suggests a shift in marital dissolution patterns, where many separations occur early on, even before couples fully start married life.Additionally, 439 cases involved Kuwaiti husbands divorcing one wife while remaining married to one or more other wives, reflecting complexities in polygamous family structures that still exist in the country.Despite the rising divorce figures, marriage rates among Kuwaitis remain strong.The Ministry of Justice reports a total of 5,993 marriages between Kuwaiti nationals in the first seven months of 2025. Over 75% of these marriages involved Kuwaiti citizens on both sides, underscoring the continued social importance of marriage in Kuwaiti society.However, divorces are not limited to recent marriages. The statistics reveal a total of 2,666 divorces during 2025 involving couples married in previous years. This indicates that many dissolutions happen after longer periods of marriage, pointing to challenges that affect families over time rather than only during the initial stages.In response to these developments, a responsible source at the Ministry of Justice confirmed the recent adoption of an enhanced framework aimed at reducing divorce rates. Central to this effort is the strengthening of marital reconciliation centers across Kuwait.These centers now operate with a multidisciplinary team comprising sociologists, family counselors, and religious scholars who actively engage with couples to mediate disputes before they escalate into divorce. Their role is to provide guidance, conflict resolution, and counseling tailored to the social and cultural context of Kuwaiti families.Beyond mediation, the Ministry emphasizes broad inter-agency collaboration to educate newly married couples about critical social risks. A key focus is raising awareness about the impact of drug abuse on families, a factor increasingly recognized for its potential to destabilize marriages and harm children.Officials also highlight the growing importance of informing couples about the social and psychological consequences of divorce, aiming to promote healthier, more stable family dynamics and reduce the strain on individuals and society.","Between January and July 2025, Kuwait recorded 2,666 divorces, including 222 khula and 287 pre-consummation cases.

Pakistan economic setback : Poverty rate reaches 25%; here is what World Bank says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-economic-setback-poverty-rate-reaches-25-here-is-what-world-bank-says/articleshow/124072300.cms,"



The World Bank’s latest report shows that poverty in Pakistan has climbed past 25%, highlighting the urgent need for long-term, inclusive reforms to safeguard the nation’s most vulnerable communities.The report, ""Reclaiming Momentum Towards Prosperity: Pakistan's Poverty, Equity and Resilience Assessment,"" marks the first in-depth look at poverty and welfare in the country in over 20 years. Using more than two decades of household surveys, administrative records and spatial analysis, it paints a stark picture of growing inequality, the Dawn reported citing the report.Pakistan’s poverty rate has climbed 7% in three years, reaching 25.3% in 2024-25, after a long decline from 64.3% in 2001-02 to 21.9% in 2018-19. The World Bank links the reversal to multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, severe flooding and economic instability.The study also notes that previous poverty reduction was largely driven by a shift from farming to service-sector jobs. But the country’s economic transformation has been uneven, slowing job creation, productivity growth and economic diversification. Informal employment still dominates, making up more than 85% of all jobs, while women and young people remain largely excluded from the workforce, ANI reported citing Dawn.Social indicators are equally worrying. Nearly 40% of children are stunted, one-quarter of primary-aged children are out of school, and three-quarters of those attending struggle with basic reading skills. Access to clean water and sanitation is limited, with only half of households having safe drinking water and nearly a third lacking proper sanitation facilities.The World Bank also pointed to persistent regional inequality. Rural areas continue to suffer more than double the poverty seen in cities, and many historically underdeveloped districts remain trapped in the same conditions today, Dawn reported.","Pakistan’s poverty rate has climbed 7% in three years, reaching 25.3% in 2024-25.

Yunus discusses SAARC revival with US envoy Gor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/yunus-discusses-saarc-revival-with-us-ambassador-designate-to-india-sergio-gor/articleshow/124078736.cms,"File photos





While it’s well known that Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived, he has now raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia.Yunus met Gor on the margins of the ongoing UNGA session in New York. According to Dhaka, the chief advisor noted that the interim government has intensified efforts to revive SAARC, which has not held a summit in over a decade.SAARC summits are held biennially but the process has remained stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. The Uri terrorist attack in 2016 put paid to the summit that Pakistan was scheduled to host that year and India has since maintained Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism has made unfeasible the SAARC dialogue, including summits and important meetings.However, India has continued to support SAARC activities in diverse sectors for closer cooperation and blamed Pakistan for blocking trade and connectivity initiatives in the region. While it hasn’t withdrawn from the Association, India has sought to strengthen regional cooperation through the BIMSTEC grouping in which Pakistan is not a member.The US readout said regional cooperation was discussed but didn’t specifically mention SAARC.Bangladesh didn’t say what Gor’s response was to Yunus’ remarks on SAARC but India will be wary of any external pressure to resume the summit process. The idea of Pakistan hosting even a virtual summit has been rendered a non-starter because of the Pahalgam terrorist attack that led to a dramatic military clash between India and Pakistan.India sees the appointment of Gor as ambassador by the Trump administration as a welcome development but will guard against any US attempt to intrude into South Asian affairs through Gor’s dual role, particularly if it has any security fallout for the region. India is already worried about security challenges that Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan might entail. It has shown little interest so far in Yunus’ efforts to, as he said earlier, revive the spirit of SAARC.While countries like Bangladesh and Nepal seek a resumption of the summit process, India maintains that there has been no material change in the situation since the 19th summit that Pakistan had to host was postponed and that there’s no consensus among members on the meeting.India closely followed a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral meeting at Kunming, taking note of reports that this was an effort to create a new bloc in the region, However, Dhaka later denied this was an effort to forge an alliance against any country.Yunus also discussed with Gor the Rohingya crisis, and the “proliferation of disinformation targeting Dhaka”. Yunus has in the past described as fake news some of the reports in Indian media about targeting of Hindus in Bangladesh .According to Dhaka, Yunus also expressed Bangladesh’s interest in joining ASEAN, stating that integration with Southeast Asian economies could significantly accelerate the country’s development. He told Gor Dhaka ismaking “comprehensive preparations” to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful general election in the first half of February.","Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived.
