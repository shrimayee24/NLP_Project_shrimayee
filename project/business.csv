NEW DELHI: With the worst of the air quality days linked to stubble burning yet to come in Delhi-NCR , the Centre on Saturday advised Punjab and Haryana to strategically plan and handle the situation by deploying all necessary resources in the hotspot districts where burning episodes may likely occur in coming days.The issue was discussed during an inter-ministerial meeting at Krishi Bhawan where officials apprehended the burning episodes may increase in the next fortnight coinciding with the pace of harvest operations in both Punjab and Haryana even as both the states have, so far, reported a lower number of such incidents compared to last year. The slow pace of harvest is linked to depressed procurement operations in Punjab where millers have been facing storage and paddy quality issues.Since firecrackers are also responsible for deteriorating air quality around Diwali every year, the participants also discussed how to deal with it by strictly adhering to the Supreme Court's order through proactive measures and creating public awareness.Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who attended the meeting virtually, said though the episodes of stubble burning had reduced by 35% in Punjab and 21% in Haryana compared to the corresponding period in 2023, there was a need to further decrease the number using multiple interventions for both in-situ and ex-situ management of paddy straw.He said it was the efforts of all stakeholders that brought down the stubble burning episodes by 51% compared to 2017, and appealed to states to promote bio-decomposer in mission mode.A detailed presentation on how the issue of stubble burning is being handled was made by agriculture secretary Devesh Chaturvedi during the meeting. The participants were informed that the Centre has, so far, this year released Rs 150 crore for paddy straw management to Punjab, Rs 75 crore to Haryana, Rs 50 crore to UP and over Rs 8 crore to 'Krishi Vigyan Kendras' out of total Rs 600 crore earmarked for this purpose during 2024-25.Besides Chouhan, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, Delhi's environment minister Gopal Rai, and agriculture ministers of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh also joined the meeting virtually. Haryana officials shared details of various incentives which are being provided to farmers in the state to deal with the problem through ex-situ/in-situ management of biomass and crop diversification.Punjab and Haryana have this year estimated generation of 19.5 million tonne and 8 million tonne of paddy straw respectively. Punjab is learnt to have promised to manage 11.5 million tonne of its paddy straw through in-situ crop residue management using crop residue management (CRM) machines and the rest via ex-situ methods.Similarly, Haryana has plans to manage 3.3 million tonne through in-situ and the remainder through ex-situ measures such as strengthening the supply chain of stubble as resources to small industries in briquetting and pelletizing operations to enhance the economic use of paddy straw.States have over the years supported farmers and custom hiring centres for procuring three lakh subsidised CRM machines under the crop residue management scheme of the agriculture ministry.",The Centre has advised Punjab and Haryana to strategically plan and handle the situation. Officials apprehended the burning episodes may increase in the next fortnight. The slow pace of harvest is linked to depressed procurement operations in Punjab.

"Pay Rs 2.5 lakh to man illegally arrested, court tells cops",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pay-rs-2-5-lakh-to-man-illegally-arrested-court-tells-cops/articleshow/114638978.cms,"CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court has ordered the complainant policeman and investigation officer to compensate a man arrested under a repealed law, calling the action “illegal” and a violation of his rights to personal liberty .The high court on Oct 23 ordered the investigating officer, police inspector Narendra Padalkar, to pay Rs2 lakh, and the complainant, constable Pandit Tare, to pay Rs50,000 to petitioner Ashwinkumar Sanap (43).Bhushan Dhawale, who represented Sanap in court, said he was arrested on Aug 6 under sections 66A and 66B of Information Technology (IT) Act, despite Section 66A being declared unconstitutional in the 2015 Shreya Singhal vs Union of India judgment. The FIR, filed on June 27, 2024, also included Section 500 of IPC, a non-cognizable offence that requires a direct complaint to a magistrate. “It was after arresting Sanap and producing him before the magistrate, the police realised that 66A and 66B were not applicable. They subsequently added 67A of the IT Act,” Dhawale said.The HC division bench, comprising Justice Vibha Kankanwadi and Justice SG Chapalgaonkar, observed that “this arrest is made at midnight, it is in total violation of the personal liberty enshrined under the Constitution of India”.Criticising Padalkar, the HC noted that “it is beyond imagination that before the arrest, the investigating officer will not apply his mind, as to which are the sections that are invoked”.It said, “The realisation of the wrong section, after the arrest of a person, would be a suicide attempt by an investigating officer, because he is bound to follow the law before and at the time of effecting arrest.”The bench further noted that even the magistrate failed to exercise due diligence when presented with Sanap for custody. Citing the SC’s decisions in Arnesh Kumar vs State of Bihar and Satender Kumar Antil vs CBI, the HC observed that both magistrates and investigating officers were bound to assess if an arrest was justified before granting custody.Highlighting issues of procedural negligence, the court said Sanap was held despite the fact that “Section 67-A of the IT Act was not at all attracted, taking into consideration the facts of the case”. The HC division bench noted that respondent Tare, Sanap’s former brother-in-law, lodged the FIR “with mala fide intention” because of a family dispute.Sanap, who had separated from Tare’s sister, allegedly sent a defamatory WhatsApp message to a relative. The court observed that because WhatsApp “is end-to-end encrypted, the sender cannot intend for a private message to be public, unless the recipient forwards it”.Addressing the implications for judicial integrity, the HC said, “We deprecate such kind of practice,” admonishing lower courts. It expressed concern over an observed trend of magistrates “passing mechanical orders.” The HC ordered that a copy of the judgment be sent to the superintendent of police, Hingoli, for review and potential action in accordance with SC guidelines in the case of Arnesh Kumar.","Ashwinkumar Sanap was arrested on Aug 6 under sections 66A and 66B of Information Technology (IT) Act.

Gujarati now third most-spoken Indian language in Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarati-now-third-most-spoken-indian-language-in-canada/articleshow/114638545.cms,":

AhmedabadGujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada, following Punjabi and Hindi . According to data from Statistics Canada , around 87,900 Gujarati-speaking immigrants have settled in Canada since 1980, with a notable 26% of them arriving in the country between 2016 and 2021.During this latter period, Punjabi speakers constituted the largest linguistic group at 75,475, followed by Hindi speakers at 35,170. Gujarati speakers ranked third, with 22,935 immigrants, while Malayalam and Bengali speakers followed with 15,440 and 13,835, respectively.The data also revealed that Gujarati immigrants experienced the second-highest decadal growth among major linguistic groups, with a 26% increase between 2011 and 2021, following a 22% rise among Punjabi speakers. Hindi speakers saw a dramatic growth of 114% during the same period. Kutchi — another language from Gujarat — also featured in the statistics, with a decrease in migration from 460 speakers between 2001 and 2010 to 370 from 2011 to 2021.The migration trend for Gujaratis surged after 2011 as Canada became a favoured alternative to US and other English-speaking countries. “US was a hot favourite for decades, but people struggled with visa processing and high costs. With UK, Australia, and New Zealand also introducing restrictions, Canada’s easier permanent residency process and lower educational costs made it an attractive option for students,” immigration consultant Sameer Yadav said.To put this growth into perspective, the number of Gujarati-speaking immigrants was 13,365 between 1991 and 2000, rising to 29,620 in the following decade, and reaching 37,405 from 2011 to 2021.However, recent changes to immigration policies have raised concerns within the community. Increased housing challenges, job market saturation, and stricter permanent residency requirements have already led to an alarming 80% drop in visa applications for Canada from Gujarat, according to a visa consultant in Ahmedabad.“With fewer visa opportunities, enquiries from students and professionals have dramatically declined, with most applications now coming from those who already hold Canadian PR seeking to bring over family members,” the consultant said.","Gujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada.

US sends back a planeload of illegal Indian immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-sends-back-a-planeload-of-illegal-indian-immigrants/articleshow/114633377.cms,"NEW DELHI: The United States earlier this week sent back a plane load of illegal Indian immigrants to India, according to an announcement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Indian govt sources here said that the deportation by a chartered plane was a result of cooperation with the US on migration and mobility .DHS said a large-frame charter removal flight was conducted on Oct 22 to India of Indian nationals who did not establish legal basis to remain in the United States.

The latest deportation of Indian nationals by a chartered flight is a result of this cooperation,” said an official, adding such deportations have been happening for several years.Since June 2024, DHS said, it removed or returned over 160,000 individuals and operated more than 495 international repatriation flights to more than 145 countries — including India.The Indian govt said in Parliament last year that according to data published by US Customs and Border Protection on their website, the number of illegal Indian immigrants encountered by US authorities in 2023 was 96,917. The annual India-US Consular Dialogue is a mechanism through which both countries discuss consular issues of mutual interest including ensuring safe and legal migration.DHS said it regularly engages with foreign govts throughout the hemisphere and around the world to accept repatriations of their nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States.“This is one tool among many DHS uses to reduce irregular migration, promote the use of safe, lawful, and orderly pathways, and hold transnational criminal networks accountable for smuggling and exploitation of vulnerable people,” it said.",The deportation by a chartered plane was a result of cooperation with the US on migration and mobility.

NEW DELHI: Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) chief S. Somanath on Saturday praised Elon Musk and SpaceX for successfully catching a giant Starship booster with 'chopsticks', stating that Musk was ""a great man doing fantastic work"".Addressing the Convocation day of IIIT-Delhi, Somanath expressed admiration for Musk's transformative impact on the space industry.He noted that Musk's innovative approaches, particularly with SpaceX's recent rocket recovery methods, have sparked global interest and comparisons with Isro's capabilities. Somanath emphasised that while there is a competitive spirit to match Musk's achievements, the inspiration drawn from his work is significant for the future of India's space endeavors.""Musk is making heads turn with the type of rockets that he has captured with the chopsticks recently and people are asking when Isro is going to do this ... Everyone is looking at Musk, what he is doing there and how we can come up with some fantastic idea that we can beat him. Of course, everybody wants to beat him, but he is above all of that. I think he is such a great man doing fantastic work. We are all inspired by this work. It is because of this that the space is becoming very attractive today,"" said the Isro chief.On October 13, SpaceX made significant advancements in rocket recovery technology with its innovative ""chopsticks"" system, successfully demonstrated during the fifth test flight of its Starship. This technique represents a pivotal step towards achieving rapid reusability in spaceflight.It is expected to facilitate not only more frequent launches but also lower costs associated with space travel. Estimates suggest that Starship could eventually bring launch costs down to under $10 per kilogram, a dramatic reduction compared to previous systems like the Space Shuttle.Somanath highlighted the growing enthusiasm among young people for space exploration, attributing this trend to advancements in technology and increased accessibility. ""Young people are looking at space with great passion. We are looking at it in a manner in which the technology is becoming accessible to people ... The application domain is growing. Also, its impact on the economy, employability, and job creation is growing. These domains are very important and that's why the government has recently taken the initiative to open up the space sector, bringing in more private investment and private participation,"" he added.The recent reforms are pivotal in transforming India's space landscape. They allow for 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in various segments of the space industry, which is expected to significantly boost the Indian space economy from its current valuation of approximately $8 billion to an ambitious $100 billion by 2040. The establishment of the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center (IN-SPACe) has been crucial in this transition, providing a regulatory framework that enables private companies to engage more actively in space activities.Somanath pointed out that while certain aspects of space technology will remain regulated, there is a pressing need to democratize access to application domains.""It's a domain that cannot be kept controlled and regulated. Of course, there is some knowledge that needs to be controlled and regulated, but the application domains, doing work, creating value in this have to get out of those vaults that have been covering the space systems,"" said Somanath.Moreover, he acknowledged that ISRO continues to play a central role in India's space ambitions while encouraging private players to contribute significantly.

"Agent Vikash: Wanted by FBI, but patriot to his village",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agent-vikash-wanted-by-fbi-but-patriot-to-his-village/articleshow/114599403.cms,"Vikash Yadav’s house in Pranpura is harder to reach than to find. It’s only after clearing a couple of verification rounds from locals that the large iron gate that hides most of the single-storey house with a pink fence — on the last line of settlements beyond which lies typically shrub-speckled Aravali terrain — parts. But there’s no going in unaccompanied.“Sensitive matter,” we are told by a group playing cards that is our first ‘check point’.“No cameras, please, and no recording on the mobile phone,” we are subsequently told by our local escort who agrees to show us the way.Sporadically seen and rarely heard from, Vikash is as inconspicuous as he could be in Pranpura, just one among hundreds of its youths who took up jobs and left and return only to visit family. This changed last week, sensationally.On Oct 17, Vikash shot to the top of an unravelling international diplomatic row after the United States department of justice revealed it had brought murder-for-hire charges against him for the attempted assassination of New York-based separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. Vikash, according to the American indictment, was also aware of the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , another separatist, last year in Canada, which has brought a chill in New Delhi-Ottawa ties after the Justin Trudeau govt alleged Indian govt agencies were involved.Though the US indictment refers to Vikash as an Indian govt official — employed by the cabinet secretariat that oversees R&AW — New Delhi has denied it, saying Vikash had been dismissed from service. In a recent statement, Union ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Vikash Yadav is no longer an employee of govt of India.”Pranpura and Vikash’s family believe neither.The watch has been necessitated by journalists landing up and making inquiries about Vikash since the US indictment revealed his name as a co-conspirator (CC1). Pranpura, part of a cluster of villages in Haryana’s Rewari district near the industrial town of Bawal, is 105 km to Delhi’s south, but not on any of the state or national highways that crisscross the region. In this place of familiar faces and routines, the American revelation creased many brows for two reasons — that Vikash was now wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the indictment’s implication that he was working as an Indian spy.“How do you know what the Americans are saying is true?” shot back Sudesh. In her 60s, Vikash’s mother spoke from behind the gate after our escort, Rajeev, called out to her. Sudesh, and anyone else you talk to in the village, insist Vikash has always been and remains a govt employee.“My son works for the country and our govt will take care of him,” said Sudesh, who knows little else about Vikash’s job except that he is a “CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) commandant”.It’s how the rest of Pranpura — which prides itself as a ‘fauji gaon’ (Army village) with a martyrs’ memorial next to the panchayat office its most prominent landmark — knows Vikash too. Like many of them, Rajeev, a neighbour of Sudesh, brushed off the Pannun plot revelation, calling Vikash “a patriot who serves the country”.Vikash, now 39, was born in a ‘fauji’ household in the mid-80s. His father Ram Singh Yadav was in the BSF and died of a heart attack in 2007 when he was posted in Tripura. The family moved around the North East with Yadav senior’s postings, so Vikash and Ajay did their schooling in different places, including Shillong . But both completed their graduation from Ahir College in Rewari.Ajay is now posted in Gurgaon as a police head constable. His wife and two children live with Sudesh. Vikash’s family — wife and one-year-old daughter — is in Delhi.“Our family has always served the country,” said Sudesh. “I don’t believe Vikash committed any crime.” Vikash, added Sudesh, does not visit home regularly and “calls once in a while”. “I don’t know where he and his family are right now. He hasn’t contacted us,” she said, declining comment on media reports that Vikash had spoken to his family after his name as CC-1 was revealed and rubbished the charges.Sudesh said she also had no idea about his arrest last year by Delhi Police. The arrest on Dec 18 by Delhi Police’s Special Cell, on charges of extortion and kidnapping of a businessman from Rohini, followed the first indictment in the Pannun plot probe by the department of justice last Nov. Vikash spent three months in custody before a Delhi court granted him six days of interim bail on March 22 to see his daughter who was undergoing treatment for acute respiratory infection.The court order described Vikash as an “ex-govt employee with clean antecedents”. On April 22, Vikash was granted regular bail with no objection from the prosecution.A Central Administrative Tribunal principal bench order dated Nov 29, 2023 shows Vikash was appointed senior field officer (SFO) of Aviation Research Centre (ARC) in the executive cadre of Directorate General of Security (cabinet secretariat) on Oct 9, 2023 after the completion of probation. ARC is part of R&AW. Vikash knocked on CAT’s door for permanent appointment after working as a probationer in the agency since Nov 2015.In May, soon after his release from prison, Vikash visited Pranpura, the last time Sudesh claims she saw him. “He came here alone and stayed for a couple of days. He didn’t tell me that he was arrested,” Sudesh said.Vikash, neighbour Rajeev offered, hardly left his home during visits, so interactions with him since he began working were rare. “He was good in academics and a fitness freak,” Rajeev said.A local resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity said no one in India would see Vikash as a criminal, even if the US indictment is true. “Pannun is a wanted accused in India and America does not want to hand him over to us. They also did not hand over (26/11 Mumbai terror attacks accused) David Headley, who is a terrorist. Assuming Vikash is an Indian officer, why should India hand him over for doing his job?” he said. Another villager said since the US indictment named Vikash, police had visited the sarpanch and made some inquiries. “No security has been posted here as they felt it is not required in our village. It is safe here,” said a neighbour of Sudesh.“We will wait and watch. What else can we do?” said a neighbour. “Sarkar dekh legi.”How do you know what the Americans are saying is true, asks Vikash’s mother Sudesh, speaking from behind the gate of their house at Pranpura in Rewari. She insists, along with others from the village, that he is a patriot and a govt employee, calling the US’s murder-for-hire allegations ‘false’.","Vikash Yadav shot to the top of an unravelling international diplomatic row after the United States department of justice revealed it had brought murder- for-hire charges against him.

However, as per NIA sources, the Canadian authorities posed some counter-queries, including why the death certificate of its citizen should be sought by India. “After that, they refused to share his death certificate,” said an officer.Nijjar’s murder had triggered a diplomatic row with the Canadian govt alleging the role of Indian agencies, a charge promptly and stoutly denied by New Delhi. The row had recently escalated with Canada naming senior Indian diplomats as “persons of interest” in the Nijjar murder investigation, and India retaliating by withdrawing those diplomats from the country.NIA is also yet to succeed in securing an Interpol red-corner notice against another pro-Khalistan rabble rouser and designated terrorist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who is a US citizen. NIA is investigating six cases of Khalistani terror against Pannun and has attached three of his properties — across Chandigarh, Amritsar and Pathankot — so far on grounds of being proceeds of terrorism. Interestingly, there was an attempt on Pannun’s life in the US in New York in June 2023, prompting the US to claim the involvement of an Indian official.Last week, an unsealed indictment showed that the US had charged Vikash Yadav, described as a former officer in India’s Research and Analysis Wing spy service, with directing the plot against the Sikh separatist.","NIA had approached Canada for Nijjar’s death certificate to fulfil the legal requirement of updating the courts here in view of the cases that were pending against him.

CHENNAI: Around 160 passengers onboard an IndiGo flight from Jaipur on Saturday were puzzled as the flight took off soon after touching down at Chennai airport . Airport authorities clarified that it was due to the long float of the flight into the runway caused by crosswinds .The flight touched down at the main runway beyond the threshold point. The alert pilot, realising the flight might not have enough runway space to slow down, decided to take off immediately. However, nothing untoward happened to the passengers in the incident.The flight (6E265) from Jaipur usually reaches Chennai at 1.05 pm. On Saturday, it arrived a little earlier and was about to land at 12.45pm.

What will be the format of the league and how many events will feature in it?

How many countries will be invited?

What may be the overall budget for the entire league?

In terms of timelines, when are you planning to have the league?

NEW DELHI: National Rifle Association of India ( NRAI ) recently announced the sport's first-ever franchise-based league in the country - Shooting League of India .The league has the approval from the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF), the sport's global governing body. The first edition is likely to take place in March next year. NRAI president Kalikesh Narayan Singh Deo spoke to TOI and talked about the modalities involved.As you are aware, shooting has traditionally sent the largest contingent to the Olympics and the Asian Games, producing the largest medal winners. This is an opportune time for the league to take place. The format will ensure that the league becomes exciting, financially viable and spectator-friendly.We are in the process of dealing with the ISSF. We need to have a format where the franchises would have the freedom to select a certain number of foreign athletes, a certain number of India's topshooters as well as some junior stars who would be part of the league so that we can give proper exposure. Shooting is one of those rare sports where you can have mixed events and traditionally, India has been very good at mixed events. Therefore, I am sure the format would incorporate some mixed events going forward.I think the priority of setting up a league is many fold. One is to increase the visibility of the sport of shooting.Two is to give an additional platform to our shooters to be able to compete and get financially supported. And, of course, to increase the number of resources coming into the sport, both to the shooters as well as federation. The league has to be viable not only for the federation and shooters, but to our franchise owners.We intend to close on the formation of the league and hopefully sign on franchises in the next few months to be able to conduct the league in March next year.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public. Musk has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-96413764,imgsize-26192,width-400,resizemode-4/96413764.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Yum! Brands Inc and Burger King removed onions from some of their locations as the restaurant industry investigates an E. Coli outbreak first traced to McDonald’s Corp.Yum withdrew fresh onions from some Taco Bell , Pizza Hut and KFC locations “out of an abundance of caution,” the company said Thursday in a statement to Bloomberg News, without disclosing which stores and regions were affected or naming suppliers.“We will continue following supplier and regulatory guidance to ensure the ongoing safety and quality of our food,” the company said.Burger King said Thursday that it gets some of its onions from a Colorado facility run by Taylor Farms, which supplied the McDonald’s restaurants that have been impacted by the outbreak.Taylor Farms issued a recall of some its yellow onion batches despite finding no traces of E. coli as of Wednesday. Restaurant distributors US Foods Holding Corp and Sysco Corp have also notified customers of the recall.“Despite no contact from health authorities and no indications of illness, we proactively asked our 5% of restaurants who received whole onions distributed by this facility to dispose of them immediately two days ago and we are in the process of restocking them from other facilities,” Burger King said.Fat Brands Inc, owner of restaurants including Johnny Rockets, said it pulled all of Taylor Farms’ fresh onion products.“We have identified an extremely limited number of Buffalo’s Cafe locations and Ponderosa and Bonanza Steakhouses that are currently utilizing Taylor Farms as a supplier for onions,” the company said in a statement Thursday.The restaurant industry is on alert after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that an E. coli outbreak likely tied to pre-slivered onions served on McDonald’s Quarter Pounders sickened dozens of people in the US and killed one. Burger King said it buys whole onions that are cut, peeled and sliced in its restaurants.McDonald’s pulled the popular product from about 20% of its more than 13,000 US restaurants, and it’s working with health authorities to confirm the source of the contamination.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc said in a statement Thursday that it doesn’t source onions from Taylor Farms or any ingredients from the Colorado facility.Inspire Brands Inc, which owns Arby’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, Sonic, Jimmy John’s, Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin’, said its onions don’t come from the facility.

The address of their news purchase is not a secret and there's a beeline of journalists, paparazzi, fans around their house. On top of that, David Beckham is often on the roof or the balcony to the cheers of his admirers.Reports said celebrities often set up a limited liability company to purchase their home so that the address is not disclosed and the publicly known address remains the attorney's office where the limited liability company is registered. But Victoria and David Beckham did not take that route and bought the Miami property under their own name and the address is available in the phone book.Nearby residents claim that the area has been clogged with inquisitive eyes who turn up to get a glimpse of David and Victoria. And it's it's not difficult. They just look up the address in the phone book.Other stars in the area include Shaika and Barry Gibb but their addresses are private. “The whole world is driving by, paparazzi are there, the houses are all over the Web, and the neighbors are concerned for safety,” said an insider, as quoted in reports.“They wish the Beckhams hadn’t used their real name. Miami’s neighborhoods aren’t Beverly Hills — it’s a lot of private, non-famous families.”“They don’t want unnecessary public attention,” they added.Beckhams' new mansion has 13 bathrooms, an outdoor kitchen, a rooftop lounge and 124 ft of frontage on Biscayne Bay including a mooring area for boats. Earlier this month, a local property source claimed that Beckhams' offer on the property had been accepted and they plan to move in early next year, Daily Mail reported.The Beckhams are not new in Miami.

We have taken a number of initiatives to address the matter and now we are planning for artificial rain in the city.""She, however, did not declare any date for it.The Punjab government , led by Maryam Nawaz, has launched the 'Anti-Smog Squad' to monitor areas affected by smog as this hazardous pollution has caused significant health problems for city residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation, and skin infections.These squads will be educating farmers about alternative methods for residue disposal, the hazards of burning crop residues and promoting the use of super seeders.Smog is a specific phenomenon that arises from a mixture of smoke and fog, occurring when certain polluting microparticles combine with cold, moist air and linger near the ground. This results in reduced visibility and can lead to various health problems.Previously, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had also called for ""climate diplomacy"" with India to mitigate smog impact in the province.She said that stubble burning in Punjab, India also impacts across the border because of air direction and hence both sides should make joint efforts to combat smog.""This issue needs to be taken up with India forthwith,"" she said.""Obstacles to environmental improvement must be removed. Smog causes breathing difficulties and damages eyesight,"" the CM added.Meteorology plays an important role in determining the level of air pollution in north Pakistan, just as it is a major factor in the neighbouring region of northwest India. After the rainy season crop is harvested, farmers from both sides tend to burn stubble adding to the existing causes of pollution caused due to industrial emissions and transport.Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, the Environment Ministry said,""The positive effects of the measures taken to combat smog will become visible in 8 to 10 years. Environmental protection has been included as a subject in the curriculum in the province.”She also urged the farmers to avoid burning the crop residues, as it harms not only the crops but also their children's health.","Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world on Monday with an alarming AQI of 394.

Mohamed Muizzu is introducing a mandatory 10% pay cut to most public sector jobs, leading the belt-tightening with the biggest salary reduction , his office said in a statement.A government source told AFP that Muizzu's annual salary will be reduced to 600,000 rufiyaa ($39,087) from next year - down from 1.2 million rufiyaa but nearly double the average household income of 316,740 rufiyaa per year, according to a 2016 census. Judges and lawmakers in parliament will be exempt from the cuts, though Muizzu's office said he expects them to share the burden by agreeing to a 10% cut voluntarily.Two weeks ago, Muizzu sacked more than 225 political appointees , including ministers, in a bid to reduce expenditure. Among those sacked were seven state ministers, 43 deputy ministers, and 178 political directors. The move is expected to save the country about $370,000 a month. The Maldives said in September that its financial troubles were ""temporary"" and that it had no plans to seek an IMF bailout .","Mohamed Muizzu is introducing a mandatory 10% pay cut to most public sector jobs.

"Scabies Outbreak: UK reports spike in Scabies, doctors urge public to shed 'social stigma' and come forward",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-reports-spike-in-scabies-doctors-urge-public-to-shed-social-stigma-and-come-forward/articleshow/114566086.cms,"England is reporting a spike Scabies cases with health authorities warning the public not to ignore the highly infectious skin disease despite "" social stigma "" preventing people from opening out, BBC reported. The disease is caused by a mite which burrows under the skin to lay eggs and is contaminated through physical contact, bedding and clothes.BBC quoted the Royal College of GPs RCGP as urging public to take necessary precaution, which is now spreading quickly in crowded places such as universities and care homes. The doctors also urged people to shed off the ""social stigma"" attached to it and come forward to address the disease.The report also quoted professor Kamila Hawthorne, RCGP chairwoman as saying while incidences remained infrequent, the number of GP diagnoses was ""above the five-year average and rising, with the north of England seeing a spike in cases"".""While not a serious condition, scabies can be very itchy and irritating,"" she said.""If not properly treated, it can spread and increase a patient’s risk of complications, such as secondary skin infections or make existing skin conditions worse.""According to NHS data , 3,689 cases of scabies were diagnosed in hospitals across England in the year ending in April, marking a rise from 2,128 cases the previous year.The report gathered accounts from students at five universities who reported clusters of scabies cases that seemed to appear ""out of nowhere,"" with entire households affected.One student described was quoted as noticing ""tiny red dots"" spreading along his wrist and later discovered a housemate had also contracted scabies, prompting him to realize he had it as well. Another student said he had been struggling to eliminate the infection for ""two to three months"" and speculated that ""sleeping together"" may have been the cause.Professor Hawthorne advised that, despite any stigma associated with scabies, people should not ignore their symptoms, as delaying treatment can worsen the condition and increase the risk of transmission.Medical professionals in the UK have recommend that all individuals infected receive simultaneous treatment with a pharmacy cream or lotion. Bedding and clothing should also be washed at a high temperature to reduce reinfection risk.","3,689 cases of scabies diagnosed in hospitals across England in the year ending in April, marking a rise from 2,128 cases the previous year.

LONDON: British head of state King Charles III 's remote private estate in the Scottish Highlands could become an exclusive location for weddings, if an application to the local council is approved.Documents submitted for consideration next week by the Licensing Board of the local Aberdeenshire Council outline plans to allow ""weddings, dinners, meetings and associated events"" at the Queen's Building on the royal Balmoral Estate .The Queen's Building lies just north of Balmoral Castle near the estate's office and stables, and was built in the 1980s as staff quarters and a canteen.It was converted last year to accommodate dining for visitors.If approved at next Wednesday's meeting, the venue could host up to 277 guests inside, with a further 144 on an outside patio.Permission to sell alcohol and play music is also part of the application, which was submitted on April 30, the documents showed.""These events may involve live performances and dancing, where alcohol may be sold up to 12:30 am. These events will be rare throughout the year,"" the application added.A spokesman for the estate said on Thursday that there were ""no plans for Balmoral to host weddings as a commercial venture"".Balmoral, set in 50,000 acres (20,000 hectares) of sprawling grouse moors, forest and farmland, is located around 50 miles (30 kilometres) west of Aberdeen and was the late Queen Elizabeth II's favourite royal residence.She died there on September 8, 2022, aged 96 after a period of ill health.Privately owned by the monarch, the castle was bought by Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert in the mid-19th century and has since become a favoured summer retreat for the royals.Its grounds have been open to the public for many years and provision for tourists has gradually increased in recent times, with holiday cottages and Land Rover tours of the estate.This year the rest of the venue was opened to visitors for the first time, billed as part of plans by King Charles III to give a better insight into royal life.Tickets for the guided tours were snapped up within 24 hours of going on sale, despite prices upwards of £100 ($130).","Application to allow weddings at King Charles III's Balmoral Estate in Scottish Highlands.
