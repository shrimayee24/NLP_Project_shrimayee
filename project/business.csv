India capitalof untreated diabetics: Lancet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-capitalof-untreated-diabetics-lancet/articleshow/115274307.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: India has the highest number of persons with untreated diabetes, claims a new study published in The Lancet medical journal.According to the study, an estimated 828 million adults (aged 18 years and older) had diabetes in 2022. Of these, over a quarter (212 million) lived in India, followed by 148 million in China, 42 million in the US, 36 million in Pakistan, 25 million in Indonesia, and 22 million in Brazil.The study was carried out by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) — a global network of health scientists that provides rigorous and timely data on risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) for 200 countries and territories, in collaboration with WHO.Senior author professor Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London, said the study highlights widening global inequalities in diabetes, with treatment rates stagnating in many low- and middle-income countries where numbers of adults with diabetes are drastically increasing.“This is especially concerning as people with diabetes tend to be younger in low-income countries and, in the absence of effective treatment, are at risk of life-long complications — including amputation, heart disease, kidney damage or vision loss — or in some cases, premature death,” Ezzati said.According to the study, global diabetes rates doubled in men (6.8% to 14.3%) and women (6.9% to 13.9%) between 1990 and 2022. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), experienced the largest increases while some higher-income countries, such as Japan, Canada and some countries in western Europe (eg. France, Spain and Denmark), saw no change or even a small decrease in diabetes rate over the past three decades.In India, the researchers pointed out, the diabetes rate nearly doubled in women and men. In women, it went up from 11.9% in 1990 to 24% in 2022. In men, it went up from 11.3% to 21.4% in the corresponding period. In comparison, the treatment coverage increased only marginally for both genders; 21.6% to 27.8% in women between 1990 and 2022 and 25.3% to 29.3% in men in the same period.Dr Sachin Kumar Jain , professor and HOD, department of endocrinology at Amrita Hospital, Faridabad, said India’s status is a sobering reality and highlights a pressing public health challenge. “The reasons behind this situation are multifactorial — limited access to healthcare facilities, socio-economic constraints, cultural perceptions and lack of awareness about diabetes,” he said,“From my experience as an endocrinologist, early detection and continuous care can drastically alter diabetes outcomes. Collaborative efforts between govt bodies, healthcare professionals, and community organisations are vital to mitigate the burden of untreated diabetes in India, improve health literacy, and deliver timely, equitable care across all geographies.”Dr Anoop Misra, chairman Fortis C-Doc, told TOI untreated diabetes is a serious problem. However, he added, that treatment coverage is unlikely to be less than 30%, as reflected in the Lancet study. “Many people opt for alternative therapies, some self-medicate and there are many others who try to deal with the condition by lifestyle modification until the condition worsens. All this is true and requires urgent action,” he said.","An estimated 828 million adults (aged 18 years and older) had diabetes in 2022.

First draft text on new post-2025 climate finance goals released,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-draft-text-on-new-post-2025-climate-finance-goals-released/articleshow/115274244.cms,"COP29

Albanian PM goes off script, speech creates a stir

Special envoy says US will continue path of decarbonisation

BAKU: With the first draft decision text on new post-2025 climate finance goals released at CO here on Wednesday, amid huge differences between rich and developing nations on the issue, UN climate body said developing countries would need $1.1-2.4 trillion annual investment by 2030, and up to $2.9 trillion till 2035, to meet mitigation goals.This could, at least, be an indication to negotiators of rich nations about requirement when developing countries have been struggling to get a deal on having at least $1.3 trillion a year from their developed counterparts with a significant provision component for adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage.Developing countries, however, don’t want it in the form of “investment” as currently much of climate finance discussions are focused on investments in mitigation actions.Though the new text has mentioned the amount ($1.3 trillion), it also carried the other much lesser options in brackets with caveats on the nature of climate finance which won’t be acceptable to developing countries.Developing countries expressed that climate finance should be “adequate, predictable, accessible, grant-based, low-interest and long-term”. The developed countries have, so far, not put in any numbers.Referring to the text, developing countries have already pointed out that it was an attempt to push weak language to avoid providing real grant-based finance. Negotiations at CO would, therefore, see more texts on a new climate finance goal — calledNew Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) — in the coming days for countries to thrash out their differences. In all probability, the more intense discussions for some convergence in the final text is expected next week when ministers are around.Albanian PM Edi Rama created a stir on Wednesday at CO, claiming that nothing had actually changed in the real world despite big appeals by leaders, who he blamed lacked common political will to go beyond words and unite for meaningful action. Citing an observation he had made a day before, Rama said he decided to leave aside his “well prepared speech” after watching the “silent TV” in the leaders’ lounge.“People there eat, drink, meet, and take photos together, while images of voiceless speeches from leaders play on and on and on in the background. To me, this seems exactly like what happens in the real world every day,” he said.Putting up a brave face amid the threat of dilution of climate actions under Donald Trump, the American special Presidential envoy for climate John Podesta said the US economy would continue down the path of decarbonisation, reducing emissions for years to come, because of historic private sector investments made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden.Delivering his nation’s statement here at CO, he said the US is on track to meet President Biden’s ambitious international public finance commitment of $11 billion per year by the end of 2024. He emphasised that the American negotiators would need to first conclude the key negotiated outcomes including Article 6 (carbon market) and a robust new climate finance target here at the climate conference.“It should be multi-layered with an ambitious, realistically achievable support layer involving new contributors ... underpinned by a set of qualitative elements that evolve the international financial architecture,” said Podesta in the context of the new post-2025 finance goal.","UN climate body said developing countries would need $1.1-2.4 trillion annual investment by 2030, and up to $2.9 trillion till 2035.

"For every rupee Isro spends, return is Rs 2.5, says space agency chief",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-every-rupee-isro-spends-return-is-rs-2-5-says-space-agency-chief/articleshow/115273716.cms,"Isro chairman S Somanath

NEW DELHI: A recent study by the Indian space agency on whether the money invested in the sector has benefitted society found that for every rupee that the organisation spent, the return is Rs 2.5, said Isro chairman S Somanath on Tuesday.At an interactive session with students of Karnataka Residential Educational Institutions Society, Somnath said Isro’s goal is to serve the country rather than to compete for supremacy among the spacefaring nations. “Going to the Moon is a costly affair. And we cannot depend only on the govt for funding. We must create business opportunities. If you have to sustain it, you have to create a use for it. Otherwise, after we do something, the govt will tell you to close down,” he said.Somanath was referring to the Socio-Economic Impact Analysis of Indian Space Programme, a report commissioned by Isro in collaboration with European space consultancy Novaspace that assessed the benefits of India’s space program. The report, however, talked about the returns the space sector was receiving in terms of dollars. The report, released by space minister Jitendra Singh on National Space Day, said the space sector has contributed $60 billion to India’s GDP between 2014 and 2024. For every dollar generated by the space sector, the Indian economy has seen a multiplier effect of $2.54.The Indian space sector’s revenues have grown to $6.3 billion as of 2023, making it the eighth-largest space economy in the world. It has created 4.7 million jobs, including 96,000 jobs in the public and private sector, it said.As of 2024, the Indian space economy is valued around Rs 6,700 crore ($8.4 billion), contributing 2%-3% of the global space economy which is expected to reach $13 billion by 2025 at compound annual growth (CAGR) of 6%. India aims to capture a 10% share of the global economy by the next decade.The total investment in Isro till date in the last 55 years since its inception is less than a single year’s budget of US space agency Nasa. Isro’s current annual budget is about $1.6 billion and Nasa’s current annual budget is $25 billion, which is about 15.5 times larger than India’s spending on space. India has over 400 private space companies — which was just 54 in 2020As per last estimates by Isro, a total of 127 Indian satellites, including those from private operators and academic institutions, have been launched till Dec 31, 2023. India has launched 97 rockets and sent 432 foreign satellites to space. It has three different rockets available for commercial launches. The report said Isro helps eight lakh fishermen daily and 140 crore Indians get the benefit of satellite-based weather forecasts. India’s spy satellites with 25cm resolution are among the best in the world.On the interplanetary exploration front, India made history by capturing the orbit of the Moon and Mars in its first attempts. India also soft-landed its Chandrayaan-3 lander Vikram near the Moon's unexplored south pole. India is at present studying the Sun 24x7 through the Aditya L-1 satellite .","Isro chairman S Somanath said Isro’s goal is to serve the country rather than to compete for supremacy among the spacefaring nations.

‘Executive’s abuse of power can’t be tolerated by courts’

NEW DELHI: Imposing a pan-India ban on instant ‘ bulldozer justice ’, Supreme Court on Wednesday said demolition of a citizen's house merely because he is an accused or even a convict, that too without following the due process as prescribed by law, will be “totally unconstitutional”. It laid down a lengthy process for razing illegal structures and ruled that a state cannot breach a family’s right to shelter by demolishing their house only because one of its members is accused of a heinous crime.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan, which had taken suo motu cognisance of demolition of houses and properties belonging to families of accused in many states, especially in Uttar Pradesh, ordered strict compliance of the SC-laid down procedure for removal of illegal structures and warned of serious consequences for officers indulging in wanton demolition of private properties.“Violation of any of the directions would lead to initiation of contempt proceedings in addition to prosecution of officers. If demolition is found to be in violation of orders of this court, the officers would be held responsible for restitution of the demolished property at his/their cost in addition to payment of damages,” the bench said.Beginning the 95-page judgment by quoting famous Hindi poet Pradeep to illuminate the importance of shelter for a family, Justice Gavai said, “The chilling sight of a bulldozer demolishing a building, when authorities have failed to follow the basic principles of natural justice and have acted without adhering to the principle of due process, reminds one of a lawless state of affairs, where ‘might was right’.”Justice Gavai pointed out that mere registration of an FIR naming a person, even in a heinous crime, did not erase his right embodied in the concept of ‘innocent till proven guilty in a court of law’. “The executive cannot pre-judge the guilt of an accused and pronounce a disproportionate punishment, that too demolition of a house,” he said.“In our Constitution, which rests on the foundation of ‘the rule of law’, such high-handed and arbitrary actions have no place. Such excesses at the hands of the executive will have to be dealt with by the heavy hand of the law. Our constitutional ethos and values would not permit any such abuse of power, and such misadventures cannot be tolerated by the court of law,” Justice Gavai said.The instant deployment of bulldozers to raze an accused person’s house, co-owned and inhabited by other members of the family who are innocent, amounted to “inflicting collective punishment on them without reason”, the apex court said and underlined that right to shelter is part of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.The bench raised several questions on the practice of bringing down of an accused person’s house.“Can the family be penalised by demolishing the property without them even being involved in any crime only based on them being related to an alleged accused person? What is their mistake if their relative is arrayed as an accused in some complaint or FIR?” it asked.“As is well known, a pious father may have a recalcitrant son and vice versa. Punishing such persons who have no connection with the crime by demolishing the house where they live in, or properties owned by them, is nothing but an anarchy and would amount to a violation of the right to life guaranteed under the Constitution,” it added.Justices Gavai and Viswanathan said under India’s constitutional scheme and criminal jurisprudence, it was impermissible to demolish a house belonging to a family merely because one of its members was involved in a crime because it amounted to “inflicting a collective punishment on the entire family or the families residing in such structure”.When solicitor general Tushar Mehta said every demolition has to be carried out in strict adherence to the procedure laid down, the bench said it has come to light that authorities have adopted a “pick and choose” attitude towards illegal structures, singling out those belonging to the accused while sparing similar ones in the vicinity. “When a particular structure is chosen all of a sudden for demolition and the rest of the similarly situated structures in the same vicinity are not even being touched, mala fide may loom large,” the bench said.“In such cases, where the authorities indulge in arbitrary pick and choose of structures and it is established that soon before initiation of such an action an occupant of the structure was found to be involved in a criminal case, a presumption could be drawn that the real motive for such demolition proceedings was not the illegal structure but an action of penalising the accused without even trying him before the court of law,” it said.“No doubt, such a presumption could be rebuttable. The authorities will have to satisfy the court that it did not intend to penalise a person accused of demolishing the structure,” the bench added.","Justices Gavai and Viswanathan said under India’s constitutional scheme and criminal jurisprudence, it was impermissible to demolish a house belonging to a family merely because one of its members was involved in a crime. “The executive cannot pre-judge the guilt of an accused and pronounce a disproportionate punishment, that too demolition of a house,” the bench said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115273260,imgsize-215380,width-400,resizemode-4/115273260.jpg"

Following are the steps to be taken by authorities:

No demolition of any illegal structure without 15-day prior notice to the owner, both by registered post and pasting it on the outer walls of the property. The time period would tick from the date of receipt of the notice by the owner

Intimation of notice simultaneously to collector/district magistrate concerned, who will designate a nodal officer for communication with municipal authorities

Notice shall delineate nature of unauthorised construction, specify violations, grounds of demolition and fix a date for personal hearing for the owner before a designated authority

Minutes of personal hearing given to owner to be recorded. After hearing, authority concerned will pass final order detailing which portion of structure is unauthorised, whether it’s compoundable

If not, the authorities will specify why a portion or the entire structure requires to be demolished, and give an opportunity to the owner to remove/demolish the said unauthorised portion

The final order for demolition would not be implemented for 15 days to allow the aggrieved person to approach the courts

If the owner does not challenge the final order of the authority in court within 15 days, then the demolition drive can be undertaken after preparing a detailed inspection report in the presence of two independent witnesses

Demolition has to be videographed and the authorities have to send a report to the civic authority commissioner concerned, containing the names of civil and police officials who participated in the demolition process

Consequences of violation of Supreme Court order:

Authorities shall strictly adhere to the guidelines; violations would lead to initiation of contempt proceedings in addition to prosecution

Officers concerned will be asked to restore the demolished structure to its original state at their personal cost and also be liable to pay damages (compensation)

NEW DELHI: A Rolls-Royce car of 1951 vintage, one of its kind built by H J Mulliner & Co for the Maharani of Baroda and ordered on her behalf by India’s first PM Jawaharlal Nehru , appears to have wrecked the marriage of the daughter of a Gwalior royal family , reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.The girl and the family claimed their ancestor was admiral of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the ruler of Konkan. The boy, whose father was a colonel in the Army, carried on the lucrative family business of running an educational institution at Indore. Both gave different accounts of how the ‘rista’ got finalised and the engagement took place in Gwalior in March 2018 and the marriage in Rishikesh a month later. But one fact was common. The bride was never taken to her matrimonial home amid disputes.The man filed a complaint against the girl and her parents for cheating his family of a large sum of money during the wedding.The woman retaliated with a dowry harassment FIR against the boy man and his family. But this FIR was quashed by MP HC. She moved SC challenging it. She said the man was so enamoured by the Rolls-Royce car that he and his parents demanded that as part of dowry along with a flat in Mumbai.Senior advocate Vibha Datta Makhija Wednesday told the SC bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan the woman is in a piquant position as “in her old-fashioned royal community, there is no tradition of re-marriage.” The bench appointed former HC judge R Basant as the mediator for conducting conciliation proceedings between the warring parties.","The woman, daughter of a Gwalior royal family, said her husband was so enamoured of a Rolls-Royce car of 1951 vintage in her family home that he wanted it as part of dowry.

"Fix creamy layer criteria without delay, say MPs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fix-creamy-layer-criteria-without-delay-say-mps/articleshow/115270466.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: The twin controversies over determination of “creamy layer” for OBCs — pending revision of income ceiling and the practice of including “salary” in the “income” of backward candidates with PSU background qualifying UPSC exams — echoed in the meeting of a parliamentary panel on Wednesday, with members demanding that they be settled without further delay.The MPs complained that clubbing “salary” in “income” is hurting OBC candidates qualifying the civil services examinations.Sources said members, including one from BJP, in the Parliamentary Committee on Welfare of OBCs , headed by BJP MP Ganesh Singh, questioned govt about the non-revision of income ceiling for OBC reservations . They lamented it was last done in 2017 and is stuck at Rs 8 lakh.As per norms, the income ceiling is to be revised every three years to factor in inflation. A lower threshold hurts the backwards by making it easier for them to fall in the “creamy layer” bracket, and thus ineligible for Mandal reservations in jobs and education. As per the schedule, the income ceiling hike is twice overdue now.With secretary of social justice and empowerment and a senior official of the DoPT in attendance, sources said the panel members demanded that the revision be clinched without delay. Among those who raised the issue included DMK’s TR Baalu, Congress’ Manickam Tagore, SP’s Ramashankar Rajbhar and a BJP member.Flagged equally vociferously by the MPs was the practice of the DoPT of calculating a candidate’s family “income” by including “salary”, contrary to the 1993 OM which states that “income” would not include “salary” and “Agricultural income”.It is done in the case of candidates with parents in PSUs and other govt departments where “equivalence of posts” has not been done – meaning where the Centre has not yet worked out the table to determine which posts in the PSUs fall under Group A, B, C and D, as happens in the govt. Earlier, Madras and Delhi High Courts had ruled against the practice with strictures against the govt, and the issue is said to be pending in the Supreme Court.Sources said members questioned why does the govt include the “salary” in calculating income, arguing that it is hurting the poor OBCs. Interestingly, the OBC parliamentary panel under the same chairman had in a special report on “rationalization of creamy layer” in March 2019 termed the practice as discriminatory, and asked the govt to stop it immediately.According to sources, when it was underlined that the issue was in court, an MP even argued that the govt can promulgate a law to settle it.It is learnt that the parliamentary panel has been asked to convene a joint meeting with DoPT and Social Justice Ministry officials to settle the issue. While revision of income ceiling is the domain of the social justice ministry, the calculation of “cream layer” falls in the jurisdiction of DoPT.",The MPs complained that clubbing “salary” in “income” is hurting OBC candidates qualifying the civil services examinations.

The offset price shall be fixed after obtaining a report from a govt-approved valuer,” the bench said.Granting her three months more time to surrender in the case, the bench directed her to deposit Rs 25 crore with the agency. The court had earlier quashed her bail.The court also directed her to furnish full, correct and complete details of her encumbrance free properties, which would also be put under the hammer to raise money for paying back the investors.

HYDERABAD: Tragedy struck them early in life, but these children have managed to weather the storm to forge ahead in life. R Poojitha is only 14 and has been in an orphanage for the past four years. But that did not stop her from embarking on her entrepreneurial journey. Her venture, ‘ RMP Flowers ’, sells bouquets made from exotic flowers and herbs.The class 9 student and her sister, who is in class 8, were sent to the orphanage in 2020 after their father allegedly killed their mother and a disabled sister. She said she was sad and angry all the time. “Now, I am happy and confident that I can stand on my own feet,” Poojitha said. A Vinay Kumar, founder and executive director of Touch Foundation, said, “Poojitha was moody and did not talk to anyone back then. From that, to starting her own venture now is a big leap.”While shadows from the past do sometimes hang heavy, the teen is elated to start her own business along with her friends. “We make bouquets using flowers and herbs from the orphanage’s garden,” she told TOI, adding that she wants to be a doctor.Like Poojitha, there are other children at Touch Foundation orphanage who have started their own businesses. These children are provided with a seed amount of Rs 1,000 by Young Tinker Foundation to execute their ideas and create the initial product. The foundation also started Young Tinker Space at the orphanage to support their ventures.“I sold five handmade photo frames at International Startup Festival 2024, held in Hyderabad a few months back. The number is small, but it gave a big boost to my confidence,” said S Yashaswi, who along with other children makes frames with reused materials such as paper, cardboard and stones for their firm‘RDY Framers Company’. The class 10 student, along with her brother and sister, was sent to the orphanage by relatives over three years ago after their parents succumbed to Covid-19.“I used to think that we are forced to live in an orphanage as we do not have anyone. Now, I want to do well in life and take care of my brother and sister,” she said. Yashaswi and her team watches videos and consults their teachers during spare time to learn about designing different types of frames for their firm, ‘RDY Framers Company’.Md Mahabub, who has been at the orphanage since his father died 10 years ago, is pursuing a vocational course and plans to sell eco-friendly shampoo from the soap nut trees near the hostel.He said they plan to tie up with local shops to sell the product.","R Poojitha is only 14 and has been in an orphanage for the past four years.

NEW DELHI: Busting exaggerated claims of coaching centres about the number of their students cracking competitive exams, the govt on Wednesday issued new guidelines to curb misleading advertisements by such institutes and prohibited them from luring new batches by making unrealistic promises of “100% selection”.Citing the analysis carried by Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), Union consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare shared that just 11 coaching institutes claimed selection of 3,636 students in the 2022 UPSC Civil Services Exam (CSE) while the UPSC recommended only 993 candidates. Similarly, in the 2023 CSE, while the UPSC recommended names of only 1,016 candidates, nine coaching institutes claimed selection of their 3,636 students.The CCPA also found that multiple coaching institutes were using photos of the same successful candidate in their advertisements. The investigations revealed how the institutes were fudging disclosures of courses these students joined and their duration.“We have seen coaching institutes deliberately concealing information from prospective students. So, we have come out with the guidelines to provide guidance to people involved in the coaching industry and also the consumers. We are not against these institutes issuing advertisements. But we want them to be truthful and transparent,” Khare, who is also chief commissioner of CCPA, told reporters.The CCPA has so far issued 45 notices and imposed penalties of about Rs 54.6 lakh on 18 institutes till date for misleading advertisements. “Failure to comply with the guideline can attract a penalty of up to Rs 10 lakh for the first offence and upto Rs 50 lakh for subsequent offences. The CCPA can order withdrawal of such advertisements and can stop them from further publication for 1-3 years,” Khare said.As per the guidelines, any coaching institute having more than 50 students will have to follow these rules. The institutes must disclose important information such as rank secured, name and duration of course, including whether it’s paid. They must adequately represent the service, facilities, resources and infrastructure of coaching centres. They must take consent of selected minor candidates after selection for use of their photograph and testimonial.The secretary said candidates joining govt service need to be careful of not violating service rules in case they consent to use of their photograph or testimonial to a coaching institute in lieu of a monetary gain. The consumer affairs department has written to DoPT on this aspect as well.","Just 11 coaching institutes claimed selection of 3,636 students in the 2022 UPSC Civil Services Exam.

Dick served as a lieutenant at Seringapatam in the 75th Highland Regiment of Foot. The regiment formed part of the storming party at the battle, their objective to breach the walls by use of ladders. Lt Dick is therefore likely to have been amongst the first of the British forces to enter the city, and it was his regiment that assisted with the search for Tipu’s body after the battle.A silver-hilt Seringapatam medal belonging to Peter Cherry, who was present at the siege in the capacity of paymaster, which depicts a “British lion overcoming the tiger”, sold for £23,040 (Rs 24 lakh).A report on the secret alliance between Tipu Sultan and the nawabs of the Carnatic, signed by N B Edmonstone, Persian translator to govt of Bengal, dated April 6, 1800, sold for £35,840 (Rs 38.6 lakh).The Edmonstone document is a manuscript copy of the report to the govt of Bengal on the cache of correspondence between Tipu Sultan and his ministers which was found at Seringapatam after the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and is believed to reveal a secret alliance between Tipu Sultan and two successive nawabs of the Carnatic, Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah and Umdat al-Umara, who were notionally allied with the British. The findings were used to compel Umdat al-Umara's successor, Azim ud-Daul, to sign the Carnatic Treaty , one of the treaties by which the British Empire acquired its rule over the Indian subcontinent.",The sword has an unbroken provenance taking it back to the 1799 battle in which Tipu Sultan met his end.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday posted a video of him trying Wayanad’s longest zipline as he took a break from campaigning for bypolls to promote the scenic beauty of Kerala’s hill district.Donning a “I love Wayanad” T-shirt, Rahul jokingly asked his sister Priyanka Gandhi to join him on the zipline challenge in her saree.Rahul engaged with locals and adventure sport organisers who have seen tourism decline since the landslides hit the region in July during his visit.In a bid to promote tourism, Rahul said that Wayanad remains full of ""incredible attractions"" despite recent challenges from landslides.Rahul Gandhi, discussing the impact of the natural disaster, said, “The recent landslide has left tourism hanging by a thread, and livelihoods are suffering. From shopkeepers to homestay owners, everyone is working hard just to keep things going. Hearing their stories, I felt both deep concern for their struggles and immense admiration for their resilience,”Highlighting the attractions in the district, Rahul noted that despite the landslide, locals have worked to create exciting draws for tourists, including the largest giant swing in South India and a drop tower. He said, ""This is more than politics for me; the people of Wayanad have truly won a place in my heart. Priyanka and I have taken it up as a mission to make Wayanad a top destination in Kerala. Wayanad embodies the best of India.""Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi too highlighted that while the landslide’s impact was confined to certain areas, the perception of risk has deterred many potential visitors. “Whoever I was meeting, one huge effect of the landslide is on tourism which is unjustified in the sense that the landslide was just in a very restricted area. And as somebody said here, Wayanad actually got a huge area with very beautiful, natural landscape, many beautiful things too. I met homestay owners, they all also have been deeply affected. They are not able to pay their staffs for the last three months. So we just want to emphasise how Wayanad is safe. It is absolutely beautiful.""Landslides triggered by torrential rainfall on July 30 wreaked havoc in Wayanad, leading to extensive damage in Punjirimattom, Mundakkai, Chooralmala, and Vellarimala villages. The disaster killed hundreds across the state and significantly affected the local economy.Rahul, who previously held the Wayand seat, vacated it after retaining the seat he won in Raebareli.

Stephen Miller: Controversies



President-elect Donald Trump has appointed longtime adviser Stephen Miller , known for his strong stance on immigration, as the deputy chief of policy for his new administration. Vice President-elect JD Vance confirmed the appointment on Monday, congratulating Miller on X, calling him “another fantastic pick by the president.” Miller has been one of Trump’s closest aides since his first presidential campaign and was a senior adviser during Trump’s first term. He has played a central role in many policy decisions, particularly on immigration, including the 2018 family separation policy.Additionally, on Sunday, Trump announced that former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director Tom Homan would serve as the administration’s “Border Czar.” In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump shared that Homan would oversee border security , including the Southern and Northern Borders, as well as maritime and aviation security. Homan, a longtime ally of Trump, is also being considered for the role of Secretary of Homeland Security. Trump praised Homan’s expertise in border control, stating he would also oversee deportation policies.Miller is expected to continue his advocacy for restrictive immigration policies, including limits on H-1B visas. According to a Forbes report, the Trump administration’s stance has often been at odds with economic consensus, which suggests that high-skilled immigrants and international students benefit the US economy. The administration worked to decouple study in the US from work opportunities, particularly through H-1B visa restrictions, making it more challenging for high-skilled foreign nationals to stay and work in the U.S. after graduation. The Cruz-Sessions bill, which reflects Miller’s influence, proposed significant barriers for H-1B visa holders, requiring them to work abroad for 10 years before qualifying to work in the U.S., and setting a high minimum salary of $110,000. The bill also sought to restrict Optional Practical Training (OPT) for international students, a policy that was nearly eliminated by a Trump administration regulation.Homan and Miller are anticipated to work closely in the upcoming administration to implement these restrictive immigration measures, with Homan overseeing border control and deportation, as well as maritime and aviation security.Miller argues that the H-1B program can lead to American worker displacement and wage suppression. During Trump’s first term, policies were introduced under Miller’s influence to tighten H-1B regulations, including raising denial rates and narrowing the definition of “specialty occupation,” reducing the positions eligible for H-1B workers.These potential changes may discourage U.S. companies from hiring Indian tech talent, limiting opportunities for those seeking employment in the US.Stephen Miller, born on August 23, 1985, in Santa Monica, California, was raised in a Jewish family with a conservative ideology that influenced his early political views and career choices.Miller attended Duke University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. At Duke, he became a prominent conservative voice on campus, frequently contributing to publications and engaging in political debates. His early career included positions as a press secretary for U.S. Representatives Michele Bachmann and John Shadegg, where he developed a strong foundation in political communication.In 2016, Miller joined Donald Trump’s presidential campaign as a senior policy advisor. After Trump’s election, he took on the role of senior advisor for policy and White House director of speechwriting from 2017 to 2021. Miller played a significant role in crafting Trump’s major speeches, including the inaugural address, and was instrumental in shaping the administration’s stringent immigration policies. He was one of the chief architects of the travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries and the family separation policy aimed at deterring illegal immigration at the U.S. border.Following Trump’s first term, Miller founded America First Legal , an organization dedicated to advancing conservative legal principles and challenging policies of the Biden administration. Through this platform, Miller continued to impact public policy, focusing on immigration and national security, key areas of his earlier work.In November 2024, after Donald Trump’s re-election, Miller was appointed as Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy in the White House. In this role, he is expected to oversee the administration’s policy agenda, especially concerning immigration and national security.Miller is married to Katie Waldman, former press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence. The couple has three children. Throughout his career, Miller has been a divisive figure, gaining praise from supporters for his unwavering conservative principles and facing criticism from opponents for his hardline stance on immigration and involvement in controversial policies.Miller’s career has been marked by several controversies. In 2019, leaked emails revealed that he had promoted articles from white nationalist sources, sparking public criticism and calls for his resignation. Despite these incidents, Miller has retained significant influence within conservative political circles.","President-elect Donald Trump has appointed longtime adviser Stephen Miller as the deputy chief of policy for his new administration.

Suhas Subramanyam: 'I will support legislation to help legal immigrants on the path to citizenship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-will-support-legislation-to-help-legal-immigrants-on-the-path-to-citizenship-says-us-congressman-elect-suhas-subramanyam/articleshow/115225958.cms,"In the past years, several legislations addressing immigration reform have failed in the US Senate and the House of Representatives. Many had provisions that would address the problems faced by Indians stuck on long green card queues. Would you be supporting any new Bill in

that addresses these issues?

There are a lot of concerns in India over the possibility of tougher immigration rules under President Elect

. Do you think there are grounds for such concerns?

Are you in touch with the other Indian Americans in the House of Representatives – the Samosa Caucus?

You were technology advisor to President Barack Obama and you will now represent a district which is known as a tech hub; would you be participating in legislations and policy discussions on technology in the House of Representatives?

You have often spoken about your Indian American immigrant background, during your campaign – did you have many team members and aides of Indian origin?

After winning the election, you have pledged to work across the aisle. In view of the deep divide during the election campaign, do you feel that Democrat and Republican members of the House of Representatives will be able to resolve their differences and work together?

As you move to Congress, your district in Virginia will have elections for the position of state senator that you have vacated, and there are a couple of names of Indian Americans who will be running. Would you be endorsing any of the candidates?

After winning the election for the Virginia District 10 seat, with a comfortable margin, Suhas Subramanyam , 38, is set to become the first Indian American in the US House of Representatives from his state, when he is sworn-in on January 3, 2025. He also becomes the sixth member of the ‘Samosa Caucus;’ the informal name for the group of Indian American law makers – though personally he is more of an alu-gobi person, preferring a healthy comfort recipe to the deep fried ubiquitous Indian snack. The US Representative-elect spoke to Times of India’s Ishani Duttagupta on a host of issues including comprehensive immigration reforms that could end green card backlogs for Indians and working across the aisle to help mitigate the deep divide between Democrats and Republicans, stemming from the divisive presidential campaigns. Edited excerpts from the interview.I want to support legislation that will help legal immigrants here on the path to citizenship. A lot of people who come here, on H-1B visas especially, work in high demand fields like technology. They pay their taxes and contribute to our economy and then they are simply left behind and not given a path to citizenship. Many of them have complained to me that it’s easier to come into the US illegally and stay than to come legally. So I do want to make sure that we are talking about comprehensive immigration reform and we are talking about deportations and border security and we don’t forget people who have been so integral to our country and to our community here in Virginia.I think that the US-India relationship is a bipartisan effort in the sense of the US and India working together long term. It doesn’t matter who is the President here or leader there. I am going to be a champion for that relationship and I think that the Trump administration seems to be supportive of strengthening the US-India relationship as well. But I think that the thing to be concerned about is that this Presidency can and will be very unpredictable. President Trump has been very unpredictable in office as well as out of office and so we have to see how that translates to the US-India relationship. But there are other issues that I am concerned about with respect to the Trump Presidency – namely the environment and making sure we are producing clean renewable and energy and protecting our planet from climate change. I’m not sure what Trump’s foreign policy will be. He ran on a platform of no new wars and ending the current wars; I’m curious to see how he is going to do that. But I’m going to keep an open mind because I promised my constituents that I’ll work with everyone including the Republicans.Yes, the other Indian Americans in Congress have reached out to me. They have supported me and gave me great advice. Though I’m actually more of an ‘alu gobi’ and ‘bhel’ person; I’m happy with the Samosa Caucus and I want to continue its growth. I hope that our shared experiences will encourage others of Indian origin as well. When I worked on Capitol Hill, there were no members of Indian origin in Congress and it was very rare to even see an Indian American staff member like me. But we have come a long way it seems and it would be great to see more Indian Americans elected.Absolutely! I think tech policy is one of the issues that can be bipartisan and we’re going to have to address it. It’s a critical moment for tech policy and we need people who understand what they are doing from a business perspective and from a technology perspective when it comes to regulating these tools. Whether it is AI or block chain or cyber security, I want to make sure that my district has a voice in shaping technology policy so that we can promote innovation and regulate the bad behaviours.A lot of young Indian Americans reached out to my campaign to get involved. We especially liked younger people from high school and college getting engaged. It is good to get exposed to policy early on to help them get a sense of service in their mind. Many of them go on to volunteer or serve in different capacities. You don’t always have to run for office. I like to impart upon young people involved in our campaign that service is so important and you can do it in so many different ways. I made it a point to make sure that young people got involved in our campaign. And many of those young people were Indian American because of my candidacy.I’ve always thought that we are stronger when we are united as a country and I want to make sure that I deliver to my constituents. That is only going to happen by working with the Republicans. But I’m going to do everything I can to protect our economy here in Virginia; to protect the community and deliver to my constituents. I’m not going to be silent on things on which I disagree such as protecting federal workers in the Washington DC area, that includes my district in Virginia. That’s going to be critical and it’s something for which I’m going to fight. I’m not going to let them fire thousands of federal workers and replace them with their people and Trump loyalists. But generally I’m going to keep an open mind, work across the aisle and deliver to my constituency.I have endorsed State Delegate Kannan Srinivasan for the Democratic nomination for the state senate seat that I will be leaving when I join the House of Representatives. But that’s not because he is Indian but because he is going to make a great legislator and do really great things in the state senate. In the past, it used to be hard to find Indian Americans running for state and federal elections; but now there are many who want to step up. Some of them have told me that it is because of my success as the first Indian American in the House of Representatives, from my state, that they felt encouraged to run; they saw that someone like them could win. That is one of the impacts of winning and I’m happy to pave the way for others. I certainly don’t want to be the last Indian American in Congress from Virginia","Suhas Subramanyam, 38, is set to become the first Indian American in the US House of Representatives from his state, when he is sworn-in on January 3, 2025.

49ers secure Deommodore Lenoir with five-year, $92 million extensions



The San Francisco 49ers have solidified their defense by agreeing to a five-year, $92 million contract extension with cornerback Deommodore Lenoir . NFL Network first reported the deal. This significant deal not only secures one of the league's rising defensive stars but also signals the 49ers' strategic move to retain top talent as they eye a bright future.Drafted in the fifth round in 2021, Lenoir, now 25, has emerged as a key player in the 49ers’ defense. His rise began to accelerate last season when he transitioned into the slot, where he showed his versatility. In just a few seasons, he’s compiled impressive career stats, including 233 tackles, six interceptions, and 23 passes defensed across 56 games. This season alone, Lenoir has tallied 53 tackles, two interceptions, and a forced fumble. Notably, he scored his first touchdown by returning a fumble 61 yards, highlighting his impact on special teams.Pro Football Focus notes that Lenoir has effectively split time between the slot and the outside, proving reliable with a mere 65 passer rating allowed on targets thrown into his coverage. His skills have allowed him to permit no touchdown passes this season while maintaining six passes defensed and contributing to the team's defensive scoreboard by returning a blocked field goal for a touchdown.Lenoir’s rapid development into one of the NFL’s notable cornerbacks aligns with the 49ers’ vision. With two key cornerbacks facing free agency, including Charvarius Ward, securing Lenoir was considered a priority. His new contract, averaging $18.4 million annually, places him 12th among cornerbacks in terms of salary, marking a substantial pay raise from his current $3.116 million base salary.This extension reflects the 49ers' foresight in managing cap space effectively. By finalizing Lenoir’s deal now, the team sets itself up financially for a forthcoming investment in quarterback Brock Purdy, who is expected to command a lucrative contract soon.Also Read: Dak Prescott’s season comes to an end as Cowboys QB set for surgery on torn hamstring As the 49ers aim to build a defense primed for long-term success, locking in Lenoir demonstrates their commitment to maintaining a formidable secondary and creating a balanced roster, ultimately setting the stage for championship contention.","49ers secure Deommodore Lenoir with five-year, $92 million extensions.

On November 11, he launched his third annual turkey drive, aiming to provide meals for 500 families through his Jonathan Owens Foundation .This event has grown into a heartfelt tradition for Owens, one that reflects his commitment to giving back to each NFL city he's called home.

Driven by this sentiment, Owens first launched his turkey giveaway in 2022, aiming to spread cheer and support for those who, like him, may not have had the chance to fully enjoy holiday festivities. Through his efforts, he hopes to create meaningful connections and holiday moments that resonate with families in a memorable way. “It was a blessing to be able to help families in need and put smiles on their faces,” he shared.Held at Chicago's Building Bright Futures Center for the Arts, the turkey drive saw a line of families eagerly awaiting the Thanksgiving meals Owens had prepared. Each family received bags filled with traditional holiday staples, including turkeys and all the trimmings. But Owens didn’t stop there; he took to the streets, distributing meals to passing cars and buses, bringing the holiday spirit to those on the go. Owens reflected on the experience with joy, saying, “The holidays are just a great time to try and bless people, give people a great experience, see some smiles on kids’ faces, and just feel like a part of the community.” His warmth and enthusiasm brought a sense of unity to the event, making each interaction a memorable one.The initiative speaks to Owens’ passion for giving back, but it also serves as a source of inspiration for the community. When he spoke to a young football player who was about to graduate, Owens offered advice he hoped would guide the player’s future. He expressed how “just a small nugget like that, of information and advice, could change someone’s life.” This mentorship moment highlighted Owens' dedication not only to physical nourishment but also to supporting the next generation.Also Read: Dak Prescott’s season comes to an end as Cowboys QB set for surgery on torn hamstring Through his annual turkey drive, Owens has proven that small gestures can create big impacts, helping families enjoy Thanksgiving while strengthening community bonds.

Tom Brady opens up about parenting struggles



Renowned for his nearly two-decade reign in the NFL , Tom Brady has long been celebrated for his precision, endurance, and relentless drive on the field. However, off the field, the legendary quarterback has embarked on a journey that lacks the clear strategies and set plays of professional sports: fatherhood.Recently, Tom Brady opened up about this deeply personal role, sharing insights that reflect a side of him few are familiar with—one that’s shaped by humility, growth, and a willingness to acknowledge his own imperfections.At the 2024 Fortune Global Forum , Brady spoke with Alyson Shontell about the trials and triumphs of raising three children. He admitted that parenting, unlike his decorated career, presents an unpredictable set of challenges. ""Being a parent is probably the hardest job all of us have,"" Brady confessed during the forum. ""And we screwed up a lot, and I've screwed up a lot as a parent,"" he reflected, bringing a candid honesty to the conversation.Brady’s eldest, Jack, whom he shares with actress Bridget Moynahan, was Brady's first encounter with the realities of fatherhood—a role that demanded a different kind of dedication and patience. He openly acknowledges the difficulties he faced, admitting that his journey in raising Jack was not without mistakes and learning experiences. His two younger children, Benjamin and Vivian, whom he co-parents with ex-wife Gisele Bündchen, further expanded his perspectives on parenthood, each bringing unique aspirations and needs that Brady finds both inspiring and challenging.Reflecting on his own upbringing, Brady expressed gratitude for his parents’ unwavering encouragement during his formative years. Despite the odds stacked against him as a young, overlooked quarterback, they remained supportive. “When I was that long shot as a kid…they never said, ‘Man, don’t do that…Let’s think about another backup plan.’ They kinda said, ‘You know what? Go for it,’” he shared, underscoring how their belief became a cornerstone of his success.Also Read: Taylor Swift fans outraged by NFL Podcast host’s cruel comments, faces backlash While the accolades of Brady’s NFL career are engraved in history, it’s his role as a father that has humbled and tested him most profoundly. Far from the certainty of football, parenting remains an ongoing journey for Brady—one defined by trial, love, and continuous learning. In embracing this new chapter, he reveals a side of himself that is as vulnerable as it is dedicated, proving that even the greatest champions face battles without clear plays or definitive victories.","Tom Brady opens up about parenting struggles at the 2024 Fortune Global Forum.

Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies—essential to the 'Save America' movement,"" the president-elect said.Quoting Trump's announcement on X, Ramaswamy criticised the administrative state for unlawful behavior, citing the Supreme Court, and called for a significant reduction in its size.""Over the last two years, the Supreme Court has ruled that the administrative state is behaving in wildly unlawful ways. But slapping the bureaucracy on the wrist won’t solve the problem; the only right answer is massive downsizing,"" Ramaswamy said on X.Trump said that he looked forward to Elon and Vivek making changes to the federal bureaucracy with a focus on efficiency, while also improving life for all Americans. He stressed that they would work to eliminate the massive waste and fraud present in the annual $6.5 trillion of government spending.""Importantly, we will drive out the massive waste and fraud which exists throughout our annual $6.5 trillion of government spending. They will work together to liberate our economy and make the U.S. government accountable to 'WE THE PEOPLE.' Their work will conclude no later than July 4, 2026—a smaller government, with more efficiency and less bureaucracy, will be the perfect gift to America on the 250th anniversary of The Declaration of Independence. I am confident they will succeed!"" Trump said in a statement on X.Elon Musk, on the other hand, said that all actions of the Department of Government Efficiency would be posted online for maximum transparency. He encouraged the public to notify them if they believed something important was being cut or something wasteful was being overlooked.""All actions of the Department of Government Efficiency will be posted online for maximum transparency. Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know! We will also have a leaderboard for the most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars. This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining,"" Musk said in a post on X.","Vivek Ramaswamy said that ""massive downsizing"" is the only effective way to amend the unlawful behavior of the administrative state.

Multiple international airlines suspended their services to and from Bali on Wednesday following continuous ash clouds from Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki on Flores, reached heights of 10 km and displaced numerous residents.Safety concerns regarding volcanic ash prompted Jetstar and Qantas to suspend their Bali operations on Wednesday, whilst Flightradar24 indicated that AirAsia and Virgin also halted their flights to the island.Singapore Airlines confirmed the cancellation of their Wednesday service from Bali to Singapore due to the volcanic activity.Operations at Lombok airport in West Nusa Tenggara province, another favoured tourist location, were completely suspended, according to an airport official's statement to Indonesia's Antara news agency.The flight cancellations led to difficulties for tourists who were stuck at the airport. Charlie Austin, from Perth, Australia, who was visiting Bali with his family, voiced his frustration and said, ""The airline did not provide accommodation, leaving us stranded at this airport.""Issabella Butler, another visitor from Australia, decided to search for alternative carriers for her return journey. ""The important thing is that we have to be able to get out of here,"" she said.According to AP sources, the disruption stranded thousands of travellers at airports across Indonesia and Australia, though precise figures were not available.The initial eruption of Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki occurred on November 3 in East Nusa Tenggara province, approximately 800 km from Bali, claiming nine lives. Subsequent eruptions have continued, with multiple occurrences on Tuesday.Between November 4 and November 12, Ahmad Syaugi Shahab, general manager of Bali's Ngurah Rai airport, reported 80 flight cancellations, affecting routes from Singapore, Hong Kong, and various Australian cities.Indonesia's location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" encompasses nearly 130 active volcanoes, situated in an area of significant seismic activity across multiple tectonic plates.The Mount Lewotobi eruption has produced an ash column reaching 10 km in height, with authorities reporting sand deposits across surrounding regions.","Jetstar, Qantas, AirAsia and Virgin all suspend flights to and from Bali.

Savannah James’ fiery past interaction



It's Giving.. We're Back and Minding Our Business || Everybody's Crazy Podcast

Savannah James , the wife of NBA superstar LeBron James, has proven time and again that she is a fierce protector of her family. While fame and fortune have brought immense opportunities, they have also introduced a unique set of challenges, particularly when it comes to public scrutiny.While many assume that public figures become immune to criticism, Savannah has shown that attacks on her children evoke a fierce protective response, reminding everyone that, at heart, they are a family first. Her approach to handling negativity, particularly at her children’s games, highlights both her resilience and her nurturing “Mama Bear” instincts.Initially uncomfortable with the spotlight, Savannah has transformed into a staunch defender when her children face public insult. On the podcast Everybody’s Crazy, she recounted a moment at one of her son Bronny’s games that underscored her instinct to protect her family. “Short story: When I had the baby on my hip, about to go and try to fight a man; he was flicking Bronny off in a game,” she shared. Savannah vividly described her reaction as she approached the man, baby Zhuri in tow, to confront his disrespect. Despite his claim that he was simply gesturing toward his own son, Savannah saw the encounter as another reminder of the irrational behavior her family often encounters due to their fame.Also Read: Shaqir O'Neal's highlight dunk earns massive 1-word praise from NBA icon LeBron James Through this episode, Savannah spoke about the peculiar challenges of being a high-profile mother . While she has grown accustomed to criticism, she admits that fame often makes her feel like her family has “a target on our back” whenever they attend public events. Spectators’ intense scrutiny, often peppered with whispers and unkind remarks, creates a challenging environment, especially during her children’s sports games. She reflects that the unpredictable behavior of spectators can be unsettling, reminding her of the heavy toll fame can exact on her family’s privacy.Despite her protective nature, Savannah has developed strategies to manage her emotions. Although tempted to respond with the boldness of fellow NBA mother Sonya Curry, she acknowledges that such direct confrontations may not always be the best path. Instead, Savannah has found solace in self-restraint techniques, particularly deep breathing exercises, which have helped her avoid lashing out. This method, she says, allows her to focus on her family and maintain composure amid the constant scrutiny.Savannah James’ journey showcases the complexities of balancing public life with parental responsibilities. Her approach—blending firm defense with emotional control—reveals how she continues to prioritize her family’s well-being above all, even in the face of unrelenting public pressure.Also Read: LeBron James Nears Historic Milestone: Only Five NBA Players Have Logged More Games",Savannah James is the wife of NBA superstar LeBron James.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Dogecoin soars after Trump election win: What you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dogecoin-soars-after-trump-election-win-what-you-need-to-know/articleshow/115275892.cms,"Dogecoin. (AP photo)

Dogecoin , a cryptocurrency known for its Shiba Inu dog mascot, has experienced a significant price increase since Donald Trump's presidential election win.Dogecoin's value more than doubled from less than 16 cents before election day to nearly 38 cents as of Wednesday afternoon, according to CoinDesk. The surge follows a broader trend of cryptocurrency growth, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $93,000.Experts attribute the rise in cryptocurrency value to Trump's positive stance on digital currencies. Trump has expressed his desire for the United States to become the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and establish a bitcoin 'strategic reserve.'Adding to Dogecoin's momentum, Elon Musk , a prominent supporter of the cryptocurrency and close ally of Trump, will lead the newly announced 'department of government efficiency."" This department, abbreviated as DOGE, will operate outside the government, offering advice and guidance to the White House.Musk's history with Dogecoin includes playing a character nicknamed 'The Dogefather' on Saturday Night Live and suggesting Twitter adopt the cryptocurrency for subscription payments.While Dogecoin initially gained popularity as a joke, it has garnered a dedicated following. Supporters believe cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin offer a decentralised alternative for online transactions, free from central bank or government influence.","Dogecoin's value more than doubled from less than 16 cents before election day to nearly 38 cents as of Wednesday afternoon.

DHAKA: A cargo vessel from Karachi docked at Chattogram port Wednesday, marking the inaugural direct maritime connection between Pakistan and Bangladesh. This underscores the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt’s shift in regional approach as it has been working to strengthen ties with Pakistan — a country held responsible by many in Bangladesh for mass atrocities during the 1971 Liberation War.The ship arrived amid a politically sensitive environment in Bangladesh, where the govt’s recent moves have stirred both support and opposition. This comprises efforts to remove symbols of the 1971 war, including portraits of Bangladesh’s founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, since an uprising ousted PM Sheikh Hasina’s govt of 15 years in Aug.Pakistani high commissioner Syed Ahmed Maroof described the establishment of the shipping route as a “major step” forward in strengthening trade and business relations. “The initiative will accelerate existing trade flows and promote new opportunities for businesses on both sides, from small traders to large exporters,” he said.","A cargo vessel from Karachi docked at Chattogram port Wednesday, marking the inaugural direct maritime connection between Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Vivek Ramaswamy: Why Musk-Ramaswamy's DOGE sounds like a Yes Minister spoof,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/doge-trump-musk-yes-minister-elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy/articleshow/115256038.cms,"Humphreys' Introduction - Yes Minister

What is DOGE?

Trillion-Dollar Savings Plan:

AI and Automation in Government:

Decentralising Agencies and Operations:

‘Hackathons for Policy’:

Transparency Initiative:

In an uncanny reflection of Yes Minister's satire, the new US Department of Government Efficiency , or DOGE, sounds straight out of the Ministry for Administrative Affairs—a fictional British institution infamous for its comically circular logic and dedication to preserving inefficiency. Yes Minister, the 1980s British TV show, followed the bumbling Minister Jim Hacker as he grappled with a bureaucratic machine designed to self-preserve rather than reform. With the Department of Government Efficiency, a real-life version of Hacker's Ministry may have come to the US, as DOGE aims to dismantle inefficiency, echoing the same paradox that Yes Minister once lampooned.In Yes Minister, bureaucracy isn’t just a system; it’s a labyrinth engineered to perpetuate itself. The civil servants, led by Sir Humphrey Appleby , expertly stonewall any attempt at change, wielding obscure regulations and jargon as weapons. Similarly, DOGE, spearheaded by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy , is set to streamline government. Yet, like Hacker’s ministry, DOGE faces a government machine skilled in red tape and averse to rapid change. DOGE's task—applying startup efficiency to a complex bureaucracy—is an audacious ""Manhattan Project"" in its own right.The project even takes inspiration from Musk's favourite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin, which started as a joke but has since symbolised unpredictable innovation. Here, the joke coin has turned into a real-world mission. Much like Jim Hacker's naïve belief in swift reform, DOGE operates under a bold vision: dismantling the very inefficiencies that protect Washington's institutions. But, as with Yes Minister, this mission may reveal that bureaucratic inertia isn’t easily overcome, leaving Musk and Ramaswamy facing the same slow gears that ground down Hacker’s plans. In a case of reel becoming reality, DOGE is set to be both an ambitious experiment and a test of whether real reform can outwit the entrenched system.The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been introduced by President-elect Donald Trump with an aim to “drain the swamp” by attacking Washington’s infamous bureaucracy head-on. DOGE brings together Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, each with a reputation for unorthodox approaches and a deep-seated aversion to waste. DOGE's mission is sweeping: reduce federal spending, overhaul government operations , and make the bureaucracy lean and transparent. The bold tagline for DOGE is Musk’s own phrase, “Government 2.0,” hinting at a tech-inspired revamp that seeks to streamline operations, improve service delivery, and cut down costs.DOGE aims to eliminate redundant departments, collapse overlapping agency functions, and integrate automation to make government processes more efficient. Musk, a known proponent of rapid innovation, sees DOGE as a proving ground for applying private-sector principles, such as rapid iteration and lean management, to the slow-moving gears of federal government. He likens it to a “public sector startup,” where cost-effectiveness and speed are paramount.Ramaswamy, on the other hand, brings a pragmatic approach, calling for cost-benefit analyses on every policy to justify taxpayer expenses. One of his key proposals is to introduce performance metrics for government employees, ensuring accountability at all levels. His philosophy aligns with Musk’s, focusing on achieving “return on taxpayer investment” with every initiative DOGE undertakes.To that end, DOGE has outlined several ambitious targets:DOGE has proposed a bold objective of cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget over the next five years. This would involve scaling down several programs that Musk and Ramaswamy argue have become bloated and redundant, while focusing on essential services with maximum public impact. Savings will supposedly come from digitisation and merging duplicate functions across departments.One of DOGE’s flagship proposals is to implement AI and automation in low-skill, high-volume government tasks. According to Musk, even a 10% increase in productivity through automation could result in billions in savings. Areas like data entry, administrative filings, and processing of government forms are ripe for AI-driven improvement.DOGE is also exploring the decentralisation of government agencies, potentially relocating non-essential operations outside of Washington, DC. This would not only cut costs associated with maintaining operations in the capital but would also bring federal jobs and investments to economically underdeveloped regions across the US, a move Ramaswamy has described as “democratizing government access.”Musk and Ramaswamy plan to introduce a series of “hackathons” where private-sector innovators collaborate to develop new policy ideas and solutions for DOGE. Each hackathon will focus on one of Washington’s most infamous inefficiencies, such as the Social Security processing backlog or the Department of Veterans Affairs waitlist issues. These events are intended to harness Silicon Valley-style problem-solving and bring fresh perspectives to old problems.DOGE is promising a transparency overhaul, where, in Musk’s words, “everything is on the blockchain.” By employing blockchain technology, DOGE aims to make government spending data public and tamper-proof, a bold move to win public trust and reduce corruption. Each department would have a transparent ledger of spending accessible by taxpayers, reflecting DOGE’s motto of “nothing to hide, nowhere to hide.”DOGE’s critics, however, argue that such sweeping changes could face immense resistance from an established bureaucratic machine. As Yes Minister’s Sir Humphrey Appleby would attest, civil servants often wield quiet power, capable of delaying, complicating, or outright nullifying attempts at reform. In this sense, DOGE’s goal of revolutionising Washington faces not just the challenges of scale but also entrenched opposition from within.Nevertheless, Musk and Ramaswamy are undeterred, casting DOGE as a last-resort attempt to reclaim government efficiency. Much like the fictional Ministry for Administrative Affairs, DOGE operates in a world where paradoxes abound: a department created to reduce departments, a budget-cutting office that costs millions, and a transparency promise that may get bogged down in legal red tape. Yet, if DOGE succeeds, it could set a precedent, becoming a global model for how governments can embrace tech-inspired transformation—no longer the punchline but the blueprint for administrative evolution.","Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) aims to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget over the next five years.
