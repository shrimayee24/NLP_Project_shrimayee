NEW DELHI: In an incident reminiscent of the Atul Subhash case , a 33-year-old techie from Uttar Pradesh, Mohit Yadav , has died by suicide, allegedly due to mental harassment by his wife. In a video message recorded before his death, Yadav cited the lack of legal protection for men as a key reason behind his decision.""By the time you get this video, I will be gone from this world. If there was a law for men, maybe I wouldn’t have taken this step. I couldn’t bear the mental torture by my wife and her family. Mom, Dad, please forgive me,"" Yadav said in the video. ""If I don’t get justice even after my death, then let my ashes be immersed in a drain,"" he added.He claimed that his wife Priya Yadav threatened him to register his house and property in her name and accused his mother-in-law of making his wife abort their child. The TOI could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.""My wife threatened me that if I didn't register my house and property in her name, she would implicate my family in a dowry case. Her father, Manoj Yadav, filed a false complaint, and her brother threatened to kill me,"" he said.This comes only two days after a 30-year-old woman in UP was booked for allegedly driving her husband, Mohit Tyagi, a 34-year-old media professional, to suicide through constant harassment and financial demands. According to the FIR filed by Mohit's brother, the trouble began soon after Mohit married Priyanka from Sambhal in December 2020. She allegedly took off with gifted jewellery and lodged false complaints against him and his family.Last year in December, Atul Subhash, a 34-year-old Bengaluru techie, died by suicide in his apartment. Before his death, he left behind a 24-page note and a video message, in which he accused his wife and in-laws of relentless harassment. He alleged they had filed eight false police complaints against him and demanded Rs 3 crore to settle a divorce, along with an additional Rs 30 lakh for access to his son. Following a complaint lodged by Atul’s younger brother, Bikas Modi, the three accused were arrested.Also read: Meerut murder Déjà Vu: Woman, lover kill hubby in UP","Mohit Yadav, a 33-year-old techie from Uttar Pradesh, has died by suicide.

No, it's unlikely to bring any real change. Yes, it's a positive step for Maharashtra.

The potential reunion has sparked varied reactions across the political parties.

'Good thing'

Shinde gets irked

'BJP is causing harm to Maharashtra'

'Two zeros always make a zero'

'If Balasaheb Thackeray were alive ...'

NEW DELHI: The political landscape of Maharashtra witnessed an interesting development as estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray indicated a possible reconciliation after two decades.""I am ready to come together (with Raj Thackeray). I am ready to come forward in the interest of Maharashtra, keeping aside minor incidents. I have put an end to all fights. The interest of Maharashtra is my priority,"" former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency ANI during his address at the 57th annual general meeting of Bharatiya Kamgar Sena .Raj Thackeray echoed a similar sentiment, saying that ""coming together is not difficult"" and that differences between cousins are ""proving costly for the existence of Maharashtra and Marathi people"".""The disputes and fights between Uddhav and me are minor -- Maharashtra is much bigger than all that. These differences are proving costly for the existence of Maharashtra and the Marathi people,"" Raj Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency IANS.""Coming together is not difficult, it’s a matter of will. It’s not just about my desire or selfishness. We need to look at the bigger picture. All Marathi people across political parties should unite and form a single party,"" he added.Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut, however, said that the talks on the potential alliance is ""only emotional"" as of now and no decision has been taken.""There is no alliance (between MNS and Shiv Sena -UBT) as of now, only emotional talks are going on,"" Raut said.""Raj Thackeray and Uddhav Thackeray are brothers. We have been together for years. Our relationship has not broken. Both brothers will decide (about the alliance),"" he added.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis welcomed the possibility of a political reunion between estranged cousins Raj Thackeray and Uddhav Thackeray, calling it a “good” development.“If the two come together, we will be happy about it. If people settle their differences, it’s a good thing. What else can I say about it? I also appeal to all Marathi people to come together for the benefit of Maharashtra and Marathi,” Fadnavis said.Echoing a similar sentiment, Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekhar Bawankule said it was entirely up to Raj Thackeray whether or not to align with Uddhav Thackeray.“It is Raj Thackeray's prerogative whether to join hands with Uddhav Thackeray or not. He can decide his party's future. The BJP has no objection to it,” Bawankule said.Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde, on the other hand, appeared irked when asked about the possible alliance between the Thackeray brothers.Shinde seemed visibly irritated and brushed off the reporter’s mic. He asked the reporter to focus on the government's work instead.“Talk about work,” Shinde said.State Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal said if the two Thackeray families came together, there was no reason to object.""When Raj Thackeray says his issues with Uddhav Thackeray are not bigger than Maharashtra, he must be hinting that BJP is causing harm to Maharashtra.. that investment is going out of Maharashtra,"" he said in Pune. Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT) are allies at present.""The BJP is trying to undermine the language and culture of Maharashtra, and Raj Thackeray's stand seems to endorse this view,"" he added.However, Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske expressed skepticism over the possibility of reconciliation, pointing to past tensions between the two.“Uddhav Thackeray had threatened to leave the house if Raj Thackeray was given any responsibility. He even opposed Raj’s visits to party branches in Mumbai and differentiated between his supporters. Uddhav should answer why he opposed Raj Thackeray,” Mhaske said.Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam took a jibe at the potential alliance, dismissing it as electorally irrelevant. “Two zeros always make a zero,” he said.“Uddhav aligned with Congress and relied on Muslim votes. Now, realising that this strategy hasn’t worked, he is leaning toward Raj Thackeray. This is not about Maharashtra’s interest—it’s about personal survival. Even together, they cannot pose a challenge to Mahayuti,” Nirupam added.Meanwhile, NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) MP Supriya Sule said the move should be welcomed if it is in the interest of the state.“Raj Thackeray said that the state’s issues are bigger than their personal dispute. That is happy news to me. If Balasaheb Thackeray were alive, he would have been very happy today,” Sule said.“If the two brothers are coming together for Maharashtra, we should welcome it wholeheartedly,” she added.","Uddhav and Raj Thackeray indicated a possible reconciliation after two decades.

An equal number of states and UTs have also doubled the threshold for workers for applicability of Factories Act to 20 (for units with power) and 40 (for those without power). Ditto for the Contract Labour Act, where the threshold for number of workers for applicability of the law has been raised from 20 to 50.While several of the amendments may be limited to NDA-governed states, when it comes to allowing women to work night shifts, 31 have gone ahead with the change, while all states and UTs have notified reforms related to compliance notice before prosecution . This indicates that irrespective of party line, there are some issues on which economics trumps politics as state leadership scouts for investments, especially in the manufacturing sector to create jobs.Similarly, fixed-term employment has been permitted in 25 states, enabling easier hiring to deal with seasonal requirements. In fact, after amending the regulations, states such as Madhya Pradesh have introduced safeguards to prevent misuse of the provisions, following some complaints. Twenty-five states have also moved ahead and allowed for compounding of offences.Besides, sources told TOI that close to two dozen states and UTs were considering mandating issue of notice for strikes and lockouts across industrial establishments, a provision that applied to public sector companies.Several of the issues on which the states and UTs have moved forward are also included in the four labour codes that were enacted with much fanfare five years ago, but are yet to be notified. Consultations with the states are currently underway, with Bengal holding it up, said sources.But Centre's nudge to the states, including during a national workshop conducted by the labour ministry, has got states moving within the current legal framework.A task force led by cabinet secretary T V Somanathan is putting together a set of best practices that states can follow, and the revised labour regulations are a crucial element.","At least 19 states and UTs have increased the retrenchment threshold from 100 to 300 without govt approval.

Maharashtra language panel opposes Hindi from class 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-language-panel-opposes-hindi-from-class-1/articleshow/120464569.cms,"MUMBAI: The Language Advisory Committee in Maharashtra on Sunday publicly opposed the introduction of Hindi as a third language alongside Marathi and English for students in Class I to V in state schools, putting the state government on the defensive.Maharashtra is the second major state after Tamil Nadu where introducing a compulsory third language in primary school is leading to a blowback. The committee, in a letter to the chief minister, said the move was neither academically justified nor ""in tune with students' psychology"".On April 16, a directive from the state announced implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) in Maharashtra - and with it, the clause that Hindi would be taught as third language from Grade 1. It resulted in a clamour on social media with criticism led by opposition parties.On Sunday, CM Devendra Fadnavis said he had not read the panel's letter but clarified that Hindi was not replacing Marathi. ""Marathi is mandatory. But under NEP, it is mandatory to learn three languages, of which two need to be Indian languages. So when the language panel headed by the minister submitted their report, they opted for Hindi as we have the required strength of faculty to teach Hindi.""But, he clarified, if some schools want to teach another Indian language in place of Hindi and if there are at least 20 students opting for the same, a teacher can be provided; if not, teaching can probably take place online. And this could be especially considered for schools in areas bordering other states, he added.However, the language committee has warned that the 3-language policy is ""unscientific"" and could place unnecessary pressure on young students. They suggested instead that a requirement for only two languages, including Marathi, be enforced until Class XII. The committee's letter said, ""Ideally, SCERT (State Council of Educational Research and Training) Pune should have consulted the committee before making such decisions. Our membership includes both professors and recognised experts in linguistics and language sciences.""","Maharashtra is the second major state after Tamil Nadu where introducing a compulsory third language in primary school is leading to a blowback.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police is investigating if alterations being carried out at a meat shop on the ground floor may have triggered the collapse of a four-storey building in Mustafabad area , which resulted in 11 deaths on Saturday.According to the FIR, just hours before the incident, construction work was underway at the shop. ""The owner (Tehsin) and others removed the wall between two shops on the ground floor, bypassing the building norms and committing negligence,"" it said. A police source said, ""We are also probing if seepage led to the weakening of the foundation.""The source said the building was constructed in a phased manner - the initial structure consisted of ground and first levels, and two more floors were added later. Police will question the builder and obtain the building's original layout. They will also seek documents from MCD related to the building's approval and compliance.Police said MCD will conduct a thorough inspection of the building on Monday to assess the structural integrity and identify potential causes of the collapse. Police will focus their inquiry on the ground-floor shops, and question their owners or anyone who had taken them on rent. Cops are also likely to seek the help of experts to reconstruct the scene of the collapse by using 3D laser scanning technology.Meanwhile, the postmortems of the 11 victims were conducted on Sunday. Family members of the deceased were overcome with grief as the bodies were brought out in ambulances.At the spot, several relatives searched for the belongings of their loved ones that might be buried under the rubble. Shehzad Ahmad, who lost his nephews Danish and Naved in the incident, said they had sold their land in Bijnor to fund two weddings in the family. “They saved some cash and jewellery, which is now trapped under the debris,” he said. The family was homeless now, he said, adding, “Everything is lost.”Neha, the sister of Danish and Naved, suffered injuries, but managed to save her parents from the debris. However, the family is now left shattered. Alim Ali, the relative of Reshma, another victim, said her two daughters, son and husband were injured in the incident. “All their savings are gone. The family has become homeless; they have nothing left,” Ali said.","Delhi Police is investigating if alterations being carried out at a meat shop on the ground floor may have triggered the collapse of a four-storey building in Mustafabad area.

LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) on late Sunday registered an FIR and launched a probe into an alleged inter-state module that was using encrypted messaging platforms to circulate anti-national content and radicalise youth to carry out fidayeen (suicide) attacks.According to ATS officials, a group was active on secure platforms such as Signal (under the name Al-Maut-ul-Hind), Instagram (Green Birds), Discord (Strangers), and WhatsApp, where they shared content promoting jihad, encouraged attacks on Indian security forces, and discussed targeting Hindu leaders and Israeli establishments in India.The FIR was filed on Thursday by ATS Sub-Inspector Rahul Satyal against three youths, two of whom belong to Sambhal and one from Patna. Their identities have not been revealed, and an interrogation with the ATS team is being conducted.Sources in the ATS said the group was allegedly conspiring to destabilise the country by pushing violent narratives online and planning targeted strikes. “The suspects were reportedly engaged in testing explosives and practising with air and pellet guns. They also shared training videos and posts to recruit new members for “suicide missions,” the ATS stated in the FIR.“Initial inputs suggest that the accused were part of a larger network preparing for proxy warfare against the Indian govt,” said a senior ATS official. “They aimed to foment communal tension and incite attacks on sensitive installations.”The FIR has been lodged at ATS's Gomtinagar police station under sections of UAPA, the Foreigners Act, and Explosives Act, and further investigation is underway to identify other members of the module and trace their funding sources.The ATS has roped in technical experts to track digital trails across multiple platforms and is coordinating with central agencies for deeper intelligence.","The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) registered an FIR and launched a probe into an alleged inter-state module.

Indian scientists submit detailed project report to develop new semiconductor material,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-scientists-submit-detailed-project-report-to-develop-new-semiconductor-material/articleshow/120458831.cms,"NEW DELHI: A team of 30 scientists from India's premier institute, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), has submitted a proposal to the government to develop 'angstrom-scale' chips, far smaller than the smallest chips currently in production. The team has submitted the proposal to the government for developing technologies using a new class of semiconductor materials , called 2D Materials , that could enable chip sizes as small as one-tenth of the smallest chips currently in global production and develop India's leadership in semiconductors.Currently, semiconductor manufacturing is dominated by silicon-based technologies, led by advanced nations such as the US, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.""A team of scientists at IISc submitted a detailed project report (DPR) to the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) in April 2022, which was revised and submitted again in October 2024. The report was later shared with the Ministry of Electronics and IT. The project promises to develop angstrom-scale chips , far smaller than the smallest chips in production today,"" a source in the government familiar with the proposal told PTI.The DPR proposes the development of 2D semiconductors using ultra-thin materials like graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These materials can enable chip fabrication at the angstrom scale, significantly smaller than current nanometer-scale technologies.The smallest chip currently in production is the 3-nanometer node, manufactured by companies like Samsung and MediaTek.A brief summary of the 2D materials project -- which aims to replace silicon, is available on the website of the PSA's office.Sources in the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) confirmed that the proposal has been under discussion.""MeitY is positive about the project. The Principal Scientific Adviser and Secretary, MeitY, have held meetings on it. MeitY is exploring the electronics applications where such technology can be deployed. This is a collaborative effort that requires due diligence at every step,"" an official aware of the matter said.India currently relies heavily on foreign players for semiconductor manufacturing -- a technology that is strategic from both an economic and national security standpoint.The country's largest semiconductor project, being set up by Tata Electronics in partnership with Taiwan's PSMC, involves an investment of Rs 91,000 crore. This project has been approved under the India Semiconductor Mission and is eligible for 50 per cent capital support from the government.In comparison, the IISc-led proposal requests a relatively modest Rs 500 crore over five years to build indigenous technology for next- generation semiconductors. The project also includes a roadmap for self-sustainability after the initial funding phase.Globally, 2D materials have drawn significant interest. Europe has invested over USD 1 billion (around Rs 8,300 crore), South Korea over USD 300 million, and countries like China and Japan have made serious but undisclosed investments in 2D material-based semiconductor research.""2D materials will be key enablers for future heterogeneous systems. While global momentum is building, India's efforts remain limited and need urgent scaling. This is a domain where India can take leadership, but time is running out,"" said an officer familiar with the efforts and global developments, speaking on condition of anonymity.According to the PSA office website, communications regarding the project have been ongoing since 2021, with outreach to key ministries including MeitY, DRDO, and the Department of Space. NITI Aayog also recommended the project in September 2022 based on the IISc report.The officer privy to the research ecosystem noted that several countries are already preparing for a post-silicon world as traditional chip scaling nears its limits.""Global technology players have turned their attention to 2D semiconductors. India now needs to move from deliberation to execution. The proposal seeks Rs 500 crore over five years, but there is still no formal assurance. This window may not stay open for long,"" the person added.","A team of 30 scientists from India's premier institute, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), has submitted a proposal to the government to develop 'angstrom- scale' chips.

In FY 2021-2011, the allocation was Rs 1,389 crore.“The total incentive payouts under this scheme over the years reflect the government's sustained commitment to promoting UPI-based digital payments,” the ministry added.The press release said that India accounted for 49 per cent of worldwide real time transactions in 2023, as per the ACI Worldwide report 2024.","GST is only applicable on charges like the merchant discount rate (MDR), which are relevant for certain payment methods.

Taylor Swift’s new era with Travis Kelce sparks questions about Joe Alwyn’s quiet exit

Taylor Swift has always been intentional about her narrative—every lyric, outfit, and public appearance has meaning. But since going public with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, fans have noticed something subtle yet striking: the virtual disappearance of her ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn from her recent storylines. Was this deliberate, or just the natural progression of moving on?Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift were together for six years—her longest relationship to date. Though private, their romance heavily influenced several of her most emotionally resonant albums, including Folklore, Evermore, and parts of Midnights. Songs like “The 1,” “Invisible String,” and “Peace” were widely believed to be about the British actor. Yet since their split and her blossoming romance with Kelce, mentions of Alwyn have grown eerily scarce.Fans began to notice the shift during the international leg of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. As she introduced tracks from Midnights and updated setlists, her emphasis leaned more toward empowerment, growth, and joy—qualities many associate with her relationship with Kelce. The emotional depth of the Alwyn era seemed to fade into the background, replaced by sparkle, stadium anthems, and viral NFL appearances.Adding fuel to the speculation is Taylor Swift’s growing presence in sports culture, amplified by her relationship with Kelce. Her appearance at Chiefs games and Kelce’s cameos at her shows signal not just a relationship, but a cultural merge that’s being embraced by both fanbases. It’s a public evolution—and with it, perhaps, a quiet edit of what came before.While Swift has never directly commented on Alwyn post-breakup, her artistic choices may be doing the talking. Her newly released content and public appearances focus almost exclusively on the now—with Kelce prominently part of that picture.Whether Taylor is rewriting history or simply writing a new chapter, the shift is undeniable. Alwyn’s influence lives in her past work, but he no longer seems to have a place in the story she’s telling today.Also Read: The man behind Taylor Swift's love songs: Why Joe Alwyn’s influence may outlast Travis Kelce As Swift continues to evolve, one thing is clear: her legacy is hers to shape. And with Travis Kelce by her side, she seems more willing than ever to let go of what was and fully embrace what is—and what’s next.","Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift were together for six years.

What Barack-Michelle said about rumors of their divorce



Barack Obama-Michelle marriage crisis is far from finishing its shelf life as people can't stop talking about it. And the main reason for it is that Barack and Michelle can't stop talking about their marriage either. Michelle has addressed her marriage in her new podcast IMO, with her co-host and older brother Craig Robinson.Megyn Kelly , in the latest episode of her podcast, spoke about what Michelle and Barack have been saying about each other and concluded that they married the wrong people. ""I’ve been married for 17-and-a-half years and not one was bad. I think she and he married the wrong people. Every word she says about Barack Obama is negative… Every time she opines, it’s something that reflects poorly on him – how he’s insensitive, how he’s not a talker, how he doesn’t know how to relate to people, he doesn’t keep the same schedule as she does. And now we’re talking about how you can have a bad decade in a marriage,"" Megyn said.Megyn Kelly fails to mention she's been married twice, Mike Sington wrote on X taking a swipe at Megyn.The rumors of an impending divorce of Barack Obama and Michelle were so intense that Barack Obama was even linked with actor Jennifer Aniston, when Michelle Obama missed several public events where a former first lady is expected to accompany her husband.Barack Obama opened up about his relationship with Michelle and recently revealed that he was in a ""deep deficit"" with Michelle after leaving office and he's still trying to make up to her. “I have been trying to dig myself out of that hole by doing occasionally fun things,” he said.Michelle Obama commented on Barack's solo appearances and said she now has the opportunity to control her own calendar and can now make “a choice for myself.”“I could have made a lot of these decisions years ago, but I didn’t give myself that freedom,” she said. “And now that’s gone. And so now I have to look at my — I get to look at my calendar, which I did this year, was a real big example of me, myself looking at something that I was supposed to do — you know, without naming names — and I chose to do what was best for me, not what I had to do, not what I thought other people wanted me to do.”“That’s the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with like disappointing people,” Michelle continued. “I mean so much so that this year people were, you know — they couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.”","Megyn Kelly said she thinks Barack and Michelle Obama married the wrong persons.

Flight reaches Delhi

NEW DELHI: A Delhi-bound IndiGo flight carrying Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah was diverted to Jaipur on Saturday night.This incident prompted a strong reaction from the CM, who described the situation at Delhi airport as “operational chaos”.The flight, which took off from Jammu, remained in the air for nearly three hours before being rerouted to Jaipur due to apparent congestion or disruption at the national capital’s airport. Passengers, including Abdullah, were left stranded past midnight, with no clarity on when the journey would resume.Taking to X, Abdullah wrote: “Delhi airport is a bloody s**t show (excuse my French but I'm in no mood to be polite). 3 hours in the air after we left Jammu we get diverted to Jaipur & so here I am at 1 in the morning on the steps of the plane getting some fresh air. I've no idea what time we will leave from here.”He also posted a selfie, standing on the aircraft’s steps, after stepping out briefly.The disruption comes amid a broader wave of travel troubles in the Jammu region. Earlier in the day, chaotic scenes were reported at Jammu airport, where hundreds of passengers faced delays and cancellations. Flight operations in and out of Srinagar were also thrown off schedule due to bad weather, which had a ripple effect on connecting flights, including the one carrying Abdullah.On Friday evening, IndiGo had already flagged potential issues due to weather in a travel advisory shared on social media: “#6ETravelAdvisory: Unfavourable weather in #Srinagar is impacting flights, but we're here to keep you informed!” the post read, along with links for passengers to check flight status and explore flexible travel options.In a follow-up advisory, the airline added: “Weather conditions in Srinagar are impacting flight operations. We understand this may cause inconvenience and truly appreciate your patience… Our teams are actively monitoring the situation and will have smooth operations back on track as soon as the weather plays nice.”After the brief delay, the Indigo flight carrying J&K CM Omar Abdullah took off from Jaipur at 2.00 am and landed in Delhi."," Indigo flight carrying J&K CM Omar Abdullah was diverted to Jaipur.

In a significant ruling, the US district court (Northern District of Georgia) has granted temporary relief to 133 international students who faced sudden termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record. With their legal status terminated, had it not been for the district court’s intervention, the students would have had to deport.The district court on Friday evening, issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), ordering the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to reinstate the plaintiffs’ SEVIS records retroactive to March 31, 2025. It also barred federal authorities from using or disclosing the students' personal information outside the scope of this litigation. By Tuesday, US government agencies (defendants to this case) have been ordered to file a notice of compliance with this order.The students, all F-1 visa holders , had filed an urgent plea alleging unlawful actions by federal immigration authorities. This lawsuit is among the largest of its kind concerning SEVIS terminations. All of them were actively enrolled in colleges and universities throughout the US – many of them were weeks away from graduation, or were lawfully undergoing Optional Practical Training (OPT). International students can gain work experience under the OPT program for a year on completion of their studies, this period is further extended by two years for those from the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) streams.Charles Kuck, founding partner of Kuck Baxter, an immigration law firm, who represented the students told TOI, “The overt ignoring of set immigration laws and policies by the Trump administration as it relates to foreign students is not just stunning, but dangerous. It sends a message that will reverberate for a generation as the best and most talented students that might have come to the US will consider and pursue their education options in other countries. This bad for America.” All 133 international students proceeded with the lawsuit pseudonymously and had sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against officials from the (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the US Attorney General. This was prompted by notices received between April 1 and April 14, informing them that their SEVIS records had been terminated—citing either criminal background checks, visa revocations, or alleged failure to maintain lawful status.This lawsuit is among the largest of its kind concerning SEVIS terminations The students argued that the terminations were baseless and procedurally improper. They emphasized that they had no criminal records and had complied with all legal requirements of their student visas.In their complaint, the students alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. They argued that the termination actions lacked proper notice, were devoid of an articulated legal basis, and were executed without giving them an opportunity to respond. The terminations, they claimed, were arbitrary, capricious, and beyond the legal authority granted to immigration agencies.They contended that once admitted to the US with an F-1 visa, international students are granted permission to stay for the ‘duration of status’ as long as they meet the requirements of this visa - maintaining a full course of study and avoiding unauthorised employment.In some, but not all of these cases, the US Department of State (DOS) has revoked the student’s visa. But, the revocation of a F-1 visa does not necessarily impact the person’s lawful presence in the country. As such, plaintiffs contended that it is the SEVIS registration termination that has rendered them vulnerable to devastating immigration outcomes such as detention and deportation, as well as irreparable harm.The district court concurred with the plaintiffs, finding they had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their case. Specifically, the district court held that DHS’s power to terminate F-1 status is tightly constrained by regulation and did not apply in this situation.Judge Victoria Marie Calvert observed that visa revocation alone does not equate to a loss of legal immigration status and cannot be used to justify SEVIS termination . In particular she added, “There is substantial public interest in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.”According to immigration attorneys, this line captures the core of the district court's reasoning—it’s not just about protecting the students, but also about ensuring that government agencies act within the law. It underscores the principle that adherence to legal procedures is fundamental, even in matters involving immigration and national security.Judge Calvert also acknowledged the irreparable harm the students faced: loss of educational opportunities, expulsion from the US on short notice, forfeiture of scholarships and jobs, and severe emotional distress. She cited similar rulings from other district courts that had intervened in SEVIS-related terminations, affirming the need for judicial oversight.The court dismissed the argument that the students could have sought relief under the Privacy Act, noting that the act does not cover international students but applies to permanent residents (green card holders) and US citizens.","133 international students faced sudden termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record.

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 3: Kane Williamson exclusive on NextGen cricketers to watch out for

NEW DELHI: Anaya Bangar , daughter of former India cricketer and coach Sanjay Bangar , has spoken out about the toxic masculinity that continues to plague the cricketing world. In a candid interview, Anaya revealed disturbing experiences she has faced within the cricketing circle, including receiving nude photos from cricketers, verbal abuse, and being propositioned by a former player.Anaya, who publicly came out last year and shared her journey of transformation through hormone replacement therapy and gender-affirming surgery , was formerly known as Aryan. She followed in her father’s footsteps, playing age-group cricket in India. However, she said the journey after transitioning came with many challenges.“There has been support and there have been some harassment as well,” Anaya said during an interview with Lallantop, reflecting on her journey.When asked how fellow cricketers responded after her gender-affirming surgery, Anaya said: “There have been a few cricketers who randomly sent me nude pictures of them.”She also shared more distressing experiences:“The person used to give gaalis in front of everybody. The same person then used to come and sit beside me and ask for my photos. There was another instance, when I was in India, I told a puraane (veteran) cricketer about my situation. He told me let’s go in the car, I want to sleep with you.”Having played alongside prominent Indian cricketers like Musheer Khan, Sarfaraz Khan, and Yashasvi Jaiswal during her early years, Anaya said she was forced to keep her identity hidden because of her father’s public profile.“I had to maintain secrecy about myself because dad is a well known figure. Cricket world is filled with insecurity and toxic masculinity,” she added.Anaya has represented Islam Gymkhana in Mumbai’s club circuit and also played for Hinckley Cricket Club in Leicestershire, UK.However, her cricketing ambitions faced a major setback in November 2023, when the International Cricket Council (ICC) introduced a new policy barring transgender women from participating in international women’s cricket.“Inclusivity is incredibly important to us as a sport, but our priority was to protect the integrity of the international women’s game and the safety of players,” then-ICC CEO Geoff Allardice had said.Anaya responded to the policy with a detailed post on Instagram, expressing her disappointment with the decision.She currently resides in the United Kingdom.",Anaya Bangar is the daughter of former India cricketer and coach Sanjay Bangar.

Google, Meta, Microsoft among top tech firms slashing jobs in 2025

Google: Streamlining amid structural shifts

Microsoft: Organizational restructuring expected in May

Meta: Performance-based layoffs and executive bonus backlash

TikTok: Job reductions in Dublin office

The technology sector is undergoing yet another wave of workforce reductions in 2025, following an already turbulent 2024 marked by widespread layoffs. As companies shift their focus to automation, artificial intelligence, and cost-efficiency, job cuts are becoming a recurring theme across some of the industry's biggest players. According to data from layoff tracking platform Trueup, 234 layoffs have already been recorded in the tech industry this year, affecting 45,656 employees—an average of 439 job losses per day.For comparison, 2024 saw a total of 1,115 layoff incidents with a staggering 238,461 workers affected, translating to an average of 653 daily dismissals. The job cuts reflect a strategic realignment aimed at optimizing resource allocation and enhancing profitability, particularly in high-growth segments such as AI and cloud computing.Google has been among the most active in workforce restructuring, entering its third round of layoffs in 2025. This latest reduction targets several hundred employees within its Platforms & Devices unit, which encompasses key products including Android, Pixel smartphones, and the Chrome web browser.Earlier in the year, Google initiated a “voluntary exit” program specifically for U.S.-based employees in the same division. This followed a 2024 internal reorganization that merged Android and Pixel teams to consolidate operations. The company also reduced headcount in its cloud division in February 2025. A Google spokesperson stated that the actions were necessary “to continue to invest in areas that are critical to our business and ensure our long-term success.”Microsoft is reportedly preparing for another round of layoffs expected to take place as early as May 2025. While official numbers have not been disclosed, internal restructuring is likely to target middle management layers. The company's ongoing objective is to increase the ratio of technical personnel, especially engineers, across all business units.Within Microsoft’s security division, for instance, leadership aims to shift the engineer-to-project manager ratio from 5.5:1 to a leaner 10:1. Performance evaluations are playing a significant role in the decision-making process, and employees with consistently low performance ratings may face termination as part of the streamlining efforts.In February 2025, Meta laid off approximately 3,600 employees, representing nearly 5% of its global workforce. The layoffs were primarily attributed to internal performance evaluations and are consistent with CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s stated vision of transforming Meta into a more efficient and agile organization.However, the timing of the layoffs attracted criticism after the company announced sizable bonus allocations for senior executives shortly afterward. This has sparked debate about compensation disparities and employee morale, especially as many mid- and entry-level workers were affected by the cuts.TikTok has joined the list of tech companies implementing layoffs this year, with around 300 jobs expected to be eliminated at its Dublin office. While the final number is yet to be confirmed, the redundancies are anticipated to take place in April 2025.This move follows a broader trend of workforce optimization across the technology sector, raising concerns among employees in Europe and beyond about job security. The reduction also underscores the challenges facing social media companies amid shifting regulatory environments and growing operational costs.","Google, Microsoft, Meta, and other tech giants cut jobs amid restructuring in 2025.

Tesla stocks declined 33% year-to-date

Tesla investor Ross Gerber, who publicly called for Elon Musk’s exit from the EV company, has once again criticised him. In an interview with Bloomberg Technology, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, said that Musk “doesn’t care” about the electric car manufacturer. He went on to claim that the tech billionaire Elon Musk is not returning 'his focus' to Tesla anytime soon. He has found his next Big Focus and that it is not Tesla. “It’s clear that he just doesn’t care. His next move is X AI… So if you have any confusion that he’s coming back to Tesla, he’s not,” he said during the interview. In March, Gerber said that Musk has lost focus given his widening interests and has become too ‘divisive’. Blaming social media posts and involvement with the president Donald Trump for bringing negative publicity to the company, he then said that “the company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk”.He then stated that Musk would need to choose between backing Trump and safeguarding Tesla. He said : “It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla.”In his Bloomberg interview, Gerber defended his Tesla comments, responding to the criticism from retail investors. He said “I understand why retail investors at Tesla are frustrated with me for voicing my views” adding that he’s “getting attacked because of Elon’s behavior.”However, Gerber said that his firm will continue to manage Tesla shares. He said “We still own Tesla because I do think something fixes itself at some point, and they have the best products”.Despite maintaining its lead in the US EV market, Tesla's stock has dropped 33% year-to-date. According to Cox Automotive data, Tesla sales fell 8.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, while the market expanded 11.4% as a whole. Meanwhile, the EV company is set to announce its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, April 22.Stock market worldwide has been volatile amidst the US-China tariff trade war.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"
