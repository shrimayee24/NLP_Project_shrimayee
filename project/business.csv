Presently, India has emerged one of the most vibrant startup ecosystems in the world and could be the third largest ecosystem by 2024. The entrepreneurial landscape has become explosive with the number jumping from 50,000 in 2018 to over 140,000 in 2024 and has been spurred by innovative ideas, flows of investment, and a considerable pool of talent that is currently changing the country into one of the global hubs of entrepreneurship. As the Hurun India 2024 on Self-Made Entrepreneurs of the Millennia, Bangalore, Mumbai, and Gurugram are now considered to be the center for entrepreneurial activities.Hence, these three cities listed above are the major success and prized startups found in India, which are crucial for the country's progress. Bengaluru is known as the ""Silicon Valley of India"" because most entrepreneurs and innovation companies in the region cluster around this place. Mumbai is close to it since it is the financial capital of India. Hence, good access to capital along with an excellent business ecosystem can be availed here. Thus, this diverse nature of startup clusters makes Gurugram a fast developing technology and business-friendly city relative to the recent period. This blossoming ecosystem is transformed not only in the formation of the Indian economy but in the ranking given the position this country has taken within a list of innovative countries at worldwide level.India's startup ecosystem has witnessed a meteoric rise in the recent past, and the country has been ranked as the world's third-largest startup ecosystem in 2024. Hurun India's 2024 report on Self-Made Entrepreneurs of the Millennia has ranked cities based on the number of successful, self-made entrepreneurs leading significant startups. This ranking highlights the cities that have become hotbeds of innovation and entrepreneurship, making a substantial contribution to India's growth as an economic powerhouse.Bengaluru is generally considered the ""Silicon Valley"" of India and undisputed leader of the startup ecosystem of the country. There are 98 entrepreneurs and 66 of the most noted companies here that have established their signature in Bengaluru. Most have credited the origin to be here when India has come up with its most successful technology ventures. There is an entrepreneurial spirit that this status provides as the city ranks as a world hub in technology.Bengaluru is home to one of the biggest and most innovative companies in India, which happens to be Zerodha- the country's leading stock brokerage platform, spearheaded by its founders Nithin Kamath and Nikhil Kamath.It has deep talent pools of engineers, IT professionals, and software developers. Because of this, it remains one of the most alluring destinations for tech startups. Moreover, Bengaluru is associated with an active venture capital network, which helps the sustenance of many companies there. Its infrastructure, connectivity, and access to various resources make it the highest destination for entrepreneurs in the country.Mumbai is the financial hub of India and one of the major states in the entrepreneurial scenario in the country. Being at number two with 73 entrepreneurs and 36 significant companies, the business finance and industrial might have attracted Mumbai as the center. The entrepreneur who has created Avenue Supermarts or DMart, Radhakishan Damani, has made this city the retail and e-commerce start-up hub.It has good financial infrastructure and attracts capital and resources to the startup sector of retail, fintech, and entertainment, bringing together a very broad market with an international financial hub with great infrastructure, one of the top contenders in the entrepreneurial ecosystem of India.Gurugram is one other important city, as a hub located close to New Delhi, which features 34 entrepreneurs and 31 prominent companies. The hub has emerged as one of the most significant business cities and tech with an accommodation for industries in every e-commerce and fintech company among other IT services. Among the notable companies established there, is Zomato-a popular food delivery application-by Deepinder Goyal.Gurugram is a major business destination because the city is just a stone's throw from New Delhi, so administrative and business resources in the national capital are instantly accessible. Modern infrastructure that comprises IT parks, office spaces, and coworking hubs has helped it evolve into an innovation center.New Delhi is the capital city of India and placed fourth with 51 entrepreneurs and 15 notable companies. New Delhi-based entrepreneurs include Vijay Shekhar Sharma who founded Paytm. Paytm is one of India's biggest fintech firms offering wallets and payment options.Delhi is the buoyant entrepreneurial ecosystem and especially in the fintech, edtech, and e-commerce segments. When talking about infrastructure and its closeness to governmental institutions, Delhi offers networking opportunities, influences policy, and access to funding for any start-up, and hence New Delhi shall remain an element which shall be very high as a position of India's startup culture and also boast more of self-made entrepreneurs.Chennai was an automobile and manufacturing city; it is now in the fifth position with 16 entrepreneurs and 12 notable companies. Entrepreneurs such as Vasant Sridhar, who have founded the B2B platform OfBusiness for SMEs, have helped in diversifying the entrepreneurial profile of Chennai to be much more tech-driven and industrial startups.Chennai has an industrial base, which makes it strong with a qualified workforce, mainly in industries like automotive, information technology, and healthcare. Its entrepreneurial culture is growing and increasing day by day in areas such as fintech, software, and education.Pune is in the sixth place with 15 entrepreneurs and 7 significant companies. Pune has, over time, developed specific niches for itself in areas such as information technology, education, and e-commerce. Amongst such stalwarts of e-commerce stands Firstcry, co-founded by Supam Maheshwari, Sanket Hattimattur, and Prashant Jadhav.The city is known for its thriving startup culture, driven by its educational institutions, research centers, and tech parks. Pune has also become a destination for tech talent, which further supports its growth as a startup hub.Hyderabad ranks seventh with 11 entrepreneurs and 6 notable companies. Known for its role as a technology and pharmaceutical hub, Hyderabad is home to Nandan Reddy, co-founder of Swiggy, India's leading food delivery platform.Hyderabad's burgeoning startup ecosystem has received tremendous support from several thousand technology companies, including in the software development sector, e-commerce, and healthtech. The reason Hyderabad appeals is that its cost of living is low, talent pools are abundant, and the infrastructure is very strong.At the eighth position is Ahmedabad with 10 entrepreneurs and 6 notable companies such as Eris Lifesciences, whose CEO is Amit Bakshi. Strengths are there in manufacturing, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, which increasingly position Ahmedabad as an innovation hub. The city enjoys a favorable business climate due to low operating costs and a strong industrial infrastructure. Its growth in the startup ecosystem has been driven by ventures in industries such as healthcare, retail, and software development.With an entrepreneurial ecosystem smaller in size, Kolkata is at the ninth position with 7 entrepreneurs and 2 notable companies. Ravi Modi is from Kolkata. He founded Vedant Fashions with the Manyavar ethnic-wear brand, and Kolkata is his place. Kolkata is still in its infant stages compared to other big cities, but it has been promising especially in retail and fashion. The potential for growth lies in this city as more entrepreneurs spring up in the region.Rounding out the top 10 is Jaipur with 6 entrepreneurs and 2 notable companies, such as CarDekho, by Amit Jain and Anurag Jain. The company is a popular online portal for buying and selling cars. Although Jaipur's startup ecosystem is pretty small, in the past few years, it has indicated significant potential. The cost of doing business in this city is pretty low and it is now emerging as a hub for e-commerce and digital services.","India's startup ecosystem has witnessed a meteoric rise in the recent past.

The trip was originally scheduled between Dec 22 and Jan 4.""I am not inclined to interfere with permission granted by family court (FC), which has entitled the respondent-mother and the minor son to travel to Singapore within the parameters set out by the court,"" said Justice Somasekhar Sundaresan on Thursday.In Sept 2022, SC had dissolved the couple's marriage and endorsed consent terms. Neither would take their son out of India without four weeks' prior intimation to the other. In contempt proceedings filed by both, SC on Jan 19 said consent terms could be modified by an appropriate legal forum.So, after FC's order, the father moved HC vacation bench, saying the mother is a flight risk as she and the son are Singapore citizens.Senior advocate Abad Ponda said his interest would be jeopardised if his son does not return. Justice Sundaresan said on the contrary consent terms bind the parties, and ""it is incumbent on the father to ensure there is no impediment to such travel... envisaged in consent terms"".The mother's advocate, Mrunalini Deshmukh, said it was known she and the son are Singapore citizens during signing of consent terms. She referred to the mother's undertaking to FC to return as scheduled on Jan 4.Justice Sundaresan said the father's flight risk apprehension is allayed by the mother's undertakings to FC, and reiterated in person to HC.The father raised an issue with the mother's renewal of leave-and-licence agreement.The judge said it ""does not turn the needle in favour of preventing departure of the respondent and the minor son on the proposed vacation trip. I see no basis to hold up any further, the proposed travel.He further noted that having delayed the original departure, the mother was willing to incur additional expense to book fresh tickets to be able to travel forthwith.Justice Sundaresan declined Ponda's request to interview the child, saying the consent terms ""are loud and clear in relation to such travel""."," Bombay HC refused to further delay travel of a woman and her son, 9, to visit her parents in Singapore.

Congress demands memorial for Manmohan Singh; committed to building one: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-demands-memorial-for-manmohan-singh-committed-to-building-one-government/articleshow/116725340.cms,"Cremation site not befitting stature of ex-PM, says Cong

NEW DELHI: Former PM Manmohan Singh will be cremated with full state honours at Nigambodh Ghat here on the banks of Yamuna Saturday.The announcement by the home ministry triggered a controversy, with Congress saying govt did not heed its request to hold his last rites at a befitting place that could be built into a memorial to him. Congress termed the decision ""a deliberate insult to the first Sikh Prime Minister of India"".The govt said it received a request from Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge in the morning ""to allocate space for a memorial"" for Singh. In a press release, the home ministry said immediately after the Cabinet meeting, home minister Amit Shah communicated to Kharge ""and the family of Late Dr Manmohan Singh that the government will allocate space for the memorial. In the meanwhile cremation and other formalities can happen because a trust has to be formed and space has to be allocated to it.""Kharge spoke to the PM and later followed it up with a letter. Govt sources said during separate conversations with the PM and Shah, Kharge ""appreciated"" the point of view that a memorial site cannot be identified immediately, but Congress later chose to make charges against govt.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh in a late-evening statement said, ""The people of our country are simply unable to understand why govt of India could not find a location for his cremation and memorial that is befitting of his global stature, record of outstanding achievements, and exemplary service to the nation for decades.""In his letter to Modi, Kharge demanded that Singh's last rites be conducted at a place where a memorial can be built. ""I also wrote to the home minister,"" Kharge told the Congress Working Committee that met to pay homage to Singh.When Kharge explained the demand and his communication with Modi to CWC, sources said a member of the Gandhi family even suggested that the cremation could be done at Shakti Sthal or Veer Bhumi - the resting places of former PMs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. Sources said Kharge informed that the PM had referred the matter to the home minister and the message was that the issue would be looked into later.However, a govt announcement for cremation at Nigambodh Ghat later in the evening left Congress agitated, with the party viewing the decision to cremate Singh at a place where no former PM has been cremated as not befitting his stature.Govt sources said Congress was making false allegations. ""Both PM and Shah explained the issue in detail to Congress president and emphasised that govt was one with Congress and all others on building a proper memorial for former PM Singh,"" a source said.Meanwhile, Sukhbir Singh Badal of SAD claimed that the Union govt had ""declined the request Dr Manmohan Singh Ji's family for performing the funeral and last rites at a place where an appropriate and historic memorial may be built to commemorate his unparalleled services to the nation"". He added, ""This place should be Rajghat... in keeping with the settled practice and tradition followed in the past.""The Union cabinet earlier in the day decided that Singh will be accorded a state funeral on Saturday at 11.45am and a half-day holiday declared in all central govt offices and central PSUs. The home ministry said the defence ministry would make arrangements for the state funeral with full military honours.Sources said going by the decision taken by the Manmohan Singh govt in 2013, the memorial of the former PM would be built at 'Rashtriya Smriti', at the Samadhis Complex on the Yamuna bank near Rajghat where the memorial of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and other former presidents and PMs have come up.An official statement issued at the time had mentioned that separate memorials constructed earlier for departed national political heads near Rajghat took up large space. ""In view of cabinet decision taken in the year 2000 that 'henceforth govt shall not develop any Samadhi for departed leaders' and the paucity of land at the Samadhis complex area, 'Rashtriya Smriti' is being developed to perform last rites of departed national political heads . The Smriti area will provide space for last rites of departed national political heads in future, besides space for a public gathering,"" it had said.Barring four - Morarji Desai, Gulzarilal Nanda who twice served as interim PM, P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh - all PMs have been cremated in the Capital.","Former PM Manmohan Singh will be cremated with full state honours at Nigambodh Ghat.

India's development priorities were key to Manmohan Singh's foreign policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-development-priorities-were-key-to-manmohan-singhs-foreign-policy/articleshow/116726639.cms,"NEW DELHI: Manmohan Singh believed India's development priorities should shape its foreign policy and, in his own words, create a global environment conducive for India's growth. It was with this in mind that he met President George Bush in 2005 on the margins of the UNGA and asked him if the US could help India access clean energy in the face of many embargoes it had been facing since the 1998 nuclear tests. The rest, as they say, is history.India and the US went on to finalise the civil nuclear deal three years later, paving the way for a waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers Group for India to carry out nuclear commerce without signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but, more importantly, for a seat at the global high table of diplomacy. How he overcame stiff opposition from Left parties and others, even risking his govt, is well documented. A man of conviction, Singh believed the US deal was in India's interest and it helped that Sonia Gandhi probably felt the same and backed him. Singh knew not just how hard Bush had worked for the deal but also how keen he was on having strong ties with India.This was India's chance, and he would not allow it to go abegging. The spirit behind this landmark agreement, which brought India and the US together after years of mistrust, continues to act as a guiding framework for the bilateral relationship, even as it moves on to another potentially transformational stage with the recently launched Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology.Apart from India's development priorities, there were many other factors - or more specifically five principles - that coalesced into forming Singh's foreign policy agenda.These included his firm belief in stable, long-term and mutually beneficial ties, greater integration into the world economy and a ""shared destiny"" of the Indian subcontinent that necessitated greater regional cooperation and connectivity. According to Singh, foreign policy should not just be about interests, but also values dear to Indian people. ""India's experiment of pursuing economic development within the framework of a plural, secular and liberal democracy has inspired people around the world and should continue to do so,"" the former PM said, addressing Indian ambassadors and high commissioners in 2013.While the nuclear deal with the US stood out for the message it conveyed to the world about India's arrival on the global stage, there were other significant foreign policy issues that Singh pursued with elan. Singh's handling of China, his efforts to solidify relations with Asean in the form of the 2012 strategic partnership and efforts to ramp up India's global trade and integration into the world economy to reduce poverty are also among the highlights of Singh's external focus.While PM Modi has been credited with transforming ties with the Gulf, it was Singh who launched India's Look West Policy to boost ties with the region. In fact, many of the policies India has been pursuing currently, whether related to Asean or even Quad, remain rooted in initiatives undertaken under Singh. According to former Australian PM Kevin Rudd, it was the joint response to the 2004 tsunami by the US, Australia, Japan and Indian under Singh that was at the heart of former Japanese PM Shinzo Abe's efforts to launch Quad. He remains the only PM in recent decades to have come anywhere close to resolving the Kashmir issue.As a Wikileaks cable revealed in 2011, Singh confirmed to a visiting US delegation two years earlier that he and then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf had agreed through back-channel talks to a ""non-territorial solution"" to the dispute.As Musharraf had said earlier, this was a four-point peace plan that included free trade and movement across LoC, demilitarisation, maximum autonomy and joint management of the area. Singh himself did not elaborate about the contents of the so-called peace formula but told the US delegation that India and Pakistan had made great progress on the issue till early 2007, or when Musharraf started to run into trouble domestically.The Pakistani govt that followed dismissed the peace plan as a personal initiative of the former president. While Singh was often accused by the opposition of being soft on Pakistan, the former Prime Minister never travelled to the country during his 10 years in office.","Manmohan Singh believed India's development priorities should shape its foreign policy.

Rajasthan tops all states and UTs with more than 6.4 lakh such cases pending, followed by Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, UP and Bengal.Traffic challans and cheque bounce cases together account for a large number of pending cases in courts across India. While govt has started the option of paying traffic challans through virtual courts, cheque-bounce cases are dealt in regular courts given the criminal nature of cases where evidence recording and witness submissions is involved.Law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal recently informed in a written response in Parliament on Dec 20 that several factors lead to delay in disposal of cases related to cheque bounce, including frequent adjournments and lack of adequate arrangement to monitor, track and bunch cases for hearing, besides lack of prescribed time frame by respective courts for disposal of various kinds of cases.""The disposal of cases in courts is contingent upon many factors, which include availability of physical infrastructure, supporting court staff, complexity of facts involved, nature of evidence, cooperation of stakeholders viz bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants & proper application of rules and procedures,"" he said.Given the long delay in disposal of such cases, Supreme Court had in an order dated March 10, 2021, constituted a 10-member committee to study steps that must be taken to facilitate an early disposal of cases underNegotiable Instruments Act .The committee suggested creation of de novo special negotiable instruments court. The amici curiae in the matter suggested a pilot study in five judicial districts with the highest pendency in five states (Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and UP) so that viability of the scheme can be examined.In another order of May 19, 2022, the apex court directed that the pilot study shall be conducted in the manner indicated in the said order for a duration of one year in 25 special courts, one in each of the five judicial districts which have been identified as having the highest pendency by the respective five high courts.

But they have engaged in politics over the issue,"" PTI said, citing official sources.The former prime minister Manmohan Singh's final rites are scheduled to be conducted at Nigambodh Ghat on Saturday with complete State honours.""It has been decided by the Government that State funeral will be accorded to Dr. Manmohan Singh. The funeral will take place at 11.45 am on December 28 at Nigambodh Ghat, New Delhi,"" the ministry of home affairs (MHA) said in their statement.Meanwhile, Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal alleged that the Centre had ""declined"" a request from Singh’s family to conduct the funeral and last rites at a location where an appropriate memorial may be built.""Shocking and unbelievable!

As of now, the cremation is slated to be performed at the common cremation ground at Nigambodh ghat. I am unable to believe that the BJP govt’s bias would go to such extremes in utter disregard of the towering global stature which Dr Manmohan Singh ji enjoyed and will always enjoy.""""Dr Sahib showed great sensitivity and compassion in his dealings with Shiromani Akali Dal over Sikh and Punjab issues. I urge PM Narendra Modi ji to intervene personally to change this deplorable decision of the government,"" he added.In a separate post, former union minister-information & broadcasting Manish Tewari stated that, ""If what is appearing in the Public Space is correct that the cremation of Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh will be held at Nigambodh Ghat, it is extremely unfortunate.""""If Late Dr Manmohan Singh's family wanted it that way then it is a different matter otherwise he should be cremated where the last rites of other Former Prime Ministers have taken place. This great son of Punjab who was respected across the world for his erudition, knowledge and sagacity needs to be given a final send off befitting his stewardship of India for ten long years. That is the least that must be done to honour his memory,"" he added.Singh passed away at AIIMS in Delhi on Thursday night at the age of 92 following age-related health issues. Congress general secretary K C Venugopal had earlier confirmed in a statement that Singh's final procession would begin from the headquarters to the cremation site at 9.30 am on Saturday.""At 8 am tomorrow, December 28, his mortal remains will be taken to the AICC headquarters where the public and Congress workers will have the opportunity to offer their tributes between 8.30 am and 9.30 am.

'That is where my grandfather was killed': What Manmohan Singh said about visiting his ancestral village in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/that-is-where-my-grandfather-was-killed-what-manmohan-singh-said-about-visiting-his-ancestral-village-in-pakistan/articleshow/116720352.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh once offered a poignant response when asked whether he would return to his ancestral village in Pakistan. Born in Gah, a village now in Pakistan's Punjab Chakwal district, Singh’s connection to the place was irrevocably marked by tragedy. When one of his daughters asked if he wished to visit, Singh replied softly, “No, not really. That is where my grandfather was killed.”Singh’s journey from a modest village boy to India’s 13th prime minister brought global attention to Gah, where locals fondly recall their connection to “Mohna,” as he was called.Daman Singh, the former PM's daughter, authored a book titled ""Strictly Personal: Manmohan and Gursharan"", which was released by HarperCollins in the year 2014. The publication aimed to present a detailed narrative about the ""story of her parents"".The village school, where Singh studied until Class 4, holds a symbolic place in their hearts. His admission number, 187, remains etched in its register, dated April 17, 1937. The school was renovated during his tenure as prime minister, and there were discussions about renaming it in his honour. However, despite Gah’s pride in him, Singh never returned.In 2008, he invited his schoolmate, Raja Muhammad Ali, to Delhi, an event villagers cherish. Ali passed away in 2010, and the remaining ties between Singh and Gah grew weaker. With Singh’s passing at 92 in Delhi, the villagers mourned deeply, describing him as family. “The entire village is in mourning. We feel that someone from our family has died today” Altaf Hussain, a teacher at Singh’s former school, told news agency PTI.""All these villagers are deeply moved… They were eager to attend his last rites in India but it is not possible. So they are here to mourn,"" Raja Ashiq Ali, who was a fellow student, made a journey to Delhi in 2008 for a meeting with him.Pakistan’s former foreign minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri also reflected on Singh’s legacy. He recalled Singh’s desire to visit Gah and his vision for regional harmony, famously envisioning a day when one could “have breakfast in Amritsar, lunch in Lahore, and dinner in Kabul.” Kasuri credited Singh for fostering trust and progress in Indo-Pak relations, particularly through initiatives to resolve the Kashmir dispute.Singh’s passing severs tangible bond between Gah and its most famous son. While the man who once sang of Partition’s pain in family picnics is gone, his legacy as a statesman and reformer endures, remembered fondly on both sides of the border.","Dr Manmohan Singh was born in Gah, a village now in Pakistan's Punjab Chakwal district. The village school, where Singh studied until Class 4, holds a symbolic place in their hearts. His admission number, 187, remains etched in its register, dated April 17, 1937.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116720368,imgsize-734517,width-400,resizemode-4/116720368.jpg"

Manmohan Singh could be brutally candid if he trusted you,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manmohan-singh-could-be-brutally-candid-if-he-trusted-you/articleshow/116727855.cms,"To paraphrase one of the greatest scientists (Einstein) speaking about the greatest Indian ( Mahatma Gandhi ), one could justifiably say that later generations would scarcely believe that a person with the character and style of MMS had been so successful in the hurly burly of Indian administration and politics, and would ride its uppermost crests for decades.Since much is already written and spoken about him, let me cover some uncovered incidents and anecdotes. Highly taciturn at the best of times and never gregarious, MMS went into absolute silence when told about the criminal case pending against him in the so-called coal scam , where he was an accused simply because he was, as Prime Minister, also the coal minister for the relevant time.After I assured him that there was no case worth the name against him, there was pin-drop silence till, in a plaintive voice, he said: 'I have tried all my life never to go near illegality. How could my name even appear there? When will my name be cleared because I know I have done nothing remotely wrong."" I had no real answer except to mumble about the vagaries of our legal system which lead agencies and the judicial system to include a name in the accused list even when they know that it is completely vicarious. I know that MMS, being the most honorable man I have encountered in public life , would not be satisfied with the abatement and closure which death brings to a criminal prosecution but would insist on an exoneration.Secondly, he could be brutally and embarrassingly candid in the company of trusted persons. In front of a then sitting cabinet minister and a senior lady civil servant from Punjab in the PMO, he told me directly about one of his deepest regrets qua me, while hinting at forces beyond his control. Decency and confidentiality inhibit me from disclosing the subject of that remark. He repeated that to me at least four times subsequently.Thirdly, he made it a point to remember his friends and well wishers irrespective of the exalted posts he held. Despite bickering and back-biting in some quarters regarding Narasimha Rao , MMS regularly visited him in his last years and went for almost all of Rao's birth and/or death anniversaries till his health permitted. He made considerable efforts to change his programs to condole my father's death in 2007 and to attend the wedding of my two sons, one in 2013 and the other in 2015. Gursharan ji's great interest in and profound knowledge of music meant that while she attended many of my wife's ghazal and Sufi concerts, 'Dr Saheb' also came impromptu for a couple, once as a sitting PM and another after demitting office. He was simplicity personified and had absolutely no airs and pretenses.Fourthly, I have yet to see an Indian politician who kept his family so scrupulously insulated from his public life and, reciprocally, how much his wife and three daughters (one abroad) have shunned public glare, glamour and media attention. I was actually in the same batch of St Stephen's College as his daughter Upinder. She did History (Hons) and I Economics. We knew each other though not well. Not once did anyone from the MMS family try and leverage his exalted status and not once did it even enter my mind to exploit my acquaintance with Upinder. The entire ecosystem in which MMS thought, worked, lived and operated was far, far away from such approaches.As a Trinity, Cambridge alumnus, I would ask him about his drive which made him one of the few non-academics I knew in India with degrees from both of Oxbridge. He would wryly say that having studied under kerosene lamps and streetlights, he understood early on that education was the greatest equalizer.I hope India has the good fortune of getting such an illustrious son again in the near future though I believe that it is going to be very, very difficult.(The writer is an eminent lawyer & Rajya Sabha MP)","MMS went into absolute silence when told about the criminal case pending against him in the so-called coal scam.

"Manmohan Singh combined courage, vision & humility",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manmohan-singh-combined-courage-vision-humility/articleshow/116727815.cms,"On The 1991 Devaluation:

My contact with Manmohan Singh goes back to the end of the 1960s when both of us were in New York. He was in the United Nations and I was teaching at New York University. Later on, we started working together in the mid-1980s when he was governor of the Reserve Bank of India and I was a deputy governor.If you look at his entire career, three important qualities stand out. One is vision, the other is courage and the third is humility. Ideas are needed to move the system forward, but you must have vision. Adequate vision must be supplemented by courage, which we saw in the early 1990s.The most important aspect of Dr Singh's actions is the exhibition of both ideas and implementation. The reforms introduced in the early 1990s, and the subsequent actions that he took in the period when he was PM, all indicate this combination of ideas and implementation.We worked together and there was an exchange of ideas. Even when we differed, we did so politely. He tried to take everybody along with him, and he gave the freedom to discuss freely. Finally, a conclusion was reached in which everybody agreed.There were occasions when we differed. But that did not come in the way of executing the ideas. There was also the quality of humility in him, which was extraordinary. For a person who held such important positions, he never rode roughshod over anybody.For example, in bringing to an end the system of issuing ad-hoc treasury bills, when I mentioned to him how this system acted a way that it resulted in the automatic monetisation of the fiscal deficit, he heard me out and then agreed, even though I did not expect he would agree to it that quickly. But he did, because when he saw the logic, he tried to follow it and implement whatever suggestion was made.Bringing the issue of these bills to an end could result in the cost of govt borrowing going up. But he was willing to bear it because the underlying principle was correct.Again, when we moved from the system of dual exchange rate to a system in which the market fully determined the exchange rate, there were many arguments against the move. There were suggestions that we move slowly. But when I discussed it with him, we decided that it was better to move in one step. He once again saw the benefit that comes from a particular action and immediately agreed to implement it.What he cared for is the benefit to the nation, benefit to society. If that demanded a particular action, he would take that action immediately.Originally, a decision was taken to devalue the rupee in two stages. I was in charge of announcing the exchange rate and made the first move.Before the second move could be made, there were some concerns whether we should devalue the rupee to such an extent. We had discussed the problem thoroughly and a conclusion had been reached and was also communicated to the President. But then the Prime Minister (PV Narasimha Rao) had some concerns on going ahead with the second step. Dr Singh said he would get in touch with me but then he went on saying that he was not able to reach me. By the time he reached me, I'd already ""jumped the step"".If he had backed down at that time, it would have reflected badly on India. Our ability to borrow in the market would have been hindered as it would have been seen as our unwillingness to take appropriate action.When the decision to devalue the rupee was taken, Dr Singh wrote a cheque and asked for it to be credited to the PM's Relief Fund. The amount represented difference in rupee value of his assets abroad following the devaluation. That showed how he was not willing to benefit by any decision personally. That shows the man's character, that his integrity was beyond question.He certainly managed the system both as the FM and the PM very well. History will remember him as one of the ablest PMs. Between 2005-06 and 2007-08, India had a growth rate in excess of 9%, which is outstanding.He will be remembered for ushering in efficiency in the system. That is what compelled him to move towards a competitive system. That is an important lesson for a country like India because if we really want to be able to compete in the world, let us say through exports, then efficiency becomes critically important. Without an efficient economic system, we cannot do it.As told to Surojit Gupta","The most important aspect of Dr Singh's actions is the exhibition of both ideas and implementation.

As finance minister , he introduced the 1991 reforms, which gave the Indian economy a completely new direction.It was a direction that was continued by subsequent govts. That is very, very important because it allowed the reforms to continue.The broad thrust of reforms has been that India is opening up, developing infrastructure, and becoming more competitive. This has been a continuing theme.If we are looking at the rest of the world, we are now in a good position. It's the result of a lot of work in which Dr Manmohan Singh probably had the single largest contribution.In his last press conference as Prime Minister, he had said that history would judge him more kindly than the media. I think that's been borne out because people now recognise that he brought about tremendous changes.He has left behind three big enduring legacies. Number one, the awareness that a well-considered dedication to economic reform leads to results and thateconomic policy matters.Point number two is that to build a consensus in a country as diverse as India, you must engage in a continuous dialogue with people, listening to people of all shades of opinion. Dr Singh was very good at that. He didn't think that just because he knew better, that should be it. He would consult people, explain to them why this was necessary and would also encourage his team to engage in such discussions. That is an essential part of taking the whole country together.Finally, his extreme simplicity, honesty and decency. Everybody who met with him was struck by his gentleness.As told to Surojit Gupta","Dr Manmohan Singh's contribution to the development of the Indian economy is remarkable.

How a 'meek' PM Manmohan Singh flexed muscles to seal Nuclear deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-a-meek-pm-manmohan-singh-flexed-muscles-to-seal-nuclear-deal/articleshow/116727106.cms,"Former PM Manmohan Singh

NEW DELHI: Seen as ""docile"" and ""time server"", Manmohan Singh was supposed to fold up when threatened with the survival of his fortuitous perch of Prime Minister. Then indispensable UPA pillar, the CPM, led by a doctrinaire Prakash Karat, had laid down the red line over the path-breaking Indo-US nuclear deal .But instead of putting survival over self-respect, Singh defended the deal to the Communist apparatchik in a matter-of-fact chat on August 7, 2007, and defied him to carry out his threat. ""If you want to withdraw support, so be it.""The Left withdrew, a tumultuous numbers game with Communists, BJP ""communalists"" and Mayawati on the same side, was won and the 'Deal' was delivered. And so was a ""muscular Manmohan"", who months later led Congress to a big win in the 2009 LS polls to emerge as a leader in his own right.Behind Singh's transition from ""meek"" to ""muscular"" was the seminal event that included high policy calculations and sharp political manoeuvrings. In the thick of it was Samajwadi Party, ever eager to join govt and make up for the slight of 1999 when Mulayam Singh Yadav refused to support Sonia Gandhi's bid to form govt after the fall of Vajpayee govt by one vote. It was also an opportunity for Mulayam to find place on the treasury benches he had failed to secure when Congress and its allies managed enough seats to form govt without his support after the 2004 LS polls.Singh tied up with Mulayam, known as a China phobe, with Congress managers promising Samajwadis relief from their legal troubles. To make the deal about policy, a briefing on '123 agreement' by NSA M K Narayanan was organised at then Mulayam confidant late Amar Singh's Lodhi Estate residence.The SP crossover changed the numbers' game, while the opposition bid to trigger defections from govt camp was countered by an equally aggressive counter-attack.For 12 days, the capital became a hub of meetings and late night huddles, surreptitious contacts and secret offers. Karat had, informally, termed Mayawati's switch to the ""nay"" group as a ""game changer"". BJP managers threw their all into the attempt to bring down the UPA. And as seen in the Parliament complex on the day of the dramatic vote, the cut-throat exercise had made BJP roll in some of its ailing MPs in ambulances for voting against the Deal.The clash eventually saw three BJP MPs bring wads of cash in Lok Sabha to claim bribes offered - cash for vote - as it came to be known. But by July 22 evening, "" Singh is King "" was the buzzword swamping the cacophony of allegations and counter allegations, days after Left pulled out of govt on July 9, 2008.That was the moment that made Singh more than he was till then known for or capable of. Already a darling of the middle classes for his role in liberalising the economy, he became its mascot as the ""strong leader"" standing up for the country's progress and development, to the extent of even risking power.","Singh's transition from ""meek"" to ""muscular"" was the seminal event that included high policy calculations and sharp political manoeuvrings.

'I feel I have done reasonably well': Top quotes of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-feel-i-have-done-reasonably-well-top-quotes-of-former-prime-minister-manmohan-singh/articleshow/116690190.cms,"Here's are some top quotes of India’s fourteenth Prime Minister:

""I would be the last person to say there is no scope of doing more"" Singh said at a press conference at the National Media Centre, New Delhi on January 3, 2014.

""I have never felt like resigning at any time. I have enjoyed doing my work. I have tried to do my work with all honesty, with all sense of integrity, without regard, or fear or favour,"" Singh said at a press conference on January 3, 2014.

""I do not believe that I have been a weak Prime Minister. That is for historians to judge. The BJP and its associates may say whatever they like. But if by “strong Prime Minister”, you mean that you preside over a mass massacre of innocent citizens on the streets of Ahmedabad, that is the measure of strength, I do not believe that sort of strength this country needs, least of all, in its Prime Minister,"" he had said at the same press conference when he was asked ""The BJP and Mr Modi’s charge against you is that you have been a weak PM. Does the party have a role,"" he said in a conference.

""It is for you to judge. As far as I am concerned, I feel I have done reasonably well. The growth process that we sustained in the last ten years despite the global financial crisis, despite the Euro-zone crisis, and considering also what is happening in other emerging countries like Brazil, like South Africa, like Indonesia, I don’t think ours is a story which can be described as non-successful or eventful,"" said Singh when he was asked to rate his tenure on a scale of ten at a press conference on Jan 3, 2014.

""Let me say at the outset that I do believe we are set for better times. The cycle of global economic growth is turning for the better,"" he had said during opening remarks at a press conference.

""Well, if I can succeed in normalising relations between India and Pakistan as they should prevail between two normal states, I will consider my job well done,"" he said while he was returning from a two-nation tour of China and Kazkhstan in 2011.

""I would be the first person to admit that we could have done more. We should not be satisfied with what we have achieved. There is always room for improvement and for better outcomes. But I do believe that the record of our first year is a record of reasonable achievement,"" he said.

""I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the Opposition parties in Parliament,"" he said in a press conference.

""India is a hospitable environment for FDI and will continue to do so. We will continue to improve our practices wherever they are needed,"" he said in a press conference in Jan 2014.

""It is often said that time is a great healer. But unfortunately, in the case of demonetisation, the scars and wounds of demonetisation are only getting more visible with time,"" he said on demonetisation in 2018.

“More than any other period of human history, the need for unity of thought and action today is the most urgent,” he said during an event by Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID) in 2019.

""When the world is breaking up into fragments, and fragments clash with fragments, surrendering all sense and purpose of living for the larger humanity, it is the humanity which seeks transcendence from narrow limits and boundaries,"" he said during an event by Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID) in 2019.

Manmohan Singh: The phone call that changed a nation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manmohan-singhs-demise-the-phone-call-that-changed-a-nation/articleshow/116696430.cms,"Singh helped India say goodbye to

Licence Raj

It was June 1991. Manmohan Singh had just returned to Delhi, after attending a conference in the Netherlands, and had gone to bed. Late that night, Singh's son-in-law, Vijay Tankha, took a phone call. The voice on the other end was that of PC Alexander, a confidante of PV Narasimha Rao . Alexander urged Vijay to wake up his father-in-law.Singh and Alexander met a few hours later, and the official told Singh about Rao's plan to appoint him FM. Singh, then UGC chairman, and who had never been in politics, didn't take Alexander seriously.But Rao was serious. On June 21, Singh was in his UGC office. He was told to go home, get dressed and attend the swearing-in function. ""Everybody was surprised to see me as a member of the new team lined up to take the oath of office. My portfolio was allotted later, but I was told straight away by Narasimha Rao ji that I was going to be finance minister,"" Singh is quoted as saying in 'Strictly Personal, Manmohan & Gursharan', a book by his daughter Daman Singh.That appointment changed the course of India's economy. From an insular, control-heavy, low-growth economy it became what's today the world's fastest growing major economy.Along with Rao, Singh was the architect of 1991 reforms, weathering attacks from inside and outside Congress. The economy was in tatters, forex reserves had dropped to Rs 2,500 crore, barely sufficient to cover 2 weeks of imports, global banks were refusing to offer loans, forex outflows were large, inflation was soaring.But Singh knew the problems beforehand, and also the solutions, which he outlined in his budget speech a month later. The ball was set rolling within days of moving into North Block. He worked closely with then RBI deputy governor C Rangarajan to devalue the rupee and removed export controls in partnership with P Chidambaram, then the commerce minister.July 24, the day Singh presented his first budget, saw the Indian economy saying good riddance to the licence-permit raj. Hours before the budget, the Rao govt tabled the new industrial policy in Parliament, working on a paper that Singh remembered having seen during his brief stint as economic adviser to Chandra Sekhar, who led a fragile coalition in 1990-91.Based on the document prepared by economic adviser Rakesh Mohan, industrial delicensing was undertaken in all but 18 sectors, and foreign direct investment was allowed in 34 industries. Besides, public sector monopoly in several sectors came to an end and disinvestment of govt shareholding in state-run companies was permitted.His budget freed up fund-raising by Indian companies by setting up Sebi and also announced a new committee under RBI governor M Narasimhan to work out the new architecture for the financial sector, which was implemented by the Rao govt and its successors. The budget focused on fiscal consolidation, by cutting down on wasteful spending.Singh had also drawn attention to the precarious price situation in his 1991 budget speech.""The price situation, which is of immediate concern to the vast mass of our people, poses a serious problem as inflation has reached a double digit level. During the fiscal year ending 31st March 1991 the wholesale price index registered an increase of 12.1%, while the consumer price index registered an increase of 13.6%. The major worrisome feature of the inflation in 1990-91 was that it was concentrated in essential commodities,"" Singh had said.Those reforms had put the economy back on track and triggered optimism globally. The ""Bombay Club"", a group of corporate chiefs who wanted protection from foreign competition, was not happy. But they got it wrong.","Manmohan Singh was the architect of 1991 reforms, weathering attacks from inside and outside Congress.

'No red sandalwood sold at international auctions since pandemic'

HYDERABAD: Amid the controversy over the stampede outside Sandhya Theatre claiming the life of a woman earlier this month during the premiere of Pushpa2: The Rule, the Allu Arjun-starring action drama, which sees him playing a red sanders smuggler, has already seen a collective earning (from Part 1 and 2) of around Rs 1,500 crore.However, the box office collections of the film are in stark contrast to the reality of the Andhra Pradesh govt's struggles to earn a profit from auction of red sanders, with the international market showing little interest.Red sanders, or red sandalwood , is listed as an endangered species under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, making its felling or sale by private players illegal. However, India received permission to remove the species from the endangered list, allowing limited legal sales with special govt authorisation.The species is endemic to AP's Rayalaseema region, but despite multiple attempts made by the AP govt - the major authorised seller of red sandalwood in India - to auction the prized wood, known for its use in certain traditional medicine and luxury goods industries, it has struggled to sell even a tonne of it in the international market since the Covid pandemic.Meanwhile, the state's Seshachalam Hills, one of India's richest biospheres, remains a hotbed of red sanders smuggling .AP government sources reveal that since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, no red sandalwood has been sold in any international auctions, with even China, previously the primary market for the timber, showing little interest.Since the 1990s, the AP govt has held nearly 24 rounds of international auctions but only managed to raise between ₹1,800 and ₹1,900 crore, slightly more than the earnings from Pushpa.It faced a setback in Nov-Dec this year, when it tried to auction 905 tonnes of red sandalwood, but failed to sell a single tonne. ""China remains the primary market, but demand has fallen since 2020 owing to the pandemic,"" claim sources, attributing the decline to the resultant global economic slowdown.The Directorate General of Foreign Trade has granted AP permission to auction 11,000 tonnes of red sanders, but about 4,000 tonnes of this is still stored in a high-security depot in the temple town of Tirupati.The logs are graded in three categories: A, B, and C, with A being the highest quality. The first fetched Rs 1 crore to 1.5 crore per tonne at auctions held during the previous tenure of the Telugu Desam Party govt. A-grade red sanders is currently valued at around ₹75 lakh per tonne.Despite the market slump, govt sources say that there are no plans to lower the price. ""We expect demand to rebound, and we do not want to give smugglers a chance to manipulate the market and form cartels,"" said a senior govt official.","Red sanders, or red sandalwood, is listed as an endangered species under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.

President Obama Welcomes Prime Minister Singh of India

NEW DELHI: His delicate health notwithstanding, the politician in former prime minister Manmohan Singh came out sharply during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections when he accused his successor Narendra Modi of lowering the dignity of public discourse and the gravity of the office of the prime minister by delivering ""hateful speeches"" during the poll campaign. In an appeal to voters in Punjab ahead of the seventh phase of the Lok Sabha polls on June 1, Singh had asserted that only the Congress could ensure a growth-oriented progressive future where democracy and the Constitution would be safeguarded.The senior Congress leader had also hit out at the BJP government for imposing an ""ill-conceived"" Agnipath scheme, which he termed as a threat to national security.""The BJP thinks that the value of patriotism, bravery and service is only four years. This shows their fake nationalism,"" he had said in what is considered as his last letter to voters of Punjab.The Congress had released Singh's letter to the media on May 30.Singh had said those who trained for regular recruitment were woefully betrayed by the Modi regime.He had said, ""The youth of Punjab, the son of the farmer, who dreams of serving the motherland through the Armed Forces, is now thinking twice about getting recruited only for a four-year stint. The Agniveer scheme endangers national security. The Congress party has therefore promised to abolish the Agniveer scheme.""Mounting an attack on Modi, he had said, ""I have been keenly following the political discourse during this election campaign. Modi ji has indulged in the most vicious form of hate speeches, which are purely divisive in nature. Modi ji is the first prime minister to lower the dignity of public discourse, and thereby the gravity of the office of the prime minister.""""No prime minister in the past has uttered such hateful, unparliamentary and coarse terms, meant to target either a specific section of the society or the opposition. He has also attributed some false statements to me. I have never in my life singled out one community from the other. That is the sole copyright of the BJP,"" the former prime minister had said.""People of India are seeing through all of this. This narrative of dehumanisation has now reached its peak. It is now our duty to save our beloved nation from these forces of discord,"" Singh had said.He had appealed to the voters to give love, peace, fraternity and harmony a chance in India and urged the voters in Punjab to vote for development and inclusive progress.""I appeal to all the young minds to exercise caution and vote for a brighter future. Only Congress can ensure a growth-oriented progressive future, where democracy and the Constitution shall be safeguarded,"" Singh had said.Modi had accused Singh of saying that Muslims had the first right on the country's resources.""This narrative of dehumanisation has now reached its peak. It is now our duty to save our beloved nation from these forces of discord,"" Singh had said in the letter.The former prime minister had noted that India was standing at a crucial juncture and, in the last phase of voting, ""we have one final chance to ensure that democracy and our Constitution is protected from the repeated assaults of a despotic regime, trying to unleash dictatorship in India"".Lauding Punjabis as warriors, he had said they were known for their spirit of sacrifice and indomitable courage and innate belief in the democratic ethos of inclusiveness, harmony, amity and brotherhood could protect our great nation.""In the past 10 years, the BJP government has left no stone unturned in castigating Punjab, Punjabis and Punjabiyat. 750 farmers, mostly belonging to Punjab, were martyred while incessantly waiting at Delhi borders, for months together. As if the lathis and the rubber bullets were not enough, none less than the prime minister verbally assaulted our farmers by calling them 'andolanjeevis' and 'parjeevi (parasites)' on the floor of Parliament. Their only demand was the withdrawal of the three farm laws imposed on them without consulting them,"" he had said.""Unprecedented unemployment and unbridled inflation have greatly widened inequality, which is now at a 100-year high. While the Congress-UPA, despite challenges, increased the purchasing power of our people, the misrule of the BJP government has resulted in depletion of household savings to a historic 47-year low,"" he had added.Singh, the architect of India's economic reforms and a consensus builder in the rough world of politics, died at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, late on Thursday. He was 92.","Former prime minister Manmohan Singh came out sharply during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.

Elon Musk says his $1 billion offer to Wikipedia “still stands”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-says-his-1-billion-offer-to-wikipedia-still-stands/articleshow/116637523.cms,"What Musk said in his original post

Have you ever wondered why the Wikimedia Foundation wants so much money?

It certainly isn’t needed to operate Wikipedia. You can literally fit a copy of the entire text on your phone!

So, what’s the money for? Inquiring minds want to know …

Elon Musk’s $1 billion offer to rename Wikipedia is still open. Initially proposed in response to a post stating, “Wikipedia is not for sale,” Musk clarified that the offer would remain valid for at least one year.Doge Designer , a frequent recipient of Musk’s interactions on X, recently shared the original post, prompting Musk to reaffirm that his offer is still active.“Elon Musk once offered Wikipedia $1 billion to change their name to ‘ Dickipedia ’,” the post from Doge Designer read.Musk was quick to respond saying, “True. Offer still stands.”Whether Wikipedia will take Musk up on his offer remains to be seen. However, the offer itself – extended in October last year – has generated significant attention.Last year, Musk shared a photo which read, “Wikipedia is not for sale”. Musk criticised it by saying:Then in a separate post, he said, “I will give them a billion dollars if they change their name to Dickipedia”, adding that he would do so “in the interests of accuracy.”When a user responded saying, “@Wikipedia, Do it! You can always change it back after you collect,"" Musk replied by saying, “One year minimum. I mean, I'm not a fool lol.”","Elon Musk’s $1 billion offer to rename Wikipedia is still open.

OpenAI’s statement

In October, 26-year-old Indian-origin tech researcher and former OpenAI employee, Suchir Balaji , made headlines when he criticised OpenAI in an interview with The New York Times, voicing concerns over potential copyright violations by leading AI companies.Balaji, who played a key role in organising data for OpenAI’s models, resigned in August, calling its practices unfair. By November, The New York Times' lawyers named him as a key figure in their copyright case against OpenAI.""If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave,"" he told the Times.However, on November 26, shortly after his 26th birthday, Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment. Authorities ruled his death a suicide, yet his family remains unconvinced, pushing for a deeper investigation.Poornima Ramarao , Balaji’s mother offered clues about her son’s tragedy in an exclusive interview with Business Insider.She revealed that Balaji joined OpenAI in 2018 as an intern and later rose to a pivotal position, contributing to the development of ChatGPT.A brilliant mind from a young age, he built a computer at 13, wrote a science paper on chip design at 14, and won a national programming contest in high school. At 17, he was recruited by Quora, where his talent blossomed further.""As a toddler, as a little 5-year-old, he never made mistakes. He was perfect,"" recalled his mother who was a software engineer.""Dad would say, 'Don't focus too much. Don't push him too much,'"" she said.Balaji’s career took off when he joined OpenAI full-time after graduating from UC Berkeley, where he had already earned $100,000 in a TSA-sponsored challenge to improve passenger-screening algorithms.But as OpenAI shifted from its nonprofit, open-source roots to a more profit-driven model, Balaji grew increasingly disillusioned. His mother revealed that he feared AI’s potential harm to society and the publishing industry.""He felt AI is a harm to humanity,"" Ramarao said.Balaji publicly voiced his concerns about AI’s ethical implications, especially regarding copyright, he criticised OpenAI’s use of publicly available internet data for profit, questioning its impact on creators' livelihoods.By late 2023, Balaji had lost enthusiasm for his work at OpenAI and began openly criticising CEO Sam Altman , as per family accounts. After resigning, he planned to start a machine-learning nonprofit in the medical field.She shared that she had a close bond with her son and recalled driving him to his office in Mountain View during his time at Quora.She toldthat she initially worried about how Balaji would manage among ""so many adults,"" but he quickly adapted, making friends to play poker with and enjoying Quora’s well-stocked cafeteria. It became a lesson in trusting her son.""That’s when I realised my son is truly advanced, and I shouldn’t hold him back,"" Ramarao said.She would arrange Costco shipments to his apartment to ensure he had enough fruit and often brought granola bars and cookies during her visits, knowing he tended to skip breakfast.She also revealed that Balaji often used to conceal his emotions and always paid for everything.She mentioned that during their last meal together on November 7, she asked Suchir if, despite the hardships and the way she had raised him, he would still choose her as his mother if given the choice.“He didn't think for a second,'"" she said. ""'Yes, mom.' And you know what? As a mother, that will keep me going as long as I'm alive.""Balaji’s death has left his family and friends grappling with grief, unanswered questions, and conspiracy theories. The San Francisco police ruled out foul play, citing CCTV footage showing he was alone. However, a private autopsy commissioned by the family yielded ""atypical"" results, according to Ramarao, though details remain undisclosed.Balaji's parents are advocating for the case to be reopened, emphasising the vulnerabilities of whistleblowers. A Change.org petition and a social media campaign aim to raise awareness, while an event in his memory is planned for December 27.""We want to leave the question open,"" Ramarao said.""It doesn't look like a normal situation.""However, Ramarao emphasized that the family isn't pointing fingers at OpenAI.She revealed that Balaji took a break from work after leaving OpenAI in August.""He said, 'I'm not taking up another job. Don't ask me.'""From his parents' perspective, all seemed well with the young coder. He was financially secure, with enough OpenAI stock to potentially buy a house, and had plans to start a machine-learning nonprofit focused on healthcare.""He wanted to do something for society,"" his mom said.On November 21, Balaji celebrated his 26th birthday with friends during a vacation. The following day, he told his mother about his flight details and spoke with his father before dinner, who wished him a happy birthday and mentioned sending a gift. According to Ramarao, the medical examiner's office concluded that Balaji passed away either that evening or the following morning.""He was upbeat and happy,"" she said. ""What can go wrong within a few hours that his life is lost?""Ramarao told that she did not hear from her son on Saturday and Sunday and thought that maybe he had lost his phone or gone for a hike. On Monday, she went to his apartment and knocked on the door, but there was no answer. She considered filing a missing-person report, but hesitated, knowing she would need to go to the police station in person to cancel it later.""He'll get mad at me,"" she thought.The following morning, she called the San Francisco police which found his body just after 1 pm.Ramarao said she was not informed about what had happened nor allowed inside his apartment. As officers arrived, she begged them to check if his laptop and toothbrush were missing, hoping it would indicate whether he had left.""They didn't give the news to me,"" Ramaro said, ""I'm still sitting there thinking, 'My son is traveling. He's gone somewhere.'Around 2 pm, she was told to go home which she refused.""I sat there firmly,"" Ramarao told BI.Around 3:20 pm, a long white van arrived with its light on.""I was waiting to see medical help or nurses or someone coming out of the van,"" adding, ""But a stretcher came. A simple stretcher. I ran and asked the person. He said, 'We have a dead body in that apartment.'""About an hour later, a medical examiner and police officers requested a private meeting with Ramarao in the apartment's office. They informed her that Balaji had died by suicide and, based on CCTV footage, he had been alone. The department spokesperson toldthere was no initial evidence of foul play.However, Balaji's parents remain unconvinced and arranged for a private autopsy, which was completed in early December.Balaji's parents are working with an attorney to press the San Francisco police to reopen the case and do a ""proper investigation.""An OpenAI spokesperson described Balaji as a valued team member whose passing deeply impacted his colleagues.“We were devastated to learn of this tragic news and have been in touch with Suchir's family to offer our full support during this difficult time,"" the spokesperson wrote in a statement.The spokesperson further added that the company first became aware of Suchir’s concerns when The New York Times published his comments.""We respect his, and others', right to share views freely. Our hearts go out to Suchir's loved ones, and we extend our deepest condolences to all who are mourning his loss.""","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old Indian-origin tech researcher and former OpenAI employee, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment.

""Experiment, take risks, fail, find difficult problems, do something valuable, don't be afraid, and, you know, be bold,"" he advised.

""I learned a long time ago that there's a diminishing return to the number of hours worked in any given day,"" he said, stressing the importance of finding the right balance between ""working and playing and relaxing.""The tech mogul highlighted workplace culture as crucial for sustained success.

However, both TikTok and Chinese authorities rejected these allegations.Trump also demanded that a US enterprise purchase TikTok, with government participation in sale proceeds. However, Joe Biden signed a law to ban the app for the same reasons.Meanwhile, Trump has changed his stance and said he has ""a warm spot"" for TikTok. He indicated his administration would review the application and potential ban.Earlier this month, the president-elect hosted TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.""Now (that) I'm thinking about it, I'm for TikTok, because you need competition.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
