MUMBAI: In a 27-year-old Pune case of robbery and multiple murders, a key accused tried separately on his re-arrest 13 years after allegedly fleeing from custody— who was convicted and sentenced to death in 2021 — stood acquitted on Monday by Bombay high court . The HC directed that he be released “forthwith”.The accused, Bhagwat Kale , was then a watchman at a construction site and did other odd jobs. The victims were four members of a family, including two children. The alleged motive was robbery of cash and silver ornaments worth roughly Rs 49 lakh.The state sought confirmation of the noose from HC as required by law for capital punishment. HC set him at liberty, holding no case was established to either nail him or hang him. A division bench of Justices Bharati Dangre and Manjusha Deshpande, pronouncing the judgment, said, “Since we find no case made out in confirming the death sentence... we dismiss the confirmation case.” Kale appealed against his conviction. HC, in a reasoned judgment to be made available later, set aside his conviction.On the intervening night of May 15-16, 1997, Ramesh Patil (55), Vijaya Patil (47), Pooja Patil (13), and Manjunath Patil (10) were murdered at their rented Kalyaninagar residence. Bhagwat Kale’s wife, Geetabai, worked as a domestic help at the Patils’ house.A Pune sessions court convicted Geetabai and the third accused, Sahebrao alias Navnath Kale, for the murders in Jan 2004.While Geetabai was sentenced to a life term, Navnath was sentenced to death by hanging. The state cited a Nov 2004 judgment of the HC division bench of then Justices V G Palshikar and Anoop Mohta, which, while commuting Navnath’s death sentence but upholding their convictions, said, “Bhagwat could not be tried as he was absconding.”","Bhagwat Kale tried separately on his re-arrest 13 years after allegedly fleeing from custody.

NGOs and activists can’t try to run the country through PILs: SG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ngos-activists-cannot-try-to-run-country-through-pils-centre-tells-supreme-court/articleshow/116152752.cms,"The Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: With NGOs and social activists attempting to perpetuate covid pandemic time free ration to migrant labour, the centre on Monday told the supreme court that it continues to provide food grains to needy strictly under the Food Safety Act but strongly resisted what it called attempts by the petitioners to run the country through PILs.Appearing for a PIL petitioner, activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan said the government may be giving free ration to around 80 crore persons but has illegally left out around two to three crore poor people from the scheme by telling the states that the stock of food grain meant to be distributed under the scheme is exhausted.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Manmohan said it may fall under the policy domain of the government to decide its food security policy, but suggested to solicitor general Tushar Mehta that if the present financial status of 80 crore beneficiaries of free ration is re-evaluated and if few crores of people have crossed the below poverty line parameters, it could consider including those left out from the scheme.The bench said the states are indiscriminately issuing ration cards for free food grains knowing fully well that it is the Centre’s liability to provide the grains. “If the states are asked to provide free ration, then most of them would run away citing financial crunch. We should concentrate on generating more employment,” Justice Kant-led bench said.Mehta said these proceedings were initiated suo motu by the SC in 2020 when the covid pandemic was at its peak to ensure that no one went hungry. “Bhushan is riding on that and trying to run the government and frame policies,” he said.The SG said, “During the Covid pandemic time, thousands of people lent a helping hand to minimize the impact on the poor. But a few armchair activists like Bhushan sat in their air-conditioned homes and drafted PILs. These NGOs and activists must file affidavits detailing what they did to help ameliorate the condition of the poor during the pandemic.”A hurt Bhushan said, “Mehta has the habit of making some barbed comments against me in every case he opposes me in the SC as I had made public some damaging emails featuring him.”Mehta said these emails were placed by Bhushan before the SC, which after perusing them had passed strictures against a petitioner, who was represented by Bhushan, for bringing on record the emails. The SG said, “He cannot attempt to run the government. We have and will always oppose such attempts from him.”Calling a truce, the bench said, “The question that emerges now is that if the states keep on issuing ration cards, should they be made liable to pay for the ration instead of depending on the Centre”. The bench posted the matter for further hearing on Jan 8.","The centre told the supreme court that it continues to provide food grains to needy strictly under the Food Safety Act.

Opposition to move resolution to remove Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar: Sources,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-to-move-resolution-to-remove-rajya-sabha-chairman-jagdeep-dhankhar-sources/articleshow/116147160.cms,"NEW DELHI: A joint move against the Rajya Sabha chairman has put the INDIA bloc back together. The turbulent relations between Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar and the Opposition members of the INDIA bloc came to a head on Monday, with the opposition camp considering submitting a notice ""very soon"" for moving a resolution to remove the vice president, who also serves as chairman of the Upper House from his office, according to sources.While the move may fail to remove him from the chair as the numbers are not stacked in favour of the opposition parties, it would be the first ever attempt to remove the VP, in India’s parliamentary history, and would be seen as a blemish to the chair.The opposition sources confirmed that they had the “required number of signatures” from all the INDIA bloc parties, when the move was first planned in August during the Monsoon session, but they did not move on it, as they decided to give Dhankhar ""another chance but his conduct on Monday"" convinced them to go ahead with the plan.The sources said Congress had taken the lead on the issue and TMC and the Samajwadi Party, besides other INDIA bloc parties, were supportive of the move. “This is not about the Chair, it is about BJP,” a TMC source said, when asked about the joint move.In August, sources said opposition parties were concerned that the microphone of the leader of opposition was allegedly being turned off repeatedly. “The opposition wants the House to be run by rules and conventions, and personal remarks against members are unacceptable,” a source said.The procedure for removal of the chairman has to begin with a resolution moved in the upper House to remove the vice-president, who acts in his dual role as chairman of Rajya Sabha. The resolution must be passed by 50% of the members present, plus one member, of those present in the House on that day. If the resolution gets passed, it has to go to Lok Sabha to be passed by a simple majority for it to get accepted, explained a senior RS MP. This procedure follows from Articles 67 (b), 92 and 100 of the Constitution.The move, on Monday, comes in the backdrop of Rajya Sabha witnessing chaotic scenes as the BJP MPs alleged top Congress leadership has links with George Soros and that the issue be discussed as it is connected to national security.While Dhankhar had rejected all notices under rule 267, several BJP and NDA MPs continued to demand an immediate discussion on it. Congress MPs claimed this was being done to divert attention from the Adani issue.Leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, Congress MPs Jairam Ramesh and Pramod Tiwari asked how the chairman was allowing BJP MPs to raise the issue when he had rejected their notices in this regard. Laxmikant Bajpayee (BJP) was given the floor to raise his Zero Hour mention and he started speaking on national security.Later Ramesh alleged, “the opposition wants the Parliament to function. In the last 2 to 3 days it has become clear that the govt does not want the House to function...What I saw in Rajya Sabha today was unbelievable. The LOP was not allowed and the leader of house was given number of chances to speak,” while speaking to the media.Pointing out that it is for the first time that government — BJP MPs were issuing Rule 267 notices for discussion, which is a weapon in the hands of the opposition to raise issues. “Today’s strategy of the ruling party was clear that both Houses of Parliament should not function. Now we wonder if the govt is running away from the discussion on the Constitution scheduled for December 13 and 14 in Lok Sabha and 16 and 17 in Rajya Sabha,” Ramesh alleged.The Opposition parties planned to raise all the issues that they had planned for to take on the govt, to be brought as part of the discussion for the Constitution.","Jagdeep Dhankhar and Opposition members of the INDIA bloc came to a head on Monday.

Opposition to move no-confidence motion against vice president Dhankhar: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-to-move-no-confidence-motion-against-vice-president-dhankhar-report/articleshow/116141119.cms,"Tensions over BJP’s Soros-Congress link allegations

NEW DELHI: The opposition is considering submitting a notice for a resolution to remove vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar from office after the rift between the Rajya Sabha chairman and the opposition's INDIA bloc intensified on Monday, news agency PTI reported citing sources.According to the report, opposition parties had gathered the required signatures for the notice in August but refrained from acting, hoping to give Dhankhar ""another chance."" However, his conduct in the House on Monday reportedly pushed them to proceed with the move.The Congress spearheaded the move, with support from the TMC, Samajwadi Party, AAP and other INDIA bloc parties.The INDIA bloc's proposed resolution invokes Article 67(b) of the Constitution, which outlines the process for removing the vice president. A resolution requires a majority vote in the Rajya Sabha, with subsequent agreement from the Lok Sabha, and must be preceded by at least 14 days' notice.Meanwhile, both houses of the parliament, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, have been adjourned till Tuesday. The adjournments came after disruptions in the proceedings.Tensions flared during zero hour after leader of the house JP Nadda accused Congress leaders of links with the Forum of Democratic Leaders in the Asia-Pacific (FDL-AP), which he claimed received financial backing from the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and viewed Jammu and Kashmir as a ""separate entity.""Nadda further alleged connections between FDL-AP and billionaire philanthropist George Soros, a claim that sparked sharp reactions from opposition members.As BJP members pressed for a discussion on these allegations, chairman Dhankhar sought an explanation for their protests. Several BJP and NDA MPs argued that the issue was tied to national security and demanded immediate deliberation. The opposition, however, said that this was a diversion tactic.After BJP's Laxmikant Bajpayee was given the floor to raise his Zero Hour mention and started speaking on the issue of national security, Congress leaders challenged Dhankhar’s handling of the situation, questioning how he could allow BJP members to raise an issue he had previously dismissed by rejecting their notices under Rule 267.""This is most unfair,"" said Ramesh. ""You have rejected the notices. Yet, an issue that you disallowed is now being raised. It appears to be part of a larger game plan to stall the House.""Ramesh further accused the BJP of attempting to shift focus from allegations surrounding the Adani Group, a narrative echoed by several Congress members.","The opposition is considering submitting a notice for a resolution to remove vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar from office.

Also give details of action taken by the state in each of these incidents and whether the properties which have been encroached upon or illegally occupied have been restored to the original owners and whether the encroachers have been penalised,"" ordered a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar.The bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati that the court is not going to pass any orders on supplementary applications filed by other persons as ""it is Union and state governments that have to take action, not us"".Mehta told the court that governments are aware of the ground situation and are taking remedial measures. ""We are advisedly not resorting to aggressive action which could be counterproductive to the priority of restoring peace in the state.""

NEW DELHI: The Common University Entrance Test is set for changes in 2025, with the University Grants Commission (UGC) preparing to announce a shift back to computer-based test mode, a standardised 60-minute duration for all papers, requirement for candidates to attempt all questions, and a reduction in foreign language papers.These revisions, aimed at enhancing efficiency and credibility of the test, have been finalised in consultation with National Testing Agency (NTA) - the delivery partner for CUET-UG and CUET-PG.At present, the 105-minute CUET-PG paper comprises 75 questions from various subjects, including 12 foreign languages. CUET-UG papers vary in duration, with domain and language papers lasting 45 minutes and the general test 60 minutes. Conducted in hybrid mode for the first time in 2024, the UG test offered computer-based test (CBT) mode in 48 subjects and pen-and-paper mode in 15. ""These proposed changes will unify the testing process and eliminate the logistical complexities of hybrid exams,"" a UGC official said.CUET was introduced in 2022 to streamline university admissions across India, but its implementation has been fraught with challenges. The inaugural year witnessed logistical failures, including abrupt changes of exam centres, technical glitches, and widespread cancellations, which delayed announcement of results until Sept.Score normalisation across multiple shifts added to dissatisfaction. ""The first CUET exposed glaring gaps in our preparedness to manage a high-stakes national-level exam,"" admitted an official familiar with the process.In 2023, errors in the answer key sparked outrage among students, especially since corrections required a fee of Rs 200 per challenge. Technical issues persisted, and in 2024, the NEET-UG paper leak allegations further delayed CUET results. The first hybrid-mode test faced abrupt cancellations in Delhi due to logistical issues, drawing widespread criticism.""Past incidents necessitated changes and improvement,"" noted a senior official from the education ministry. To address these concerns, the UGC constituted an expert committee to review the test structure, syllabus alignment, and operational logistics. ""The committee's recommendations were thoroughly discussed at a recent UGC meeting,"" said a source in the NTA.The UGC is expected to release a draft proposal inviting feedback from stakeholders, including students, parents, and educators soon. With 283 universities adopting CUET in 2024 and over 13.47 lakh registrations, its importance as a unified admission gateway remains undisputed.","The Common University Entrance Test is set for changes in 2025.

The BCI has also instructed its Secretary to approach the CBI to verify the authenticity of the degree and investigate possible fabrication of related records.The BCI revealed that a sub-committee was constituted earlier this year to investigate the matter following directions from the Delhi high court. The inquiry found several discrepancies in the records provided. Among them was the fact that PMB Gujarati Arts and Law College, Indore, was not authorized to conduct an LLB (Hons) course during the relevant period. Moreover, the LLB (Hons) program itself was introduced under Bar Council regulations only in 2008, raising doubts about the legitimacy of the degree purportedly issued two decades earlier.BCI said that the further scrutiny of the academic records revealed signs of tampering, with uniform handwriting and ink consistency over extended periods.The BCI, citing its authority under the Advocates Act, 1961, resolved to adopt the inquiry report and removed Nasiar from his post pending the outcome of the CBI investigation .This comes months after the Delhi high court in August dismissed a petition challenging the authenticity of Nasiar’s degree. Justice Rajiv Shakdher, while delivering the judgment, relied on a verification report from the concerned university that declared the degree genuine. The court had noted that there was no basis for the claim that the degree was “forged or fabricated.”","The decision comes amidst allegations of irregularities in Nasiar’s LLB (Hons) degree, issued in 1988. The BCI has also instructed its Secretary to approach the CBI to verify the authenticity of the degree and investigate possible fabrication of related records.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116103030,imgsize-683460,width-400,resizemode-4/116103030.jpg"

Who is Sanjay Malhotra, the new RBI governor?

Will new RBI governor alter the monetary policy course?

Sanjay Malhotra, the revenue secretary, has been appointed as new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor by the Narendra Modi government . Malhotra will succeed Shakikanta Das whose tenure is scheduled to end on December 10, 2024. Sanjay Malhotra will be the 26th governor of India's central bank.Malhotra will start his three-year tenure as RBI governor from December 11. He will take over from Shaktikanta Das , who has led the central bank since 2018. In the past Malhotra has served as a representative of the financial services department on the RBI board.Sanjay Malhotra, a 1990 batch Indian Administrative Service Officer from the Rajasthan Cadre, holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from IIT Kanpur and earned his Master's in Public Policy from Princeton University, USA.Throughout his career spanning more than 33 years, Sanjay Malhotra has served across diverse sectors, including power, finance, taxation, information technology, and mines. Currently serving as secretary (revenue) in the ministry of finance, he previously held the position of secretary in the department of financial services under the ministry of finance, Government of India.His extensive expertise encompasses finance and taxation at both state and central government levels. As a revenue secretary, he significantly contributes to formulating tax policies concerning both direct and indirect taxation systems, according to the department of revenue website.According to a Bloomberg report, Malhotra’s strong working relationship with the finance minister is expected to enhance the synchronisation of monetary and fiscal policies. During his ministry tenure, the successful rollout of the new income tax system stands as a notable accomplishment.Although Malhotra has maintained silence on monetary policy matters, he has advocated for investment growth through tax system simplification. In a recent address, he advised revenue officials to focus on economic development and be prudent when issuing substantial tax notices to businesses, particularly given the ongoing tax disagreements with major firms like Infosys Ltd.Also Read | Why did Shaktikanta Das-led MPC not cut repo rate despite GDP shocker? Top 5 points to know Malhotra will take charge during a challenging period for the central bank. The RBI faces mounting pressure to reduce interest rates, particularly as GDP growth declined to 5.4% in the July-September quarter, marking a seven-quarter low.Senior government officials from the Narendra Modi government have increasingly advocated for RBI easing. Both finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and trade minister Piyush Goyal have recently expressed concerns about the economic impact of high borrowing costs.In his final policy decision on Friday, Shaktikanta Das maintained the benchmark rate whilst implementing measures to enhance banking system liquidity, potentially supporting the decelerating economy.Das indicated that food price fluctuations, comprising approximately half of the inflation basket, would likely keep price increases elevated during October to December.CPI inflation continues to exceed the RBI's target, reaching a 14-month peak of 6.21% in October. The central bank operates under a government-mandated inflation target of 4%, with a tolerance band of plus or minus two percentage points.Analysts suggest this surprise appointment will not significantly change India's monetary policy direction.According to a Bloomberg survey, most economists anticipate the central bank will begin reducing rates in early next year.""If growth continues to underwhelm, then obviously chances of interest rate cut increases, but a February rate cut still depends on data,"" said Gaurav Kapur, an economist with IndusInd Bank Ltd.""The RBI has a history of bureaucrats becoming the governor,"" said Anubhuti Sahay, an economist with Standard Chartered Bank Plc. ""Irrespective of the governor in place, we believe India is on the round of turning point where rate cuts will have to begin.""","Sanjay Malhotra will start his three-year tenure as RBI governor from December 11. He will take over from Shaktikanta Das, who has led the central bank since 2018. He is currently serving as secretary (revenue) in the ministry of finance.

. With this new deal, Juan Soto has become the highest-paid athlete in history, as the amount has broken all records set so far. Although $765 million is a massive amount of money, how does it compare to in terms of the highest-paid NBA players, such as Jayson Tatum , Stephen Curry, and Jaylen Brown?With a slight stretch, one can say that Juan Soto landed an $800 million deal and what is more impressive is his contract even surpasses the amount 22 MLB franchise owners paid for their teams. Besides securing his financial future, is a long-term contract better than the more usual and shorter contracts that basketball players are accustomed to?Juan Soto’s contract with the Mets isn’t just big — it’s historic. The Dominican star dunked over all previous records with his 15-year, $765 million deal, which could increase to over $800 million if escalator clauses are met. As reported by ESPN’s Jess Passan, ""Juan Soto’s 15-year, $765 million deal with the New York Mets includes no deferred money, according to sources, and has escalators that can reach above $800 million.""The sheer size of the deal becomes even more astonishing when compared to MLB franchise values. A viral statement highlighted that ""Juan Soto’s new $765 million contract is worth more than what 22 MLB principal owners paid for their franchises."" This not only reflects Soto's immense value as a player but also underscores how far the sports salary landscape has evolved.Also read: Who is Juan Soto and why is he trending? Since NBA contracts are usually shorter than Soto's long 15-year agreement, athletes can keep their flexibility and optimize their future profits. Stephen Curry, Jayson Tatum, and Jaylen Brown, among other NBA top earners in 2024, have chosen shorter contracts with higher yearly compensation.With his latest one-year, $63 million contract agreement with the Golden State Warriors, four-time NBA champion Stephen Curry will make $178 million over the following three years. With yearly salaries of $55.8 million, $59.6 million, and $63 million included in this agreement, he is now among the highest-paid athletes in the league. Jaylen Brown made news when he signed a $304 million, five-year contract that paid him $60.8 million on average annually. However, Jayson Tatum, a colleague of the Boston Celtics, outdid him by securing a five-year, $315 million supermax agreement that ensures him the highest NBA salary of $63 million per year.On the other hand, Juan Soto's average yearly compensation of $51 million is insignificant. Even while his contract is rather large, he makes a lot less money annually than Curry, Tatum, or Brown—all of whom have greater negotiating leverage in future contracts.","Juan Soto lands massive $750 million deal with the mets.

I had a family of four who meticulously prepared their application, attaching all relevant documents like confirmed hotel bookings and flight details. Despite this, their visa application was rejected.""In another case, a large group of 35 individuals found their meticulously planned Dubai trip completely derailed when one family member's visa application was rejected, resulting in financial losses. Travellers are losing money not just on visa fees, but also pre-booked flight tickets and hotel reservations. ""In just one week, I have seen nearly eight rejections,"" Pujari said.The new regulations require extensive documentation like hotel bookings and return tickets. For those staying with relatives, additional proof of accommodation is needed by the latter. All these requirements have caught many travellers off guard.Vijay Thakkar, director of Hasmukh Travels, told TOI: ""Two of our passengers recently had their Dubai visa applications rejected. They were planning to stay with relatives in Dubai. While applying for the visa, we had attached all the relevant documents as per the new visa requirements. Yet, their applications were rejected. This resulted in significant monetary loss for the passengers, as they had spent nearly Rs 14,000 on visa fees, and ticket cancellation cost was another Rs 20,000 and more.""Nikhil Kumar, director of Passio Travels Pvt Ltd, said, ""Earlier, the rejection rate for Dubai visas was just 1-2%. This is before the new rules were enforced. We are now getting at least 5-6 visa rejections per day from nearly 100 applications daily. Even when confirmed flight tickets and hotel stay details are attached, the visa applications are being rejected.""He said, ""In cases where travellers are staying with relatives in Dubai and we attach mandatory documents like the host's rental agreement, Emirates ID, residence visa copy and contact details, visas are getting rejected. In all of these cases, the clients have already paid for confirmed flight tickets and hotel bookings.""In another instance, Kumar said, ""A husband and wife applied for Dubai visas, but the wife's visa was rejected while the husband's was approved, despite having identical documents for hotel and flight tickets. Their tickets were non-refundable.""A Pune traveller who had planned to visit his relatives in Dubai with his brother told TOI: ""The visa fees were non-refundable, and our flight tickets were non-refundable too. We spent around Rs 50,000 on a two-way flight, and now that money is gone to waste. We had attached all the relevant documents as per the new requirements while applying for the visa, yet our plan stands cancelled as our visas were rejected.""Nilesh Bhansali, president of Travel Agents Association of Pune, said, ""After stricter requirements for Dubai tourist visa applications were introduced, many people are attempting to attach dummy flight tickets or fabricated documents. This is never recommended. Dubai is extremely strict, and a rejection can potentially create lifelong travel complications to the destination. My advise to travellers is to avoid any dummy tickets or hotel bookings.""","The new regulations require extensive documentation like hotel bookings and return tickets. For those staying with relatives, additional proof of accommodation is needed by the latter. Travellers are losing money not just on visa fees, but also pre-booked flight tickets and hotel reservations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116094957,imgsize-134640,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/116094957.jpg"
"Jeff Bezos is back at Amazon just 3 years after his retirement,"" my fears are there and....""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jeff-bezos-is-back-at-amazon-just-3-years-after-his-retirement-my-fears-are-there-and-/articleshow/116026924.cms,"Why Jeff Bezos is back at the company

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is taking a hands-on approach to the company's future, devoting 95% of his time to artificial intelligence initiatives . Although he stepped down as CEO three years ago, Bezos highlighted his enduring commitment to Amazon’s growth and innovation during the DealBook Summit on Wednesday. This intensified focus on AI reflects his dedication to advancing one of the most transformative technologies of our time and underscores his continued influence on Amazon’s strategic vision.""My heart is in Amazon, my curiosity is in Amazon, and my fears are there and my love is there,"" Bezos said, emphasizing his ongoing involvement. The world's second-richest man is particularly focused on helping Amazon become a leader in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, with the company currently developing 1,000 internal AI applications.A key strategic move involves building a powerful supercomputer in collaboration with Anthropic, the AI startup in which Amazon has invested $8 billion. This initiative aims to provide Amazon with significant computing capabilities to compete against other tech giants, like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, in the AI race. The company is reportedly developing a multimodal AI model capable of processing images, video, and text.While Bezos stepped down as CEO in 2021 to concentrate on Blue Origin, his rocket company, he remains Amazon's executive chairman. He continues to support current CEO Andy Jassy and the leadership team, mirroring a trend seen with other tech founders like Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who returned to assist with AI initiatives.Bezos is optimistic about the company's future, drawing parallels to other tech leaders reinvesting in their original companies during the AI revolution. His deep engagement suggests Amazon is positioning itself as a serious contender in the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence market.""I'll always be there to help, and right now, I'm putting a lot of time into it,"" Bezos said, adding, ""It's super interesting, so why not?""Last month, Bezos's net worth reached a record high of $228 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This surge was attributed to an increase in Amazon's stock price, which hit a record $207.09 per share after the recent US election results. Bezos, who owns almost 9% of Amazon, saw his wealth increase by $7 billion.","Jeff Bezos is devoting 95% of his time to artificial intelligence initiatives.
