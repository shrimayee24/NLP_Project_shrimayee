What's the case about?

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday summoned industrialist Anil Ambani on August 5 in loan fraud case amid probe over bribery, unsecured loans allegations.Ambani, 66, has been asked to depose at the ED headquarters in Delhi as the case has been registered here, sources told news agency PTI.The agency will record his statement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) once he deposes, they said.Meanwhile, the agency is conducting search in Bhubaneshwar and Kolkata in connections with fake bank guarantee racket.""The agency recorded an ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report) based on a case registered by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police dated November 11, 2024 in the matter,"" officials said.This comes days after the central probing agency conducted simultaneous raids in connection of financial irregularities and collective loan ""diversion"" of more than Rs 10,000 crore by multiple group companies of Ambani.ED sources had said the investigation primarily pertains to allegations of illegal loan diversion of around Rs 3,000 crore, given by the Yes Bank to the group companies of Ambani between 2017-2019.Officials said that searches were done at over 35 locations in Mumbai, covering 50 companies and 25 individuals under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).A Delhi-based ED unit is spearheading the investigation.The agency is probing alleged improper diversion of approximately Rs 3,000 crore in loans, granted by Yes Bank to Ambani's group companies between 2017 and 2019. In reaction to the raids, Reliance Power and Reliance Infrastructure issued clarification letters to the exchanges.According to officials, multiple agencies, including the National Housing Bank, SEBI, National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), and Bank of Baroda, have shared relevant information with the ED.Officials told that “ED has found gross violations in Yes Bank loan approvals to RAAGA companies,” including backdated Credit Approval Memorandums, lack of due diligence, and breaches of the bank’s credit policies. The loans were allegedly diverted to multiple group and shell companies.Red flags identified include loans to entities with weak financials, shared addresses and directors, poor documentation, and evergreening of loans. Officials also noted, “SEBI is also learnt to have shared its findings with ED in the case of RHFL.”The searches at premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off, including outside the country, through ""undisclosed foreign bank accounts and foreign assets"" created over the years.A large chunk of the money came to Reliance ADAG from SBI and other public sector banks, besides Yes Bank, then a private entity, and mutual funds.Preliminary investigation has thrown up a mysterious entity: 'C Company'. The entity, whose existence was not known so far, is allegedly found to have been involved in related party transactions in this whole scam, sources said.","Ambani, 66, has been asked to depose at the ED headquarters in Delhi as the case has been registered here.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Friday as India braces for 25% tariff rate on its exports to the US. While Nifty50 went below 24,750, BSE Sensex was down over 100 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,727.45, down 41 points or 0.17%. BSE Sensex was at 81,047.39, down 138 points or 0.17%.Market analysts indicate that Nifty's underlying short-term trend remains positive despite high volatility. Analysts suggest maintaining caution and adopting a hedged strategy due to expected market fluctuations. US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order announcing tariffs on 69 countries (including EU) which will be effective August 7, 2025. India is also a part of the list. Trump's earlier deadline for reciprocal tariffs was August 1.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The August series starts on a weak note after the 3.1% dip in Nifty in July. In the near-term the market will be influenced by the tariff-related news. Since the date of implementation of the modified tariff rates is August 7th, that gives countries time to negotiate and bring the tariffs down.That may happen. Yesterday’s market action indicates that the market views the 25% tariff as a short-term issue. The rate is likely to come down after the next round of negotiations beginning this month.“An important trend in the market is the weakness in the broader market, particularly the smallcaps. This trend is likely to continue given the high valuations of the segment. Sustained selling by the FIIs continues to be a negative. The sharp surge in the dollar index to 100 will nudge the FIIs to continue selling putting pressure on largecaps too. Investors can adopt a wait and watch strategy.""US equities declined on Thursday as initial gains diminished following corporate earnings reports and economic data releases, with investors awaiting post-market results from Amazon and Apple.Asian equities dropped for six consecutive sessions, marking the longest downward trend in 2025, following President Donald Trump's tariff announcement, despite strong performance from large technology companies failing to boost overall market confidence.Oil oprices remained stable on Friday, following a decline exceeding 1% in the previous trading session, as market participants evaluated the consequences of increased US tariffs potentially affecting economic activities and global fuel consumption growth.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 5,588 crore net on Thursday.

UPI New Rules: New NPCI rules kick in from August 1 - All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/upi-system-changes-new-npci-rules-kick-in-from-august-1-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/123025161.cms,"Representative image

Cap on balance enquiries to prevent system overload

Limit on bank account access via “list account” API





Restrictions on UPI autopay transactions during peak hours

Industry reaction welcomes move towards efficiency

Deadline set for compliance; penalties for violations

Starting August 1, 2025, UPI will see changes as the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the UPI ecosystem.The changes are aimed at improving system efficiency, preventing outages, and ensuring better user consent mechanisms.Payment Service Providers (PSPs), UPI apps, and banks must implement the changes by July 31, as per NPCI’s compliance notice dated May 21.A major change includes a cap on balance enquiry requests, now limited to 50 per app per customer in a rolling 24-hour period, as per ET.These requests must be user-initiated only, with no automatic prompts by apps or systems. UPI apps must also introduce the ability to reduce or halt such requests during peak load hours to minimise system strain.The guidelines also require issuer banks to include the available account balance in every successful UPI transaction message, streamlining user experience and reducing the need for separate balance checks.NPCI has also put in place access limits on the “list account” API, which lets users view bank accounts linked to their mobile number. This API will now be restricted to 25 requests per customer per app per day, and only after the user selects their bank in the app.Any retries must be made with explicit customer consent, ensuring transparency and avoiding unnecessary API calls.To further address system congestion, NPCI has restricted UPI Autopay executions to non-peak hours only. Peak hours are defined as 10:00 to 13:00 and 17:00 to 21:30.Each autopay mandate will be allowed one initial attempt and a maximum of three retries, clearly capped at four total executions per mandate sequence.Welcoming the new rules, Tarun Nazare, co-founder and managing director of Neokred was quoted as saying by ET that “These measures are prudent and forward-thinking, as they prioritise system efficiency and user security. By capping balance requests and optimising API usage—especially with clear restrictions during peak hours—the guidelines will effectively reduce server overloads and potential service outages. ”He also highlighted the value of “emphasis on customer consent and timely compliance” in enhancing system accountability.The NPCI has clearly warned that failure to comply with these directives by July 31, 2025, may result in UPI API restrictions, penalties, suspension of new customer onboarding, or any other appropriate action.NPCI has advised all member banks and UPI ecosystem participants to communicate these changes across their systems and partners ahead of the compliance deadline.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the UPI ecosystem.

Another indigenous warship joins Navy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-indigenous-warship-joins-navy/articleshow/123029921.cms,"NEW DELHI: Another indigenous multi-role stealth frigate, Himgiri, was delivered to the Navy Thursday that will boost country's blue-water combat capabilities. This is the second such stealth warship to be handed over to the force this month.The 6,670-tonne Himgiri has been built by the Kolkata-based Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), while her predecessor Udaygiri was handed over by the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) on July 1. Both the warships are slated to be commissioned together towards end-August.The 149-metre long Himgiri is the third of the seven frigates being constructed under Project-17A, four at MDL in Mumbai and three at GRSE in Kolkata, at an overall cost of Rs 45,000 crore. The first was commissioned as INS Nilgiri in Jan, while the remaining four are to be progressively delivered by end-2026.All these multi-mission frigates are packed with advanced sensors and weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic precision-strike cruise missiles whose range has been extended to 450-km from the original 290-km, and ""designed to address current and future challenges in the maritime domain"", an officer said.For air defence, the frigates are equipped with Israeli-origin Barak-8 surface-to-air missile system, with an interception range of 70km against fighters, helicopters, drones and cruise missiles, among other weapons.""These frigates reflect a quantum leap in naval design, stealth, firepower, automation and survivability, and are an admirable symbol of aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) in warship building,"" the officer said.Overall, the 140-warship Navy has 58 ships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards for over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, while another 31 warships are in the planning stage.

The party also questioned that if "" demonetisation and a flawed GST"" killed the economy, then how come India became the world's fastest-growing major economy, with nominal GDP tripling from 2014-15 to 2024-25.BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya on X said that Rahul has ""hit a new low by echoing the 'dead economy' jibe - a shameful insult to the aspirations, achievements, and well-being of the Indian people.""""But let's be honest -- the only thing truly 'dead' here is Rahul Gandhi's own political credibility and legacy,"" he added.The BJP leaders reacted after the leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi said that everyone except Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman knows that the Indian economy is ""dead"".BJP MP Anurag Thakur said making anti-India statements has become Rahul's ""mentality"".""Whenever anyone makes an anti-India statement in the world, he grabs it,"" he said.","BJP says Rahul Gandhi is ""delusional, ignorant of facts and deeply frustrated"" The party also took a swipe at Rahul, citing his affidavit from the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.

A copy of the detailed order is awaited.Earlier this month, a different bench had dismissed petitions by Turkish firms Celebi Airport Services India Pvt Ltd and Celebi Delhi Cargo Terminal Management India Pvt Ltd challenging the revocation of their security clearance by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Safety (BCAS), saying there were ""compelling national security considerations"" involved.In May, BCAS had revoked the security clearance after Turkiye backed Pakistan and condemned India's strikes on terror camps in the neighbouring country. The court on July 7 underlined the necessity to eliminate the possibility of espionage or dual use of logistics capabilities, which would be highly detrimental to the security of the country, especially in the event of an external conflict.In its detailed ruling on the earlier petitions, the high court had upheld the govt's reasoning and decision.","Delhi high court dismisses plea by Turkish-owned company Celebi Ground Handling India Pvt Ltd against government's decision to revoke its security clearance.

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic yet decisive reversal, Supreme Court Thursday annulled its May 2 judgment ordering liquidation of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, which had been revived in 2021 by the Sajjan Jindal-led JSW through a Rs 20,000 crore plan concurrently upheld by NCLT and NCLAT under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code process.Unabashedly admitting that its earlier decision militated against the settled law on inviolability of the decision of Committee of Creditors, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice Satish Chandra Sharma recalled the verdict and posted the matter for fresh hearing next Thursday.The bench also frowned upon the use of Article 142 by the earlier bench led by Justice Bela M Trivedi, who has since retired, to order liquidation of the revived company despite it being in the pink of health.""Powers of Article 142 are meant to do complete justice and not cause injustice to 25,000 employees,"" the apex court said Thursday.In an open court hearing on the review petitions filed by Punjab National Bank, the lead creditor for bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, and JSW, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul told a bench of CJI BR Gavai and Justice Satish Chandra Sharma that IBC proceedings aim to revive sick companies and liquidation is only the last resort.The CJI said he has, as an SC judge, authored many judgments crystallising disparate rulings on IBC proceedings to lay down the cardinal principle that concurrent approval by NCLT and NCLAT of a revival plan accepted by the CoC cannot be interfered with by SC unless the petitioner challlenging it establishes a perversity. The verdict in the Bhushan Steel and Power Ltd case appears to be in the teeth of SC rulings.Mehta said IBC proceedings were followed to the T and it was the decision of the CoC to approve the revival plan of successful resolution professional, which was concurrently upheld by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the appellate tribunal (NCLAT) leaving little scope for SC interference.""Liquidating a viable and profit-making entity will be in the interest of none and would create many difficulties for the creditors as well as the successful resolution applicant,"" he argued.Kaul said JSW has infused an additional Rs 8,000 crore apart from the Rs 20,000 crore, and the company is now in robust health nearly tripling its productions. It now employs 25,000 people in the revived plant.On May 26, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Sharma had stayed the liquidation process and ordered status quo after learning that petitions seeking review of the May 2 judgment are pending consideration.","Supreme Court annulls its May 2 judgment ordering liquidation of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd.

Hockey Canada sexual assault trial acquittals ignite fury as toxic locker room culture and sexist branding persist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/hockey-canada-sexual-assault-trial-acquittals-ignite-fury-as-toxic-locker-room-culture-and-sexist-branding-persist/articleshow/123019374.cms,"Hockey Canada sexual assault trial acquittals ignite fury (Getty Images)

How hockey apparel brands are sending dangerous messages to youth

From courtroom to culture war: why advocates say the real battle for reform has just begun

FAQs

1. Why are the Hockey Canada acquittals controversial?

2. What is the issue with the HockeyBenders clothing brand?

The Hockey Canada sexual assault trial has concluded, with the five accused players acquitted, yet the profound discussions about the sport's deep-seated culture persist. Despite the legal outcome, advocates stress the critical need to confront and alter ingrained attitudes toward women and sexuality, reaching far beyond the confines of the locker room.HockeyBenders, a popular Canadian apparel brand, unveils a troubling trend. They market T-shirts for ""$35"" and ""children’s sizes"" hoodies with the slogan ""Barduzz, Gettin Huzz,"" ""Loosely translated"" as: ""Scoring goals, getting hoes."" Their videos query teens on ""how many blondes"" and ""how many puck bunnies"" they know, with one labeled ""lover boy,"" another a ""quality over quantity guy.”While founder Cole Lequier, 25, asserts he ""felt like, growing up, there wasn’t many hockey clothing brands that had relatable slogans and sayings for hockey players,"" and ""So I saw a huge, huge gap in the market,"" critics like Andrea DeKeseredy, a sexual assault counselor, strongly contradict.She views these products as a stern refusal of hockey culture to evolve, phrasing, ""It shows the lack of true critical self-reflection and introspection that is occurring in Canadian hockey,"" and profoundly, ""It makes me sad. It’s the opposite of what should be happening.""The judge, Justice Maria Carroccia, interpreted that ""It is not the function of this court to make determinations about the morality or propriety of the conduct of any of the persons involved in these events.The sole function of this court is to determine whether the Crown has proven each of the charges against each of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.""However, the trial heard how one player invited others to his room for a ""3 way,"" and texted a teammate to come for a ""gummer."" The complainant, E.M., described players discussing putting golf balls and clubs into her, though she initially told police this was said ""in a joking manner.""The National Hockey League dubiously condemned the conduct, affirming, ""The allegations made in this case, even if not determined to have been criminal, were very disturbing and the behaviour at issue was unacceptable.""HockeyBenders, yet, defends its content, with an email from ""The Hockeybenders Team"" stating, ""The boys are two hardworking young hockey entrepreneurs and make videos for people to enjoy and laugh that’s it. And like to keep everything they do positive. They like to stay in their own lane with their fans and followers!""Katherine Henderson, Hockey Canada's new CEO, finds such language on children's clothing ""disgusting,"" acknowledging the sport must confront these problematic attitudes.The Hockey Canada trial, despite its verdicts, spotlights persistent cultural issues. Brands like HockeyBenders illustrate ongoing misanthrope attitudes. While the NHL and Hockey Canada aim for change, truly transforming the sport to foster respect and accountability remains a significant, demanding journey, requiring continuous introspection.Also Read: Hockey Canada sexual assault verdict clears players but ignites outrage over justice system and survivor treatment Because many believe the verdict overlooked a deeper culture of misogyny and entitlement in Canadian hockey.It’s facing backlash for promoting sexist slogans that critics say glorify toxic locker room behavior.","HockeyBenders, a popular Canadian apparel brand, unveils a troubling trend.

Is UAE giving Golden Visa to farmers? Two Thai women the first receiepients for growing dates abroad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-golden-visa-for-farmers-how-two-thai-women-became-the-first-receiepients-for-growing-dates-abroad/articleshow/122988964.cms,"The two Thai women, who run a farm with over 5,000 date palms, participated in the Dubai Dates Festival to showcase their produce and promote cultural exchange/ Image: Khaleej Times, TikTok

How Two Thai Farmers Became Golden Visa Recipients



What Makes Their Story Stand Out



Where It Happened: The Dubai Dates Festival



The festival includes:

13 competition categories, including rare varieties like Dubai Hilwa and awards for Homegrown Palm and Largest Cluster

A weeklong date palm auction, held in partnership with Emirates Auction

Traditional tools and exhibits, showcasing historical farming methods like digging, pollination, and harvesting

A display of archival photographs tracing the stages of date farming

Food stalls offering sweets and other traditional products made from dates





The UAE’s Golden Visa is one of the most sought-after residencies in the region, usually granted to investors, scientists, entrepreneurs, and other high-profile professionals. But this year, for the first time, two Thai women running a date farm were awarded the visa, raising questions, and curiosity, about how farming and culture can open unexpected doors.The two women, owners of Orawan Farm in Thailand, manage a large-scale date plantation with more than 5,000 fruit-bearing palm trees. They’re not just farmers; they’re also entrepreneurs who’ve turned their farm into a business, producing and marketing dates within Thailand and beyond.Their recognition didn’t come through the usual channels, they didn’t apply, invest, or go through a formal process. Instead, they were nominated directly by Dubai’s General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA), the authority that oversees Golden Visa approvals. The nomination was made during their visit to Dubai, where they were invited participants in the ongoing Dubai Dates Festival.There, they met personally with Lt Gen Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of GDRFA, who acknowledged their work in a face-to-face meeting.According to Khaleej Times, their nomination was based on their role in “promoting date cultivation beyond the UAE and spreading Emirati heritage and values globally,” helping raise global awareness of the fruit, which holds deep cultural and historical meaning in Emirati life.On paper, the UAE’s Golden Visa program does not list farmers or agricultural workers as eligible categories. It’s primarily designed for individuals who contribute to the country’s growth through investment, entrepreneurship, real estate, science, culture, education, and humanitarian work. The visa typically goes to business owners, researchers, skilled professionals, or those with significant capital. But this case is different, and that’s exactly why it matters.The Thai women aren’t just growing dates. They’ve also been using social media platforms like TikTok to creatively promote the health benefits and cultural relevance of dates, reaching audiences who might not otherwise engage with the topic. They’ve essentially become informal ambassadors of the fruit, and by extension, of a tradition that’s central to the UAE’s heritage.Their selection marks the first time the Golden Visa has been awarded to foreigners cultivating dates outside the Emirates, a significant recognition that comes with real advantages. The visa grants 10 years of renewable residency, allows recipients to live and work without employer sponsorship, and includes the ability to sponsor family members and hire domestic staff. For many, it’s a gateway to long-term security and flexibility in the UAE.Another factor that sets them apart is their proactive involvement. They travelled from Thailand to take part in a UAE-based cultural and agricultural event, a move that reflects genuine interest and initiative. Participating in a niche festival like this, rather than promoting their work from afar, likely played a role in getting their efforts noticed by local authorities.The award took place during the Dubai Dates Festival, which runs from July 25 to August 1 at Qalaat Al Remaal (Al Remah Fort), along the Dubai–Al Ain Road. The event, now in its second edition, is organized by the Hamdan Bin Mohammed Heritage Center and focuses on both the agricultural and cultural importance of date palms.Open daily from 10am to 10pm, the event blends education, commerce, and cultural storytelling, and it’s clear that the Thai women’s participation wasn’t just a side event. It was central to why they were recognized.","The UAE’s Golden Visa is one of the most sought-after residencies in the region. For the first time, two Thai women running a date farm were awarded the visa. The two women, owners of Orawan Farm in Thailand, manage a large-scale date plantation with more than 5,000 fruit-bearing palm trees. They’ve also been using social media platforms like TikTok to creatively promote the health benefits of dates.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122994096,imgsize-1311412,width-400,resizemode-4/122994096.jpg"

'National interests first': Where does India stand amid this tariff flurry

US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a sweeping executive order imposing higher tariffs on several nations and the 27-member European Union, significantly escalating his administration’s global trade offensive. The order, titled ""Further Modifying The Reciprocal Tariff Rates"", is set to take effect from August 7, seven days after its issuance, with rates going up to 41%.India has been slapped with a 25 per cent ""Reciprocal Tariff, Adjusted"", one of the higher rates among key US trading partners. The White House justified the move by citing India’s “obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers,” persistent trade imbalances, and strong energy and defense ties with Russia.While the initial tariff deadline was August 1, the implementation was deferred to August 7 to allow US Customs and Border Protection time to update its systems.The extension reflects the govt’s need for more time to harmonise the tariff rates, according to a senior official who spoke to Associated Press reporters on condition of anonymity.The tariff hike is part of Trump’s effort to rebalance what he terms unfair trade deficits and national security risks.Countries with large trade surpluses with the US or insufficient strategic alignment have been hit with the steepest increases.The steepest hikes include 41 per cent on Syria, 40 per cent on Laos and Myanmar, 39 per cent on Switzerland, 35 per cent on Iraq, Serbia and Canada.In South Asia, India faces a 25 per cent tariff, while Pakistan has been hit with 19 per cent, according to the new Executive order.The US has announced adjusted reciprocal tariffs on 95 countries and territories, ranging from 10 per cent to 41 per cent, based on trade deficits and strategic alignment.Also read: ‘Major success’ or ‘factless turbulence’? Here's how nations reacted to Trump's new tariffs The US has announced adjusted reciprocal tariffs on several countries and territories, ranging from 10 per cent to 41 per cent, based on trade deficits and strategic alignment. Here's what country faces what rate:The US has openly linked its new tariff measures on India to frustrations over New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil and arms. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said India’s energy trade with Russia is “most certainly a point of irritation” in ties, as it helps sustain Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine. While acknowledging India as a strategic partner with major energy needs, Rubio added that Washington is “clearly frustrated” that India continues to buy large volumes of discounted Russian oil despite the availability of other global vendors.Also read: Donald Trump administration fires fresh salvo after 25% tariff; says Russia oil ‘most certainly a point of irritation’ Trump’s imposition of a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods and an additional penalty for Russian dealings is seen as a sharp expression of that dissatisfaction. Trump also accused India of maintaining “obnoxious” non-monetary trade barriers and failing to open up its market to American goods.The government, meanwhile, has reiterated that it will act in its national interest. The Ministry of Commerce said it is assessing the impact of the new tariffs and penalties, while also emphasising that discussions with the US for a fair and reciprocal trade agreement are ongoing. Five rounds of negotiations have taken place, with a sixth round expected later this month. India has maintained a firm stance on key issues such as agriculture and dairy, where it has resisted US demands for greater market access.Also read: No F-35 jets from US for India?

The world’s wealthiest individuals dominate industries ranging from technology and e-commerce to luxury goods and investment. These top 10 richest billionaires not only hold staggering personal fortunes but also shape the global economy with their innovative ideas and strategic ventures. According to Forbes, nine out of these ten billionaires are American, showcasing the dominance of the US in wealth creation, while Bernard Arnault represents Europe’s luxury empire. From Elon Musk’s space ambitions to Jeff Bezos’s e-commerce revolution and Warren Buffett’s legendary investing style, their wealth-building stories are remarkable examples of vision and execution. Check the list of world’s top 10 billionaires.Elon Musk stands as the world’s richest individual, owing his fortune to groundbreaking ventures in electric vehicles, space exploration, and artificial intelligence. He holds about 12% of Tesla, the electric car pioneer valued at hundreds of billions, and owns a 42% stake in SpaceX, a leader in commercial space technology. Musk’s 2022 purchase of Twitter (renamed X) for $44 billion further solidified his influence in social media and AI-driven communication.Known for his ambitious projects, such as Neuralink and The Boring Company, Musk’s vision revolves around sustainable energy, interplanetary travel, and integrating AI into human life.Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle Corporation, built one of the most successful software companies in the world, specializing in databases and enterprise solutions. He owns 40% of Oracle’s shares, which drive most of his wealth. In addition to technology, Ellison is known for his real estate ventures, most notably his purchase of 98% of Lanai Island in Hawaii for $300 million. A board member at Tesla until 2022, Ellison continues to influence the tech industry with his investments and strategic vision. His lifestyle and property holdings place him among the wealthiest tech moguls globally.Jeff Bezos revolutionized retail through Amazon, transforming it from a humble online bookstore into a global e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse. Even after stepping down as CEO in 2021, Bezos retains significant wealth with a 9% stake in Amazon and ownership of Blue Origin, a space exploration company. Recently, he married Lauren Sánchez, marking a new personal chapter. Bezos also focuses on philanthropy, investing in climate change initiatives and education. His success story is a prime example of how innovation and risk-taking can create unprecedented wealth.Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook in 2004, a social media platform that became an integral part of global communication. Now rebranded as Meta Platforms, Zuckerberg’s company is heavily investing in AI and the metaverse—a virtual reality-based internet experience. He owns about 13% of Meta, which drives most of his fortune. Despite facing privacy controversies and regulatory scrutiny, Zuckerberg remains one of the most powerful tech leaders, continuously shaping how billions connect and interact online.Larry Page co-founded Google in 1998 alongside Sergey Brin, creating the most widely used search engine in the world.

His leadership and strategic direction have positioned Nvidia as one of the most valuable tech companies, crucial to the growth of AI and cloud computing industries.Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton), oversees more than 70 luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora. He is the only non-American on this list, representing the luxury fashion and goods sector. Arnault’s five children also play active roles in the family business, ensuring continuity in leadership. His fortune showcases how luxury goods and global branding can rival tech industry wealth.Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, transformed the company during his tenure (2000–2014), significantly expanding its software and enterprise services portfolio. After retiring, Ballmer purchased the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion, diversifying his investments. Much of his wealth comes from Microsoft stock holdings, which continue to grow as the company remains a leader in cloud computing and software.Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is known globally as the “Oracle of Omaha” for his unmatched value investing strategies. Berkshire Hathaway owns diverse businesses like Geico, Duracell, and Dairy Queen, making it a financial powerhouse. Buffett is also a leading philanthropist, pledging most of his fortune to charitable causes through the Giving Pledge initiative. Despite his immense wealth, Buffett is known for his modest lifestyle and long-term focus on ethical, disciplined investing.","The world’s wealthiest individuals dominate industries ranging from technology and e-commerce to luxury goods and investment.

Thinking Machines Lab: a startup with billion-dollar belief

Why Murati’s team said no to Meta

A name to watch in AI’s future





Mira Murati, the Albanian-American tech visionary behind some of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, is once again in the spotlight—this time for turning down an eye-watering $1 billion offer from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . As the former CTO of OpenAI and now the founder of the AI startup Thinking Machines Lab, Murati has become one of the most influential figures in the global AI race. Her team's unanimous rejection of Meta’s massive offer speaks volumes about their confidence in her leadership and their belief in the startup’s long-term vision.Before launching Thinking Machines Lab, Mira Murati served as the chief technology officer at OpenAI, one of the most influential positions in the modern AI world. During her tenure, she played a pivotal role in leading the development of groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Codex—systems that have since transformed the way people interact with artificial intelligence. Her work helped bring generative AI into the mainstream, sparking a global wave of innovation across industries from education and healthcare to design and coding.Murati wasn’t just a technical leader—she was a strategic visionary. At OpenAI, she emphasized the importance of safety, alignment, and responsible development, pushing the organization to think deeply about the societal impact of powerful AI systems.Internally, she earned the reputation of being the “AI brain” behind OpenAI’s most ambitious projects, praised for her calm, focused demeanor and her ability to guide multidisciplinary teams through intense periods of innovation. Her combination of engineering precision and human-centered thinking set the stage for her next bold move: founding her own AI company.In early 2025, she delivered a keynote at the World Economic Forum in Davos, warning that “AI without values is intelligence without conscience,” sparking international dialogue on AI ethics and sovereignty. She’s also been advising the European Commission on emerging AI regulatory frameworks, a rare role for a startup founder.Founded in early 2025, Thinking Machines Lab has rapidly emerged as one of the most-watched AI startups. Despite not launching a single product yet, the company recently raised a stunning $2 billion seed round at a valuation nearing $12 billion, led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup’s goal: to create customizable, interpretable, and widely accessible AI systems that could redefine the AI landscape. Industry insiders say the company’s stealth mode only adds to its mystique. With Murati at the helm, expectations are sky-high for what comes next.According to a Wired report, Zuckerberg's Meta offered some of Murati’s team members compensation packages ranging from $200 million to $1 billion to join its newly launched Superintelligence Lab. But every single offer was turned down. Sources say the Thinking Machines Lab team believes their equity in the startup has the potential to be worth far more—and more importantly, they value their independence and Murati’s vision over big-tech paychecks.In a tech industry where massive paydays often drive decisions, the loyalty displayed by Murati’s team stands out. The rejection of Meta’s lucrative offers highlights their belief in the startup’s mission and long-term potential. Many observers also note that the chance to help shape AI’s future from the ground up, without the constraints of a corporate giant, is a rare and meaningful opportunity—one Murati has worked hard to create.Mira Murati’s leadership has already been recognized worldwide—she was featured in Time’s 100 Most Influential People in AI (2024) and Fortune’s 100 Most Powerful Women in Business (2023). With Thinking Machines Lab gaining momentum and Meta's billion-dollar offers rebuffed, Murati has solidified her place not just as a builder of AI—but as a shaper of its future.",Mira Murati is the founder of the AI startup Thinking Machines Lab.

Hulk Hogan's CAUSE OF DEATH: Medical Examiner Reveals Shocking Details

Medical examiner confirms heart attack and undisclosed health battles

Family statements and public reactions

Legacy of the WWE Hall of Famer

Almost a week after the legendary wrestling great Hulk Hogan 's untimely demise, medical authorities have confirmed that Hulk Hogan, 71 years old, succumbed to an acute myocardial infarction, or more popularly known as a heart attack, on 24 July 2025 at his home in Clearwater, Florida.As many fans know, Hogan is considered to be one of the most important sports entertainment talents of all time, and when he died, the wrestling world and fans all over the world were shaken. Hogan was well known as an exciting character with a unique mustache, an even greater personality, and primary woman-like energy in the ring, helping to mold contemporary professional wrestling history and the diversification of the WWE worldwide in the 1980s and '90s.Hulk Hogan went into cardiac arrest around 9:51 a.m., and local EMS crews tried to resuscitate him for roughly 30 minutes but took him to Northside Hospital, according to information from the Pinellas County Forensic Science Center. He soon arrived at the hospital and was declared dead.The medical report also indicated that Hulk Hogan was experiencing atrial flutter, which is an irregular heartbeat, and was also diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, a slow-growing cancer of the blood.He had these underlying conditions, which were disclosed following his death.A medical examiner ruled the death natural, and the family has since decided to have him cremated, but there is as yet no date set for a public memorial.Sky Daily, Hogan's spouse, called the loss an unexpected ""emotional tsunami"" in a heartfelt statement. She revealed that although Hogan had undergone neck surgery earlier this year, but seemed to be healing well and was otherwise in high spirits just days before his sudden death.His daughter, Brooke Hogan , also spoke out, saying their relationship was loving, and although there had been ""family issues in the past"", she had not fallen out with him. Hulk's son Nick also remembered him as ""his best friend"" and recalled all their moments together in a very emotional tribute.His ex-wife, Linda Hogan, mourned, saying, “I never really got over him in all these years.” She also admitted that they had a long and troubled history together and that she still loved him and missed him.So did the wrestling community. WWE dedicated a segment to him on Monday Night Raw, and many legends and fans paid their respects. Ric Flair, Vince McMahon, and more are in disbelief as they pay tribute to Hogan for being a mentor, friend, and marvel of the wrestling world.Also Read: Brooke Hogan Turned Her Back on Hulk Hogan’s $25M Fortune Before His Death: Report In the 80s, Hulk Hogan was the biggest name in the world, leading the ""Hulkamania"" charge and being known all over the world.

Employees are prioritizing office presence, leading to a 20-45% rise in vehicular flow at tech parks. Traffic police propose work-from-home on Wednesdays, while commuters emphasize the need for improved infrastructure to alleviate the gridlock.

Poll Should companies implement mid-week work-from-home to ease Bengaluru traffic? Yes, it can reduce congestion No, it's not a long-term fix

Motorists seek better infra, not just WFH





BENGALURU: The tech capital's infamous traffic has found a new villain: fear of layoffs.As job insecurity grips the tech sector, especially in the wake of AI-led downsizing, a curious trend has emerged: travel time on all working days of the week has increased on the Outer Ring Road (ORR), with Wednesday turning out to be the worst day to be on the road!Read also: ‘To be seen in office is to survive’: Layoff-weary Bengaluru techies ditch WFH, brave traffic Bengaluru Traffic Police (BTP), who analyse the vehicle-parking data from 26 tech parks on ORR, said there was a 20-45% rise in vehicular flow at tech parks in June 2025 compared to June 2024.The surge in traffic on ORR (from Silk Board Junction to KR Pura), Sarjapur Road, and the roads leading to Electronics City has been more glaring in the past three weeks as layoffs have become near-daily headlines. The talk in HR circles is that more employees are choosing to be seen in office rather than risk being labelled dispensable while working remotely.""I can't afford to be invisible,"" said Rahul Shetty (name changed), a senior developer who now makes it a point to show up at his office in a tech park near Doddanekundi, on ORR, at least four times a week. ""These days, optics matter. Being seen at your desk might ensure job security,"" he added.This line of thinking, despite lacking definitive data to substantiate it, is resulting in a bumper-to-bumper nightmare on ORR. So much so that the new traffic police chief, joint commissioner (traffic) Karthik Reddy, proposed a work-from-home arrangement for tech employees every Wednesday, during a recent high-level coordination meeting involving officials from BBMP, BMTC, and representatives of the Greater Bengaluru IT and Companies Association.""Peak traffic is observed between 9am and 10am on all weekdays, but Wednesday stands out because of an increase in office attendance by IT employees. We've recommended that tech firms either allow work-from-home every Wednesday or shift office timings to start by 7.30am and end earlier in the day,"" Reddy told TOI.The vehicle-parking data collected by BTP paints a stark picture. In June 2024, an average of 82,168 vehicles were recorded on Wednesdays. This June, the number jumped to a staggering 1.2 lakh — a 45% increase. The spike, officials believe, isn't just about the corporate mandate to return to office but also speaks to employee anxiety.Traffic police's suggestion to corporate head honchos to put in place a work-from-home arrangement for tech employees every Wednesday has turned the spotlight on Bengaluru's broken civic infrastructure, which techies and other commuters insist must be fixed on priority.Suma Santosh, a data analyst working with a multinational company in Bellandur, said: ""Work-from-home for a single day is only a temporary band-aid. The deeper problem lies in poor pedestrian infrastructure. I live barely 2.5km from my office, but I'm forced to take my two-wheeler because walking is unsafe and inconvenient. If proper footpaths and crossings existed, at least 25% of two-wheeler traffic could be cut down. ""Others pointed to the uncoordinated construction activities choking the tech corridor. ""From Metro construction to BWSSB's pipeline works to road widening, everything is happening at the same time,"" said Vikram Naik, project lead in a company located in Marathahalli. ""There's no synchronisation between agencies. This chaos is what's fuelling peak-hour gridlocks.""A BBMP official, who attended the recent coordination meeting, admitted that simultaneous infrastructure works have exacerbated congestion. ""We're working with BMRCL and BWSSB to ensure better coordination in project planning. We're also exploring the feasibility of creating parallel service roads or alternative routes to divert traffic.""While tech firms have shown preliminary support for staggered timings and hybrid policies, sources say the implementation needs logistical planning. Sridhar M, an HR executive with a tech major, said: ""Work-from-home arrangement on Wednesdays is doable but optional. Some roles demand physical presence. We're open to encouraging early shift starts, and promoting carpooling and BMTC usage among our employees. ""With tech zones such as Bellandur, Marathahalli, Kadubeesanahalli, and Devarabisanahalli continuing to bear the brunt of urban congestion, the coming weeks will test how well coordination, policy tweaks, and corporate cooperation can collectively decongest the city's IT backbone.","Bengaluru's tech sector faces increased traffic congestion on Outer Ring Road.

GTA 6 may again witness a delay



Grand Theft Auto VI expected to generate nearly $8 billion



Rockstar Games’ much-awaited title Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA6) may again witness a delay. According to a new online leak the game may release in September 2026 instead of May 2026. As reported by Tom’s Guide, leakster Millie A has revealed that due to some internal discussions at the studio, the release of GTA 6 is said to shift from May 2026 to September 2026. This news comes after Rockstar had already pushed back the game's launch from its initial Fall 2025 window to May 2026. While Rockstar Games has yet to officially comment on these latest speculations. Along with this, the leakster also revealed the likely price of GTA 6 in the UK.The rumours stem from an X (formerly Twitter) user and leaker known as ""Millie A,"" who, despite a mixed track record, claims that ""internal talks"" at Rockstar Games point to a possible slip in the release schedule. Earlier, the gaming studio confirmed that the GTA 6 will launch in May 2026, however as per the new leak the game launch has witnessed another delay and now it may launch in September 2026.In addition to the potential delay, the leak also offered insights into the alleged pricing structure for GTA 6's various editions:* Standard Edition: Reportedly priced at $69.99/£69.99.* Deluxe Edition: Expected to cost $89.99/£89.99, potentially offering early access to GTA Online.* Premium Edition: Priced at $109.99/£109.99, rumoured to provide ""first access"" to GTA Online.The prospect of early access to GTA Online for pricier editions suggests a strategy by Rockstar to incentivize higher-tier purchases, leveraging the immense popularity and profitability of GTA 5's online component.Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is set to launch in May next year. Meanwhile, investment firm Konvoy has made some major predictions for the upcoming open world title’s financial performance. The video game venture capitalist company suggests that GTA 6 will generate $7.6 billion in revenue within just two months or 60 days of its release. Josh Chapman, a managing partner of Konvoy, shared this forecast on a post shared on the professional networking site LinkedIn. He highlighted that the firm believes that the highly anticipated game will have major commercial success. However, it's important to note that Konvoy's projection is based on certain assumptions that Take-Two Interactive has not yet confirmed, such as an $80 price point for the game and a reported budget of around $2 billion, which the company is said to have spent to develop the game.Konvoy's analysis suggests that GTA 6 could recover its estimated $2 billion budget in under 30 days and build considerable momentum. The firm predicts that it may become the gaming industry’s biggest launch to date and is expected to break records for both copies sold and revenue generated by a game. Considering that analysts have referred to GTA 6 as ""the most important game to ever release in the industry,"" a multi-billion dollar revenue figure may be within reach for the title.",Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA6) may again witness a delay.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
