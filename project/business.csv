'Unwilling to work hard even with Rs 1 crore salary': US-based CEO post on 'engineers for Indian office' creates stir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unwilling-to-work-hard-even-with-rs-1-crore-salary-us-based-ceo-post-on-engineers-for-indian-office-creates-stir/articleshow/117872762.cms,"NEW DELHI: IIT-Kharagpur alumnus Varun Vummadi , CEO of the US-based tech company Giga ML , ignited a debate on work ethic and work-life balance in the tech industry after he claimed in a post on X that many Indian engineers are unwilling to work hard despite being offered high salaries.“I’ve noticed a pattern in hiring engineers for our Indian office. Even with a base salary of Rs 1 crore, many are unwilling to work hard. A significant number of engineers with 3–8 years of experience are reluctant to work six days a week,” Vummadi wrote in a post.Vummadi expressed frustration over the attitude of engineers in India, particularly those in the early and mid-stages of their careers. He later doubled down on his stance, referencing his own family’s work ethic. He added, “My dad and mom are government teachers. They still work 6 days a week. 6*8 hrs for a Rs 1 crore base salary, which is significantly above benchmark for 3-8 year experienced people, is extremely fair.”He further added, “So work-life balance is what cuts it for attention and press in Indian crowd. People who are willing to work hard—hope they don't get eaten up by this virus. Many successful startups did 6 or 7 days a week. @elonmusk is a living example of where you can be if you work hard.”His comments triggered mixed reactions online. While some agreed with his observations, others pointed out that productivity does not necessarily correlate with longer working hours. Many argued that sustainable productivity and mental well-being should not be compromised for financial incentives.“Work ethic isn’t just about hours—it’s about impact. If talented engineers are hesitating despite a Rs1 crore base salary, it might be worth considering whether expectations align with modern work culture . Sustainable productivity often beats sheer hours,” one user commented.Another user pushed back against the notion of overworking for money, saying, “You can't buy cracked folks. They appreciate money, don’t worship it!”",IIT-Kharagpur alumnus Varun Vummadi ignited a debate on work ethic and work-life balance in the tech industry.

Third major holy dip begins at Kumbh amid 'zero-error' vigil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/third-major-holy-dip-begins-at-kumbh-amid-zero-error-vigil/articleshow/117872316.cms,"PRAYAGRAJ: Authorities implemented a ""zero-error"" approach to ensure safety and smooth crowd management as the sacred bathing ritual of Basant Panchami got under way at Maha Kumbh. The tithi for the third major holy dip began at 9.14am Sunday and will continue until 6.52pm Monday.Nearly 90 lakh devotees had already taken a dip at Sangam by noon and a much larger turnout is expected Monday when all 13 akharas and Naga sadhus begin their Amrit Snan in phases at dawn.The heightened vigilance follows the tragic stampede on Mauni Amavasya Amrit Snan on Jan 29, which claimed 30 lives and left 60 injured. That day, more than 7 crore pilgrims had gathered in Prayagraj for the ritual. CM Yogi Adityanath has instructed officials to ensure an error-free event this time.District magistrate Vijay Kiran Anand emphasised the scale of preparations, saying: ""It is a major bathing day and since we witnessed over 3.5 crore visitors on Makar Sankranti (first Amrit Snan on Jan 14), we expect a similar or higher turnout. We are all on high alert and all necessary steps have been put in place to ensure all devotees have a safe snan.""Authorities have issued strict guidelines for akharas performing. The mela area, spanning 44 ghats spread over 4,000 hectares or 40sqkm, has been continuously prepared to regulate crowds. A key aspect of these preparations is Operation 11, a specialised crowd-control plan featuring a one-way traffic system, strategic barricading, and increased police presence at crucial points.To prevent overcrowding, devotees have been advised not to linger at the ghats after bathing or eat food and drinks in the area. Special holding areas have also been set up at key points to manage crowds efficiently. Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad president Mahant Ravindra Puri urged pilgrims to explore other bathing sites beyond Sangam - the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and the invisible Saraswati. ""The entire five 'kos' of Prayagraj is as pious as Sangam. Devotees can and should bathe anywhere, from Phaphamau to Arail,"" he said.A strict one-way route has been implemented throughout the mela area, with devotees entering via Kali Sadak and exiting through Triveni Marg. Until Feb 5, entire mela zone will remain a no-vehicle area, with diversions, barricades, and holding areas set up to prevent overcrowding.To handle the enormous influx of pilgrims, UP govt has deployed the same trio of IAS officers - Vijay Kiran Anand, Ashish Goyal, and Bhanu Chandra Goswami - who managed 2019 Kumbh.","The heightened vigilance follows the tragic stampede on Mauni Amavasya Amrit Snan on Jan 29, which claimed 30 lives and left 60 injured.

Government’s debt management plan

Capital expenditure and growth focus

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday cited India’s “unblemished track record” of fiscal consolidation , even as credit rating agency Moody’s decided not to upgrade the country’s sovereign rating.Sitharaman said that India has never deviated from its fiscal consolidation and debt reduction targets.She also defended the government’s strategy of balancing fiscal prudence with growth, highlighting tax reliefs and a clear debt management plan outlined in the Union Budget for 2024-25.""Despite all these we have shown a commitment and following the commitment to the last word as regards fiscal deficit and the glide path that we should follow,"" Sitharaman said. ""We have, not one year have we failed (to meet our commitment).""Global credit rating agency Moody’s has maintained India’s sovereign rating at “Baa3” with a stable outlook, the lowest investment-grade rating. The agency ruled out an immediate upgrade, citing concerns over the country’s debt burden and fiscal deficit levels.""While we view the government's sustained fiscal discipline and narrower fiscal deficits as credit positive, we don't expect these improvements in the debt burden or 'debt affordability' to be enough to trigger a sovereign rating upgrade at this time,"" Christian de Guzman, Senior Vice President at Moody’s Ratings, told PTI.Moody’s evaluates a country’s creditworthiness, assessing its ability to repay debt. A higher rating generally translates to lower borrowing costs and increased investor confidence, while a lower rating signals higher risks.Sitharaman stressed that India had to borrow more during the Covid-19 pandemic due to global supply chain disruptions and geopolitical conflicts but has remained committed to reducing debt levels.""The government has volunteered to say that it will manage the debt,"" she said, adding that India has been steadily working towards reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio in line with expert recommendations.She also highlighted that while focusing on fiscal discipline, there has been no reduction in public spending on essential sectors such as social welfare, education, and healthcare.She defended the government’s approach to capital expenditure , which has been pegged at Rs11.21 lakh crore for 2024-25, a modest increase from Rs 10.18 lakh crore in the revised estimate for the current fiscal year.""If we are looking at the numbers, because we've got used to 16 per cent, 17 per cent increase (in capital spending) every year from 2020, and saying you have not increased it by that number (in the Budget for 2025-26), I would equally want to ask you to please look at the way in which the quality of spending has happened, particularly capital expenditure,"" she stated.Sitharaman also praised states for effectively utilising the 50-year interest-free loans provided for capital expenditure, contributing to overall infrastructure growth.The spending for the ongoing fiscal was lower than initially budgeted due to a slowdown in expenditure during the general election period. However, Sitharaman remains confident in the government’s strategy of balancing fiscal responsibility with economic expansion.","Sitharaman said that India has never deviated from its fiscal consolidation and debt reduction targets.

Budget paves the way for India-US Harley diplomacy as customs duty on bigger bikes slashed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/budget-paves-the-way-for-india-us-harley-diplomacy-as-customs-duty-on-bigger-bikes-slashed/articleshow/117861538.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of PM Modi’s upcoming visit to the US, the Union Budget may have paved the way for Harley diplomacy between the two countries with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman slashing the import duty on bigger bikes -- the move set to directly benefit the iconic American bike company Harley-Davidson -- paying heed to an often-repeated tariff reduction rant of President Donald Trump.The Budget also seemed to offer benefits for Tesla, the electric vehicle giant run by Trump’s confidant Elon Musk, but this relief appears to be more of a lip service with the effective tax rate remaining the same.On motorcycles, the Budget slashed the customs duty not just for the big bikes with engines above 1600cc, but even the smaller ones, making it a widespread and substantial relief (the move will also benefit other makers such as Honda, Suzuki, Ducati, and KTM).For the 1600cc and above motorcycles, the customs duty was slashed significantly from 50% to 30% for the fully-built imported bikes. For the ones coming in through semi-knocked down (SKD) kits, the duty comes from 25% to 20%, while for the completely-knocked down (CKD) ones, it comes down from the current 15% to 10%.For bikes where the engine is smaller than 1600cc, the customs duty comes down from the existing 50% to 40%. On SKDs, it comes down from 25% to 20%, and for CKDs, it gets reduced from 15% to 10%.The move will see the price of the bigger bikes come down significantly -- by at least a few lakh rupees -- in a direct benefit to the products that are made in the US (Harley is making smaller-engine bikes in India –about 440cc – in partnership with Hero Moto).It is believed that the govt decided to slash the import duty to please the new US administration as President Trump has almost been admonishing various countries, especially China, India and Brazil, for being “tremendous tariff makers”. With Trump threatening that “we’re not going to let that happen any longer”, govts across key trading nations have been looking at ways and means to soothe the nerves.On the other hand, the duty cut for Tesla (and other imported cars) is not tangible in its actual sense.The Budget cut the headline customs duty on imported cars costing upwards of $40,000 (around Rs 35 lakh) from the current 100%, to 70%, a measure that would seemingly benefit a car company like Tesla that has spoken about having a presence in India, but is yet not ready to invest in a local factory.However, while reducing the basic customs duty by 30%, the budget replaced the Social Welfare Surcharge of 10% on the previous customs duty with a 40% Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC).In effect, the cumulative duty on any new car – priced above $40,000 -- that is being imported to India continues to be 110%.So in effect, there is no effective change in duty on the ground in case Musk decides to begin his electric car business in India through the import route.Govt had already welcomed the maverick American businessman with a special electric vehicles manufacturing policy, that many saw as a ‘Tesla package’. The package, which was announced around March last year, promised any company investing over $500 million for a factory with a highly-subsidised 15% import duty for around 8,000 cars annually as they began work for a manufacturing base. However, while the govt waited anxiously, Musk backed out at the last minute, in a big setback to the plans.Will the new lower headline tariffs help India in negotiating better with the US during the trade talks, only time will tell.","The Union Budget may have paved the way for Harley diplomacy between the two countries.

'Declare Kerala backward if you want funds': Minister's remark sparks controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/declare-kerala-backward-if-you-want-funds-ministers-remark-sparks-controversy/articleshow/117859467.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union minister George Kurian's remark on Sunday that Kerala should declare itself a backward state to secure better allocations in the Union Budget has ignited a major controversy.Addressing concerns raised by Kerala’s chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and finance minister K N Balagopal regarding the centre's budget, Kurian said: ""If Kerala announces that it is backward—that it lacks roads and quality education—then the Finance Commission will examine it and report to the central government. If Kerala is behind other states in education, infrastructure, and social welfare, the Centre will allocate funds accordingly.""Kurian’s comments, made to reporters in the national capital, come amid strong criticism of the Union Budget 2025-26 by both the ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress in Kerala. The two parties accused the central government of overlooking the state’s critical demands.Vijayan, Balagopal, and Leader of Opposition V D Satheesan expressed their disappointment, claiming that key state demands—including a Rs 24,000 crore special financial package and rehabilitation aid for Wayanad—had been ignored in the budget. The trio described the budget as ""condemnable,"" ""extremely disappointing,"" and ""unfortunate.""The CPI(M) quickly responded, condemning both the Union Budget, presented by Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and Kurian’s comments. CPI(M) State Secretary M V Govindan and senior leader E P Jayarajan accused Kurian of adopting an “anti-Kerala” stance in the allocation of funds to the state.The CPI(M) intensified its criticism, alleging that the BJP-led Centre had deliberately sidelined Kerala in the budget, pushing what they termed an “anti-Kerala” agenda. Govindan claimed that despite Kerala’s strong performance in human development, health, and education, the BJP had consistently worked against the state’s interests.“The BJP’s aim is to make Kerala poor and backward. After their failed attempts to tighten their grip on the state, they are now trying to push Kerala backward by denying it the funds it deserves,” Govindan said.Echoing these views, Jayarajan accused the Centre of political discrimination in fund allocations, violating federal principles, and undermining secular values. He called for a united Kerala to protest against Kurian's statement, urging the Centre to recognize India as a united nation where all states are treated equally.“The people of Kerala must unite and protest against the Union minister’s statement that the state must regress in all areas of development to receive central allocations,” Jayarajan said.This criticism follows earlier claims from Kerala’s leadership that the state’s key demands—such as the special financial package and Wayanad rehabilitation aid—were disregarded in the Union Budget.","Kurian's comments come amid strong criticism of the Union Budget 2025-26 by both the ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress in Kerala.

There was a huge crowd of advocates for an important case preceding my case. I struggled through the crowd and reached the front row to seek a Passover. But my vocal cord failed me. I struggled to make the request to the CJI,” he said.Apart from his legal acumen, he was known for his lighter vein comments to diffuse tense debates inside the courtroom, especially in sensitive and important issues before constitution benches. So much so that, CJI D Y Chandrachud always gave him the opportunity to speak the last word, which invariably was a joke rhyming with the issue.CJI Khanna modified Sibal’s statement that Justice Roy was a complete judge. The CJi said Justice Roy was a complete man, as apart from legal knowledge, reasonableness and a sense of justice, he was an allrounder being a voracious reader and golfer.

Army gearing up to induct more heavy-duty drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-gearing-up-to-induct-more-heavy-duty-drones/articleshow/117847274.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Army is chalking out a long-term roadmap to expand its fleet of heavy-duty drones for ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) as well as precision-strike missions, with their sheer operational utility being reinforced by the Russia-Ukraine and Armenia-Azerbaijan conflicts amid the ongoing shift towards unmanned and autonomous technologies in modern warfare.The force is basically looking at unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) systems that can operate at ranges beyond 1,000-km for long-range strategic ISR missions, fly at altitudes over 30,000-feet to evade detection, and have an endurance of over 24 hours at a stretch, top sources told TOI on Thursday.As per estimates, China has well over 2,000 top-notch UAVs, which includes combat drones like the Cai Hong-4, CH-5, CH-7, Wing Loong-II and the stealthy Hongdu GJ-11 `Sharp Sword’.China is also the world’s largest exporter of military UAVs , and has stepped up supply of the armed CH-4 and Wing Loong-II drones to Pakistan, which in turn has around 150-200 drones, including the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 and Akinci drones.The Indian Army, in contrast, has only around 50 Israeli-origin Heron Mark-I and Mark-II as well as Searcher-II medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) drones. Amid the military standoff with China, the force inducted four new satcom-enabled Heron Mark-II drones to boost surveillance along the Line of Actual Control.While the Army Aviation Corps operates these fighter-size UAVs for surveillance and precision-targeting, infantry battalions use a wide array of smaller drones for tactical reconnaissance, logistics and other tasks.While IAF and Navy have their own UAV fleets, there is an overall requirement of at least 150 new MALE drones for the three Services. Towards this end, the Army is focusing on indigenous development of MALE drones by DRDO as well as private sector companies, including through collaboration with friendly countries.DRDO has developed the Rustom series of UAVs, including the Tapas-BH-201 drone but it failed to fully meet operational military requirements, as was first reported by TOI. “Efforts are now underway to enhance the capabilities of Tapas,” a source said.The first flight of Archer-NG, a weaponised MALE drone developed by DRDO, in turn, is expected soon. With a maximum altitude of 30,000-feet, the UAV can carry 300 kg of payload, including anti-tank guided missiles and smart anti-airfield weapons. “With a 1,000-km range, Archer-NG is designed for ISR missions, target acquisition and precision-strikes,” he added.In the arena of the much more capable high-altitude, long endurance (HALE) drones, the armed forces of course will get 31 armed MQ-9B `Predators’ under the Rs 32,350 crore contract inked with the US last Oct. The delivery of these drones, armed with Hellfire missiles, GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs and other weapons, will begin in 2029.“The Army also needs advanced MALE drones because of the two long `active’ borders with China and Pakistan, both of which require continuous real-time intelligence-gathering and monitoring,” another source said.“UAVs and RPA systems reduce risk to soldiers, allow longer operational endurance and provide precision-strike capabilities. They also enhance counter-terrorism operations by tracking cross-border infiltrations and carrying out strikes on terrorist hideouts,” he added.","The force is looking at unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) systems that can operate at ranges beyond 1,000-km for long-range strategic ISR missions.

Every family in India is brimming with happiness and enthusiasm. Our government has completely zeroed income tax on earnings up to Rs 12 lakh. Since independence, no one earning Rs 12 lakh a year has ever received such significant relief from income tax,"" the Prime Minister said.""For a person with a salary of Rs 12 lakh during Jawaharlal Nehru's time, one-fourth would have gone to tax. If Indira Gandhi's government were in power today, Rs 10 lakh of your Rs 12 lakh would have gone to the government as tax. Even just 10-12 years ago, during the Congress era, if you had a salary of Rs 12 lakh, Rs 2,60,000 would have gone as tax. But after yesterday's BJP government budget, those earning Rs 12 lakh will not have to pay a single rupee in tax,"" PM Modi highlighted.Launching an attack on the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi, PM Modi accused it of making false promises and indulging in corruption, which he claimed has led to the closure of factories in the capital. He warned that those responsible for ""looting the people"" would be held accountable.""While on one hand is 'AAP-da', which stands for false promises, on the other is 'Modi’s guarantees',"" he said, taking a swipe at the ruling party.PM Modi also linked the Budget’s welfare measures to his broader governance vision, stating that his government at the Centre has focused on strengthening four key pillars: the poor, farmers, youth, and women. He asserted that the Budget reflects his commitment to fulfilling these guarantees.PM Modi expressed confidence in the BJP's victory, asserting that Delhi has suffered under AAP rule for 11 years and now seeks a ""double-engine government"" that prioritizes development. He assured that under a BJP-led government, no slum would be demolished, nor would any welfare schemes be discontinued.""You can note it down: the BJP government will be formed in Delhi on February 8, and by March 8, on International Women’s Day, women will start receiving Rs 2,500,"" he stated, highlighting BJP’s welfare promises, particularly for senior citizens and women.PM Modi also sought to connect with the significant Purvanchali population in Delhi, referencing his Lok Sabha constituency, Varanasi, and reaffirming the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government's commitment to Bihar’s development through various Budget proposals.PM Modi reiterated that his government makes decisions in alignment with their aspirations. He highlighted the Budget’s focus on employment-generating sectors such as tourism and manufacturing, emphasizing that these initiatives would directly benefit the youth.Taking a jibe at AAP leader and former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, PM Modi said, ""Those who live in 'sheesh mahal' (glass palaces) cannot relate to a poor family's jhuggi or a middle-class family’s 2BHK flat."" He accused AAP of corruption in every sector, including healthcare, and claimed that even AAP leaders, including sitting MLAs denied tickets for the elections, were deserting the party due to growing public resentment.""Feeling jittery, the AAP is making false announcements every day,"" he added.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday lauded the Union Budget, calling it the ""most middle class friendly Budget in India's history"" PM Modi pointed out the significant relief offered to those earning up to Rs 12 lakh, saying that such benefits have never been granted since India’s Independence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117857489,imgsize-905232,width-400,resizemode-4/117857489.jpg"

It could, however, be considered one of the largest GBS outbreaks as medical literature classified 30 to 50 cases as an outbreak until 2019 when Peru registered the worst flare-up.The South American country had 1,120 cases in 2019, with 683 cases reported in two months.Its annual caseload stood at 59 in 2017 and rose to 262 in 2018 before peaking in 2019. Cases were recorded from across the country, but there is little data on deaths. The story didn't end there; Peru witnessed an outbreak again in 2023, when 130 suspected cases were reported between June 10 and July 15.The problem with GBS, as a professor of medicine in a medical college in Mumbai said, is that it is an autoimmune condition that technically doesn't seem like an epidemic-causing condition. ""GBS has been seen as an independent disorder that is sporadically seen across the country, but we now need to change our mindset and accept it can emerge as an outbreak and study it epidemiologically to look for links between the patients,"" he said.The only link between Peru and Pune is microbe Campylobacter jejuni . Smaller studies from across the world show GBS following this infection is linked with higher disability and mortality rates.GBS has been so rare - India has a reported annual incidence of 1.75 to 2 per lakh population - that there are few in-depth studies. The first-ever detailed analysis of the prevalence and disability burden of GBS was conducted in 2021. Using data between 1990 and 2019, the analysis showed that Japan, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, South Korea, the US and Mexico had much higher than expected burdens, while countries and territories such as China, Fiji, Taiwan, and Guam had much lower than expected burdens.","18 of 140 patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome are on ventilator support in Pune.

Political Party's Ideology Candidate's Track Record

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday launched a sharp attack on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) saying that the party is falling apart ahead of the upcoming elections in Delhi.“We are seeing that even before the voting, ‘jhaadu ke tinke bikhar rahe hain’ (the straws of the broom are scattering). Leaders of ‘AAP-da’ are leaving it, they know that people are angry with ‘AAP-da’, they (people) hate this party,” Modi said, referring to several AAP leaders quitting the party.He also expressed confidence in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) forming the next government in Delhi. “With the arrival of Basant Panchami, the weather starts to change. In Delhi, on February 5, ‘vikas ka naya Basant aane wala hai’ – this time BJP government is going to form in Delhi,” he said.His remarks comes days after 8 AAP MLAs quit the party and joined BJP just days before the Delhi Assembly polls. The legislators—Vandana Gaur (Palam), Rohit Mehraulia (Trilokpuri), Girish Soni (Madipur), Madan Lal (Kasturba Nagar), Rajesh Rishi (Uttam Nagar), B S Joon (Bijwasan), Naresh Yadav (Mehrauli), and Pawan Sharma (Adarsh Nagar)—resigned from AAP, citing corruption and the party’s alleged deviation from its ideology.AAP, however, dismissed the allegations, claiming that BJP had been trying to lure its MLAs by offering positions and incentives.During his speech, Modi also took aim at AAP’s governance in Delhi over the past 11 years, accusing the party of corruption and mismanagement. “AAP-da committed scams in even health measures, those who ‘looted’ people will have to return it,” he said.PM Modi also spoke about the Union Budget, calling it a “people’s budget” that fulfils his government’s commitments to empowering the poor, farmers, youth, and women. He emphasised that the budget is particularly beneficial for the middle class, calling it the “most friendly budget for them in India’s history.”“Never after Independence have those earning up to Rs 12 lakh received such a relief,” he said, referring to the tax cuts introduced in the budget. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement raised the exemption threshold from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 12 lakh, providing substantial relief to the middle class.Modi lauded the budget’s approach, saying it strengthens savings and makes citizens partners in development. “The Budget lays a strong foundation to increase savings and make citizens partners in development,” he said.The Delhi Assembly elections are set for February 5, with results to be declared on February 8.","PM Narendra Modi says Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is falling apart ahead of Delhi elections.

explained the macroeconomic context of her

to TOI's Diwakar & Surojit Gupta. In an exclusive interview, she rejected the criticism that the concessions would further shrink the tax base, while asserting that strong fundamentals would help the economy weather global uncertainties

Through income-tax relief, you appear to betting on rise in consumption. Was that the only consideration?

And spurring consumption could be a byproduct?

The salaried middle classes keep complaining that while they honestly pay taxes, they do not get bang for their buck because they do not get to use public schools or hospitals, there is no unemployment benefit or pension. How do you view this criticism?

How do you see the prospect of growth in the immediate term, given the global uncertainties?

How do you plan to provide relief to those who are outside the ambit of this tax relief. For example, in rural and urban centres?

Also Read:

Commentators have expressed concern over capex allocation.

There has been worry about the private sector not investing. What is holding them back?

The Economic Survey also spoke about wage growth not keeping pace with rise in corporate profits. How much does that have to do with weak demand?

They are also not passing on their profits to their employees and that has created this wage stagnation.

Privatisation of state-run companies has slowed down. Do you see the process taking off?

What other initiatives does the govt have in mind for creating jobs?

But there is criticism that quality employment is not being created.

India needs industrial growth as well as agricultural growth, but rural India is witnessing migration and now, we increasingly have only the elderly in villages.

There are worries about inflation.

What about fuel rates?

Is there any possibility of bringing fuel under GST?

Will GST rates be rationalised, particularly of essential commodities?

Will the Centre nudge states towards that end?

Capex will continue from govt side. It's not reduced from last year. On the contrary, it's gone up and private sector can come in any time... (On customs duty) We have been engaged in rationalisation for the past 2 years. We are looking at it item by item. There is no link between the new(Trump) regime coming in and our rationalisation Sitharaman

You were already having to deal with a lot of uncertainties. Now, you have a new factor in the unpredictable US President, Donald Trump. It has been said that the Budget did not factor in the Trump presidency.

What is going to be the mandate for the committee on deregulation that you have talked about?

You have pursued a new IT law since July. Will the changes be limited to simplification of language or go beyond?

In your speech, you hinted at a culture shift, saying the authorities have to first trust the assessee and then only scrutinise. Right now, the presumption, at least in practice, seems to be that you are guilty unless proven innocent. Will the bill shift the onus?

You have reduced customs duty on premium bikes. Is it a signal to the new US administration?

When do you plan to introduce the insurance bill?

You have followed the path of fiscal consolidation. Do we have the firepower in case the global situation turns adverse?

There is concern about the shrinking tax base which has further shrunk after the latest concessions. How do you see that? It is said the narrow tax base will lead to a longterm problem.

The finance ministry had very strong views on Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs). You have now signalled a revamp. What is the intent behind this?

An election is always due somewhere. But Purvodaya is part of the PM's larger plan for the eastern region. He is very keen on it. Bihar deserves help. A state with such dense population needs several things so that it can catch up Sitharaman

The focus on Bihar has been linked to elections which are due in Nov. So, was it the only consideration?

The govt has been fiscally prudent. When you spoke to the PM on the tax relief issue, what was his response

You have announced an asset monetisation plan. How will that proceed?

Will it cover the pending ones like

Hotel Ashok

, Stadia?

What about the choice of a sari with Madhubani art on Budget day?

The main consideration was that we should honour taxpayers, honest taxpayers who have been contributing to nation building.It can be. It can boost savings too.I also wish public services moved commensurately, but they are not just in the central govt’s hands. They are also in the local bodies’ hands, and in the state govt’s hands. There are elected representatives in all these places. They are all not run by the central govt. But I do sincerely wish that they improved for the sake of people.The World Bank and the IMF have clearly indicated that India will continue to be the fastest growing economy and despite all the odds and challenges resulting from extraneous reasons, we still have a very buoyant, strong economy. Our macroeconomic fundamentals are very strong. So, our growth will continue.We have several schemes to provide them relief such as Kisan Credit Card, whose limit has been raised from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. Another Rs 50 crore will be brought in the ambit of the revamped Stand-Up India loans. Banks are giving record number of loans at discounted rates for affordable housing, while start-ups are getting another Rs 10,000 crore through the Fund of Funds. More than 2 lakh start-ups had registered for the hand-holding assistance in 2016. So, each sector has got affordable credit. At the grassroots, SHGs are getting a corpus for doing business.We will continue with our public sector expenditure. Capex will continue from govt side. It's not reduced from last year. On the contrary, it's gone up and private sector can come in any time.It is a commercial decision, which industries have to take as to when they want to get into the market to expand their capacity or build new capacities. So, beyond this, I may not be in a position to answer.Is true that after corporate tax rate was brought down in 2019, a lot of cleaning up of the books has happened. The twin balance sheet problem between companies and banks has been addressed. So, the companies are, I'm told, making profits but probably keeping it as passive investments, earning interest on the money but yet not feeling that at this time, it is adequate or proper for them to invest and expand capacities. So, they may take a call depending on how demand and export possibilities arise. It's also true that globally, exports are facing challenges and they want the pace of growth of exports to pick up a lot more, even that would be part of their considerations for taking the call.That's the point which the chief economic advisor has made.Privatisation will happen at least for those for which have been cleared by the cabinet. It’s quite a long list. We'll have to keep those units running profitably, professionally, to ensure they are vibrant units. We cannot neglect them just because they were put on the disinvestment list. We have been taking steps and that’s why many of the companies have now got good valuations; whether they are listed or not, at least they are being run professionally. Just as disinvestment is my responsibility, I am also responsible for keeping them in robust health. That’s what we are doing.The July Budget came up with five different schemes, four of which looked at employment generation in MSMEs and also in large corporations for which the govt scheme would come and support in terms of EPFO registration and so on. Of the five schemes, one was aimed at giving internship opportunities in top 500 companies. The pilot run of Phase 1 is over, the second pilot has begun; and so, the internship scheme is moving and students and young adults from very distant areas are benefitting without having to move out of their district. They are being placed with companies in their own districts. There are some who, by choice, want to go to Bengaluru or to Haryana, to Gurgaon or any other place. And have located them as well. They are all going through their internship. Besides that, Rozgar Melas are filling up all the vacant positions in the govt. In this Budget, which I've given for the leather industry, toy sector, for textiles, for critical minerals, for lithium ion batteries, I have already made enough number of announcements which are all labour intensive.Companies are in search of skilled workers. They tell me I want these many people with such skill sets. Job positions are available. The issue also is how many youth are available with required skill sets? Expectations are not being fulfilled because of this mismatch. Companies are not able to get such workers and those who have the skill sets are not able to reach the companies. We are trying to find a way to provide some exposure. We are working on this. Actually, this internship scheme is also about telling people what kind of jobs are available.Agricultural growth has been steady all over the country. Even during Covid, agriculture contributed significantly to India's GDP. In this Budget, we have provided two schemes for promoting rural livelihood and prosperity. The PM Dhan Dhanya Krishi Yojana has so many components that it should ensure that migration becomes an option rather than a compulsion. If you are getting an opportunity, there is no need for them to go out. If we create lots of opportunities, as the PM Dhan Dhanya Krishi Yojana intends to do, in rural districts with low productivity, by using high yielding and hybrid seeds, then they will find jobs there itself. They can be helped also by better handholding for marketing, and by value addition for those products.Inflation is not going up, it’s coming down. The data is released every month. Inflation is something which both the Reserve Bank of India and the Govt of India continuously monitor and try to bring down. Prices of products go up because of input costs and it is something which affects the entire buyer and seller market. But govt takes supply side measures to ensure adequate availability of goods, even perishable ones.State govts play a role. The data on inflation in states clearly shows those states which have not cut fuel prices are the ones who are suffering from higher inflation.GST Council turned down the suggestion. We suggested that at least aviation turbine fuel can be brought under GST and petrol and diesel remain outside, but state finance ministers did not agree. So, the question should be put to the state finance ministers, not to me.There is a discussion going on in the GST Council. We will let you know once they take the call.Centre is part of the GST Council and our inputs go into the eventual decision... meaning we'll discuss. The Centre's viewpoint will also go into it.You answered the question yourself. We will not get to know what the US administration or, for that matter, any other administration in the world is going to do about India unless they take a call. So, what exactly should I prepare for? We can only be mindful of and watchful about it. But what action can I take when there is no announcement about anything concerning India?Well, the details will be worked out, but they include items like, when licences have to be given or inspections are to be conducted or a certificate has to be issued for a product of a certain standard. Currently, there is lack of clarity. The industry or the manufacturers are asked one thing at one point in time, and quite another at some other point. The overall sense is that there is not a common approach; no SOP even if there is one. Manufacturers too have concerns about regulators. So, should there be a way to approach a problem from a manufacturer's point of view, from a trader’s point of view. So that we can go beyond merely saying ‘oh no, here is my rule and you have to follow’. Else, you are not going to get the licence. Another fellow says that I have to inspect you. And there is yet another who says I have to visit you each month. Such things are completely avoidable. So we want to bring some coherence in the way this is handled.It will be a comprehensive approach to making the Income Tax Act relevant to the 21st century; relevant to an era which is technology-driven; relevant to times where the taxpayer is most often doing the assessment and filing himself. So, for a citizen to be able to deal with income tax on his own, the system should be simple enough for him to handle. It is also something we are working on because of the looseness and ambiguity of language. There are also several issues in courts where both sides appear to be right. That is because of the language used in the Act. And why should it be like that? The Act came in 1965 and India has since seen major changes; in 1991, the economy opened up, liberalization came in. Then, in 2020, Covid struck. So many changes have happened, and there have only been additions to the Act in response. Are they all consistent? Are the additions aligned with the original intent of the law? All of this has necessitated a comprehensive relook.Even now, when it comes to the question of this Budget proposal on the people who have more than one residence or one house, we have said that selfdeclaration, whether one is being used for personal purpose or whether one has been rented out is fine with us. It is for the tax assessee to say what he wants to say, and for us his word is final. That is already on.Trust is what we want and, therefore, trust is what we are trying to use as a first step. Self-declaration, yes, trust is the first thing.We have been engaged in rationalisation of customs duty for the past two years We are looking at it item by item. There is no link between the new regime coming in and our work on rationalisation.We will let you know once we have something on this. At the moment, I have said that we will be bringing the income tax bill this week.Our fundamentals are strong even now. So my fiscal deficit is continuously assessed. The deficit number is given in the glide path and that is what I am following. Not one single year have I failed. And that would not be possible if my fundamentals were not strong.So, is it wiser to keep loading the narrow base with taxes because that is the only set of people I have for paying taxes? Even that's not right. Therefore, we have said that we need to give relief. We will give relief because that's honouring the taxpayer and he has been contributing all the while. But it is also equally upon us to widen the tax base and keep newer people coming in who have not been earlier paying taxes, who are probably in the tax payable net. So, we will draw them in.We want to have the draft BIT to be a bit more investor friendly. That’s why I want to do it.In the July Budget too, we announced schemes for Bihar when elections were not on the horizon. An election is always due somewhere. But Purvodaya is part of the PM's larger plan for the eastern region. He is very keen on it. That is why we revived fertiliser plants in the region. Bihar deserves help. A state with such dense population needs several things so that it can catch up. Bihar is part of the Buddhist tourism circuit but lacks a big international airport. Is giving it one greenfield airport an excess? I am surprised by the criticism. I don't think we need an opposition which is opposed to the progress of such a state. They should say openly that they are against Bihar's development. Don't do anything for Bihar because we don't want you to develop Bihar, is this what they are trying to say? The PM has repeatedly said that a state needs to improve irrespective of the party in office. Else, it will become a drag and pull you down. So, I'm happy we are doing this.Right from the beginning, his guidance was to find out how you would be able do it , what is going to be the formulation and, so, we worked with the department of revenue, CBDT and only then went with the proposal. Various different.The first plan went well and we are bringing the second edition and under that we will plough back about Rs 10 lakh crore under that and I have mentioned this in the budget speech. We will take it forward.I wouldn't name individual items but yes it will cover a whole lot of sectors.This is a very interesting story. I had gone to Madhubani in Nov when I was introduced to Dulari Devi, who is known for her paintings. She belongs to the fishing community, an EBC, and she gave this sari to me and told me to wear it on Budget day. I offered to pay but she would not let me. She said it is our custom to give sari and other gifts when a daughter visits home. On Budget day, I remembered her and so....",FM Sitharaman explains the macroeconomic context of her Budget.

"Terror kingpin deported from Philippines to India, arrested",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/terror-kingpin-deported-from-philippines-to-india-arrested/articleshow/117869656.cms,"NEW DELHI: July 8, 2024. It was unusually rainy, hot and humid that night in Bacolod City, Philippines. The Bureau of Immigration assembled a crack team of select agents from their Fugitive Search Unit (FSU) to hunt down a high-value suspect. The target was an ""Indian-Nepalese"" national, the subject of a red-corner notice, located by Indian agencies in their country.The subject, Joginder Gyong, 41, was described as a ranking kingpin of a separatist terror group and a wanted criminal in India. He was tipped to be hiding in an apartment in Barangay Tackling locality in Bacolod. The police in Delhi and central agencies identified the alias ""Kanta Gupta"" that Geong was using to stay undercover.Acting on real-time information from their Indian counterparts, the FSU sleuths carried out a clean operation, apprehending their suspect in an ""in-and-out"" sweep.However, this was just the beginning of a tedious process of getting a fugitive back. Delhi Police 's Special Cell, CBI, Intelligence Bureau and Haryana Police followed Geong closely for months. As deportation proceedings began, Geong was detained at BI warden facility in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City, in high security. There was a chance that Khalistan groups could try to free him.It took almost six months for the Indian authorities to get hold of Geong as he was flown in from Manila to Bangkok two days ago and, finally, to India, where he was arrested by Delhi Police's Special Cell early on Sunday.The events started to unfold early in 2024 when Indian agency sleuths shared information with their counterparts in Manila, said a source. The immigration subsequently issued a 'mission order' for Geong's arrest. Geong was heading an organised crime syndicate and was sentenced to life imprisonment in India. After cops got hot on his trail, Geong fled to the Philippines, where he assumed a fake identity and re-established his gang. Interestingly, he fled to South Africa in mid-2000 and was deported in 2007 too.""He is the younger brother of Surender Geong, who died in an exchange of fire with Haryana Police in 2018. Geong spread his tentacles in Karnal, Panipat, Kaithal, Gurgaon and Delhi and was attempting to re-establish a network for extorting money from doctors, contractors, liquor vendors and other financially well-off businessmen,"" said a senior cop.After settling down in the Philippines, he reorganised his gang and started his criminal enterprise and further got fully involved in the terror network of Arsh Dalla, a designated and wanted terrorist of KTF.The Davinder Bambhia gang, currently operated by wanted fugitive Lucky Patial, also came on board, having a fraternal relationship with Kaushal Chaudhary's gang. Soon, Geong rose to be a key planner and organiser of manpower, harbouring fugitives and moving narcotics and weapons as a logistical hub to facilitate the activities of these criminal networks.This network then carried out sensational killings of Youth Akal Dal leader Vicky Midhukhera, Gurlal Brar and Kabaddi player Sandeep Nangal Ambian in recent years. According to police, Geong's criminal history spans 24 cases, with convictions in 15 cases, including five murder cases. A reward of Rs 1.5 lakh was declared on him.Geong's arrest is expected to reveal new information about the terror-criminal nexus, their international connections, and potential links with hostile foreign entities.""The arrest marks a major milestone in the collaboration between Delhi and Haryana Police forces to combat the terrorist-gangster nexus with help from central agencies,"" said Additional Commissioner (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha. A team comprising Inspector Maan Singh and ACP Ved Prakash are interrogating Geong in custody at present.","Joginder Gyong, 41, was described as a ranking kingpin of a separatist terror group.

In an exclusive interview to TOI, a day after she presented her 8th consecutive Union Budget, Sitharaman asserted that the tax relief unveiled by her was meant to honour the honest taxpayer. She said it was not wise to keep loading the narrow tax base with taxes. ""But it is also equally upon us to widen the base and keep newer people coming in,"" she added.On the proposed revamp of the I-T Act, she said, ""It will be a comprehensive approach to making it relevant to the 21st century, to an era which is technology-driven, where the taxpayer is most often doing it himself. For a citizen to be able to deal with the income tax on his own, the system should be simple enough for him to handle. This is what we are working towards.""She added that the effort was also to build trust between the tax department and the taxpayer and detailed several measures unveiled in the Budget towards that end.Sitharaman said govt would implement the 8th Pay Commission from Jan 1, 2026.

Mehta is likely to participate in deliberations over the changes being planned. CLNDA, 2010, has been a big hurdle to private participation in the sector because of a provision which pins liabilities on nuclear suppliers, in addition to the operator, in case of nuclear damage.

In contrast, the earnings from its freight segment are expected to grow at a more modest rate of 4.4%.Budget documents show the share of passenger earnings in the total revenue has increased from 26.4% in 2022-23 to 28.6% in the revised estimate (RE) of current financial year and is projected to rise to 30.6% in FY26. Though earnings from freight movement remain the railway's mainstay, rising share of passenger revenue will offer some elbow room to frame policies to attract more cargo from other modes of transport, particularly roads.Data shows earnings from AC3 tickets could touch Rs 30,089 crore by March, an increase of nearly 20% from the last financial year. Railways has estimated revenue from this segment to go up by 23% in FY26 and generate Rs 37,115 crore.

Similarly, the revenue from AC Chair Car is projected at Rs 4,280 crore by March surpassing the Budget Estimate (BE) of 2024-25 and an increase of 28.6% over last year. As per estimate for FY26, the earnings would be around Rs 5,626 crore, a growth of 31%.Officials said the increase in passenger revenue will be from across classes as the national transporter will operate a greater number of trains with more general coaches to meet the travel demand of poor and lower middle class. In fact, data show that revenue projected for FY25 from second class (ordinary) - general coaches in inter-city trains - is projected at Rs 1,517 crore, almost double of last financial year.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has dismissed any chance of fare hike. ""The increase in passenger revenue will be driven by growth in passenger volumes.

PM Modi: People should reduce intake of edible oil by 10% to cut obesity risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/people-should-reduce-intake-of-edible-oil-by-10-to-cut-obesity-risk-pm/articleshow/117763507.cms,"NEW DELHI: While physical inactivity, junk food and other factors have drawn a lot of attention for their role in causing lifestyle disorders, and rightly so, edible oil has mostly escaped scrutiny. PM Modi, in his address at the 38th National Games opening ceremony, focused on it and called its excessive use a key factor for rising obesity, while urging for reduced oil intake in all households.Excess consumption of cooking oil, he said, was a key factor behind the rising incidence of obesity. ""Every age group of the country, and even the youth, are being badly affected by it. And this is also a matter of concern because obesity increases the risk of diseases like diabetes, heart disease,"" the PM said.PM Modi appealed to people to reduce oil intake, in addition to working out daily and focusing on a balanced and nutritious diet, leading many to wonder if it was a precursor to a plan focused on tackling obesity by, among other things, discouraging high consumption of edible oil.“In our homes, ration comes at the beginning of the month. Till now, if you used to bring home two litres of cooking oil every month, then reduce it by at least 10%. Reduce the amount of oil we use every day by 10%,” Modi said.He is not alone in sounding the alarm. According to Dr Vineet Kumar Surana, consultant diabetes and endocrinology at Manipal Hospital-Dwarka, when you add excess oil in cooking, it can add hidden calories without causing fullness leading to weight gain and obesity. “One should not consume more than 600-700 ml per month, which translates to approximately 20 ml/day (equivalent to roughly four teaspoons),” he said.Fortis C-Doc chairperson Dr Anoop Misra said, “Normally, people tend to consume double the recom mended amount of oil or more.” To make matters worse, he added, many people tend to reuse oil which is dangerous. “Re-using oil for frying food items leads to an increase in trans-fats that are known to increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke among others,” he said.Apart from quantity, the quality of oil is equally important. The ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (ICMRNIN), says though mustard oil and groundnut oil are very good for cooking, it is best to use a combination of oils either blended or by rotation. e.g. groundnut oil, soya bean oil, sunflower oil, rice bran oil so that one can get the benefit of all. The PM’s call, sources said, suggests the govt is looking to initiate dedicated programmes to tackle and prevent a potential crisis posed by it.The Economic Survey 2023-24 has warned that unhealthy food and sedentary habits don’t just raise the risk of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases and certain types of cancer but they also pose a threat to the country’s economic potential.“For India’s working-age population to be gainfully employed, they need skills and good health. Social media, screen time, sedentary habits and unhealthy food are a lethal mix that can undermine public health and productivity and diminish India’s economic potential,” the survey report said. It adds that the private sector has made substantial contributions to this toxic mix of habits, and that is myopic.It recommended Indian businesses to embrace traditional lifestyle, food and recipes. These have shown how to live healthily and in harmony with nature and the environment for centuries. It makes commercial sense for Indian businesses to learn about and embrace them, for they have a global market waiting to be led rather than tapped, the report said.","Excess consumption of cooking oil, he said, was a key factor behind the rising incidence of obesity.

What are the new tax slabs rules?

How is income tax calculated on new slabs?

What is the latest income tax rebate limit under Section 87A?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Elon Musk's growing influence has now reached the federal payment system as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent reportedly gave its access to the representatives of the Department of Government Efficiency. While this has kicked up a storm in the administration, the move is to facilitate DOGE's monitoring of government spending so that it can limit it. The payment system sends out money on behalf of the government and Elon Musk won access to it after a week-long stand-off with a top Treasury official who did not want it to happen, the New York Times reported.David Lebryk, the official, was put on leave and abruptly retired Friday, the report said. In his email announcing his retirement, Lebryk praised the department’s staff. “Please know that your work makes a difference and is so very important to the country. It has been an honor to work alongside you,” he wrote. “Our work may be unknown to most of the public, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t exceptionally important.”Elon Musk Saturday suggested that this access was to root out fraud or illicit payments. “The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups,” Musk wrote. “They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.” However, Elon Musk did not offer any evidence to back his claim.The issue has been going on since after the election and when DOGE was announced. DOGE officials have been asking for this access since then and then stepped up the pressure after Donald Trump's inauguration. Tom Krause, a Silicon Valley executive, has now been detailed to the Treasury -- on behalf of DOGE.A Washington Post report said it is precisely unclear why Musk's team sought access to these systems.",Elon Musk's DOGE representative now has access to the government's payments system.

“Truly, it’s hard to know what to make of the ongoing saga involving the National League’s top home run hitter since he came into the league and one of the most prolific in the history of the franchise. But from my drama-free distance, it feels like Alonso desperately hopes to return while the Mets could go either way.”

There have been noticeable struggles between the New York Mets and Pete Alonso , in regards to re-signing status. While Mets owner Steve Cohen has publicly admitted to having moved on from the contract discussions, multiple reports from MLB insiders have hinted at their potential reunion.

Los Angeles traded Anthony Davis for Dallas Mavericks' star Luka Doncic

Theshook up the NBA with a blockbuster trade for Luka Doncic , but their roster is far from complete. While Doncic’s offensive firepower is undeniable, his defensive limitations could pose serious challenges, especially in a backcourt alongside Austin Reaves. Now, LA appears to be targeting formerto bolster their perimeter defense.According to ESPN’s Brian Windhorst and Tim Bontemps, Smart is currently on the trade market as the Memphis Grizzlies explore options for the veteran guard. The Los Angeles Lakers, in need of a defensive-minded presence, could benefit from Marcus Smart’s experience and tenacity, but pulling off a trade won’t be easy.One of the biggest obstacles is LA’s trade assets. The Lakers are reportedly reluctant to move Rui Hachimura, who would likely be the centerpiece of any package for Smart. Memphis could demand Hachimura along with draft compensation, but it's uncertain whether LA would be willing to meet that price. While Hachimura has been a key rotation player, the Lakers recently acquired Dorian Finney-Smith, which could make parting with Hachimura more feasible.Marcus Smart, 30, remains one of the league’s most respected defenders. He won NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2022 and brings a level of intensity that could help the Lakers counterbalance Doncic’s defensive shortcomings. However, he is owed $21.6 million next season and won’t hit free agency until 2026, making his contract a factor in trade discussions.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ front office, led by GM Rob Pelinka, is now weighing whether acquiring Smart is worth the potential cost. If LA can put together a competitive trade offer, Marcus Smart’s presence could be a game-changer in their championship pursuit.In a stunning mid-season trade, the Los Angeles Lakers have acquired Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks, sending Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a 2029 first-round pick to Dallas. The Los Angeles Lakers also received Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris in the deal.This move pairs Doncic with LeBron James , creating a formidable offensive duo. Doncic, known for his scoring and playmaking, is averaging 28.6 points per game this season.The trade has sent shockwaves through the NBA, with many surprised by the Mavericks' decision to part with their 25-year-old superstar. Mavericks GM Nico Harrison stated, ""I believe that defense wins championships,"" highlighting the strategic rationale behind acquiring Davis.Also read: NBA Trade Rumor: Golden State Warriors eye blockbuster trade for $215 million Chicago Bulls star; Buddy hield on the table as key trade asset The NBA community is excited to see how this historic deal will affect the league's landscape as the Lakers add Doncic to their roster.","Los Angeles Lakers traded Anthony Davis for Dallas Mavericks' star Luka Doncic.

Budget 2025 income tax expectations : As we all gear up for the Union Budget later this week, the big question for individual taxpayers is whether the Hon’ble Finance Minister will completely scrap the old tax regime ? Well, time will only give the answer but the moot question is – would it be prudent to do so?Let’s step back for a bit of analysis! The new income tax regime was introduced in 2020 as an optional regime for individual taxpayers. The primary objective was to introduce a more simplified tax structure by removing the plethora of deductions and exemptions. The Government also provided significant relief to taxpayers by reducing income-tax rates, thus nudging them to adopt the new income tax regime. It was quite apparent that the Government intended to phase out the old income tax regime in due course. As per media reports, there were very few takers of the new income tax regime in the initial years.To give a further push, vide Finance Act, 2023, the Government made the new income tax regime as the default regime and brought more attractive changes related to the new income tax regime, by reducing the income-tax rates further, capping the maximum marginal rate (MMR) at 39%, introducing the standard deduction of ₹50,000 for salaried individuals, increasing the income level for 100% tax rebate etc. The trend even continued for the subsequent year wherein vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2024, the slab rates were further tweaked for better, standard deduction for salaried individuals was hiked, deduction for employer’s NPS contribution increased by 4% etc. This seems to have worked its magic. As per Press Release issued by the Ministry of Finance on August 2, 2024, 72% taxpayers opted for the new income tax regime in FY 2023-24 ITRs filed until July 31, 2024.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Top personal tax changes on the wishlist While this appears to be a large percentage, one cannot disregard the fact that the 28% taxpayers opting for the old income tax regime in FY 2023-24 is still a considerable number. Furthermore, while we do not have the necessary data to understand clearly which section of taxpayers are still in favour of the old income tax regime, it is not difficult to guess. From salaried taxpayers’ perspective, the ones benefiting from popular tax exemptions and deductions such as, HRA, LTA, home loan interest, 80C deductions, insurance premia, charitable donations etc. would be still opting for old income tax regime.Also See: Income Tax Slab Given this, is it worth evaluating if the lower tax rates under the new income tax regime really offset the tax deductions/ exemptions which taxpayers have to forego?We have categorised individual taxpayers in four general baskets as per their annual gross income – (A) individuals having income up to ₹15 lakh, (B) individuals having income between ₹15 lakh - ₹1 Cr, (C) HNIs having income between ₹1 - ₹5 Cr and (D) ultra-HNIs having income beyond ₹5 Cr.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Why standard deduction should be hiked under new tax regime Category A represents the largest filing population, possibly young salaried taxpayers, many of them millennials, who may not have invested in long term assets like house properties and other savings schemes. Hence, they would typically prefer hassle-free filing and less burden of documentation proof, etc. At the other end of the spectrum are the ultra-HNIs who would prefer the MMR currently capped at 39% in the new income tax regime due to surcharge cap vis-à-vis 42.74% in the old income tax regime. For both these categories, new income tax regime seems to be the clear winner.It is the people in between who seem to make up the largest group as the old income tax regime filers. These individuals generally spend a significant part of their earnings and savings on rising house rent and home loan EMIs, children’s education, medical expenditure especially for their aged dependents and towards their own retirement savings. They also tend to donate to help a social cause. HNIs would comparatively spend, invest and donate more.The available standard deduction against salary income is definitely not commensurate with the rising YoY expenses. The continuity of existing tax benefits under the old income tax regime hence becomes a critical part of their financial planning to meet their cash budgets. As more consequential tax savings would be available to individuals in Categories B and C and their MMR in both the regimes is the same, they would generally find the old income tax regime more attractive. It is also important to remember that many of these tax deductions, e.g., for home loan interest, insurance premia, savings schemes, etc. were originally introduced to give a boost to the related industry, by incentivising taxpayers to spend on them.If discontinued, this could also have an adverse impact on such payee organisations and investee entities in meeting their objectives, fund requirements etc. In view of these, the Government should not rush to scrap the old income tax regime entirely, either in the existing income-tax law or the probable new Direct Tax Code, at least for a few more years till the average taxpayer develops the habit of prudent financial planning.In the interim, the Government could consider announcing its roadmap of phasing out the old income tax regime coupled with an additional carrot of lower tax rates to encourage this middle-income group to voluntarily adopt the new income tax regime.","Budget 2025 income tax expectations: In the interim, the Government could consider announcing its roadmap of phasing out the old income tax regime.

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented her eighth consecutive Union Budget on Saturday. This brings her closer to the record of 10 budgets presented by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who holds the record for the most budgets presented across different terms. She is also the first woman to serve as a full-time finance minister.The Budget for the financial year starting April 2025 (FY2025-26) was the 14th consecutive Budget under the Narendra Modi government since 2014. This includes two interim Budgets presented before the general elections in 2019 and 2024.Ahead of the Budget, there was interest in how the announcements would affect the prices of goods and services, especially for the middle class.Meanwhile, the Economic Survey presented in Parliament on Friday projected India’s economic growth to be between 6.3 per cent and 6.8 per cent for the financial year 2025-26.The survey said that India's economic fundamentals remain stable due to a strong external account, fiscal discipline, and private consumption. It also mentioned that the government plans to support long-term industrial growth by focusing on research and development (R&D), micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and capital goods.""The fundamentals of the domestic economy remain robust, with a strong external account, calibrated fiscal consolidation and stable private consumption. On balance of these considerations, we expect that the growth in FY26 would be between 6.3 and 6.8 per cent,"" the survey stated.The survey also noted that food inflation is expected to decrease in the last quarter of FY25 due to lower vegetable prices and the arrival of the Kharif harvest. A good Rabi harvest may help control food prices in early FY26. However, inflation risks remain due to uncertain weather and rising global agricultural prices.",The Budget for the financial year starting April 2025 (FY2025-26) was the 14th consecutive Budget under the Narendra Modi government since 2014.

What FM Nirmala Sitharaman said on Income Tax Slabs

“Democracy, Demography and Demand are the key support pillars in our journey towards Viksit Bharat. The middle class provides strength for India’s growth. This Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi has always believed in the admirable energy and ability of the middle class in nation building,” Sitharaman said.

There will be no income tax payable upto income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000.

Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 New versus Old Income Tax Regime: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has given the middle class, common man and salaried taxpayers a big income tax relief bonanza in the Union Budget 2025. With no income tax burden for income levels up to Rs 12.75 lakh, a big section of the middle class has found reason to cheer.All the changes in the income tax slabs and income tax rates for financial year 2025-26 have been brought in the new income tax regime. Hence, the most important question that is there in the minds of salaried income taxpayers is - after Budget 2025 which income tax regime is better for me? Is it time to switch to the new income tax regime or does the old income tax regime with higher tax exemptions and deductions still make sense? TOI answers this important question for you:According to EY, the simple thumb rule that every salaried taxpayer needs to follow is: calculate the total exemptions and deductions that you want to claim in a year under the old income tax regime.Also Read | Union Budget: No income tax up to Rs 12 lakh - a simple guide to what it actually means for taxpayers If the gross income is more than Rs 24.75 lakh, then a salaried individual is better off taking the new income regime only if the deductions and exemptions (Deductions and exemptions which are not allowed under the new tax regime) are less than Rs 8 lakh (excluding standard deduction).It is important to note that this threshold or break-even level of Rs 8 lakh is specific to the 30% tax bracket, that is for income above Rs 24 lakh or Rs 24.75 lakh (including standard deduction). This break-even level will vary for income levels below Rs 24 lakh, as is evident from the table below where specific examples have been given for gross salary levels of Rs 14 lakh, Rs 18 lakh and Rs 22 lakh.Also Check | Income Tax Slabs 2025-26 Budget 2025 Live Updates “The finance minister has proposed reforms to personal taxes with special focus on middle-class tax payers. While there are limited exemptions available under the new tax regime, taxpayers with a gross income exceeding Rs 24.75 lakhs will find the new tax regime beneficial if their total deductions and exemptions, such as those under Section 80C for specified savings, Section 80D for medical insurance, interest on education loan, donations, HRA exemption, and home loan interest under Section 24, which are not available in the new regime, are less than Rs 8,00,000,” explains Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India.“Therefore, when choosing between the old and new tax regimes, it is crucial for taxpayers to carefully compare their deductions and exemptions eligible under the old tax regime with the potential tax savings offered by the lower rates being proposed in the new tax regime,” she says.","New Vs Old Income Tax Regime: Which one should salaried taxpayers opt for post Budget 2025?

Microsoft layoffs go ‘harder’: Termination ‘effective immediately’ with no severance pay and …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-layoffs-go-harder-termination-effective-immediately-with-no-severance-pay-and-/articleshow/117781629.cms,"Poll Should Companies Provide Severance Pay to Laid-Off Employees? No, It's Not Necessary Yes, It's Important for Supporting Employees

Microsoft has initiated a wave of performance-based job cuts , with impacted employees losing their jobs effective immediately and receiving no severance packages, according to termination letters sent to staff.The termination letters, obtained by Business Insider , state that employees are being let go because their ""job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations"" for their positions.Impacted workers face immediate removal of access to Microsoft systems, accounts, and buildings.In a particularly strict measure, the company is discontinuing healthcare, prescription, and dental benefits for employees on their final day of work. Three terminated employees confirmed that they would not receive severance payments, underscoring the company’s more stringent approach to performance management.""You are relieved of all job duties effective immediately,"" the termination letters state, requiring employees to return all company property, including cardkeys, corporate American Express cards, and any Microsoft hardware or software in their possession.The letters also warn that future employment applications to Microsoft will be evaluated considering ""past performance and basis of termination,"" potentially affecting former employees' chances of returning to the company.A Microsoft spokesperson defended the company's actions, stating, ""At Microsoft we focus on high performance talent. We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action.""The performance-based cuts are occurring alongside separate layoffs across multiple divisions, including Security, Experiences and Devices, sales, and gaming. However, the company maintains that these performance-related terminations may not significantly impact overall headcount, as Microsoft often backfills these positions.The company, which employed approximately 228,000 full-time workers as of June, requires terminated employees to permanently delete any company materials stored on personal devices and uphold their Microsoft Employee Agreement regarding the protection of confidential information after employment ends.","Microsoft has initiated a wave of performance-based job cuts.
