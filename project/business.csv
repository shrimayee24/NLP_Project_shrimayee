NEW DELHI: Just three days after Jagdeep Dhankhar created a flutter by quitting as vice president on health grounds, political circles appear to have settled into its ""business-as-usual"" rhythm. As govt and opposition trade volleys over a whole range of issues, with the usual routine of ""disruptions"" in Parliament proceedings thrown in, few seem to be lamenting the absence of the loquacious former Rajya Sabha chairman.The anger in the governing quarters with him for accepting opposition-sponsored motions for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma has given way to preoccupation with who gets to succeed him as VP. Opposition, even as it leverages the dramatic episode to seek to embarrass the government, is not mourning his abrupt exit, leaving the former VP marooned in a political no man's land.At an informal meeting of INDIA bloc parties, Rahul Gandhi and other participants are known to have argued with Dhankhar, who allegedly ""tormented"" them during his three year-tenure by his ""partisanship"".As they agitate over revision of electoral rolls in Bihar, the former VP hardly seems to be a hot priority for Parliament's monsoon session, relegating the resignation saga to the bottom of their list of priorities with a handful of opposition members being sympathetic to him.NDA parties have maintained, barring PM Narendra Modi's curt post on X, a ""radio silence"" over Dhankhar's impending departure from the Vice President's Enclave. They did not even share PM Modi's "" Dhankhar ji has got many opportunities to serve the country in various capacities, including as vice president of India. Wishing him good health"", X post.While govt officials are exploring a Type-VIII bungalow to shift Dhankhar, the developments preceding his resignation suggest that he was left with no choice but to quit as BJP and its allies were preparing to bring a no-confidence motion against him a day after he accepted the notice against Justice Varma signed by 63 opposition MPs.Sources said that the way Dhankhar accepted opposition's notice against Justice Varma even after govt had decided to bring the motion in LS with the signature of members from all parties, top members of the governing alliance were perturbed and angry and responded to the ""betrayal"" by rushing to collect signatures of MPs in the Parliament office of defence minister Rajnath Singh to bring a no-confidence motion against Dhankhar in Rajya Sabha the next day. no confidence motion against the VP can be passed with a simple majority and NDA has more than the required numbers.Sources suggested a message was conveyed to Dhankhar by an RS secretariat functionary Monday that ""either quit immediately, else face no confidence motion next day."" Instead of confronting, Dhankhar reached the Rashtrapati Bhawan, handed over his resignation letter to President Droupadi Murmu and made it public through a post on X.After accepting opposition MPs' signed letter against Justice Varma and passing a ruling from the chair, Dhankhar had become ""inaccessible"" to the senior government functionaries who tried to reach him, leading them to to skip the evening BAC meeting.Sources said the notice of LS MPs seeking removal of Justice Varma was given to speaker Om Birla by a delegation of MPs led by senior BJP functionary Ravi Shankar Prasad, who scrambled after getting to know that Dhankhar had opened channels with the opposition MPs seeking a notice in the case from them.","Political circles appear to have settled into its ""business-as-usual"" rhythm.

"Age of consent for sex cannot be less than 18 years, Centre tells SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/age-of-consent-for-sex-cannot-be-less-than-18-years-centre-tells-sc/articleshow/122889794.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union government has told Supreme Court that the age of consent for sex cannot be lowered from 18 years, as it is meant to protect minors from sexual abuse, often by relatives, but conceded that judicial discretion can be exercised on a case-by-case basis in instances of adolescent romantic and physical relationships.""The statutory age of consent fixed at 18 years must be strictly and uniformly enforced. Any departure from this standard, even in the name of reform or adolescent autonomy, would amount to rolling back decades of progress in child protection law, and undermine the deterrent character of laws like Pocso Act , 2012, and BNS,"" it said.Centre said the constitutional framework unequivocally supported the legal presumption that a person below 18 years of age was incapable of giving valid and informed consent to sexual activity. ""Loosening age-based protections could open avenues for abuse (rape) under the guise of consensual (sexual) activity,"" it said.In a comprehensive written submission settled by additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, the Centre detailed how the age of consent increased from 10 years in Indian Penal Code, 1860; to 12 years under the Age of Consent Act, 1891; 14 years in an amendment to IPC in 1925 and Sharda Act (Child Marriage Restraint law) of 1929; to 16 years in a 1940 amendment to IPC and 18 years in 1978 through amendment to Child Marriage Restraint Act which has remained in force till date.""The age of consent under Indian law, fixed at 18 years, represents a carefully considered legislative choice aimed at creating a non-negotiable protective framework for children. This flows from the inherent protection provided to children envisaged under the Constitution of India,"" govt said.It added that the judiciary, on a case-by-case basis, could exercise discretion, including the close-in-age exception for those nearing 18 years and engaged in adolescence romance. ""The legislative framework governing child sexual offences, particularly under Pocso Act, 2012, is premised not only on the vulnerability of the child due to age, but also on the recognition that a majority of such offences are committed by persons within the child's immediate environment of trust, including family members, neighbours, caregivers and teachers. Such perpetrators have a strong influence on the authority and agency of the minors,"" Centre said.It said data collated by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and NGOs like Save the Children and HAQ Centre for Child Rights, indicated that over 50% of sexual offences against children were perpetrated by persons known to the child or those who were trusted by the minors.Lowering the age of consent from 18 years, under the guise of adolescent romance, would be legally unsound and provide a defence to the abusers, who exploit the minor's emotional dependence or silence, govt said.""A child's inability to report or resist is exacerbated when the perpetrator is a parent or close family member. In such cases, presenting 'consent' as a defence only victimises the child, shifts the blame onto them, and undermines the very object of Pocso Act to protect children from exploitation regardless of whether they were 'willing,"" it said.Govt said the existing age of consent (18 years) must not be tinkered with by the court as it was specified in several legislations to ""protect the bodily integrity of children and uphold the constitutional and statutory safeguards accorded to them"".",Union government tells Supreme Court that the age of consent for sex cannot be lowered from 18 years.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented a tree sapling to King Charles III during a visit to the monarch’s Sandringham Estate on Thursday, as part of his “Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam” initiative promoting environmental consciousness in tribute to mothers.The Buckingham Palace confirmed the meeting in a statement, noting that “during their time together, His Majesty was given a tree to be planted this Autumn, inspired by the environmental initiative launched by the Prime Minister.”Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the sapling will be planted on the estate during the upcoming planting season. The gifted tree, a Davidia involucrata ‘Sonoma’, commonly known as the Sonoma dove tree, is an ornamental species admired for its early and abundant flowering. Its distinctive white bracts resemble fluttering handkerchiefs or doves, making it a visual spectacle in late spring.PM Modi and King Charles are known to share a long-standing interest in holistic approaches to environmentalism, with Yoga and Ayurveda expected to have figured in their conversation.The royal audience came after Prime Minister Modi and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer met at Chequers, where the two leaders finalised the much-anticipated India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA).The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) aims to boost bilateral trade and investment.“At Chequers, PM Keir Starmer and I saw an exhibition which gave a glimpse of the strong economic linkages between India and the UK.

"India develops personnel sphere, completes welding on submersible after 700 trials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-develops-personnel-sphere-completes-welding-on-submersible-after-700-trials/articleshow/122867246.cms,"MATSYA-6000

NEW DELHI: In a landmark achievement for India’s Deep Ocean Mission, Isro has successfully developed the personnel sphere for the submersible vessel MATSYA-6000, designed to carry humans up to 6,000 metres (6km) below the ocean surface, by completing a critical welding process after 700 weld trials.‘Samudrayaan', a project under the Deep Ocean Mission of the ministry of earth sciences (MoES), aims to strengthen India’s capabilities in deep-sea exploration. The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), under MoES, collaborated with Isro’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) to design and fabricate the spherical crew compartment. The Deep Ocean mission will allow scientists to explore unexplored deep-sea areas, assess mineral resources like nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements, and study marine biodiversity. The mission is expected to be realised by 2026.Central to the Samudrayaan effort is the creation of a human occupied vehicle (HOV) that can withstand extreme pressure and temperature conditions on the seafloor. “At the heart of the HOV is a titanium personnel sphere, a 2,260mm diameter enclosure with 80mm thick walls, made from a high-strength alloy. Designed by VSSC, the sphere is built to endure pressure up to 600 bar and temperatures as low as -3°C,” Isro said Wednesday.One of the biggest challenges scientists faced in creating this weld lay in the properties of titanium as a metal. While titanium is known for its strength, it can be difficult to weld. The technical challenge was developing a reliable electron beam welding process capable of fusing thick (80-102 mm) titanium plates. Isro’s Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Bengaluru, took charge of augmenting its welding facility from a 15kW to a 40kW EBW capacity.LPSC developed the process and infrastructure for the welding process and non-destructive evaluation (NDE). While LPSC had the expertise to carry out welding up to 20mm thickness, it augmented the EBW machine from a 15kW rating to 40kW, while also making alterations to the chemical cleaning and handling equipment to accommodate the increased size and mass.Over 700 weld trials were conducted to optimise the process parameters, ensuring high quality and structural integrity. For quality assurance, Isro enhanced its X-ray radiography capability, one of the highest energy levels used in India, allowing detailed non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of the welded joints.The breakthrough came with the successful completion of the first high-penetration weld on the actual sphere hardware. This involved 80mm thick welds over a 7,100mm length, achieved in a continuous 32-minute operation, “a national first in scale and precision” as per Isro.The milestone marks a significant leap for India’s underwater exploration ambitions and brings Matsya-6000 closer to sea trials. Once complete, the vehicle will be among the very few human submersibles in the world capable of reaching such depths, opening new frontiers for deep sea science, resource exploration and technology development.","Isro has successfully developed the personnel sphere for the submersible vessel MATSYA-6000.

Vision 2035 Key Points



Growth and jobs in the UK and India, building on the ambitious trade deal

Develop cutting-edge Technology and Research, building on the India-UK Technology Security Initiative, focused on AI and critical minerals, semiconductors

Counter terrorism, radicalisation and violent extremism; combat financing of terrorism and the cross-border movement of terrorists

Commitment to strengthen the rules-based, non-discriminatory, fair, open, inclusive, equitable and transparent multilateral trading system

Adoption of 10-year defence roadmap; developing new capabilities, including in underwater systems and direct energy weapons

Focus on reform of UNSC and other multilateral bodies like IMF, World Bank, WTO and WHO

PM Narendra Modi strongly raised issues like the need to shun double standards on terrorism, presence of Indian economic offenders in the UK and Khalistan extremism in his meeting with counterpart Keir Starmer, saying those who use democratic freedom to undermine democracy must be held accountable.Thanking Starmer for his strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terrorist attack, Modi said that the 2 leaders were united in their view that there can be no place for double standards in the fight against terrorism.While the formalisation of India-UK free trade agreement was the highlight of Modi’s visit to the UK, another significant takeaway was the launch of a Vision 2035 roadmap for boosting ties in areas like defence, technology, education, clean energy and people-to-people contacts. The leaders adopted a blueprint for defence industrial cooperation to promote, as the Indian government said, collaboration in co-design, co-development and co-production of defence products to meet the growing demand in both countries as well as for the world market.On the issue of Khalistan extremism, which he was expected to raise with Starmer, Modi said there was agreement between India and the UK that forces with extremist ideologies must not be allowed to misuse democratic freedoms.“Those who misuse democratic freedoms to undermine democracy itself must be held to account,” said the PM, in his joint press statement with the UK PM.“On the matter of extradition of economic offenders as well, our agencies will continue to work together in close coordination and cooperation,” added Modi, who sought the UK’s cooperation in bringing the fugitives to justice. India and the UK also reached an agreement between the CBI and the UK’s National Crime Agency to jointly fight organised crime.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said that the leaders committed to strengthen the global fight against terrorism. “While noting that extremism and radicalisation pose threat to both societies, they agreed to further enhance bilateral cooperation to deal with the menace,” said the official.While talking about the 2035 roadmap, Modi drew a cricket analogy to say that while there may be a swing and a miss at times, India always plays with a straight bat and is committed to building a high scoring solid partnership. “The agreements concluded today, along with our Vision 2035, are milestones that carry forward this very spirit,”Modi said that Vision 2035 will serve as a roadmap for a strong, trusted, and ambitious partnership in the areas of technology, defence, climate, education, and people-to-people connectivity. “It is our commitment that, from AI to critical minerals, Semiconductors to Cyber Security, we shall create the future together,” he said, while inviting Starmer to visit India soon. Starmer accepted the invitation. Amid concerns over the erratic US trade policies, both sides also sought to promote a fair, non-discriminatory and inclusive trading system.According to the roadmap, India and the UK reaffirmed their shared commitment to a rules-based international order and to strengthening multilateralism through meaningful reform. Importantly for India, the roadmap focuses on reform of the United Nations, including the Security Council, and other multilateral institutions such as the Commonwealth, WTO, WHO, IMF, and the World Bank, ensuring these bodies “reflect contemporary global realities and are equipped to address emerging challenges”.","India, UK unveil road map to boost defence, tech, energy ties.

The court reserved its order on notice for July 31.ED, which recently filed a chargesheet against Vadra and others in the case, submitted that the evidence conclusively established that the offence is of money laundering, where proceeds of crime are generated, layered and enjoyed. The agency said they had shown funds flow, property and statements of witnesses.The land deal in question was executed in Feb 2008, when a Congress govt led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda was at the helm in Haryana.Special counsel Zoheb Hosain, who appeared for ED through video-conferencing, submitted that the investigation found false declarations were made in the land deal. Skylight Hospitality, a firm in which Vadra held 99% shares, purchased land measuring 3.5 acres worth crores of rupees.The sale deed falsely declared that Rs 7.5 crore had been paid, when in reality no payment was made as the cheque was never cashed. The money was paid at a later stage to avoid stamp duty, and this was corroborated by key witnesses, the counsel submitted.The land was later sold to DLF for a higher amount, and this aspect was still being scrutinised, ED told the court. The central probe agency further argued that money laundering and enjoyment of proceeds of crime continued even today.The ED chargesheet, filed on July 17, names 11 individuals and entities as accused, including Vadra, his company Skylight Hospitality, Onkareshwar Properties — which sold the land to Vadra’s firm — and its promoters/directors Satyanand Yajee & K S Virk.",ED: It’s a ‘clear and classic case of money laundering’ as proceeds of crime were used to acquire immovable properties.

NEW DELHI: Early on Thursday, the ED swooped in on more than 35 premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani and at least 50 entities associated with his Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) across Mumbai in a larger money laundering investigation targeted at him based on multiple FIRs registered by CBI and other agencies over the last few years. The searches have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off.The searches at premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off, including outside the country, through ""undisclosed foreign bank accounts and foreign assets"" created over the years. A large chunk of the money came to Reliance ADAG from SBI and other public sector banks, besides Yes Bank, then a private entity, and mutual funds.Preliminary investigation has thrown up a mysterious entity: 'C Company'. The entity, whose existence was not known so far, is allegedly found to have been involved in related party transactions in this whole scam, sources said.Sources said ED was probing an alleged loan fraud ofRs 14,000 crore involving Reliance Communications Ltd and other associated entities. In response to a question in Lok Sabha on Monday, minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said SBI has ""classified Reliance Communications Ltd along with promoter director Anil Ambani as 'fraud' on June 13"".This has also been communicated to Bombay Stock Exchange.""Based on information received from Sebi, ED has found Reliance Infra has diverted large sums of money disguised as ICDs to group companies of ADAG (Anil Ambani group) through 'C Company', an undisclosed related company,"" a source told TOI.Reliance Infra did not disclose 'C Company' as its related party in order to avoid having to take proper approval from shareholder and audit committees, the source added. It was also hidden presumably to circumvent checks and balances imposed on related party transactions as per laws.Besides, there is an investigation in the alleged diversion of loans of over Rs 10,000 crore by Reliance Infra. ED's probe is looking at why Reliance Infra took a haircut of Rs 5,480 crore, receiving only Rs 4 crore in cash, while agreeing to settle the remaining Rs 6,499 crore through transfer to certain discoms, which have neither been operational nor done business for many years.The agency is already probing Ambani and his entities in a case of Rs 3,000 crore received from Yes Bank where he is alleged to have bribed the former CEO of the bank, Rana Kapoor, through his wife's company for Rs 225 crore. In another case of alleged misappropriation of bank funds, the agency is probing Reliance Communications for a loan default ofRs 1,050 crore to Canara Bank.Sources said more than 25 individuals, including Ambani and his close associates, are targets of the search operations which started on Thursday morning in a probe initiated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.ED is being assisted by multiple agencies, including National Housing Bank, Sebi, National Financial Reporting Authority and Bank of Baroda among others.The alleged loan diversion of around Rs 3,000 crore from Yes Bank pertains to the period between 2017 and 2019. ED is investigating alleged quid pro quo in sanction of loan as a Reliance Anil Ambani entity had transferredRs 225 crore into the accounts of RAB Enterprises, in which Rana Kapoor's wife Bindu Kapoor had 100% stake.These are all part of an FIR registered by CBI and now being investigated by ED. The FIR also alleged that credit approval memorandums were back dated, and the proposed investments lacked due diligence, not meeting the bank's credit policy.Sources said preliminary investigation found that these loans were diverted to many group entities and shell companies, in many cases there was no proper documentation to loans issued.

UK pact comes amid tariff turmoil created by Trump

LONDON/NEW DELHI: More than three years after they began negotiations, and amid intense uncertainty in the global trade ecosystem, India and the UK finally signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, which slashes duties on both sides. It also makes it more predictable for investors and business workers to get visas, and allows access for audit and accounting firms in the two countries as part of efforts to more than double bilateral trade from the current $56 billion by 2030.Consumers can look forward to cheaper British-made cars, cosmetics, medical devices and Scotch, as govt has agreed to slash average tariffs from 15% to 3%. The zero duty import list also includes silver - the largest item in the UK's export basket ($2.1 billion last fiscal). But all the changes won't happen overnight, with some duty cuts planned over 10 years, allowing Indian industry time to adjust.In return, govt got the UK to allow zero duty import on 99% of product lines. ""This is more than just an economic partnership; it is also a blueprint for shared prosperity. It paves the way for enhanced market access in the UK for Indian textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery, seafood, and engineering goods. It will also unlock new opportunities for India's agricultural produce and processed food industry. Above all, this agreement will be especially beneficial for India's youth, farmers, fishermen, and the MSME sector,"" PM Modi said.Govt has, however, managed to keep several agricultural products such as oats, apples, edible oil and sensitive seeds, as well as dairy outside the ambit of tariff reduction.""We're living through a new and more dangerous global era... we believe building stronger partnerships is the best response... today we are confirming this approach in our new deal with India - the biggest and most economically significant trade deal for the UK since leaving the EU,"" said British PM Keir Starmer.The India-UK trade agreement, announced on May 6, but formalised at Chequers, the official country residence of British PM, came amid tariff turmoil caused by US President Donald Trump's moves, prompting countries to not just rush to Washington to strike deals but also speed up negotiations on other treaties.India is ready to roll out treaty with European Free Trade Association, comprising Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, from Oct, while seeking to finalise the agreement with EU after 18 long years of talks. FTAs with New Zealand, Oman and several other countries are in the pipeline. But the CETA with the UK is unlikely to be implemented for at least a year as it requires British legislative approval.The pact with the UK, which was in the making for three-and-a-half years, required significant give-and-take, with India managing to keep a bilateral investment treaty out of the current deal, just as the UK did not agree to carve-outs on carbon tax for Indian products.India also claimed victory in getting a more predictable visa regime for business and professional visitors, but the bigger gain is in the form of a Double Contribution Convention, which will ensure that Indian workers in the UK for up to three years do not have to contribute to the National Insurance (NI) system there, while also seeing deductions towards Employees' Provident Fund Organisation. But it did offer some major concessions. Trade research body GTRI argued that govt's promise for ""adequate remuneration"" to patent holders when compulsory licensing provisions are invoked risks delays.In addition, govt opened an estimated 40,000 central contracts above a certain value to UK businesses, who would be granted local contractor status with 20% or more domestic content.","India and the UK have signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.

NEW DELHI: Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost India's tiny 1.9% share of UK imports. The new trade pact promises zero- or near-zero tariffs on textiles, leather and footwear, engineering goods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals - relief the government says will make Indian exports far more competitive.Government said 99% items of trade (called tariff lines), comprising 100% of India's exports, are covered in the deal.In textiles, for instance, there are 1,143 items on which zero-duty market access will be provided to Indian goods, blunting the duty advantage that Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan have so far enjoyed. So, readymade garments or home textiles, carpets, handicrafts and traditional items such as pashmina shawls or Kanchipuram or bandhini sarees are expected to gain. India is fourth-largest textile supplier to UK, accounting for over 6% of imports.Government officials said India hopes to outperform competitors such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Turkey and Bangladesh in the footwear market, especially athleisure and sports shoes, in addition to Vellore and Kolhapuri chappals and traditional leather shoes. In recent years, several large sports shoe manufacturers have tied up with Indian producers to make footwear for brands like Puma, Adidas and New Balance for domestic and global markets.There are sectors where India has a large presence in other markets but a limited share of the British market. Indian exporters hope to replace competitors across a variety of engineering goods, including machinery and components, where zero-duty access will be provided to 1,659 items. With exports of $4.3 billion, India holds a small share of the $194 billion machinery imports by British businesses. Govt is projecting to double the value of exports by March 2030.India also has a small share in UK's pharma imports - only $1 billion out of $30 billion in 2024. The govt is eyeing gains in not just generics but also medical devices such as ECG machines and X-ray systems.For chemicals, where India's exports to UK were $570 million last year, the government is betting on a 30-40% jump in the first year itself as over 1,200 chemicals will be given duty-free access. Businesses are eyeing an opportunity in gems and jewellery sector, where exports are now pegged at $940 million.Although government has maintained that it has not opened several critical agricultural sectors such as dairy, apples, edible oil and oats under the Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement, it hopes to push Indian grapes, processed food, bakery items and marine products into UK supermarkets.A lot of the market access in these segments will also depend on the quality standards that the UK puts in place and also other trade deals that it enters into in the coming months.","Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost India's tiny 1.9% share of UK imports.

NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated duty cuts for Scotch and gin is not happening overnight. While import duty will come down from 150% to 75%, it is unlikely to happen until at least the second half of 2035.That's because the agreement will take at least a year to be ratified by the British Parliament and there is a gradual tariff reduction roadmap starting with duties in India dropping to 110% in the first year of implementation. The UK government said customs duty will reduce to 40% over the next decade.What's more, govt has got the UK to agree to a minimum import price which means, whisky, gin or any other drink that costs under $5 in a one litre bottle or $6 in a 750 ml bottle will get the tariff benefit and the MIP will be indexed to inflation.However, industry officials say that despite halving import duty, the actual reduction of consumer prices will not be more than 10%. ""The share of customs duty to the overall structure of MRP is hardly 15-20%, depending on the category. The rest comprises state govrnment taxes, and distribution margins. So actual consumer prices will come down by only 8-10%,"" an official said.The reduction in import duty will be a benefit for manufacturers of Indian Made Foreign Liquor.Around 80% of imported scotch is in bulk form, which is used for bottling in India and for blending by local whisky brands.But the industry cheered the move. Sanjit Padhi, CEO of International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI), said the agreement paves the way for a more balanced and equitable trade environment, particularly as Indian alcohol exports to the UK have zero import duties.""We laud the Indian and British governments for formalising this historic treaty which will boost bilateral trade and positively impact the accessibility of premium Scotch whisky in India, reigniting growth and increased choice for Indian consumers,"" Praveen Someshwar, MD and CEO of Diageo India, said.","The much-anticipated duty cuts for Scotch and gin is not happening overnight.

NEW DELHI: Government has agreed to cut tariffs on thousands of products imported from UK - from chocolates and cosmetics to cars, silver and Scotch - but reduction and elimination of customs duties will not translate into the entire benefit being passed on to consumers.To begin with, customs duty is only the basic cost of the landed price for an Indian seller. On top of that are local levies - GST or excise - which even an Indian manufacturer has to pay. And, this can be a significant portion of the final price.Take the case of alcohol, for instance, where the landed price of a bottle of the popular Johnnie Walker Black Label is estimated at around Rs 350, which at 150% customs duty sees a levy of Rs 525. On top of that, there is a 200% margin for the importer, the company, in most cases - which means an addition of around Rs 750 - taking the landed price to Rs 1,275. Then comes excise of 85% or Rs 1,084 and VAT of 25% (Rs 590), taking the wholesale price to Rs 2,950. Then comes the retail margin, pushing the cost in a market like Delhi to over Rs 3,000 a bottle.The actual price reduction for a customer will only be Rs 200-300 a bottle, a top industry executive told TOI while predicting a higher margin for companies.That's especially true for Made-in-India whisky, which blend anywhere between 1% and 25-30% Scotch imported in bulk form. ""Going forward, for several MNCs operating in India, bottling in India may not be a great idea and they will simply import bottles of blended whisky,"" the source said.A similar situation is likely to play out in other sectors such as cosmetics too, where companies will see improved margins, said marketing executives. There is no mechanism for govt to ensure the full benefit is passed on. Although it tried to ensure the window is no longer available under GST and in any case, companies dragged authorities to court, questioning the calculations.In segments such as automobiles, competition from players will drive pricing behaviour, as will other trade agreements. For instance, with the EU deal in the pipeline, a German carmaker or Tesla may just lower domestic prices significantly to grab a bigger pie of the market.With duty reduction in several segments staggered over 10 years, price cuts are not on the immediate horizon.","Customs duty is only the basic cost of the landed price for an Indian seller.

NEW DELHI: India finally relaxed its highly-controlled duty rates on imported cars with the UK trade deal paving the way for customs charges to come down from the highs of 100%+ to as low as 10%, benefitting ultra-luxury car brands such as Jaguar and Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Aston Martin.However, the government has delayed the import duty concessions when it comes to electrics and other green cars, the measure being initiated to protect the domestic players who are looking to produce high-value clean cars. “There are no concessions given to electrics, hybrids, and hydrogen-powered vehicles in the first five years,” an official said.In petrol and diesel categories, the lower tariffs can be enjoyed for a limited number of vehicles as the government has imposed quotas and limits to protect the domestic makers and also curb mass-scale shipments.For large-engine petrol cars above 3000 cc and diesel cars over 2500 cc — traditionally luxury imports — India has committed to lowering the current 100%+ customs duty to 10% over 15 years, within a quota starting at 10,000 units and rising to 19,000 in year five, according to a review document of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).For mid-sized cars (1500–2500 cc diesel / up to 3000 cc petrol), a 50% in-quota duty applies initially, falling to 10% by year five.Small cars under 1500 cc follow a similar tariff reduction path with a growing quota. “These in-quota vehicles enjoy sharply reduced duties, while out-of-quota imports still face tariffs ranging from 95% to 50%, depending on vehicle size and year,” GTRI said.In electrics, market access has been given mostly in the high price segment of vehicles priced above £80,000 (around Rs 94 lakh). “For vehicles priced below £40,000, no market access provided, ensuring complete protection for the mass-market EV segment in which India seeks global leadership,” the official said.While the duty cuts will happen only once the UK Parliament approves the agreement (possibly by the middle of next year), analysts believe that the duty reduction with the UK may pave the way for similar measures with other countries and trading blocs as well. “This is India’s first-ever auto tariff concession in any FTA, and it’s likely to trigger similar demands from Japan, the EU, South Korea, and the U.S.,” GTRI said.“By year five, up to 37,000 UK-built ICE vehicles could enter India annually at just 10% duty — far below the current base rate of 110%. This creates a preferential entry path for high-end British brands… but also for other UK-based exports. While the measure is capped in volume and spread over 15 years, the policy sets a precedent in opening India’s tightly controlled automobile market to bilateral trade partners—potentially triggering similar demands in future FTAs. ”",India finally relaxed its highly-controlled duty rates on imported cars.

Hulk Hogan and His Family: A Complicated Legacy

What is Hulk Hogan’s Net Worth?

Wrestling icon Hulk Hogan has reportedly passed away at the age of 71. According to TMZ, emergency services were called to his Florida home early Thursday morning following reports of a cardiac arrest. Hogan had recently undergone surgery and was said to have suffered complications.The Hulkster was perhaps the most famous wrestler to ever get inside the ring and was one of the driving forces behind taking the WWE to where it is today. He headlined eight of the first nine WrestleMania events, with his legendary 1988 match against André the Giant drawing an astonishing 33 million viewers on television. With these feats, he brought in a ton of money throughout his career. It is safe to say that Hogan meant to professional wrestling what Babe Ruth was to baseball. However, his personal life was far from ideal. Let’s take a look.Hulk Hogan had a total of three marriages. The WWE legend had two children with his first wife, Linda Hogan—a daughter, Brooke, and a son, Nick. The couple was married from 1983 until their divorce in 2009. Then in 2010, Hogan married Jennifer McDaniel, but their relationship didn't last either, and they separated in 2021.Hogan and his children became widely known in the mid-2000s thanks to the VH1 reality show Hogan Knows Best, which gave fans a glimpse into their everyday lives and his hands-on parenting style. In September 2023, Hogan married once again to Sky Daily, in a small, private ceremony held in Clearwater, Florida.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Hulk Hogan had an estimated net worth of $25 million. This figure includes income from his legendary pro wrestling career, various business ventures, and his high-profile 2016 settlement with Gawker.com. The Gawker lawsuit originally resulted in a $140 million award, but the amount was significantly reduced before taxes, with Hogan reportedly receiving around $31 million in the end.His net worth also reflects the financial hit he took from his 2009 divorce from Linda Hogan. As part of the settlement, he gave up 70% of the couple’s liquid assets, $3 million in cash for property settlements, and 40% ownership in his businesses. In recent years, Hogan earned about $2.5 million annually through his WWE Legends contract, endorsements, and entrepreneurial efforts.In 2012, Hulk Hogan launched his bar and restaurant called Hogan’s Beach Shop, marking his move into the hospitality business. Building on its success, he opened more ventures, including Hogan’s Hangout, a popular spot for fans and tourists. He expanded the Hogan’s Beach brand into retail, opening shops in both Orlando and Clearwater, Florida.Beyond wrestling and business, Hogan also made a name for himself in Hollywood. He appeared in several films, including Rocky III, No Holds Barred, Little Hercules, and Bimini Code. Most recently, he stepped into the beverage industry by launching his own beer brand called The Real American Beer, tapping into his iconic persona and broad fan base.Also read: WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan dies at 71 after reported cardiac arrest","Wrestling icon Hulk Hogan has reportedly passed away at the age of 71.

RFK Jr backs mercury-free flu shots: Vaccine panel splits; global supply may suffer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rfk-jr-backs-mercury-free-flu-shots-vaccine-panel-splits-global-supply-may-suffer/articleshow/122864527.cms,"Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (AP file photo)





US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr on Wednesday signed a recommendation to eliminate thimerosal from all influenza vaccines.Thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative used in vaccines since World War II, has long been criticised by anti-vaccine groups. Kennedy, a known sceptic of vaccine safety standards, said, “After more than two decades of delay, this action fulfills a long-overdue promise to protect our most vulnerable populations from unnecessary mercury exposure. ”The recommendation came from the advisory committee on immunisation practices (ACIP), following a 26 June meeting where the majority voted against allowing any flu vaccines to contain thimerosal. The proposal was introduced by Lyn Redwood, former head of children’s health defence, an anti-vaccine group Kennedy himself founded.However, not everyone on the panel agreed. Dr Cody Meissner was the only ACIP member to oppose the decision. He argued there is no scientific evidence that thimerosal caused harm and warned that banning it could increase costs and reduce vaccine access, especially in countries that still rely on preserved vaccine stock.According to the centers for disease control and prevention, nearly 96% of flu vaccines in the US are already thimerosal-free for the 2024–2025 season. But FDA continues to back its safety, citing decades of global research. FDA states that “a robust body of peer-reviewed, scientific studies conducted in the United States and countries around the world support the safety of thimerosal-containing vaccines.”While improved manufacturing has made preservatives less necessary, experts say a full ban could hurt international vaccine programmes that still depend on multi-dose vials containing thimerosal.","Thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative used in vaccines since World War II, has long been criticised by anti-vaccine groups.

"'Makes no sense': JD Vance gives H-1B warning to Microsoft, Indians say he's not revealing that....",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/makes-no-sense-jd-vance-gives-h-1b-warning-to-microsoft-indians-say-hes-not-revealing-that-/articleshow/122887840.cms,"JD Vance issued a stern H-1B warning and slammed companies like Microsoft for laying off people while continuing overseas hiring.

'JD Vance is misleading people'







Vice president JD Vance slammed US companies prioritizing H-1Bs instead of giving jobs to Americans and said he does not believe in the bulls**t story that these companies can't find workers in America. Speaking at a bipartisan event co-hosted by the Hill and Valley Forum, Vance questioned the ethics and economic logic behind mass layoffs by companies like Microsoft which is followed by an increase in H-1B applications.This suggests that these companies are laying off Americans and then applying to hire people from overseas.""You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me,"" Vance said.""That displacement and that math worries me a bit. And what the president has said, he said very clearly: We want the very best and the brightest to make America their home. We want them to build great companies and so forth. But I don't want companies to fire 9,000 American workers and then to go and say, 'We can't find workers here in America.' That's a bulls**t story.""Microsoft recently laid off 9,000 employees globally and came under scrutiny for its use of the H-1B visa program. According to several social media claims. Microsoft submitted applications for more than 6,000 H-1B visas since October while they are also laying off so many employees.An Indian-American tech investor reacted to JD Vance's suggestion and said the vice president would not mention that many of the 9,000 laid off employees were H-1Bs too and they got no severance, no safety net and just a 60-day countdown to leave the country.""Microsoft didn’t bring in new foreign workers after laying people off , they renewed visas for long-time employees who’ve been in the U.S. legally for many many years, stuck in green card backlogs. Saying that’s “replacing Americans” is like saying letting a loyal employee stay and renew his visa in the building is the same as hiring someone new off the street. It’s not. It’s just letting them stay in the job they already earned,"" the tech investor wrote.","JD Vance slammed US companies prioritizing H-1Bs instead of giving jobs to Americans.

How did Hulk Hogan respond to the backlash?



WWE icon Hulk Hogan , real name Terry Bollea, passed away Thursday, July 24, at age 71, in Clearwater Beach, Florida. The date marked a haunting coincidence— it was exactly 10 years since the racist audio leak that almost erased his legacy. Once a symbol of professional wrestling’s golden era, Hogan’s final chapter is now intertwined with one of the darkest moments in his career.Hogan’s rise was unmatched. He turned WWE into a household name in the 1980s, riding the wave of “Hulkamania” straight into movies, television, and pop culture immortality. With his 24-inch pythons, red-and-yellow gear, and booming charisma, he was an icon.But in 2015, that image shattered. A leaked recording captured Hogan using racial slurs in a tirade about his daughter’s boyfriend. “I’d rather if she was going to f— some n—er,” he said on tape. “I’d rather have her marry an 8-foot-tall n—er worth a hundred million dollars! Like a basketball player!”WWE quickly severed ties. “WWE terminated its contract with Terry Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan),” the company announced at the time. “WWE is committed to embracing and celebrating individuals from all backgrounds.” Hogan was removed from the Hall of Fame page, his merchandise vanished, and his presence across WWE’s platforms was erased. In his words, it felt like he “never existed.”According to transcripts cited by Marc Lamont Hill, Hogan also referred to fellow wrestler Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson using the n-word and “sambo.”Johnson later addressed the controversy: “I was pretty disappointed with what I heard, like all of us... I had not known the man to be racist.”After the public fallout, Hogan issued a formal apology: “Eight years ago I used offensive language during a conversation. It was unacceptable... and I apologize for having done it. This is not who I am,” Hogan told PEOPLE. On Good Morning America, he broke down. “It was wrong. I’m embarrassed by it,” he told ABC’s Amy Robach, explaining he was unaware he was being recorded and that he had been at the lowest point in his life. “I wanted to kill myself,” he said.Hogan attributed his use of the slur to growing up in a rough South Tampa neighborhood where the word “was just thrown around like it was nothing.” But he pleaded for forgiveness. “Please forgive me. I’m a nice guy... I’m just Terry Bollea. I’m just a normal man.”In the years that followed, Hogan made efforts to rebuild his public image and raise awareness about the consequences of hate speech. Whether those efforts were enough will remain a point of debate.Also Read: WWE icon Hulk Hogan passes away at 71, triggering heartfelt tributes from sports and entertainment giants As news of his passing broke, fans were left grappling with the complex legacy of a man who once embodied American heroism, only to fall victim to his own words.Hogan passed away in Clearwater Beach, Florida, after suffering cardiac arrest.A leaked sex tape captured him using racial slurs, leading to his termination from WWE.He apologized publicly and said he was deeply ashamed, asking fans to forgive him.","Hulk Hogan, real name Terry Bollea, passed away Thursday, July 24, at age 71.

8th Pay Commission: What is the fitment factor; how it may impact salary hike of central government employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/8th-pay-commission-what-is-the-fitment-factor-how-it-may-impact-salary-hike-of-central-government-employees/articleshow/122888330.cms,"8th Pay Commission news:

What is the fitment factor?

Why it matters for take-home pay

When will the 8th Pay Commission be implemented?

As the central government has begun consultations with key stakeholders, including the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Personnel and Training, and state governments, as part of the process to constitute the 8th Central Pay Commission (CPC) to revise pay structures for nearly 50 lakh central government employees and 62 lakh pensioners, attention is now focused on a key component of the salary calculation — the fitment factor.According to an ET report, the fitment factor plays a pivotal role in determining how much a government employee’s basic pay will rise under a new pay commission structure.The fitment factor is a numerical multiplier used to calculate revised salaries. It is applied to the existing basic pay to arrive at the new basic salary under the Pay Commission. A higher fitment factor results in a proportionally higher salary.For example, under the 7th Pay Commission, the fitment factor was 2.57 — meaning the basic pay was increased by 2.57 times to arrive at the new structure. If the 8th Pay Commission recommends a higher figure, the salary hike could range between 30% and 34%, as per initial estimates cited in reports. However there's no official word yet on the new multiplier, any upward revision will significantly impact take-home pay and pension calculations.A higher basic salary also boosts allowances that are linked to it, such as dearness allowance (DA), house rent allowance (HRA), and travel allowances. This means a higher fitment factor not only increases base pay but also enhances total take-home earnings.While there is no official notification yet, in a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said, “Inputs have been sought from major stakeholders, including Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Personnel & Training and from states.” He added that the chairperson and members of the 8th CPC will be appointed once the commission is formally notified.The Union Cabinet had approved the setting up of the 8th Pay Commission in January 2025, aiming to revise the pay structure of nearly 50 lakh central government employees and the allowances of about 65 lakh pensioners, according to a PTI report.Responding to a query on when the revised pay scales would be implemented, Chaudhary clarified: “The implementation would be taken up once the recommendations are made by the 8th CPC and are accepted by the government.”","The fitment factor is a numerical multiplier used to calculate revised salaries.

Judge cites insufficient evidence and inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony



Emotional fallout, public protests, and future implications



FAQs



Q1: Who were the five hockey players acquitted in the sexual assault case?

Q2: What was the main reason for the acquittal?

Q3: Will the players return to the NHL?

Five former Canadian junior hockey players were acquitted of sexual assault charges tied to a 2018 incident in London, Ontario. The judgment, delivered by Justice Maria Carroccia, concluded a lengthy and high-profile trial that had become a national conversation on consent, memory, and the legal threshold for criminal responsibility.After an eight-week trial that captured the attention of the nation, Justice Carroccia found Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote, Alex Formenton, and Carter Hart not guilty. The former Canadian World Junior team members had been accused of sexually assaulting a woman, referred to as EM, in a hotel room following a Hockey Canada gala. Carroccia spent hours detailing her reasoning, underscoring contradictions in EM's testimony, including discrepancies about who bought drinks and conflicting accounts provided to police and Hockey Canada investigators.“She went to great lengths to emphasize how intoxicated she was,” said Justice Carroccia. However, the judge added that surveillance footage and witness testimony did not corroborate the level of impairment EM described. Two videos shown during the trial, one taken without her knowledge, showed EM appearing composed, smiling, and providing verbal consent — though the judge clarified that the videos alone did not legally establish consent under Canadian law.The ruling emphasized the importance of establishing credibility and reliability in a complainant’s account, something the Crown, in the judge’s view, failed to do. “The Crown cannot meet its onus on any of the counts,” she concluded.The courtroom was packed, with additional rooms opened for the overflow crowd. As the not-guilty verdicts were read, visible signs of relief were seen among the players and their families. Yet, outside the courthouse and on social media, a different emotion pulsed — frustration, sorrow, and disbelief.EM did not appear in person but watched the hearing virtually. Her lawyer, Karen Bellehumeur, expressed disappointment: “She’s really never experienced not being believed like this before… She agreed to do everything asked of her by the criminal justice system… yet it was not enough.”Protesters gathered outside with signs in support of EM, warning the outcome could cast a chilling effect on future survivors of sexual assault. One protester stated, “This verdict will influence how sexual assault cases are viewed in Canada for the next decade.”The NHL, where four of the players had active contracts at the time of the charges, reiterated that they remain ineligible to play until the league completes its internal review. Meanwhile, the NHLPA called the eligibility ruling “inconsistent” with standard procedures and advocated for the players’ return.Crown prosecutor Meaghan Cunningham acknowledged the verdict but stood by the complainant: “A successful prosecution is not measured solely by guilty verdicts. Our goal was a fair trial — fair to both EM and the accused.” An appeal is still being considered, with a 30-day window to file.As legal teams retreat and the headlines begin to fade, the emotional and cultural resonance of the case is expected to linger, not just within the hockey community but across the broader conversation on consent and justice.Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote, Alex Formenton, and Carter Hart were acquitted by an Ontario judge.The judge ruled the complainant's testimony lacked sufficient credibility and consistency to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.They remain ineligible pending the NHL’s internal review of the court’s findings.Also Read: Isaac Howard isn’t enough: Edmonton Oilers still active in trade market to give Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl the help they need","Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote, Alex Formenton, and Carter Hart were acquitted by an Ontario judge.

It explicitly bans third‑party “pay‑for‑play” NIL payments to college athletes, while still allowing fair‑market value endorsements from brands.The White House states that booster payments used to recruit athletes threaten competitive balance and siphon resources from smaller sports programs.The order requires athletic departments with $125 million or more in revenue during the 2024‑25 season to expand scholarships and roster spots in women’s and non‑revenue sports.Departments earning between $50 million and $125 million must at least maintain current support, and those below $50 million must not cut opportunities for non‑revenue sports.NCAA President Charlie Baker commented on July 24 at a Washington event, saying the NCAA is open to executive ideas but stressed that real change needs lawmakers: “our focus needs to be on the legislative process.” He supports clearer rules via Congress, not just executive orders.That same day, House committee leaders,Reps. Brett Guthrie, Tim Walberg and Jim Jordan praised the order and said the SCORE Act, a bill to reinforce NIL and antitrust protections, will move forward in the fall session.They stated:The order also told U.S. officials including the Secretaries of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services and the FTC chair to define athlete employment status and use regulatory or legal tools to support stability in college sports. Many legal experts question how much lasting impact the order will have without congressional backing.It bans pay-for-play deals but still allows fair brand endorsements for student-athletes.Yes, it aims to protect and expand scholarships, especially in women’s and non-revenue sports.Yes, the order stops colleges from using third-party money to recruit athletes unfairly.","On July 24, 2025 in Washington, President Donald Trump signed a new executive order.

FAQ’s

Q1: What position will Todd Nelson hold with the Pittsburgh Penguins?

Q2: Why have the Penguins chosen him now?

Q3: Has Todd Nelson coached the big names?

The Pittsburgh Penguins, by and large, excelled on the man advantage, particularly during the Sidney Crosby period. However, a mere 15.3% power-play success rate in 2023-24 put them among the worst in the NHL. It was different last season, and the power play rose to sixth in the league with David Quinn as the assistant coach. Now that he is gone, the brains must have been shifted onto the new assistant, Todd Nelson. The simple question is: can Nelson somehow improve upon what was rebuilt last year and take it a step further?Todd Nelson comes over from Hershey after an unprecedented AHL stint with the Bears and finds the power play with a glittering top-end reputation. His first order of business would be to choose the best defenseman to quarterback the top unit, and with Matt Grzelcyk unlikely to reprise the role, the choices narrow down to Erik Karlsson or Kris Letang. Karlsson boasts perhaps too elité skating and vision but has lagged behind it on the power play in recent times. Letang, on the other hand, has been around the top unit for a long time but has visibly slowed.The coach will have to decide immediately during training camp who is best able to execute the structure of the top unit.His coaching philosophy stresses chemistry, directness, and high puck recovery, which are very important to a productive power-play. At this camp, Nelson stressed simplicity: #1: move the puck quickly; #2, crash the net; and #3, recover rebounds. Actual implementation will go a long way toward providing clearly defined roles and disciplined zone entries.Forward choices are just as important. Through the years, Penguins have experimented sporadically with separating Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin into two different power-play units, but history shows they are at their best when together. Adding the Bryan Rust, Rickard Rakell, or up-and-coming Ville Koivunen variety to the group gives it more options.Last season, Koivunen seemed to have a good grasp of it, in a limited NHL sample, with three power-play points in eight games. His playmaking ability and vision certainly make a case as to why he might see more time in 2025-26. Assuming he is on the roster, he could start on the second unit and push from there for minutes on the first.Also Read: Tyler Motte is still unsigned despite valuable depth and experience Todd Nelson has all the means to take the Penguins' power play one step forward from last year: optimizations of roles and chemistry could breed an elite man advantage in Pittsburgh.Ans: Nelson is set to become an assistant coach, with his main duties being the development of the power play unit.Ans: The Penguins sought to change the dynamics of their special teams by making a change in the coaching staff and bringing in fresh ideas and schemes after missing the playoffs.Ans: Mostly in the AHL, Nelson coached; however, some players are believed to have prospered in the NHL under the systems Nelson had working with them.","Pittsburgh Penguins have hired Todd Nelson as their new assistant coach.

Bengaluru Insect in Food: Rameshwaram Cafe extortion bid: Group accused of staging insect-in-food incident at Bengaluru airport outlet; demanded Rs 25 lakh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/rameshwaram-cafe-claims-extortion-bid-case-filed-after-group-tries-to-blackmail-bengaluru-airport-outlet-with-insect-in-food-video-demanded-rs-25-lakh/articleshow/122892312.cms,"



NEW DELHI: A case has been registered against a group of individuals accused of attempting to extort Rs 25 lakh from the popular Rameshwaram Cafe by allegedly staging a false incident of food contamination at its Kempegowda International Airport outlet in Bengaluru.According to police, the incident took place on the morning of 24 July.According to news agency PTI, a group of five to seven people reportedly caused a public disturbance by claiming that an insect had been found in the food served at the cafe.The complaint, filed by the café’s operations head, alleges that the individuals threatened to release a video of the incident on social media unless they were compensated.Soon after the scene, the team reportedly received a phone call demanding Rs 25 lakh in cash to avoid reputational damage to the brand.The cafe management has submitted call records, message screenshots, and other documents to support their claims and has urged police to take swift legal action.Police say a Zero FIR has been registered under sections 308(2) and 351(4) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), and the case will be transferred to the jurisdiction relevant to the complainant’s address.A Zero FIR allows a complaint to be filed at any police station regardless of the location of the crime.In a statement, Divya Raghav, founder of The Rameshwaram Café, rejected the accusations.“We categorically deny the baseless accusation that a worm or insect was found in our food,” she said. “This is clearly a staged act with malicious intent to extort money and malign our brand.”Ms Raghav said the cafe operates under “the strictest quality protocols” and that food safety, especially at sensitive locations like airports, is non-negotiable.She added that similar extortion attempts had been made in the past.“We will not succumb to intimidation or blackmail,” she said, adding that the company is fully cooperating with authorities and plans to pursue legal action against the alleged perpetrators.","A case has been registered against a group of individuals accused of attempting to extort Rs 25 lakh from the popular Rameshwaram Cafe.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says: 'If I were 20 years old today, I would focus more on this field than software'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-if-i-were-20-years-old-today-i-would-focus-more-on-this-field-than-software/articleshow/122776861.cms,"Jensen Huang's evolving view: from engineering to physical AI

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power.Huang’s vision aligns with growing industry momentum around embodied AI—where intelligence is tied to physical systems like robots or autonomous machines. Leading research labs such as DeepMind and Boston Dynamics are already exploring this frontier, integrating reinforcement learning with robotics to train systems capable of real-world interaction and problem-solving. This convergence of AI with physics and motion is what Huang sees as the next great leap.Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics.

No more beef over beef: Australia to finally take a bite of American meat; 'we are going to sell so much' says Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/no-more-beef-over-beef-australia-to-finally-take-a-bite-of-american-meat-we-are-going-to-sell-so-much-says-donald-trump/articleshow/122893889.cms,"Australians will be finally biting onto American meet burgers and steaks as Canberra has decided to remove the trade barriers obstructing US meat's way into the country.US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) hailed Australia's decision to lift a decades-long ban on American beef as a “historic win” and proof that US produce is the “safest and best in the entire world. ”In a triumphant post on his social media platform, the US president declared, “After many years Australia has agreed to accept American Beef! For a long time, and even though we are great friends, they actually banned our Beef. Now, we are going to sell so much to Australia because this is undeniable and irrefutable Proof that US Beef is the Safest and Best in the entire World.”He further added, “The other Countries that refuse our magnificent Beef are ON NOTICE. All of our Nation’s Ranchers, who are some of the hardest working and most wonderful people, are smiling today, which means I am smiling too. Let’s keep the Hot Streak going. IT’S THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA!”The announcement comes after a spell of strained trade ties between the two allies, during which Trump accused Australia of profiting from beef exports to the US while blocking American meat from entering its own market.In April, during the unveiling of the “Liberation Day” tariffs, he threatened a 10% baseline import duty on Australian goods, further straining ties with Canberra.Responding to the breakthrough, US trade representative Jamieson Greer called the decision a “major milestone” in removing unjust trade barriers, adding that President Trump’s firm stance had “unlocked market access” that had long been denied to American farmers.“Yesterday's decision by Australia marks a major milestone in lowering trade barriers and securing market access for US farmers and ranchers. President Trump is taking decisive action to confront unfair trading practices, and Australia's decision to unlock market access for U.S. beef is a direct result of his leadership,” the ambassador said.Secretary of agriculture Brooke Rollins echoed the sentiment, criticising what she described as “non-scientific trade barriers” and framing the announcement as part of a broader effort to put American agriculture back at the forefront of global trade.“American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world. It's absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years.”Australian officials, for their part, attributed the policy shift to improved quality control measures introduced by US meat producers. Agriculture minister Julie Collins said the updated protocols had addressed Australia’s long-standing biosecurity concerns.Australia has historically enforced strict import rules, including rejecting beef from US cattle born in Mexico or Canada.The move coincides with the 20th anniversary of the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA).A press release from the US government said that over the last two decades, US Trade Representative and department of agriculture have worked tirelessly to secure and uphold American ranchers' access to international beef markets, ensuring they fully benefit from trade agreements.","US President Donald Trump hails Australia's decision to lift a decades-long ban on American beef as a ""historic win"" The announcement comes after a spell of strained trade ties between the two allies.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
