Raja Ravi Varma’s ‘last’ painting caught in ugly ownership row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/raja-ravi-varmas-last-painting-caught-in-ugly-ownership-row/articleshow/128334362.cms,"‘Imminent risk of painting being transferred to gallery in Australia’

NEW DELHI : A rare Raja Ravi Varma painting — by some accounts his last work — is at the centre of a high-stakes legal battle with multiple ownership claims.The painting, ‘Kadambari’, by the 19th-century maestro, is at present in the possession of Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, which assured Delhi high court recently that it is only exhibiting the artefact, being a private museum, and is not going to sell it further.The piece of art, estimated to be worth well over Rs 100 crore, was originally in possession of a Delhi-based art collector, who moved HC alleging that he was “conned” by his close associates into handing it over to them and lost out on a work of immense emotional and cultural value to the country. The associates, he said, sold the painting.In his suit, art collector Mohinder Verma alleged that in 2021 he entrusted the masterpiece to individuals he considered trusted associates, as one of them was also a director in Verma’s company. However, they first tricked him into accepting advance payment of Rs 3 crore in pounds sterling in London, then tipped off local police, resulting in him being jailed abroad.Taking advantage of his incarceration, the people he entrusted with the painting for safekeeping and restoration, with the explicit understanding that no further action could be taken without his express approval, sold the artwork through a web of intermediaries.The suit claimed the painting ended up at a public auction conducted by Saffronart, where the work was acquired by the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA) for a substantial sum — all while the original owner remained entirely in the dark.Meanwhile, UK police dropped charges against Verma and he was acquitted. On returning to India, he lodged a complaint with Delhi Police against his associates, resulting in an FIR and a probe.While hearing the suit, Justice Mini Pushkarna asked the parties to first pursue pre-litigation mediation. During the hearing, the defendants told court that Verma’s brother and sister-in-law should also be made party to the suit, as ownership of the painting was being claimed by them.HC agreed and said it is “of the view that the brother and sister-in-law of the plaintiff ought to be before this court”. It asked the duo to also appear before the mediation wing with the other parties.In his suit, Verma explained why he rushed to court, claiming he recently learned that the Queensland Art Gallery, in Brisbane, Australia, is establishing a dedicated section for the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma.“Several prominent art dealers informed the plaintiff that ‘Kadambari’ is intended for permanent display at this gallery, thereby resulting in its removal from India and beyond the territorial jurisdiction of this court. The plaintiff therefore states that there is an imminent risk of the painting being transferred to the Queensland Art Gallery in Brisbane, Australia,” Verma said in his plea.Appearing for the art collector, advocate Giriraj Subramanium contended that those who profit from the commercialisation of art cannot distance themselves from the responsibility of verifying the title and urged the court to hold the intermediaries accountable.With Verma naming auction houses and market intermediaries as defendants in the suit, any decision by HC is likely to impact the longstanding “culture of informality” in the Indian art trade. The suit also highlights that auction houses and buyers must first verify the provenance of the artwork before going further.","The painting, ‘Kadambari’, by the 19th-century maestro, is at present in the possession of Kiran Nadar Museum of Art.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Navy is gearing up to mark a defining moment in India's maritime story as Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25, placing the 'City of Destiny' once again at the heart of India's Indo-Pacific strategy.“The current edition of IFR and MILAN exercise will be larger in scope and deeper in meaning as navies of 72 countries, including US and Russia, will participate and the mega joint naval events will feature over 60 warships and naval aircraft of three countries,” said a Navy source. The IFR will position India’s eastern seaboard as a focal point for naval diplomacy and multilateral maritime engagement. Warships and assets from Germany, Philippines, and UAE are participating for the first time, including the Philippines' ‘BRP Miguel Malvar’ (FFG-06) and a UAE Navy warship, Al Emarat. Since 2001, India has used IFRs and opened its ports to allied navies to project maritime strength, foster international cooperation, and establish its role in blue water operations.The star of Operation Sindoor’s naval leg, aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, is all set to be the centre of attraction at the fleet review. The Vikrant carrier battle group deployed in the northern Arabian Sea, played a key role in the strategy of compellence, thereby forcing the Pakistan Navy to be in a defensive posture and requesting an urgent ceasefire.For the IFR, it will sail to the Bay of Bengal. China and Turkey have not been invited for the event and the decision is reportedly linked to their military support to Pakistan during last year’s conflict in May.President Droupadi Murmu, Governor S Abdul Nazeer and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu will attend the IFR on Feb 18, while defence minister Rajnath Singh will participate in Milan-2026 on Feb 19.MILAN 26 will bring together navies from friendly foreign countries to strengthen professional bonds, share best practices and enhance cooperation at sea. Milan’s sea and harbour phases will focus on interoperability, maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, air defence, and search-and-rescue operations.Significantly, the IFR will coincide with the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium's conclave of chiefs, showcasing India's convening power in a contested region. Beyond the warships at sea, the International City Parade will carry naval camaraderie into the streets, while a high-level maritime seminar will sharpen the intellectual edge of the gathering. These events promise to elevate IFR and MILAN 2026 beyond ritual, transforming them into platforms for strategic dialogue, operational trust and enduring people-to-people engagement.Technology will feature prominently at IFR 2026, but with a clear lesson: technology amplifies capacity, but governance shapes effects. Drones, autonomous surface and subsurface vehicles, and AI-enabled maritime domain awareness tools can multiply the reach of a modest fleet.The fleet review is a time-honoured naval tradition that assembles ships and sailors from friendly foreign navies, serving as a platform for confidence-building, mutual respect, and operational familiarity.end","Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25.

Why stock market crashed today: Top 5 reasons

IT sector stocks crash

Weak global equity markets

Dollar strength, weak rupee

Weak technical set-up

Geopolitical tensions linger

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Stock market crash today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the equity benchmarks, crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff. While Nifty50 went below 25,500, BSE Sensex closed down over 1,000 points. Nifty50 ended the day at 25,471.10, down 336 points or 1.30%. BSE Sensex closed at 82,626.76, down 1,048 points or 1.25%.The stock market slide was led by continued selloff in IT shares which weighed heavily on market sentiment amid rising concerns about disruption driven by artificial intelligence. Large-cap technology stocks such as Infosys, TCS, HCLTech and Wipro led the losses.Selling pressure in IT stocks intensified for a second straight session after the American depositary receipts of Infosys and Wipro dropped nearly 10 percent overnight. During Friday’s trading, the Nifty IT index fell more than 4 percent, taking its two-day decline close to 10 percent. Major sector players including TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, HCLTech and Mphasis declined between 4 and 6 percent, indicating widespread weakness across the segment.Negative sentiment strengthened after US-based artificial intelligence startup Anthropic introduced a new enterprise-oriented tool designed for corporate legal teams.The company, known for its Claude chatbot, said that the platform can automate several tasks such as contract reviews, non-disclosure agreement sorting, compliance processes, preparation of legal briefs and standardised responses. This development has raised concerns about the long-term demand outlook for traditional IT services.“Tech stocks, reeling under the Anthropic shock, are unlikely to recover soon,” warned V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. He added that Indian IT may continue to face pressure in the near term, while a rotation of capital toward stronger-performing sectors could support stocks outside the technology space.Global market sentiment remained fragile after sharp losses on Wall Street on Thursday, driven largely by heavy selling in technology stocks. Investors turned cautious amid growing concerns that artificial intelligence could disrupt earnings visibility and compress margins across the sector.The Nasdaq, which has a high concentration of technology companies, fell around 2 percent, while broader US indices also declined as market participants evaluated fresh labour market data and positioned themselves ahead of the closely monitored January inflation figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 669.42 points, or 1.34 percent, closing at 49,451.98. The S&P 500 slipped 108.71 points, or 1.57 percent, to 6,832.76, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 469.32 points, or 2.03 percent, ending at 22,597.15.Asian equities mirrored the weakness on Friday, pulling back from recent record levels as concerns over profitability pressures in the technology sector weighed on major stocks such as AppleA stronger US dollar, which extended gains for a third consecutive session to 96.93, along with a softer rupee, added to market pressure.The Nifty closed in negative territory on Thursday, slipping out of its recent consolidation range and forming a short-term pattern of lower highs and lower lows. The 26,000 level continues to act as a significant resistance zone, supported by strong call writing activity and multiple failed attempts to move higher.Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East has continued to weigh on investor sentiment after Donald Trump warned that the United States could consider action against Iran if negotiations over a nuclear agreement fail, even as diplomatic efforts remain underway. Adding to market unease, Trump indicated that deploying an additional aircraft carrier to the region is under consideration as Washington and Tehran prepare to restart discussions.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff.

Instagram and small businesses: Visibility, trust and the new storefront

On a busy afternoon in Old Delhi’s Parathe Wali Gali, Darshit Singh held up his phone and did something unusual.He didn’t hype the food.He critiqued it.The reel — an “honest review” of a legacy eatery and Daulat ki Chaat — crossed 7.3 million views. Messages flooded in. Invitations followed. Cities called.That was 2024.Today, Singh calls himself India’s first “food deinfluencer”.Elsewhere, Santosh was boarding a late-night flight after wrapping up a full corporate workday.An IIT-Delhi alumnus by degree and a traveller by instinct, he refuses to choose between spreadsheets and sunsets.“I’m a traveller with a full-time job,” he says — a line that has now become his digital identity.Every month, a new state.Every trip, a vlog.Every journey, proof that passion doesn’t need permission.What once looked like just another viral reel is now part of something bigger — a creator economy projected to be worth thousands of crores, and increasingly recognised in India’s economic blueprint.This year’s Union Budget did something subtle but significant: it placed creativity inside the growth narrative.Welcome to India’s Orange Economy moment.For decades, art, storytelling and digital creation lived in the margins of economic planning — celebrated culturally, rarely counted financially.That is beginning to change.The “Orange Economy” — a term popularised by the Inter-American Development Bank refers to industries that transform ideas into cultural goods and services protected by intellectual property. It includes media, film, music, publishing, animation, gaming, advertising, design, fashion, digital content and now, increasingly, independent creators.In India’s Union Budget 2026–27, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a major push for India’s creative industries — or what is increasingly being called the “Orange Economy.”Presenting the Budget, Sitharaman emphasised that India’s creative and AVGC-XR (Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics and Extended Reality) ecosystem has the potential to generate large-scale employment and position India as a global content hub.The Economic Survey projected that the AVGC sector alone could require up to 2 million skilled professionals by 2030.Sitharaman highlighted that India’s demographic dividend must be aligned with emerging sectors, particularly those driven by digital platforms and intellectual property.At the WAVES summit earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reinforced this direction, describing India as a nation with “a billion-plus stories” and positioning the creative economy as both cultural capital and economic opportunity.India’s creator economy is projected to grow at an 18% compound annual growth rate, rising from Rs 19 billion in 2023 to Rs 34 billion by 2026, according to Ernst & Young.Influencer marketing is defined as “a collaboration between popular social-media users and brands to promote brands’ products or services.”What began as informal brand shoutouts has now evolved into a regulated, data-driven industry.The scale today is substantial. Globally, the influencer marketing economy was valued at $21.1 billion in 2023, having more than doubled since 2019 on the strength of platforms such as Instagram and YouTube.According to ET, the global influencer marketing platform market grew from $6 billion in 2020 to a projected $24.1 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 32%.Forbes highlighted that the broader creator economy is now a $250 billion global force, projected by Goldman Sachs to reach $480 billion by 2027.Statista reports that over 200 million creators operate globally, while social commerce is expected to touch $2.9 trillion by 2026.India’s influencer marketing sector is projected to reach Rs 3,375 crore by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 18%, according to EY’s ‘State of Influencer Marketing in India’ report.Exchange4Media estimates the core influencer market at around Rs 3,600 crore in 2024, projected to reach Rs 4,500 crore in 2025, though insiders suggest the real size may exceed Rs 10,000 crore due to direct brand-creator deals outside conventional tracking.Creator fees rose between 10–30%, while top-tier creators in India reportedly earned between Rs 10–25 crore annually through endorsements, platform monetisation, live events and equity partnerships.Influencers are categorised by follower size:EY observes that marketers leverage both large/macro and micro/nano influencers equally.While mega and macro influencers drive awareness and brand loyalty, micro and nano influencers often deliver stronger engagement and relatability.Regional creators are becoming central to brand strategies. According to Influencer.in (Social Beat), regional creators drive 35–40% better engagement in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Budget allocation for regional creators has increased from 3–10% earlier to 8–20%, with expectations of further growth.The ecosystem is increasingly youth-driven. A 2024 YouTube India–SmithGeiger report found that 83% of Indian Gen Zers consider themselves creators, and 75% see content creation as a genuine career path. More than 55% reported gaining financial independence through digital platforms.As ET highlights, influencer marketing is seen as cost-effective and personalised. Influencers build relatability and directly shape purchase decisions. In fact, 61% of consumers trust recommendations from creators more than traditional brand advertising, according to Sprout Social cited by Forbes.Influencer partnerships typically follow two models:Increasingly, creators are moving beyond endorsements to ownership — launching brands, seeking equity partnerships and building independent revenue streams. Exchange4Media notes a visible shift from “endorser to owner.”From hyper-local memers to pan-India gaming stars, from nano creators in Tier-3 cities to mega influencers earning crores annually, India’s influencer economy is no longer peripheral to marketing. It has become a structured, high-growth pillar of brand strategy — reshaping commerce, culture and consumer trust in the digital age.For creators like Darshit, having a mass following of 51.7K followers, the viral Old Delhi reel was only the beginning. What followed was a clearer understanding of how the influencer economy actually works.“I started making content post-COVID but it was mostly just pictures and a few videos with music. No voiceover,” he says. It was only after that breakout moment in 2024 that he began studying the platform more closely — especially the algorithm.“Instagram is fundamentally different… it thrives on recommendations,” he explains. Unlike platforms that depend heavily on follower count, Instagram pushes reels to users who may never have heard of the creator but are likely to engage. “Someone who has never made a video in their life can come to this platform and make one and get millions of views.”Uploading identical content across YouTube Shorts, Facebook and Threads, Singh says Instagram consistently delivers his highest reach. For him, discovery is not accidental — it is engineered.But growth alone was never the goal. His identity as a “food deinfluencer” is built on resisting what he sees as blind positivity in brand culture.“Our society today has a trust crisis. Be it government, institutions, or media. Everyone is facing that. So for me, my audience’s trust is paramount,” he says. Even in paid collaborations, he critiques dishes he does not like. “I wanna be the reason behind someone’s memorable meal.”His approach reflects a broader shift in marketing strategy. “Earlier brands used to only work with celebrities and movie stars but now they prefer influencers in most cases as the latter gives them higher ROI,” he observes. “Celebrities promoting a product feels like an ad. But some influencers subtly promote the brand in their organic way… audiences are more likely to purchase that product later.”A few kilometres away from Old Delhi’s food lanes, Santosh is planning his next trip — between client calls.Santosh began his creator journey not in airports or mountains but inside hostel rooms. What started as campus vlogs on YouTube, hostel stories, placement anxiety, the reality of being an IIT student slowly built a community of aspirants and peers.Then came Instagram.Reels allowed him to compress entire journeys into seconds — a new state every month, documented between office deadlines. The platform’s real-time engagement — stories, reels, DMs helped him move beyond informational content into something more personal.“You can be discovered without being famous,” he says, pointing to how a few of his travel and IIT reels travelled far beyond his existing follower base.More importantly, he has watched the industry change.“When I started, content creation felt experimental,” Santosh says. “Now brands plan structured budgets. Long-term collaborations. There’s more professionalism.”In his words, the creative economy is no longer informal hustle.It’s recognised work.If the orange economy is the ecosystem and creators are its lifeblood, then Instagram is the marketplace — the digital high street where attention turns into advertising, and creativity converts into commerce.To understand how influencer marketing thrives, it’s important to understand how Instagram itself makes money.Founded in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger as a simple photo-sharing app, Instagram was built on one idea: visuals connect people. What started as a minimalist platform for filtered photos has evolved into a billion-user ecosystem of Stories, Reels, shopping tabs and creator tools.After Meta (then Facebook) acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion, the platform scaled rapidly. Today, Instagram is estimated to be worth around $400 billion, making it one of the most valuable digital assets globally.The engine driving all of this? Advertising.Instagram’s primary revenue model is advertising. What makes Instagram powerful for marketers is its algorithmic precision. Content appears based on user behavior, engagement patterns and interests.The platform’s shift toward short-form video has supercharged engagement. According to a Meta-commissioned IPSOS study:Meta India’s Managing Director Arun Srinivas said: “India is leading the world in video adoption, and Reels is at the center of this shift. Five years since its launch, Reels is India’s leading short-form video platform—driving massive engagement, shaping culture, and delivering real business impact.”Instagram’s model is symbiotic with the influencer economy.While food reels dominate one corner of the ecosystem, knowledge-driven creators are building influence in quieter but equally powerful ways.For Bikramjeet Dutta, having a massive following of 51.9K followers, Instagram’s inflexion point came during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. “I was attending several political rallies, press conferences etc. I started uploading that it started gaining views and followers,” he says.His content extends beyond political coverage into books, geopolitics and history. “Instagram helped me to connect with those who are experts in these fields,” he says, adding that credibility assessment feels more immediate on the platform. “In Instagram it's quite easy to verify whether the person is credible or not.”Discovery, he believes, has fundamentally shifted the opportunity landscape. Posting book reviews led to requests from publishers. Geopolitical commentary brought invitations to panel discussions and book launches. “Yes, Instagram has made it easier for creators to be discovered,” he says.For many small businesses in India, Instagram is no longer just a marketing add-on. It functions as a storefront, catalogue, customer service desk and storytelling space — often all at once.The shift became especially visible during the pandemic. In 2020, Instagram introduced the ‘Support Small Business’ sticker, which grouped Stories using the sticker into a shared feed so “more people can discover more small businesses.”Around the same time, it rolled out features that made it easier to discover gift cards, online food orders and fundraisers, allowing users to tap directly and purchase through partner websites.For Nidhi who runs a handmade chocolate business, Instagram became more than a display window.“Instagram didn’t just become a platform… it became the space where my creativity found its voice,” she says.She explains that unlike other platforms, Instagram allowed her “to connect, not just sell — to share stories, build trust, and grow a community that appreciates handmade details and thoughtful gifting.”Instead of simply listing prices, she moved toward behind-the-scenes reels — melting chocolate, assembling hampers, last-minute packing. The shift from static posts to process-driven video felt “more genuine for the audience.”Another small business owner Harsh in the fabric trade echoes a similar sentiment.“Instagram has played a major role in building our fabric brand identity. Through reels, product videos, and live customer interactions, we showcase our manufacturing quality, fabric textures, and latest collections in a very visual way.”Increased competition, he highlights, has pushed businesses “to become more creative by high-quality reels and by making it more realistic.”In the architecture of the orange economy, small businesses are not just beneficiaries of digital platforms. They are active participants: adapting content, tone and strategy in response to algorithmic culture and rising competition.","In India’s Union Budget 2026–27, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a major push for creative industries. The ‘Orange Economy’ includes media, film, music, publishing, animation, gaming, advertising, design, fashion, digital content and now, increasingly, independent creators.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128293766,imgsize-1386798,width-400,resizemode-4/128293766.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday released the list of countries whose leaders will attend the India–AI Impact Summit 2026, to be held in the national capital next week.The summit, hosted at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is being positioned as the first major global AI gathering in the Global South.The India AI Impact Summit 2026 will take place from February 16 to 20 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi. Leaders, ministers, global CEOs and representatives of international organisations are expected to deliberate on the future of artificial intelligence, its economic impact and governance frameworks.According to the MEA, the following leaders are scheduled to participate:In addition, ministerial delegations from over 45 countries will participate.

Outside the House, however, some of the party MLAs generously praised the chief minister on Friday over his budgetary allocation for the annual Amarnath Yatra “Our CM’s move to allocate Rs 180 crore for Amarnath Yatra is a positive step,” Pawan Gupta, BJP MLA from Udhampur West, said, adding that it “reflects the changing times in Jammu and Kashmir”.Linking govt’s move to a broader sense of political and social transition in the region, Gupta said: “What we want at the end of the day is that Kashmir should join the mainstream, and slowly that is happening. In this Assembly, today you hear legislators saying they are proud Indians. Earlier, we mostly heard about special status.”The MLA said although BJP remained critical of govt on several issues, good and constructive decisions should be acknowledged.In his budget speech last week, Omar said his govt was deeply committed to ensuring the safety, comfort and spiritual experience of pilgrims visiting the holy cave shrine. He proposed to “further modernise pilgrimage infrastructure with an outlay of Rs 180 crore during 2026-27, in partnership with the Border Roads Organization, to improve road connectivity, emergency response systems and logistical support.” The initiative would ensure that the yatra became safer, smoother and more dignified for the pilgrims, he announced.Gupta said the chief minister’s current stance on the Amarnath pilgrimage marked a significant shift from the past. “Earlier, Omar Abdullah had different opinions about the yatra, but now his views have changed. As an Indian, it is my duty to appreciate this change,” he said.BJP legislator Balwant Singh Mankotia, too, appreciated the change in the CM’s approach, recalling in the Assembly how Omar had opposed such measures during the 2008 agitation, when he had stated that “not an inch of land would be given”.Another party MLA, Vikram Randhawa representing Bahu constituency, who had earlier in the day created a ruckus in the House alleging that Kashmiris were illegally settling on land belonging to the Jammu Development Authority, praised the CM for the budgetary allocation for Amarnath Yatra.","BJP members miss no opportunity to corner the Omar Abdullah govt over a host of issues.

GalaxEye’s upcoming spacecraft will be folded into what the founder described as a “virtual constellation”, allowing Nsil to plug data gaps in its current offerings.“Nsil will resell our data. From now on, whatever satellites we launch, Nsil becomes a reseller for that data,” GalaxEye co-founder and CEO Suyash Singh told TOI.The first satellite — “Drishti” — in GalaxEye’s planned 10-satellite constellation is scheduled to leave for launch on Feb 25. The company plans to deploy all 10 spacecraft over the next four years. The current agreement is structured to cover the entire planned constellation, meaning Nsil can distribute data from each satellite as it comes online.In practical terms, Nsil will function as an extended sales arm for the start-up.It will be able to market raw data as well as downstream products built by GalaxEye. The arrangement also allows Nsil to directly sell the satellite data to its own customer base, which includes govt agencies and commercial clients.Drishti, which is expected to launch aboard a SpaceX mission, weighs 160-kg and is pegged to be India’s largest privately built commercial satellite. While GalaxEye, through contracts with Ananth Technologies and XDLINX procured the satellite bus, the firm said the spacecraft will carry its proprietary “SyncFused OptoSAR” technology, combining optical and synthetic aperture radar data on a single platform.About one cubic metre in size with a 3.5-metre deployable antenna, Drishti will offer 1.5-metre resolution imagery and a global revisit time of seven to ten days. The data is aimed at defence, border surveillance, disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, agriculture, and financial risk assessment.GalaxEye has completed around 500 aerial test flights and earlier flew a payload on Isro’s PSLV mission. The structural model was recently tested at Isro’s UR Rao Satellite Centre.The start-up is in discussions with Indian defence and agriculture ministries and has signed letters of intent with partners in over 20 countries. It plans to scale up its future satellites, targeting 0.5-metre resolution in future versions.“With recent geopolitical events increasing, we look forward to providing unparalleled imagery intelligence. We already have interest from defence and security agencies, utilities, agriculture, and financial companies and we are truly excited about the potential of this technology to transform decision-making and operational efficiency across industries,” Singh had earlier told TOI.","Bengaluru-based space start-up GalaxEye has signed a channel partnership agreement with Space PSU NewSpace India Limited.

‘Spoken reputation’ of a judicial officer important to maintain public faith: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spoken-reputation-of-a-judicial-officer-important-to-maintain-public-faith-sc/articleshow/128330928.cms,"‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

NEW DELHI : Taking a hardline stance for improving public faith in the integrity of justice delivery in trial courts, Supreme Court Friday said a district judge’s “spoken reputation” is an important factor for a high court in deciding to give him extension or retire him compulsorily.A Gujarat additional district judge was compulsorily retired in “public interest” in July 2016 on attaining the age of 56 years and nine months based on a report of a committee of three HC judges, who examined service records and recommended premature retirement of 18 judicial officers.The judge had unsuccessfully challenged his compulsory retirement before HC. In the appeal, his counsel Mayuri Raghuvanshi told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi the judicial officer is not contesting his compulsory retirement but challenging the ‘unfit’ tag which, according to him, was stigmatic.The bench said compulsory retirement is not a punitive action and assuaged the feeling of the judicial officer by saying that the remarks in the order compulsorily retiring him would not be an impediment to his entitlements to post-retirement benefits.However, the CJI had some harsh words for those with doubtful integrity in the justice delivery system. “If there is a report about doubtful integrity of a judicial officer and the HC is of the view that he should not continue in service, how can the SC interfere in that decision?” “Spoken reputation of a judicial officer is important to maintain public faith in the justice delivery system.Once a committee of judges casts a doubt on the integrity of a judicial officer and if a decision is taken to compulsorily retire him, then the benefit of doubt (about the correctness of the decision) should go to the institution and not the judicial officer,” the CJI said.The high court had said the service record of the judicial officer from 2000 till 2015 shows the case disposal was either ‘just adequate’, ‘inadequate’, ‘adequate’ or ‘poor’.“We have also noticed adverse entries in his confidential reports. There were three vigilance complaints registered against him, though they were filed. The petitioner was aware of all these adverse facets, and they have become final. At this stage, we cannot substitute the entries in confidential reports or assessments of disposal,” HC had said.“The office that a judge holds is an office of public trust. A judge must be aperson of impeccable integrity and unimpeachable independence… The standard of conduct expected of a judge is much higher than an ordinary man. This is no excuse that since the standards in the society have fallen, the judges who are drawn from the society cannot be expected to have high standards and ethical firmness required of ajudge,” the court had said.","A Gujarat additional district judge was compulsorily retired in July 2016 on attaining the age of 56 years and nine months.

‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday frowned on Himachal Pradesh HC's repeated interference in the state govt's decisions and said it appeared that the high court was not allowing the elected govt to function. SC warned that it would view such interference seriously in future.Despite these oral remarks, a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the HC had rightly rejected the Himachal govt's reliance on the ongoing delimitation process to seek postponement of local body elections by six months.""Pendency of delimitation exercise cannot be a ground to seek postponement of elections,"" the bench said.It also said the HC was right in saying that holding timely elections to urban local bodies, municipalities and nagar panchayats had been mandated by the Constitution. There are around 3,500 gram panchayats, 90 panchayat samitis, 11 zila parishads and 71 urban local bodies in HP, the majority of which go to polls this year.Taking into consideration the logistics and problems of accessibility to remote areas in winter, the bench extended the HC's April 30 deadline for completion of local body elections by a month to May 31.Appearing for the petitioner, on whose plea the HC had asked the delimitation exercise to be completed before Feb 28, senior advocate Maninder Singh told the bench that the high court had set the deadline keeping in mind the fact that nation-wide Census work would commence from May 1. It was the state election commission that had cited this fact before SC, he said.For the state govt, senior advocate V Giri said the HC should have kept the logistics in mind while setting the deadline for completion of civic body elections.The CJI-led bench in its order said, ""The direction by the HC that elections to local bodies are required to be held after the expiry of their tenure as per constitutional mandate does not warrant any interference.""""However, having regard to logistic difficulties, we modify the time schedule and direct that all preparatory work be completed before March 31 instead of Feb 28. Elections shall be conducted within eight weeks thereafter, that is positively before May 31. No application for extension of time will be entertained,"" the bench said.","Supreme Court frowns on Himachal Pradesh HC's repeated interference in the state govt's decisions.

EC usually appoints special observers after announcement of Lok Sabha/assembly poll schedule.“As a special observer, you will oversee that the process of special intensive revision is strictly as per the directions of the commission issued from time to time.

He had also served as special police observer in Maharashtra during the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. West Bengal has a history of poll violence and clashes between political workers of rival parties. Mishra, as special observer, will be keeping a watch on law and order in the state as well as observance of EC’s guidelines and directions for free and fair conduct of assembly polls, including those relating to deployment of Central paramilitary forces.Singh, a 1991 batch IRS officer, had served as Director General, Income Tax (Investigation) in Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu is known for high and unaccounted poll expenditure; in 2019 Lok Sabha election, the EC had cancelled the poll in Vellore parliamentary constituency due to excessive use of money power to influence voters. Earlier in 2016, assembly polls in two constituencies - Thanjavur and Aravakurichi — were cancelled on the same grounds, followed by rescinding of election in R K Nagar assembly constituency in 2017.The EC asked the two retired officers — who will be under EC’s superintendence and control and shall receive an honorarium — to visit their respective states in coordination with the chief electoral officer concerned.

He said there are key challenges, including making farmers financially strong, which can happen only when they have holding capacity to sell their produce when they get a good price. The minister said this can happen when the shelf life of farm produce is enhanced by value addition. He added that there is a need to set up more food processing units close to agriculture production hubs. He also highlighted the need to address wastage, particularly of perishable products.He said several interventions, which govt has taken in the past decade, will help India to position itself as a global food basket. On India’s growth story, Paswan said a decade of structural reforms under PM Modi have strengthened the country’s economic resilience. Paswan said even amid global uncertainties, India remains the fastest-growing major economy.He added the country’s next leap will be powered not merely by scale, but by value creation particularly in agriculture and allied sectors. “Our agriculture sector is shifting from subsistence to value creation,” he said, underscoring the renewed focus on animal husbandry, fisheries, and food processing.On India-US deal, Paswansaid the interests of farmers will never be compromised. The assurance came as the Opposition raised questions over the deal, calling it ‘anti-farmer.” “India is one of the fastest-growing economies. That means we are doing something right. Our policies are often challenged, but we are allaying every fear.”","Food processing minister Chirag Paswan said India has the volume to support food security of many other countries.

Spectrum can't be part of insolvency process: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spectrum-cant-be-part-of-insolvency-process-sc/articleshow/128322830.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday held that telecom companies cannot claim ownership over spectrum allocated to them by govt and the natural resource cannot be subject to insolvency and liquidation process of a bankrupt telecom company.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar rejected the plea of banks, which submitted that licenced spectrum could also be put on block to recover debt taken by a bankrupt telecom company. It quashed an NCLAT order in insolvency proceedings of Aircel group, which had said that spectrum usage rights could be treated as assets of a corporate debtor and could be transferred during insolvency or liquidation. The court's order is a setback to banks, which have exposure to telecom firms.""Recognition of spectrum licensing rights as an intangible asset in the balance sheet is not determinative of recognition/transfer of ownership of the spectrum to telecom service providers (TSPs). It only indicates control over the future economic benefits flowing from the grant of the right to use the spectrum. Hence, even if the right to use spectrum exhibits property-like features, such as longer licensing terms, exclusivity, transferability, tradability, etc, they merely represent different sticks in the bundle of rights and falls short of conferring complete ownership of the spectrum on TSPs,"" the bench said.Justice Narasimha, who penned the judgment, said merely because spectrum can be treated as an ""asset"" on the basis of certain attributes - such as possession and usage, lease and assignment, claim and liability or credit and debt - the entirety of the telecom sector cannot be brought under the sweep of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).He said the grant of a telecom licence, including the right to use spectrum, does not effect a transfer of ownership or proprietary interest. ""What is conferred is a limited, conditional and revocable privilege to use spectrum for specified purposes and for a defined duration,"" the bench said.""In conclusion, the framework of IBC is clear in excluding assets over which the corporate debtor has no ownership rights. Mere recognition of spectrum licensing rights as an intangible asset by TSPs in financial statements is not conclusive of their ownership, as it only represents control over future economic benefits. Even assuming that licensing of spectrum rights is one among the bundle of rights, in the absence of transfer of title over the spectrum, no ownership rights are created in TSPs either in the spectrum or in its right to use as governed by licensing conditions. Hence, under the IBC framework, spectrum licensing right is not a part of the pool of assets for insolvency or liquidation,"" the judgment said.It said licence agreement leaves no doubt that effective and pervasive control over the licence and spectrum vests with the licensor (govt) and licensee's rights are circumscribed by regulatory oversight, disclosure obligations, restrictions on transfer, and the ever-present power of the licensor to suspend or terminate the licence for breach, liquidation, or winding up of the licensee.","Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar rejected the plea of banks.

The SC also made it clear that ""the disability pension is not a matter of largesse, but a recognition of sacrifice made in service of the nation.""""Right to receive disability pension is a valuable right and once found due, the benefit of the same has to be given from the date it became due. The same cannot be curtailed by restricting the benefit to a period of three years preceding the filing of the original application,"" the apex court has clarified.A bench comprising Justice Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Justice Alok Aradhe passed these orders while dismissing the appeals by the central government and allowing those filed by ex-servicemen seeking complete arrears.The main issue of consideration before the apex court was if the arrears of disability pension be restricted to three years prior to filing the claim before the armed forces tribunal (AFT).The dispute traces back to the Supreme Court’s landmark 2014 judgment titled Union of India versus Ram Avtar, where a three-judge bench ruled that Armed Forces personnel who retired with disabilities attributable to or aggravated by military service were entitled to “broad banding” of disability pension, even if they were not invalidated out of service.Following that ruling, many ex-servicemen approached the AFT seeking re-computation of their disability pension and payment of arrears. While some tribunal benches granted arrears from the date of retirement or applicable pay commission cut-off, others restricted arrears to three years, citing limitation principles.In its appeal, the central government represented by Attorney General submitted that the grievance of the government is confined to the direction to pay arrears of disability pension beyond a period of three years. It was contended that claims for arrears of disability pension are governed by the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963, as well as Section 22 of the Act, and that even in cases of continuing wrong, arrears cannot extend beyond the prescribed period of limitation.However, rejecting the centre's plea, the SC observed that pension is not a matter of charity or executive discretion. It is a “deferred portion of compensation” and constitutes a vested property right protected under Article 300A of the Constitution. ""The contention advanced on behalf of the Union of India that the claim for arrears of disability pension is barred by Limitation Act, cannot be accepted,"" held the SC in its 17-pages detailed order.","Supreme Court rules that eligible ex-servicemen (ESM) are entitled to full arrears of disability pension without restriction to a three-year limitation period.

Five of the 15 trusts that filed annual reports declared nil contributions, while reports from Swadeshi Electoral Trust, AB General Electoral Trust, PD General Electoral Trust, Janta Nirvachak Electoral Trust and Independent Electoral Trust were missing from the EC portal. ADR further noted that Harmony Electoral Trust disbursed Rs 35.65 crore, about Rs 10 lakh more than it received during the year.Calling for greater transparency, ADR said trusts failing to comply with EC guidelines should face strict action and urged mandatory public disclosure of corporate political donations through company filings.The report comes a year after the Supreme Court of India struck down the electoral bonds scheme in February 2024, ruling that anonymous political funding violated voters’ right to information.","The BJP received Rs 3,157.65 crore, or 82.52 per cent of the funds distributed. The Indian National Congress was a distant second with Rs 298.78 crore. The top 10 donors together accounted for nearly half the total at Rs 1,908.86 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128305119,imgsize-2412023,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

Bank strike today: Are banks shut amid nationwide Bharat bandh on February 12?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bank-strike-today-are-banks-shut-amid-nationwide-bharat-bandh-on-february-12/articleshow/128235136.cms,"Representative AI image

Will banks remain open today?

Which bank unions are participating — and why?

The nation is observing a Bharat Bandh on Thursday following a nationwide strike call by a joint forum of central trade unions against the Centre’s alleged anti-worker policies. The strike also involves banking unions.Thus, amid the strike, uncertainty looms over banking operations, with customers across cities unsure whether branches will function normally or face disruptions as several bank unions align with the strike call.While banks will remain open, services might face disruptions as major institutions like State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda , and UCO Bank have notified the BSE about potential service impacts during the Bharat Bandh.Bank of Baroda has informed customers through its BSE filing that while it is preparing for normal operations, branch services might be affected if the strike takes place. Similarly, SBI noted that although necessary arrangements have been made to ensure normal functioning, work in branches and offices may be impacted to a limited extent.UCO Bank made similar statements in its BSE filing, stating that steps are being taken for smooth operations but branch functioning could be affected if the strike materialises.For customers wondering about bank services on February 12, it is important to note that while banks are not officially closed, planning transactions in advance may help avoid inconvenience due to possible service limitations.Major bank unions including the All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers Association (AIBOA), and Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) joined forces with 10 central trade unions for this protest. They have raised concerns over the new labour codes, alleging that the reforms are unfavourable to workers and could make trade union registration more restrictive.The protest also comes at a time when bank associations have been actively campaigning for improved working conditions, including the long-pending demand for a five-day work week to enhance work-life balance for employees.Over 10 central trade unions called for a nationwide Bharat Bandh to protest the government’s “anti-worker” policies. The strike was supported by farmer organisations and other groups across multiple sectors.The bandh was announced as a demonstration against what the unions described as “anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-national pro-corporate policies of the central government.”Trade unions estimated that nearly 30 crore workers from various sectors were likely to take part in the agitation. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) urged farmers to join trade union workers to ensure the success of the all-India general strike.","The nation is observing a Bharat Bandh on Thursday following a nationwide strike call by a joint forum of central trade unions against the Centre’s alleged anti- worker policies.

The difference in basic pay

The difference in dearness allowance (DA) calculated on the revised basic pay

Central government employees and pensioners have reason to cheer with the website for the 8th Pay Commission going live, seeking feedback and inputs from concerned individuals.The 8th Pay Commission was first announced in January 2025, and it was formally notified later through a Ministry of Finance notification issued on November 3, 2025. The government has already approved the 8th Pay Commission’s Terms of Reference (ToR), giving it a period of 18 months to submit its recommendations on revisions to salaries, pensions, and other allowances of government employees and pensioners.With the 8th Pay Commission now constituted, the government has introduced its official website (https://8cpc.gov.in/). With the launch of the website, the 8th Pay Commission has now invited suggestions and feedback from ministries, departments, central government employees, and other stakeholders.In a statement published on the new website, the Commission said it is seeking views, opinions, and inputs to help it make well-informed recommendations. The final date for submitting responses to the questionnaire is Monday, March 16, 2026. The website reads:The 8th Pay Commission has clarified that the identities of respondents will remain confidential, and the feedback received will be examined and presented only in an aggregated and non-attributable form.The 8th Central Pay Commission is expected to have an impact on restructuring pay scales, allowances, and pension benefits for millions of central government employees and pensioners.The questionnaire is open to a wide range of participants, including:In December 2025, four Members of Parliament raised questions in the Lok Sabha regarding the timeline for implementing the 8th Pay Commission, seeking clarification from Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, according to an ET report.In his response, the minister did not specify an implementation date. He said that the government would decide when the 8th Central Pay Commission recommendations would come into effect and that suitable financial provisions would be made once the recommendations accepted by the government are implemented.According to Ramachandran Krishnamoorthy, Director – Payroll Services at Nexdigm, arrears under the 8th Pay Commission may be estimated by multiplying the difference in monthly salary by the number of months for which implementation is delayed.The revised pay is calculated by applying the approved fitment factor to an employee’s existing basic pay under the 7th Pay Commission.Krishnamoorthy explained that arrears generally consist of:The overall arrears amount depends on the duration of the delay, which could typically range between 18 and 24 months.","The 8th Pay Commission was first announced in January 2025, and it was formally notified later through a Ministry of Finance notification issued on November 3, 2025.

"IndiGo plans to hire over 1,000 pilots after December's crew crunch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indigo-plans-to-hire-over-1000-pilots-after-decembers-crew-crunch/articleshow/128331589.cms,"Stepping up expansion

DGCA findings

IndiGo, the country's largest airline is set to go on a hiring spree, bringing over 1,000 pilots on board. This comes after the aviation giant faced massive operational disruption last December, when the company was forced to cancel more than 5,000 flights within seven days.The fresh intake will span trainee first officers, senior first officers and commanders. A recruitment notice shows the carrier is also ready to accept applicants without time on the Airbus A320, the workhorse aircraft across its network, ET reported.Under the updated framework, the number of landings permitted between 12 am and 6 am has been limited, while the mandatory weekly rest period for pilots has gone up.A review carried out by the irectorate General of Civil Aviation concluded that the airline had neither hired in line with the new rules nor accelerated its training capacity. This, the probe noted, resulted in pilots being stretched through repeated reassignments, lengthier duty spans and greater use of deadheading, in which crew are moved as passengers to operate flights elsewhere.A senior official, as cited by ET, maintained that IndiGo is now lining up a steady supply of cockpit crew to keep pace with rapid aircraft additions.The airline’s in-house system is currently upgrading about 20–25 first officers to captain each month. Now, alongside hiring, the carrier has begun adjusting its network planning to create more breathing space in daily operations. From almost no buffer in December, the margin has been raised to 3% this month. Standby crew availability has also been lifted to a minimum of 15%.Fleet expansion is continuing at a brisk rate, with roughly four aircraft joining the airline every month on average.Training remains a long lead activity. Trainee first officers require around six months before they are cleared to operate, while promotion to captaincy demands at least 1,500 hours of flying, though airlines may prescribe stricter benchmarks.While the regulator’s baseline requirement is three sets of pilots per aircraft, including one captain and one first officer, IndiGo’s intense utilisation levels push its need to well over twice that figure.Figures placed during the inquiry into the December episode showed the airline needed 2,422 captains but had 2,357.After the disruption, the watchdog stepped in with temporary relaxations, suspending night-duty restriction rules until February 10.In its assessment, the DGCA said there was an overriding focus on maximising utilisation of crew, aircraft, and network resources, which significantly reduced roster buffer margins.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation said that the airline structured its crew schedules to extract the longest possible duty hours, leaning heavily on deadheading, tail swaps and stretched work patterns while leaving very little room for recovery. It noted that such planning weakened roster integrity and hurt operational resilience.","The fresh intake will span trainee first officers, senior first officers and commanders.

What does the law say about side hustles for H-1B visa holders?





With several guns trained at H-1Bs in the US and especially in Texas, several social media posts have now flagged home kitchen businesses being run by visa holders 'illegally'. H-1B and their dependents H-4 visas are not legally permitted to do a side hustle in the US and the laws are so strict that content creators are not allowed to monetize their channels but people are advertising their small catering services in closed Facebook or WhatsApp groups hiding from the public eye and scrutiny, the allegations said.One such post showed that an Indian woman in McKinney is offering North Indian crusine for small parties and occasions, for minimum 12 to 15 people. The allegation pointed out that this is illegal by McKinney's local laws as they must have a food establishment permit, have regular inspections and can not operate hot meal catering from a residential kitchen.The allegation pointed out that such operations are illegal on two counts: One, if they are on H-1B or H-4 visas, but if they are not visa holders, then also it is illegal as the Texas Cottage Food Law only allows baked goods to be made at a residential kitchen -- not hot trays.H-1B status authorizes the visa holders to work only for the specific employer that petitioned for (and received approval of) their H-1B petition, and only in the specific specialty occupation and conditions described in that petition. Any other employment whether it's freelancing, driving for Uber/DoorDash, consulting on the side, independent contracting, running a side business that involves active work, or even some content creation/coding gigs is considered unauthorized employment by USCIS.The income may be small, and the clients may be outside the US.Passive income is allowed from investment, stocks, rental as long as they do not require the visa holder's active participation.H-4 visa holders with EAD can own and operate a business as long as it does not violate any other laws.",Social media posts have now flagged home kitchen businesses being run by visa holders 'illegally' H-1B and their dependents H-4 visas are not legally permitted to do a side hustle in the US and the laws are so strict that content creators are not allowed to monetize their channels.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128316059,imgsize-1181297,width-400,resizemode-4/can-h-1b-visa-holders-maintain-a-side-income-in-the-us.jpg"

KOLHAPUR: A 52-year-old wholesale pharmacy distributor from Karad lost Rs 6.7 crore to cybercriminals who promised shares and stocks at discounted rates and high returns on investments over the past six months, the police said.The alleged scam started with a WhatsApp message from an unknown person to Ajay Bhattad, the pharmacy distributor, asking him to download an app and make investments.On Sept 9, 2025, Ajay Bhattad, a pharma distributor and resident of Shaniwar Peth in Satara's Karad town, had gone to Jaysingpur in Kolhapur to meet his relative. While he was at his relative's place, he received a WhatsApp message with a link and voice calls from two numbers telling him about a share market investment plan. They told Bhattad to download a mobile application named SIG to get shares and stocks at a discounted price, and promised high returns on subsequent liquidation of shares.""Initially, the victim got some returns. He went on to buy the shares and invest. They trapped him in their scam in such a way that he was buying the shares as recently as the first week of Feb. During verification, we found that the money was transferred through RTGS mode to 30 different accounts of both private and public banks, mostly with branches outside Maharashtra.The website floated by the scamsters is deceiving, and makes claims such as huge profits of Rs 333 crore being made to some investors,"" said Amol Thakur, the sub-divisional police officer of Jaysingpur division, who superintendent of police Yogeshkumar Gupta appointed for a thorough investigation.Gupta deputed some staff from the cyber police station to work under Thakur to get to the bottom of the scam. ""It is an organised crime. We are reaching out to the banks so that we can stop further transfer of the invested funds to the mule accounts,"" said the investigation officer.A case was registered against the unknown people operating the SIG mobile app and the people associated with the two phone numbers through which the communication was made, under sections 318(4), 316(2), 3(5) of BNS 2023 and 66(D) of the Indian IT Act 2000.","The alleged scam started with a WhatsApp message from an unknown person to Ajay Bhattad, the pharmacy distributor.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.
