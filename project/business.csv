CISF designated as nodal agency for port security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cisf-designated-as-nodal-agency-for-port-security/articleshow/125498710.cms,"File photo: X/CISF

NEW DELHI: The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which currently guards over 70 key airports and 13 seaports, has been mandated by the govt to act as the nodal or regulatory authority for all matters related to port security.The govt on Nov 18 designated CISF as the ‘recognised security organisation’ (RSO) for port security under the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPFSC). The mandate, which aligns with the govt’s vision of port-led growth as it focuses on a ‘blue economy’ as a key driver of economic expansion, followed the recommendation of a joint committee of CISF and DG, Shipping, constituted in Sept 2024 to study port security, conduct gap analysis and suggest remedial measures.As the RSO for ports, CISF said it will carry out a fresh assessment of security systems, prepare standardised security plans compliant with ISPFSC and carry out core security functions at all seaports engaged in export and import (EXIM) operations across the country.There are around 77 EXIM ports in the country, including 12 major and around 65 non-major ports. Also, there are around 200 minor ports where no cargo is handled as of now.However as and when these ports become EXIM ports, CISF will regulate their security as well.“For all things related to port security, the CISF will be the nodal or regulatory authority. We will work in three domains — providing consultancy for the establishment of security systems and gadgets, deploying hybrid security manpower and training all stakeholders in the sector,” said a senior CISF officer.“The initiative aims to resolve longstanding gaps arising from non-standardised security arrangements at non-major ports and ensure oversight by a domain expert security agency across all such facilities,” added CISF DIG(Int) Ajay Dahiya.A hybrid security model, improved screening systems and dedicated training institutions and courses for port-security personnel are also being introduced, officials said.The core security functions to be handled by CISF include access control, CCTV surveillance, perimeter security, seafront patrolling, quick reaction teams and the integrated operations centre. Non-core duties such as traffic management, container terminals and ancillary tasks may be handled by state police, state industrial security forces or private security agencies. However, these personnel too will be trained by a team of CISF experts to ensure professional and standardised port security services.CISF has prepared different training modules, focused on basic port security, specialised security and audit.Till now, seaport security was being dealt with by the Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) under the Directorate General of Shipping, and there was a requirement for a professional agency in this area, a CISF officer said.The officer disclosed that the idea to have a professional and sovereign RSO, had emerged from various top-level security meetings chaired by the prime minister and the home minister over the last few years, where the vulnerability and security gaps in the 254 big and small seaports of the country were underlined.",The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) currently guards over 70 key airports and 13 seaports.

Rs 10k crore: Cost of health cover fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-10k-crore-cost-of-health-cover-fraud/articleshow/125497230.cms,"MUMBAI: Fraud and waste continue to drag India’s health-insurance system, with Rs 8,000–10,000 crore leaking from claim payouts each year, says a Boston Consulting Group–Medi Assist report. Fraud and unnecessary claims inflate premiums, strain insurer finances and drain public funds. Weak data systems and loose checks also push patients into higher out-of-pocket spends.The analysis shows retail health portfolios carry higher fraud risk than group portfolios. Within group covers, fraud is consistently elevated in BFSI and healthcare. Reimbursement claims pose the biggest threat: group reimbursement claims show 9x more fraud than group cashless, while individual reimbursement claims show 20x the incidence of group cashless. Misrepresentation and document fabrication remain the top fraud types across IPD/OPD. Fraud risk clusters in mid-ticket claims (Rs 50,000-Rs 2.5 lakh), where incentives are high and oversight moderate.“Small-ticket fraud and abuse are often rationalised as harmless… This mindset has turned into a systemic behavioral challenge… contributing materially to the broader issue of FWA (fraud, waste and abuse) in the health insurance ecosystem,” the report said.The report urges tighter fraud prevention/detection, unified medical-coding rules, AI-driven oversight and faster data-sharing via the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission and the National Health Claim Exchange.Medi Assist says tech will do the heavy lifting. “As India’s health system stands at an inflection point, the next decade will be defined by connected data and intelligent automation,” said Satish Gidugu, Medi Assist’s CEO. Reducing fraud and rebuilding digital trust, he said, will help keep care “accessible, affordable, and accountable for all citizens.”For BCG’s Swayamjit Mishra, the biggest gains lie in the “remaining 8%” of claims that sit between harmless and outright fraudulent.","Fraud and waste continue to drag India’s health-insurance system, with Rs 8,000–10,000 crore leaking from claim payouts each year, says a Boston Consulting Group–Medi Assist report.

SC: Accused has right to speedy investigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-accused-has-right-to-speedy-investigation/articleshow/125497152.cms,"Right to speedy trial covers all stages: SC

NEW DELHI: ""The accused cannot be made to suffer endlessly with this threat of continuing investigation,"" the Supreme Court said, holding that the right to speedy investigation is also part of fundamental rights. The court said it will benefit the accused, the victim, and society if the investigation and trial are done quickly and completed within a reasonable time.Though it refrained from framing any timeline for completion of probe, which it said was not practical and feasible, a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N Kotiswar Singh said that an accused could approach courts for quashing of a case for inordinate delay in the probe. The court noted that there had unfortunately been many cases in which there was massive delay in filing chargesheet/taking cognisance etc. It said the right to speedy trial is an important facet of Article 21 (fundamental right to life). ""Timely completion of investigation is inherent thereto,"" it said.The bench said the court has repeatedly underscored the necessity of speedy investigation and trial but for various reasons this is still not a reality.It said the right to speedy trial covers all the stages - investigation, inquiry, trial, appeal, revision and re-trial - and shouldn't be seen narrowly.""The accused cannot be made to suffer endlessly with this threat of continuing investigation and eventual trial proceedings bearing over their everyday existence,"" the bench said and added that the apex court in its various rulings hold unequivocally that investigation is covered under the right to speedy trial and that violation of this right can strike at the root of the investigation itself, leading it to be quashed.""At the same time, it must be said that timelines cannot be set in stone for an investigation to be completed nor can outer limit be prescribed within which necessarily, an investigation must be drawn to a close.

Marking a Political Milestone, Nitish Kumar Sworn In as Bihar CM for the 10th Time

After GST rollout, state finance portfolio lost some sheen

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has ceded the home portfolio to BJP for the first time in his two decades at the helm and his party JDU has, in lieu, got control of finance, which was kept by BJP.Though it may appear like a regular ministry swap which happens between allies, the significance of deputy CM Samrat Choudhary being given charge of home was lost on few as the department is considered politically crucial due to its control of police, intelligence and general law & order, a reason why CMs in most states keep the portfolio to themselves. This is also a big boost for Choudhary and puts him in a higher weight category vis-a-vis his party colleague and the other deputy CM, Vijay Sinha, who has got revenue & land reforms and mines & geology departments, a notification said.Sources said that the new arrangement would also see political inputs accommodated into the functioning of the crucial department, which had lately been perceived to be run by bureaucrats.JDU's Bijendra Prasad Yadav has been vested with finance and commercial tax department, held by Choudhary in the last govt. The rising Kushwaha figure of BJP is now in charge of the state's law & order, and has no other department.As Nitish distributed portfolios among his 26 ministers - 14 from BJP, eight from JDU, two from LJP(RV) and one each from HAM(S) and RLM, the two main parties seemed to be keeping most of the key departments they earlier had, save for the exchange of home and finance.The finance ministry in states has lost some of its sheen as levers of revenue generation are limited for them after GST rollout, more so in Bihar where liquor is not a source of filling coffers due to prohibition since 2016.The decision of Nitish, whose 'sushasan babu' image owed much to his handling of law and order as he ensured minimal political interference in policing, to part with the ministry hints at the growing recognition in JDU circles about the need to relieve him of a part of his responsibilities as well as BJP's growing heft in the alliance after the party's national brass led by PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah played a central role in shepherding the NDA's campaign that decimated the opposition.CMs in most states, including Yogi Adityanath in UP, M K Stalin in Tamil Nadu, Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra and N Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh, are in charge of home, or law & order, as it is referred in some places. In Congress-governed Karnataka, the home ministry has been given to G Parameshwara but CM Siddaramaiah has kept 'intelliegence' with himself.There have been, however, examples of allies getting the home department. In the previous Mahayuti govt headed by Shiv Sena's Eknath Shinde, his deputy and BJP's Fadnavis was in charge of the portfolio. In the Maha Vikas Aghadi govt that preceded Shinde's, NCP's Anil Deshmukh was the home minister in the dispensation headed by Shiv Sena's Uddhav Thackeray. Both NCP and Shiv Sena had split and the new factions, which later got the official status, became partners in subsequent Mahayuti govt.Among current state govts, deputy CM Vijay Sharma holds the home ministry in BJP-governed Chhattisgarh.Nitish has kept the portfolios of the general administration department, cabinet secretariat and vigilance with himself. Vijay Chowdhary, a close aide of Nitish, will helm building construction, water resources and parliamentary affairs. The party has not named its choices for six other departments that have come its way, with sources saying that the picks would be finalised later.BJP has continued to keep health, law, industries, road construction, urban development and housing, and agriculture in its quota First-time minister BJP's Shreyasi Singh, a former international shooter, has been given sports, and information and technology. Deepak Prakash of RLM and HAM(S)'s Santosh Suman have been given the portfolios of panchayati raj department and minor water resources department, respectively.LJP (RV) MLAs Sanjay Kumar and Sanjay Kumar Singh are in charge of sugarcane and public health engineering department, respectively.","Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has ceded the home portfolio to BJP for the first time in his two decades at the helm.

IAF pilot dies as Tejas fighter crashes at Dubai air show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-pilot-dies-as-tejas-fighter-crashes-at-dubai-air-show/articleshow/125496211.cms,"Also read |

Tejas Crashes In Dubai Air Show Display As Massive Fireball Sparks Panic, Pilot Succumbs To Injuries

Since its 1st squadron was raised in 2016, Tejas has had an excellent safety record

.

In a major blow to India's much-delayed project for indigenous fighters as well as their export potential, a single-engine Tejas jet crashed during a demonstration at the Dubai Airshow on Friday afternoon. The IAF pilot, Wing Commander Namansh Syal, died in the accident.The Tejas Mark-1 fighter was on a low-altitude aerobatic demonstration sortie when it couldn't recover from a ""negative G-turn"" and plummeted to the ground, exploding in a ball of fire in front of a large audience at the Al Maktoum International Airport at 2.10 pm, local time.Wing Commander Syal was from Kangra in Himachal Pradesh and was posted at TN's Sulur IAF station. His wife is a retired wing commander. The couple has a daughter, who is seven years old.This is the second crash of the lightweight multi-role Tejas, manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics and powered by American GE-F404 turbofan engine, since it was inducted into the IAF 10 years ago.In the first crash near Jaisalmer on March 12 last year, the pilot had managed to eject safely. The jet was returning from the Bharat Shakti military exercise at Pokhran.Wing Commander Syal, an experienced fighter pilot, was not so lucky. He could not eject in time before the jet slammed into the ground.The pilot sustained fatal injuries,"" an officer said. The IAF has ordered a court of inquiry (CoI) to ascertain the exact reason behind the crash after coordinating with Dubai aviation authorities and recovering the ""black box"" of the ill-fated fighter. ""It's very difficult to say what led to the crash at this moment. It could be a sudden loss of power or control malfunction at a critical juncture,"" said a veteran fighter pilot, who did not want to be named.""Pilots can also suffer spatial disorientation during negative G-turns when they push the controls forward to make their planes dive, though they are trained to manage and mitigate negative G forces,"" he added.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said he was ""deeply anguished at the loss of a brave and courageous IAF pilot"", adding the nation stands firmly with the bereaved family in this tragic hour. Military aviation is inherently dangerous, with fighters being pushed to their limits through extensive combat manoeuvres and low-level flying and diving missions.The 13.5-tonne Tejas so far has had an excellent safety track-record since its first squadron '45 Flying Daggers' was raised with only two jets at Sulur in July 2016 despite its torturous development saga and excruciating delays. Over the last few years, India has been deploying the fourth-generation Tejas Mark-1 jets for airshows in Dubai, Singapore and other places to showcase its ""superior handling characteristics and manoeuvrability"" through low-level aerobatics to an international audience in a bid to win export orders.IAF, however, has inducted only 38 Tejas Mark-1 fighters, with the second squadron '18 Flying Bullets' deployed at Naliya, of the 40 ordered for Rs 8,802 crore in the 2006-10 timeframe. ""Three Tejas jets were sent for the Dubai air show for the No 45 and 18 squadrons,"" another officer said. IAF has also ordered 180 'improved' Tejas Mark-1A jets for over Rs 1.1 lakh crore, with the latest Rs 66,500 crore deal for 97 jets being inked in Sept this year. The force, however, is yet to begin getting Tejas Mark- 1A deliveries due to huge delays in supply of engines from the US as well as pending weapons trials.The trials involve Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs and their integration with Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system.","IAF pilot, Wing Commander Namansh Syal, died in the accident.

Order against ‘bulldozer justice’ was my most important: CJI Gavai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/order-against-bulldozer-justice-was-my-most-important-cji-gavai/articleshow/125495363.cms,"'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

Equality does not mean equal treatment: Gavai

NEW DELHI: Judges traditionally avoid commenting publicly on their own judgments, but on Friday CJI B R Gavai departed from that norm to pick his verdict against “bulldozer justice” as his most important one, followed by the ruling allowing states to sub-classify SCs and STs for job reservations.At the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) farewell function, CJI Gavai said he could do so as he has completed his judgments and doesn’t have any judicial work as he is retiring on Sunday. He said if he was asked to pick the most important judgment authored by him, it would undoubtedly be the one against bulldozer justice.“Bulldozer justice is against the grain of rule of law. How can a house be demolished just because a person is accused of a crime or convicted for it? What is the fault of his family and parents? Right to shelter is a fundamental right,"" he said.The Chief Justice of India B R Gavai had mentioned bulldozer justice judgment even in his speeches in foreign countries to highlight how the judiciary protects rule of law in India.He said the judgment allowing sub-classification of SCs and STs for availing reservation in jobs was needed as it would be difficult to imagine how a chief secretary’s children could be equated in status with the children of an agricultural labourer who have no access to education or resources.Quoting Ambedkar , he said equality does not mean equal treatment to all as “it would lead to further inequality.” CJI Gavai said he had a law clerk, who is the son of a top bureaucrat in Maharashtra belonging to a SC community.After I delivered the judgment, the law clerk said he would not avail benefit of reservation as he had the best of facilities despite belonging to SC community, the Chief Justice of India said on Friday.The CJI said he veered away from the traditional notion of the Supreme Court being a CJI-centric court and always consulted all his colleagues before taking decisions relating to the institution.He said during his short tenure, 107 judges were appointed to the HCs and thanked his collegium colleagues for the congenial atmosphere in the meetings. Not all meetings were congenial though, as Justice B V Nagarathna had shot off a long letter protesting the collegium’s choice to recommend Justice Vipul M Pancholi as a judge of the SC.In the morning, the courtroom farewell unprecedentedly extended beyond one and half hours as senior advocates and lawyers kept highligting the humble, compassionate and to-the-point demeanour and approach of the CJI.Chief Justice of India B R Gavai said he has been heading the green bench in Supreme Court for the last three years and his first judgment as CJI was protecting a forest land in Pune and the last judgment was to protect Aravali Hills and range.CJI B R Gavai said his 40-year-long career in the legal field, 18 years as an advocate and 22 years as a judge of constitutional court, was driven by Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's philosophy of justice, equality and liberty.",Chief Justice of India B R Gavai said he veered away from the traditional notion of the Supreme Court being a CJI-centric court.

‘We Made No Crime’ Prashant Kishor Admits Failure, Takes Full Responsibility for Bihar Verdict

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor on Friday announced that he will donate 90 per cent of his income over the next five years to fund his party’s campaign. The declaration comes just days after the newly launched party suffered a major setback in its debut Bihar assembly elections , failing to win a single seat despite an energetic start to its campaign.Jan Suraaj drew a blank in the polls, unable to open its account amid a sweeping victory for the NDA.Addressing reporters after a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Ashram in West Champaran, Kishor also accused the newly formed Nitish Kumar cabinet of being packed with tainted leaders. “The new cabinet of Nitish Kumar, which took oath on Thursday, is full of corrupts and criminals. I must say that this council of ministers is a slap in the face of the people of Bihar. It's like rubbing salt on the wound as several corrupt leaders were inducted,” he alleged.Kishor further claimed the appointments show that “Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and CM Kumar are least concerned about Bihar.” He also accused the ruling alliance of buying votes through cash transfers. “They have purchased votes by transferring Rs 10,000 into the bank account of more than 1 crore women.Now, they have no concern for the state or the people,” he said, adding, “If I am saying anything wrong, the state government can put me behind bars. ”According to him, funds meant for the state’s contingency reserve and a World Bank grant were diverted for the cash transfer scheme. Kishor vowed that his party would ensure women receive the Rs 2 lakh promised by the NDA. “Now, we will ensure that women get Rs 2 lakh as promised by the NDA ahead of the polls,” he said.Kishor also announced the launch of the ‘Bihar Navnirman Sankalp Yatra’ beginning January 15, during which Jan Suraaj workers will visit every household across the state. “We will visit all houses in the state over 15-18 months and create awareness among the people about the misdeeds of this government. The organisation of the Jan Suraaj Party will be strengthened before the campaign starts,” he said.Reiterating his personal commitment, Kishor said, “Besides, whatever assets I have acquired in the last 20 years, except my Delhi house, I will donate those for the party.” He appealed to supporters to contribute as well, saying, “Now, I request the people of Bihar to donate just Rs 1,000 to the party on a yearly basis. I will not meet anyone who doesn't donate this amount to the party.”Invoking Mahatma Gandhi, Kishor said he remains determined. “We will change the government. They tried to break our morale in this election. We will fight and win,” he said.","Jan Suraaj drew a blank in the polls, unable to open its account amid a sweeping victory for the NDA.

Investors have often cited India's archaic labour laws as one of the stumbling blocks while deciding on setting up factories in India and have flocked to countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh amid diversification of production bases.PM Modi called it the ""most comprehensive and progressive labour-oriented reforms since Independence"".Officials said the rules for these four codes - on wages, industrial relations, social security and occupational safety and health - will be notified within 45 days for enforcement of the provisions.While the Centre had enacted the laws as part of the response to the Covid crisis, reluctance in opposition-led states had prompted it to go slow.But with more than two dozen states showing willingness to move ahead with amendments in laws, the Modi govt decided to press ahead after extensive consultations.All states, except West Bengal, have published draft rules on the provisions of the four codes, officials said.In any case, states that fail to notify the rules will have to follow those finalised by the Centre since labour is a subject under the concurrent list.The codes cap share of allowances in overall compensation paid to salaried employee to ensure companies don't structure pays in a way that it results in lower social-security contribution by employers. For workers, there's a national floor wage, and states can notify higher payment.ILO director-general Gilbert F Houngbo said, ""Following with interest developments of India's new labour codes announced today...""Under the new regime, fixed-term employees become eligible for gratuity after one year and social security coverage is expanded to all. All workers will get PF, ESIC, insurance, and other social security benefits. In addition, several sectors will now have mandatory annual health check-ups for their employees who are more than 40 years old.","The rollout comes within a week of a resounding electoral mandate in Bihar for the governing NDA.

"Battle lines drawn for fresh standoff, government leans on unorganised workers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/battle-lines-drawn-for-fresh-standoff-government-leans-on-unorganised-workers/articleshow/125494633.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre's decision to implement the four labour codes is the second ""big bang"" reform measure since the unsuccessful bid to overhaul agricultural markets, and signifies the confidence that it has drawn from the Bihar landslide as well as the recognition to prepare industry and business for global uncertainty.The announcement drew protests from trade unions, most of them aligned to opposition parties and appears to have set the stage for another confrontation.RSS-affiliate Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh, the largest of the trade unions, has not joined the chorus. But that is not the only reason for govt to feel confident that the long-promised labour reforms did not meet the fate that befell the farm sector laws.The farm reforms had to be aborted because govt failed to convince farmers that the proposed schemes were meant to help them. Going by the drift of the deliberations in govt over the past several months, the Centre seems to be confident that it will be able to persuade the intended beneficiaries; essentially a sprawling mass of workers who are not part of the organised sector.The proposal to extend social protection to a large and rapidly growing mass of contractual and unorganised workers will be welcomed by millions like those engaged by online platforms.The established trade unions have failed to acquire a following among them.The codes mandate timely wage-payment guarantees by seventh of every month, and allow women to work night shifts across sectors with consent and safety arrangements.This seems to be a combination of multiple factors - their obsession and the resultant dependence on organised labour, difficulty in bringing together those who are not working under one roof and the perception of unionisation as an anti-business pursuit whose worst victims have been workers themselves. But the net result is the presence of a large mass who have not been cared for and who should welcome any effort to improve the deal for them.Denial of minimum wages in large parts of the country and absence of safety norms also give govt an opening to win the support of these sections for its larger agenda, which includes preparing the country to the challenges of an uncertain global milieu.The uncertainty wrought by the Covid pandemic has been compounded by US President Donald Trump's aggressive mercantilism. The risks can be offset by opportunities, but the country does not seem fully prepared to grasp them. For all the talk of China-plus-one and the need to diversify the global supply chain, India has not benefited significantly from the concern about dependence on a ruthless China.The codes seem to make an effort to remedy the situation by introducing flexibility in a labour market which discourages entry of new players and capacity expansion while deterring foreign investors. While the codes address the need to shake up things a bit, govt will have to contend with an opposition, licking its wounds after successive electoral defeats, using them to amplify their ""pro-rich"" charge.","The Centre's decision to implement the four labour codes is the second ""big bang"" reform measure since the unsuccessful bid to overhaul agricultural markets.

Trade unions call move ‘undemocratic’, cite ignored consultations

Unions submit charter in pre-budget consultations

NEW DELHI: A joint platform of ten central trade unions on Friday criticised the government’s notification of the four labour codes, calling the move “a deceptive fraud committed against the working people of the nation” and announcing a nationwide day of protest on November 26.The unions allege that the implementation, effective from November 21, is unilateral and “anti-worker, pro-employer” and undermines the welfare-state framework. The statement was issued jointly by INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF and UTUC.The notification operationalises the Code on Wages (2019), Industrial Relations Code (2020), Social Security Code (2020) and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code (2020), replacing 29 central labour laws.PM Narendra Modi hailed the implementation, calling it “one of the most comprehensive and progressive labour-oriented reforms since Independence” and said the move strengthens workers’ rights and simplifies compliance.“These Codes will serve as a strong foundation for universal social security, minimum and timely payment of wages, safe workplaces and remunerative opportunities for our people, especially Nari Shakti and Yuva Shakti,” PM Modi said on X.""It will build a future-ready ecosystem that protects the rights of workers and strengthens India’s economic growth. These reforms will boost job creation, drive productivity and accelerate our journey towards a Viksit Bharat."" PM Modi added.The government said that the overhaul is intended to expand formalisation, reduce compliance burden and enhance worker protections across sectors, including gig and platform labour, MSMEs, women workers and contract employees.According to the government’s announcement, major changes include:The trade unions called the rollout arbitrary, alleging the decision caters to “employers’ representatives and fringe supporters of the Govt”. They claimed multiple protests and strikes since 2019—including the January 2020 general strike, the November 26 protest with Samyukt Kisan Morcha, and a July 9, 2025 strike claimed to involve “more than 25 crores workers”—were ignored.They said appeals to convene the Indian Labour Conference and repeal the codes, including during pre-budget meetings on November 13 and November 20, received no response.“This Union government has made effective the labour codes to cater to the demands of employers’ representatives… The most undemocratic, most regressive—anti-worker and pro-employer move,” the statement said.“Implementing the codes amid deepening unemployment crisis and rising inflation is nothing short of declaration of war on the working masses,” the platform said, alleging the government acted “in cahoots with capitalist cronies” to return to an “exploitative era of master-servant relationship”.""The working people of India will put up a formidable fight till the labour codes are withdrawn."" the labour unions added.Earlier, the Joint Platform of Central Trade Unions presented its 20-Point Workers Charter at the 2026-27 pre-budget consultation on November 20.The charter sought measures to boost domestic demand amid tariff concerns, stronger auditing of government schemes, and steps to reverse declining audit reports placed before Parliament. The unions demanded wider EPF/ESI coverage, higher statutory thresholds, increased minimum pension and scheme-worker honorariums, and sectoral cesses to fund welfare.They also sought reversal of decriminalisation under the Jan Vishwas Act and demanded job-creation measures in place of public funding through PLI, Capex Incentive and ELI schemes, citing declining employment growth, stagnant real wages and weak manufacturing performance.","Trade unions call move ‘undemocratic’, cite ignored consultations.

Supreme Court had earlier noted that the public could not be forced to pay toll for roads in a state of disrepair.""First, we need to have clear criteria linking toll collection with riding quality and maintenance of an NH stretch.

Govt unveils tougher car safety test norms under BNCAP 2.0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-unveils-tougher-car-safety-test-norms-under-bncap-2-0/articleshow/125491420.cms,"NEW DELHI: For car manufacturers, obtaining a five-star safety rating will become tougher under the next phase of Bharat NCAP, which will be rolled out from October 2027. Under BNCAP 2.0, cars will need to undergo five crash tests, compared with the current three. The new regime will add full frontal and rear crash tests to the existing offset (frontal), side, and side-pole impact tests.Cars will be evaluated on five broad parameters — safe driving, accident avoidance, crash protection, vulnerable road-user protection, and post-crash safety of occupants. This means vehicles equipped with advanced safety features such as autonomous emergency braking (AEB) and electronic stability control (ESC), which help reduce the chances of a crash, will receive higher ratings. The assessment will also factor in features such as drowsiness detection, lane-departure warning, and forward-collision alerts.The road transport ministry published the draft protocol for star ratings — Automotive Industry Standard (AIS) Code 197 — on Thursday and has invited feedback from stakeholders. “This will bring a paradigm shift in car-safety ratings and will be superior to many global standards. The main focus of NCAPs worldwide is to ensure that cars do not become death traps for occupants,” said a private-sector expert involved in preparing the new protocol.The first phase of BNCAP is valid until September 2027.The new assessment protocol will also evaluate female occupant safety, going beyond regulatory requirements, and the safety of belted minor occupants, specifically assessing 6- and 10-year-old children. It proposes the use of advanced crash-test dummies during side-impact and pole-impact tests for better analysis of occupant protection.The proposed standard also includes post-crash safety requirements for both conventional and electric vehicles, which are crucial for safe evacuation of occupants. These include mandatory assessments of energy management for fire and electrical hazards and occupant extrication. Optional assessments will include multi-collision braking (MCB), SOS or e-call systems, and hazard-warning light functions.The test protocol will also assess features aimed at minimising the impact on pedestrians and other vulnerable road users in the event of a crash.","Under BNCAP 2.0, cars will need to undergo five crash tests, compared with the current three.

PM Modi Predicts Major Congress Split After NDA’s Bihar Win And Warns Allies Of Growing Instability

NEW DELHI: A group of 272 eminent citizens, including 16 judges, 123 retired bureaucrats, 14 former ambassadors and 133 retired armed forces officers, issued an open letter accusing leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and the Congress of trying to erode public faith in the Election Commission and other constitutional institutions.The letter, titled ""Assault on National Constitutional Authorities,"" alleged that opposition leaders were attempting to manufacture a sense of institutional breakdown through what it described as “venomous rhetoric” and “provocative but unsubstantiated accusations.”The letter said: “Some political leaders, instead of offering genuine policy alternative, resort to provocative but unsubstantiated accusations in their theatrical political strategy. After their attempts to tarnish the Indian Armed Forces by questioning their valour and accomplishments, and the Judiciary by questioning its fairness, Parliament, and its constitutional functionaries, now it is the turn of Election Commission of India to face systematic and conspiratorial attacks on its integrity and reputation.”The signatories singled out Rahul Gandhi for repeatedly alleging vote theft while, they said, failing to file a formal complaint or sworn affidavit to back his claims. They pointed to his assertions that he had “100 per cent proof” and an “atom bomb” against the Commission, alongside accusations of “treason,” and argued that such remarks came “without the prescribed sworn affidavit” required for accountability.The letter also noted that similar accusations had been amplified by Congress leaders, opposition parties and allied NGOs, including claims that the Election Commission had acted like the “B-team of the BJP.” It argued these assertions collapsed under scrutiny, pointing to the ECI’s public release of its methodology and verification done under court oversight.It said, “Moreover, several senior figures of Congress and other political parties, leftist NGOs, ideologically opinionated scholars, and a few attention seekers in other walks of life, have joined in with similarly blistering rhetoric against SIR, even declaring that the Commission has descended into complete shamelessness by acting like the ‘B-team of the BJP.’ Such fiery rhetoric may be emotionally powerful but it collapses under scrutiny, because the ECI has publicly shared its SIR methodology, overseen verification by court-sanctioned means, removed ineligible names in a compliant manner, and added new eligible voters. ”The signatories described this pattern of criticism as “impotent rage,” stating that leaders who faced electoral setbacks “lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility.”The letter said, “This pattern of behaviour reflects what might be called ‘impotent rage’ deep anger born of repeated electoral failure and frustration, without a concrete plan to reconnect with the people. When political leaders lose touch with the aspirations of ordinary citizens, they lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility. Theatrics replace analysis. Public spectacle takes the place of public service. ”Invoking the legacy of former chief election commissioners TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, the letter said, “Today, thinking of ECI, the country also remembers the likes of TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, whose unyielding leadership transformed the Election Commission into a formidable constitutional sentinel. They did not court popularity. They did not chase headlines. They enforced the rules fearlessly, impartially, relentlessly. ”Calling for transparency, legal accountability and respectful political conduct, the letter concluded by saying, “We call upon the Election Commission to continue its path of transparency and rigour. Publish complete data, defend itself through legal channels when necessary, and reject politics dressed up as victimhood. We call upon political leaders to respect the constitutional process, to compete not through baseless accusation but through policy articulation, and to accept democratic verdicts with grace. ”"," 272 eminent citizens, including 16 judges, 123 retired bureaucrats, 14 former ambassadors and 133 retired armed forces officers, issued an open letter.

New Delhi: Dr Umar un Nabi, the suicide bomber behind the Nov 10 Delhi car blast, had met a Syrian terror operative in Turkiye in 2022 along with co-accused Dr Muzammil Shakeel Ganai and Dr Muzzafar Rather, supposedly on the directions of their Pakistani handler Ukasha, sources connected with the investigation told TOI on Thursday.The agencies are trying to dig deeper into what transpired during the meeting. Muzammil, who was arrested by NIA Thursday with three other accused - Dr Adeel Ahmed Rather, Dr Shaheen Saeed and Mufti Irfan Ahmad Wagay - is expected to be interrogated by NIA to take forward the probe into international linkages of the conspiracy.Intelligence sources told TOI the three doctors - Umar, Muzammil and Muzzafar (Adeel Rather's brother) - had stayed in Turkiye for around 20 days. Though they had travelled there to see Ukasha, who is said to be based along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, the meeting never happened, as per the accused. Instead, Ukasha directed them to meet the Syrian national.Muzaffar went on to travel via UAE to Afghanistan and is said to have joined al-Qaida.Sources said Umar was also keen to travel to Afghanistan from Turkiye but was told by Ukasha to return to India to execute Jaish's ""bigger"" terror plans there.He followed the direction, and it was only after his return that he joined Al Falah University and gave shape to the terror module that had been amassing explosives for future attacks when it was busted.""Muzammil, Adeel and Umer were constantly in touch with three Pakistan-based handlers Faisal, Hashim and Ukasha via Telegram, who would give them instructions, radicalisation material and bomb making videos,"" an officer told TOI.NIA said on Thursday that the three doctors and Shopian cleric Mufti Irfan arrested by it had played a key role in the Delhi terror attack and were also conspiring to carry out similar pan-India strikes.Earlier, NIA had arrested Amir Rashid Ali, a plumber from Pampore, and Jasir Bilal Wani who hails from Qazigund. Amir had facilitated purchase of the vehicle used in the Delhi car blast and was aware of the suicide bombing plan. Umar had visited Pampore a week before buying the car to arrange the money and then travelled back to Haryana with Amir. Amir stayed with Umar for around a week, bought the car in his name, and then returned to Pampore days before the blast.Jasir is accused of being an active co-conspirator who had provided technical support for carrying out terror attacks by modifying drones into rockets for use in terror attacks.All the accused were earlier in custody of J&K police, which had, in a painstaking investigation that started with spotting of some Jaish posters in Nowgam, unravelled a chilling Jaish terror conspiracy involving highly-radicalised doctors working at Al-Falah University in Faridabad.","Dr Umar un Nabi, the suicide bomber behind the Nov 10 Delhi car blast, had met a Syrian terror operative in Turkiye in 2022 along with co-accused Dr Muzammil Shakeel Ganai and Dr Muzzafar Rather.

"Talaak-e-Hasan explained: Why it’s under scrutiny, and how it differs from triple talaq",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/talaak-e-hasan-explained-why-its-under-scrutiny-and-how-it-differs-from-triple-talaq/articleshow/125464201.cms,"Explained: Difference between Talaq-e-Hasan and Triple Talaq

What is Talaak-e-Hasan





Why Talaak-e-Hasan is challenged now





What happened in the 2017 case





How is teen talaq different from Talaak-e-Hasan





Where the debate stands now





NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court, while hearing a petition challenging the unilateral use of Talaq-e-Hasan, on Wednesday questioned the validity of a growing practice in which Muslim men authorise lawyers to issue monthly talaq notices on their behalf. Examining the case of journalist Benazeer Heena, the bench observed that such notices, issued without the husband’s signature, could not be treated as a valid dissolution of marriage. The Court warned that delegating talaq to lawyers or third parties exposes women to serious legal vulnerabilities, including the possibility of being accused of polyandry if they enter another marriage under the mistaken belief that the first marriage has been legally dissolved. The matter, already before the apex court through multiple petitions, has now brought renewed attention to the constitutional and procedural validity of Talaak-e-Hasan.The bench of Chief Justice-designate Surya Kant, along with Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and N K Singh, expressed strong reservations about this emerging practice, reiterating that talaq requires the husband’s direct pronouncement and signature.When senior advocate M R Shamshad, appearing for the husband, argued that such delegation was a customary practice within the community, the bench firmly rejected the claim. Justice Kant asked, “How can this be a valid practice? The notices for talaq and talaqnama must have the signature of the husband. How can a third party give the woman notice on behalf of her husband?” The bench further noted that clients often disown their lawyers’ actions, leaving women legally stranded. “Is this legal? How are such innovations made to give talaq? How is the community promoting such practices? We will not permit such processes to harm the dignity of the Muslim women,” the Court said.Also read - 3 talaqs sent through lawyer not valid: Supreme Court Benazeer, who was present in court, narrated how she had been abandoned by her husband after paying a total alimony of Rs 17,000 and forced to run from “pillar to post”. The Court directed her to file an application specifying the welfare needs of her child, assuring, “We will do the needful.” The bench also praised her courage, stating, “We salute her for gathering courage to move the court challenging the unilateral Talaq-e-Hasan process of divorce. Think of the condition of millions of Muslim women, illiterate and living in rural areas. What would be their plight?”The Court’s remarks indicated that the issue extends beyond individual grievances and affects thousands of Muslim women who may lack awareness, access or legal protection. The bench said it would examine the validity of Talaak-e-Hasan after detailed arguments, a move that has set the stage for a significant judicial review of practices that have long existed within Muslim personal law.Talaak-e-Hasan (TEH) is one of the classical Islamic methods of divorce recognised under Sunni Muslim personal law. Unlike instant triple talaq , which the Supreme Court struck down in 2017, TEH is a staggered process carried out over three months. The husband pronounces “talaq” once every month, typically during a period when the wife is not menstruating, and each pronouncement is intended to be separated by at least one complete menstrual cycle or lunar month. This timing is not arbitrary; it is grounded in Islamic jurisprudence, which emphasises reflection, restraint and opportunities for reconciliation between the spouses.The first pronouncement initiates the process, but the divorce does not become final. During the month that follows, the couple is expected to attempt reconciliation. If they resume cohabitation in any form before the second pronouncement, or if the husband changes his mind, the declaration becomes void. The second pronouncement follows the same pattern. Only if the third pronouncement is made in the third consecutive month, without any resumption of marital relations, does the divorce become final and irrevocable. This structure is closely tied to the Islamic concept of iddat, a mandatory waiting period observed by the wife after divorce or widowhood. The iddat serves several theological and practical functions, including providing time for reflection and clarifying pregnancy status.Within Islamic jurisprudence, TEH is seen as a measured and reversible form of divorce, distinct from the abruptness of instant triple talaq. Nevertheless, critics argue that despite its structured nature, TEH remains a unilateral and extra-judicial mechanism controlled solely by the husband. While Muslim women do have options such as khula—a wife-initiated divorce that requires returning the mehar—or mubarat, where both parties mutually agree to end the marriage, these processes can be inhibited by social pressure, family influence and lack of legal support. As a result, women often remain at a disadvantage when navigating marital dissolution within personal law.The challenge to TEH arises not merely from its theological structure but from how it is being applied today. The Supreme Court’s current examination stems from allegations that husbands are misusing the process by issuing talaq notices through lawyers instead of personally pronouncing the divorce. In the case of Benazeer Heena, her husband allegedly sent three talaq notices through his lawyer, completed a divorce and remarried another woman. Her counsel, senior advocate Rizwan Ahmed, told the Court that “when a talaqnama does not bear the husband’s signature, it is not a valid divorce document.” He cautioned that if a woman remarries under the belief that she is divorced, only to later learn that her husband denies having signed or authorised the talaq, she could be accused of polyandry. He further noted that potential suitors may refuse to marry her out of fear that the earlier divorce may not be legally valid.The bench reacted strongly to this argument. It rejected the claim that delegation of talaq is a widespread or acceptable practice. The judges observed that the integrity of the process collapses when a third party issues notices, especially when the husband can later deny authorising them. They expressed astonishment at the idea that a husband would ask someone else to divorce his wife, asking pointedly, “How can a third party give the woman notice on behalf of her husband?” The bench insisted that talaq must be executed strictly in accordance with religious law and not through intermediaries.The misuse of TEH is not limited to this case. Another petitioner, Nazri Nisha, appeared in person to narrate her difficulties, saying her husband attempted to divorce her through an irregular method. She explained that the lack of a valid divorce document had made it nearly impossible to access essential services such as school admissions and passports for her child. The Supreme Court asked her to file an application so that directions could be issued to protect her rights, emphasising that husbands cannot “enjoy their own life while destroying their wife’s. ”These cases have added to a broader argument that TEH, even when executed in good faith, gives unilateral and disproportionate power to husbands. The petitions challenge this imbalance, arguing that TEH remains discriminatory and violates Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. They contend that the practice lacks judicial oversight and allows men to dissolve marriages without ensuring financial security, due process or legal validation. The Court’s willingness to examine these claims signals its recognition of the deeper systemic issues at play.The current debate cannot be understood without reference to the Supreme Court’s landmark 2017 judgment in the Shayara Bano case, which struck down instant triple talaq (Talaq-e-biddat) as unconstitutional. The case began when Shayara Bano challenged the talaqnama her husband sent to her in 2015, arguing that triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy violated her fundamental rights. Her petition triggered a nationwide debate on Muslim women’s rights and the nature of personal law.Many women joined the litigation, including Ishrat Jahan, whose husband divorced her over a phone call from Dubai; Gulshan Parween, who received her talaq on a stamp paper; Aafreen Rehman from Jaipur; and Atiya Sabri from Saharanpur. The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) also filed a petition, arguing that triple talaq lacked Quranic sanction and violated women’s rights to equality, non-discrimination and dignity.The practice was defended by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and organisations like the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind. They contended that Muslim personal laws are protected under Article 25 and constitute essential religious practices. They argued that although triple talaq was “bad in theology”, it was “good in law” and valid under the Hanafi school of jurisprudence. They urged the Court to leave any reform to Parliament instead of judicial intervention.In a historic 3:2 verdict, the Supreme Court struck down instant triple talaq as arbitrary and unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that the practice violated Article 14 by granting husbands unilateral power without any possibility of reconciliation. The verdict was followed by the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, which criminalised the pronouncement of instant triple talaq.Significantly, however, the 2017 ruling did not address Talaak-e-Hasan or Talaak-e-Ahsan. These practices were considered more acceptable because they provided time for reflection and potential reconciliation. This omission left unanswered questions that have now resurfaced through petitions filed by women who argue that unilateral talaq—whether instant or staggered—remains discriminatory in practice.Teen talaq, or Talaq-e-biddat, is fundamentally different from Talaak-e-Hasan both in process and principle. Teen talaq involves the husband pronouncing “talaq” three times in one sitting, leading to the immediate termination of marriage. It does not require a waiting period, the wife’s presence or acknowledgement, or any attempt at reconciliation. Historically, the practice became infamous for being delivered through letters, phone calls, text messages and even social media. This instant, irrevocable nature was the chief reason it was struck down as unconstitutional.Talaak-e-Hasan, by contrast, is a three-step process over three months. Each pronouncement is separated by a significant interval, creating space for reflection and reconciliation. The first and second pronouncements are revocable, meaning the marriage continues if the couple resumes cohabitation. Only after the third pronouncement does the divorce become final. Scholars argue that TEH aligns with Quranic principles, which discourage hasty dissolution of marriage and emphasise attempts to reconcile.Also read - Explained: Why did SC say 'Talaq-e-Hasan' is different from triple talaq The Supreme Court itself has recognised this distinction. In a 2022 hearing on a related petition, the Court observed, “This is not triple talaq. You (women) also have option of Khula.” The Court noted that women have alternative routes such as khula, separation by mutual consent through mubarat and judicial remedies, whereas teen talaq offered no such opportunities for women.Yet, critics point out that despite these theoretical safeguards, TEH remains unilateral and extra-judicial. They argue that waiting periods or reconciliation windows do not compensate for the fact that the husband alone controls the process. The petitions before the Court contend that even staggered unilateral divorce violates the principles of equality and dignity enshrined in the Constitution.The Supreme Court’s latest observations do not equate TEH with instant triple talaq. The bench made it clear that TEH is not “so improper” as to be immediately struck down. However, the judges also signalled that procedural misuse, especially through delegated notices, cannot be tolerated. They emphasised that any valid divorce must comply strictly with Sharia procedures and must not compromise the dignity and security of women.The Court will now examine TEH in detail on 26 November, when it hears a batch of petitions challenging unilateral talaq practices. The issues before the Court include whether TEH is constitutionally valid, whether unilateral extra-judicial divorce violates women’s fundamental rights, and whether Parliament or the judiciary should reform personal laws that affect millions of Indian Muslim families.Whatever the eventual decision, the case marks an important moment in India’s evolving dialogue on personal laws, gender justice and constitutional morality. The Court’s findings will likely shape the future of marital rights for Muslim women and further clarify the balance between religious freedom and the right to equality.","Supreme Court questions validity of a growing practice in which Muslim men authorise lawyers to issue monthly talaq notices on their behalf.

NEW DELHI: Amid the rumblings triggered by the opposition's comprehensive defeat in Bihar, Congress said it was committed to INDIA bloc and would double efforts to strengthen the national alliance.AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said the INDIA bloc was put together as an arrangement at the national level for like-minded parties to coordinate their efforts to counter BJP's regressive politics. ""Nothing has changed since it was formed. Congress is committed to INDIA and will make further efforts to boost its efficacy,"" he told TOI. The Congress manager also said the opposition would continue with its coordination in Parliament when the winter session gets under way on Dec 1.Doubts about the fate of the opposition alliance have surfaced on social media after the decimation suffered by the RJD-Congress combine in the recent Bihar elections , where it was roundly defeated by the JDU-BJP coalition. Some Congress netas too have advocated that in future, the party should move independently in Bihar by junking ally RJD. Some of the questions have also been stoked by the likelihood of Congress contesting the upcoming Bombay Municipal Corporation elections separate from NCP and Shiv Sena (UBT), which are its allies in Maha Vikas Aghadi.Venugopal, however, rubbished the speculations.Many Congress netas said the alliance was intrinsic to the politics of the party, as it would soon be fighting in Tamil Nadu as DMK's junior partner, and would go into the future Assam polls as part of a coalition that is already being stitched.Venugopal said municipal and panchayat elections were local contests, where decisions on alliances were made by local units based on political ground realities, like in BMC. ""But even there, the idea would be to defeat BJP,"" he said. The Kerala MP, who is a confidant of Rahul Gandhi, said while nothing had changed since the national alliance was formed, members were aware there would be differences in a few states, like West Bengal and Kerala. ""We will still fight separately in the two states. But the larger alliance will remain intact,"" he said.","Doubts about the fate of the opposition alliance have surfaced on social media after the decimation suffered by the RJD-Congress combine in the recent Bihar elections.

LiAngelo Ball’s Viral Comments on Tipping

Michael Porter Jr. Backs Ball, Calls Tipping Expectations “Excessive”

Lonzo Ball Pushes Back, Defends Traditional Tipping Norms

A Closer Look at the Tipping Culture Divide

What This Debate Reveals About Changing Social Expectations

has unexpectedly thrust himself into the national spotlight - this time not for basketball highlights, but for a conversation that touches a nerve across America: tipping culture. What began as a casual remark during a family podcast episode quickly transformed into a viral talking point, igniting debates about wealth, responsibility, service work, and changing social expectations. With many already frustrated by rising tipping prompts and surcharges, Ball’s comments landed in the middle of an ongoing cultural clash.The discussion resonated so widely because it cut across demographics - fans, service workers, and everyday diners all joined in. For some, Ball’s stance echoed a growing fatigue over automatic tipping expectations. For others, it came across as tone-deaf coming from a multimillionaire athlete. In essence, one candid confession about restaurant habits opened the door to a sprawling, emotionally charged conversation.LiAngelo Ball, the middle brother of the well-known Ball family, revealed that he typically leaves between $10 and $20 in tips - even on restaurant bills reaching $400 or more.He shared this openly during a recent episode of the “Ball in the Family Podcast,” sparking intense discussion online and among sports fans. According to Ball, this habit reflects his philosophy on tipping: the amount should depend on service and not the total price of the meal.He explained his thinking bluntly: “If I’m at a restaurant, I might leave a small tip… But I can get, like, a $400 meal, and I’m only giving a $10 or $20 depending on the service. That’s just how I rock, for real.” He added that he occasionally increases the tip to $100 - but only when the server genuinely impresses him. Otherwise, as he put it, “If you did a great job, you might get $20. If you were just okay, you’ll get $10 for showing up. ”NBA star Michael Porter Jr., who appeared alongside the Ball brothers during the discussion, agreed with LiAngelo’s position. Porter argued that the standard 20% guideline feels disproportionate when large checks are involved. He framed his criticism around logic rather than money: If someone spends $3,000 on a meal, should a server automatically receive $600 in tips? To Porter, that expectation doesn’t make sense.He also questioned why food delivery services - like Uber Eats - are expected to receive consistent 20% tips regardless of order size. Both athletes maintained that tips should be based primarily on effort and quality of service rather than the cost of the food being served.The Ball family isn’t aligned on the matter. Lonzo Ball countered his brother’s stance by supporting the customary 20% tipping standard, especially for good service. He emphasized that a great server can elevate a dining experience, while a poor one can diminish it. According to Lonzo, rewarding excellent hospitality upholds fairness and acknowledges the hard work that often goes unnoticed in the service industry.This disagreement among the Ball brothers mirrors wider public division. While some praised LiAngelo and Porter Jr. for challenging tipping culture, others criticized them for what they saw as unnecessary penny-pinching - especially given the athletes’ substantial earnings.LiAngelo Ball’s comments highlight longstanding tensions in American dining culture. While tipping norms typically fall between 15% and 20%, many servers earn below minimum wage and rely heavily on tips to make ends meet. Critics of Ball’s position argue that low gratuities from diners - especially affluent ones - make an already unstable livelihood even more precarious.Supporters of Ball’s perspective see tipping differently. They view gratuity as a reward for service quality rather than an automatic fee. Their stance is that check size shouldn’t dictate tip size, especially when large bills reflect group sizes or luxury items rather than increased effort from staff.LiAngelo Ball may have intended only to share his personal approach to tipping, but he inadvertently triggered a conversation that extends far beyond basketball or celebrity culture. His viewpoint taps into broader frustrations about tipping inflation, service industry wages, and shifting consumer expectations.It raises questions many diners face: Should tips always scale with the price of the meal? Does presenting a bottle of champagne justify an $80 gratuity? And should a server’s income depend so heavily on subjective customer judgment?Also read: LiAngelo Ball Makes Platinum History with Breakout Hit “Tweaker” featuring Drake In the end, while LiAngelo Ball may tip $20 on a $400 dinner, he has undeniably made a far larger contribution to the national debate on tipping—one that shows no signs of slowing down.","LiAngelo Ball, the middle brother of the well-known Ball family, revealed that he typically leaves between $10 and $20 in tips - even on restaurant bills reaching $400 or more.

‘Will Show Trump His Mistakes…’: Putin’s Ally Challenges Trump At Asean Summit | Tariff War

US President Donald Trump has withdrawn steep tariffs on a wide range of Brazilian food products — including beef, coffee, cocoa, fruits and tomatoes — in a major reversal of policies that had sharply increased costs for American consumers.The decision, announced on Thursday, removes the 40% duties that were imposed in July as retaliation for Brazil’s prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro, as per news agency AFP.According to the executive order published by the White House, the exemptions will apply to Brazilian shipments arriving in the United States on or after November 13.The move may also require Washington to refund duties collected while the tariffs were still in force.Rollback widens a growing list of exclusions from tariff regimes introduced in recent months, as Trump faces voter frustration over the rising cost of living.Brazil supplies around one-third of the coffee consumed in the United States — the world’s largest coffee market — and has become an increasingly important source of beef, particularly the kind used for burgers, reported Reuters.US retail coffee prices climbed as much as 40% this year, driven by the tariffs and weather-related production shortages.Trump’s falling approval ratings have been closely tied to food inflation, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.Importers reacted quickly to the announcement. Commodities analyst Judith Ganes was quoted by Reuters as saying, ""You can expect some thousands of bags of Brazilian coffee that were sitting in bonded warehouses to start moving quickly to US roasters.""Many importers had stored goods in such facilities, which allow products to be held without paying duties, in the hope that the tariffs would eventually be reversed.Brazil’s beef industry welcomed the decision. The trade group ABIEC was cited by Reuters as saying, ""The decision (to lift Brazil tariffs) shows the effectiveness of the trade negotiations,"" adding that it intends to keep pushing to expand its access to the US market.Trump’s order did not address the sanctions he imposed earlier this year on Brazilian officials involved in the prosecution of Bolsonaro, who was convicted in September for plotting to overturn the 2022 election result.Brazil’s Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes and his wife were previously sanctioned under the Global Magnitsky Act, and some officials had their US visas revoked.Officials cited by AFP justified the new tariff exemptions by saying that there had been “initial progress in negotiations with the Government of Brazil.”An annex to the order lists the agricultural items no longer subject to the additional 40% duty, with exclusions backdated to November 13.Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva welcomed the shift, saying he was pleased that the punitive tariff had been removed, reported Reuters.",US President Donald Trump has withdrawn steep tariffs on a wide range of Brazilian food products.

The country has sought IMF support 24 times since 1958, and the current programme under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is the 25th, with two tranches already released and a third expected next month.Both the IMF and Pakistan’s government, agree that tackling corruption vulnerabilities is essential to achieving sustainable reform and economic recovery.","Pakistan’s long-delayed Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment has drawn a stark picture of weak institutions and widespread corruption.

NEW DELHI: Delhi's air quality showed slight improvement on Friday morning with the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) dropping to 370 at 8 am from 391 recorded the previous day at 4 pm, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Despite the improvement, the air quality remained in the 'very poor' category, with several areas recording severe pollution levels, prompting authorities to maintain strict measures.Various monitoring stations across Delhi recorded concerning AQI levels. IGI Airport T3 registered 307, ITO showed 378, and Punjabi Bagh recorded 379. Other locations like Najafgarh, North Campus DU, Aya Nagar, and CRRI Mathura Road continued experiencing very poor air quality with readings between 340 and 385.Some areas in the capital faced severe air quality conditions. Anand Vihar recorded 418, while Ashok Vihar reported 411. Rohini and RK Puram registered even higher levels at 424 and 401 respectively.The air quality classification defines readings of 0-50 as 'good', 51-100 as 'satisfactory', 101-200 as 'moderate', 201-300 as 'poor', 301-400 as 'very poor', and 401-500 as 'severe'. Popular locations like India Gate, Akshardham, and Kartavya Path remained engulfed in dense smog on Friday morning.The Delhi high court addressed the situation by directing the Delhi Government to restrict outdoor sports activities for schoolchildren during the polluted winter months from November to January. Justice Sachin Datta emphasized the need to protect children's health by modifying the annual sports calendar.The Supreme Court took action by ordering subsistence allowances for construction workers who lost work due to the implementation of GRAP-3 in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. Chief Justice BR Gavai's bench instructed these state governments to implement preventive measures and conduct regular reviews of air pollution.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) implemented GRAP III on November 11 across the national capital. The measures include stricter restrictions on construction activities, vehicular movement, and industrial operations to control emissions in the region.The situation had remained consistently poor, with Delhi recording an AQI of 399 on Thursday morning and 392 on Wednesday, both falling in the ""very poor"" category. The Supreme Court has mandated monthly listings of air pollution-related matters to maintain regular oversight of the situation.","The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) dropped to 370 at 8 am from 391 recorded the previous day at 4 pm.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Record earnings









Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed the growing concerns about an AI bubble. In recent months, investors and analysts have raised alarms about a potential AI bubble, warning that soaring spending by cloud providers and tech giants may prove unsustainable. Concerns have centered on whether the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure could mirror past boom-and-bust cycles in technology. Huang feels that the industry is presently undergoing some structural transformations and that it will sustain growth for the years to come. Speaking at the company’s earnings call, Huang said, “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.” The remarks made by Huang in AI bubble were quite expected as his company is presently at the centre of the artificial intelligence boom. Almost all the major cloud service provider such as Google, Amazon, Oracle are Nvidia’s customers.During the earnings call, Huang also laid down three major transitions which are fueling the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs.- From CPUs to GPUs - Firstly, Huang talked about the slow down of Moore’s law.He said that traditional computing is built around central processors and it is reaching its limit. Industries ranging from data processing to search and ad recommendations are shifting toward GPU-powered systems, which are uniquely suited to handle the massive computational demands of AI.- AI as a creator of new applications - Secondly Huang feels that AI is not just improving the existing tools but it is now unlocking completely new categories of applications. From generative models reshaping search and recommendations to advanced engineering solutions, AI is becoming the foundation for innovations that didn’t exist before.- Rise of Agentic and Physical AI - Lastly, Huang pointed out that the next-generation AI systems are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting and require minimal human intervention. These “agentic” and “physical” AI applications, such as coding assistants and robotics, will require unprecedented levels of computing power, further driving demand for Nvidia’s architecture.Huang believes that Nvidia’s singular architecture supports all three transitions across every industry and modality of AI, making the company uniquely positioned to power this next wave of infrastructure growth.Nvidia reported a record quarter with $57 billion revenue which is up by 62% year-over-year, and forecasted $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The shares of the company rose by 5% in after-hours trading. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress reinforced the bullish outlook, noting, “The clouds are sold out. Our GPU installed base is fully utilized.”","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed the growing concerns about an AI bubble.

How this compares to Verizon's previous layoffs









: Verizon has announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history, a report has said, adding that the job cuts come as the country’s largest wireless carrier struggles with competitive pressures and a shrinking customer base. CEO Dan Schulman, who took the helm in October after serving on Verizon’s board since 2018, cited the need to streamline operations and reduce costs that are limiting the company's ability to invest in customer value.“Our current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,"" Schulman wrote in an internal memo obtained by news agency Reuters. “We must simplify our operations to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers”.The telecom giant plans to significantly reduce not only its direct workforce but also outsourced and external labour expenses, the report noted. Additionally, Verizon will convert 179 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations and close one location.Meanwhile, a company spokesperson told CNBC that the job cuts are “an opportunity for Verizon to reset, restructure and realign our priorities on ways that will help us regain our leadership as a communications provider.”This represents Verizon's largest-ever single job cut. The company had approximately 1,00,000 US employees at the end of 2024, including around 70,000 non-union workers. Over the previous three years, Verizon had already eliminated nearly 20,000 positions, making the current reduction particularly dramatic.Verizon is establishing a $20 million career transition fund specifically for laid-off workers, focusing on “opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI.” The company emphasised that the job cuts were not driven by AI implementation.Reports say that Verizon is facing competition from established rivals offering cheaper plans and cable operators entering the wireless market. The company added just 44,000 monthly bill-paying wireless subscribers in the third quarter, significantly trailing AT&T and far behind T-Mobile, which led the industry with over 1 million net subscriber additions.Schulman inherited substantial challenges from his predecessor at PayPal, arriving amid aggressive promotions from AT&T and T-Mobile surrounding new iPhone launches. Despite massive investments—including $52 billion for 5G spectrum in 2021, a $20 billion Frontier Communications acquisition, and $6 billion for TracFone Wireless—Verizon continues to lose ground in the competitive landscape.","Verizon announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history.

Moody's warns that many US States showing recession signs





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy. Bezos has urged the consumers and businesses to postpone their large purchases as the fear of recession is mounting. Speaking to CNN’s Chole Melas in an interview, Bezos has cautioned that the coming months could bring prolonged downturn. Bezos has recommend that households should consider putting a hold on purchasing big-ticket products such as cars, televisions and appliances. He urge the consumers to save that money as it will make a lot of difference if the economic worsens. Along with this, Bezos has also advised the small businesses to avoid large capital expenditures or acquisitions during this uncertain period.“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”Despite his cautionary advice, Bezos struck an optimistic tone about the long-term future, saying he believes the American Dream remains attainable. He even projected that within his lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public. Last month, Bezos tweeted a warning to “batten down the hatches,” advice he reiterated in his CNN interview as relevant to both consumers and business owners.Ironically, if the consumers follow Bezos’ advice, then it could mean lower sales for Amazon. Recently, Amazon announced its plans to layoff 14,000 employees. In October, Amazon projected holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street expectations, citing inflation and shifting consumer behavior. Americans are spending more on travel and dining out and less on discretionary goods.Recently, Mark Zandi, chief economist at credit rating agency Moody' warned about recession in the US. A new analysis of state-level data suggests that the US economy is ""on the edge of recession,"" said Mark Zandi of Moody's. ""Based on my assessment of various data, states making up nearly a third of US GDP are either in or at high risk of recession, another third are just holding steady, and the remaining third are growing,"" Zandi wrote on social media.The data reveals a mixed picture across the country. States in the South are generally the strongest, though their growth is beginning to slow. Meanwhile, some of the nation's largest economies, like California and New York, are described as ""holding their own,"" and their stability is seen as critical to preventing a full-blown national recession.However, many states are showing signs of vulnerability. Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Kansas, and Massachusetts were all identified as being at high risk of recession. The broader Washington, D.C. area is also notable for its economic struggles, which Zandi attributes to government job cuts.Adding to the forecast, Zandi predicts that the annual inflation rate, currently at 2.7%, could rise to nearly 4% within the next year, further eroding purchasing power for consumers.Along with this, Zandi also warned about the restrictive immigration policies which could hurt the tech sector. He urged the lawmakers to protect access to global talent especially in AI, software engineering, and data science. ""If it feels like we're coming to the end of the tariff increases, or like we're going to get a more rational immigration policy,' I think that would be a signal that the coast may be cleared,"" Zandi told BI.“It’s no mystery why the economy is struggling; blame increasing U.S. tariffs and highly restrictive immigration policy. The tariffs are cutting increasingly deeply into the profits of American companies and the purchasing power of American households. Fewer immigrant workers means a smaller economy,” added Zandi.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy.

A room full of startup founders and investors at the world's biggest AI conference votes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI among 'likely flops',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-biggest-ai-conference-votes-sam-altmans-openai-among-likely-flops/articleshow/125364076.cms,"Representative Image

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’





OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference.

US Shutdown ‘Ends’ After 40 Days; Senate Passes Bill After Dems ‘COMPROMISE’ With House GOP | WATCH

The US government will not release official inflation or jobs figures for October after the record-long shutdown prevented statisticians from gathering essential data, leaving the Federal Reserve without two major indicators ahead of its December policy meeting.The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) confirmed on Friday that the October consumer price index (CPI) has been cancelled because staff were unable to collect the survey information in time, as per Reuters.“BLS is unable to retroactively collect these data,” the agency said, adding that only a few indexes based on nonsurvey data could be reconstructed. Where possible, October values will be issued alongside November’s CPI report on 18 December.The shutdown—which lasted 43 days from early October to mid-November—also forced the cancellation of the October employment report.While October nonfarm payroll figures will be combined with November data on 16 December, the unemployment rate for that month “will never be known”, reported Reuters.A similar message was delivered in Washington on Friday, with the BLS reiterating that survey-based data simply “was not gathered” during the stoppage, reported news agency AFP.The agency noted that CPI collection typically relies on in-person visits to retailers, including supermarkets, and telephone interviews. Household survey data for the jobs report is gathered in the same way.The cancellations have intensified uncertainty for the Federal Reserve, which meets on 9–10 December.Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently compared navigating the economy without standard datasets to “driving in the fog”, reported The Guardian.“What do you do if you’re driving in the fog? You slow down,” he said last month.Fed officials were already under pressure, with inflation still above typical levels and policymakers weighing whether to deliver another rate cut.A speech by New York Fed President John Williams on Friday added to expectations of a possible adjustment, saying he saw “room for a further adjustment in the near term”, according to The Guardian.The September jobs report, released with delays because of the shutdown, showed 119,000 jobs added but the unemployment rate rising to its highest level since 2021.The full October labour market report will never be published, although the job creation figure for that month will appear alongside November’s release a week after the Fed’s meeting.The shutdown has already pushed back a series of economic indicators, including retail sales and trade data, as per AFP.It comes as President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to complicate inflation pressures, with some Fed officials considering holding rates steady for longer.",US government will not release official inflation or jobs figures for October after record-long shutdown.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
