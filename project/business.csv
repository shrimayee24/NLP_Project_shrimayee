Tamil Nadu's Unique Education Strategy: SEP vs NEP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-walks-its-own-path-on-education/articleshow/111420430.cms,"The State Education Policy (SEP) looks set to have several student-friendly provisions -from only play at pre-primary schools to open book assessment to no common exams till Class X. A 550-page set of recommendations on the SEP was submitted by a 14-member panel headed by Justice D Murugesan, retired chief justice of Delhi high court, to chief minister M K Stalin on Monday.The Murugesan panel report runs counter to the National Education Policy (NEP). It favours continuing with the existing school education system instead of the 5+3+3+4 system proposed by NEP. It recommends five years as entry age for Class I against six years by NEP. UG admissions should be based on Class XI and XII board exam marks and not an entrance test as proposed by NEP. There are to be no multiple entry and exits in degree programmes. The panel also proposed a two-language formula against the three-language formula suggested by NEP.“Tamil Nadu has been following five years as a school entry for several years and it served the state well. We have recommended regulations to make school entry age uniform for all types of schools in the state,” Justice Murugesan told TOI.The report also recommends steps to check commercialisation of education, a ban on coaching and tuition centres parallel to schools and colleges, longer periods for physical education, and a special mission to improve quality of higher education.“Conducting common exams at early classes such as Class III and V or VIII will add stress to students. So, we have recommended board exams only in Class X,” Murugesan said.The panel proposed a regulatory body for deemed-to-be universities for admissions, fee structures and minimum salary for faculty. It recommended extending oversight by the state board fee committee to schools that fol low CBSE and other boards too.Revamping teacher selection and education, setting up regional structures for affiliating engineering colleges and establishing super specialty hospitals and college under Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University were other recommendations.It proposes RTE admission reimbursement only in private schools located in remote areas, hills, where there are no govt schools. It says funds being spent for RTE admissions can be used for developing govt schools.“The present structure offers seamless transition from school to college to students. NEP may disrupt the transition as it mandates a common entrance test and introduces a new school education system. In hindsight, the recommendations seem to protect the interests of people of TN and educational infrastructure in the state,” said education activist P B Prince Gajendrababu.Madras University former vice-chancellor P Duraisamy said multiple entry and exits in degree programmes will offer flexibility to students.",A 550-page set of recommendations on the SEP was submitted by a 14-member panel to chief minister M K Stalin on Monday.

"NEET retest: 60% improve scores, but can't match what they got with grace marks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-retest-60-improve-scores-but-cant-match-what-they-got-with-grace-marks/articleshow/111415067.cms,"Results of

NEET-UG re-test

will ensure there is no change in number of toppers

NEW DELHI: 60% of the 813 NEET applicants who took the re-test after the grace marks awarded to them were rescinded have improved upon their original score, excluding the grace marks. They include 4 of 5 whose score after the addition of grace marks totalled 720, the maximum possible in the test. Marks of another member of the 720 club came down by just 4.However, none of them could match the scores they had with the addition of grace marks.The increases over what they had scored minus the grace marks range between 10 and 40 marks. Although the NTA , unlike in the case of the general NEET, has not released scores, 11 candidates are learnt to have scored 670 or above.These students were among the 1,563 who were given grace marks because they had initially been given a wrong set of question papers and could not get the full three hours and 20 minutes allotted for the test.The grace marks for them sparked an uproar with many led by well-known coaching institutes alleging corruption, leading the National Testing Agency (NTA) to reverse the award of grace marks and give the 1,563 students the choice of appearing for a fresh test or settling for their scores without any grace marks. In the event, only 813 volunteered to take the test afresh.The results of the re-test, announced on Monday, will ensure that there is no change in the number of toppers, which came down to 61 after the exclusion of six whose score had reached 720 after the addition of grace marks.Of the 1,563 candidates, 750 opted to retain their scores without the grace marks. Though their ranks slipped, their original marks; i.e, what they achieved without grace marks, are good enough to land them seats in good govt medical colleges .Allegations of scam gained ground after six of the students who scored 720 were found to have appeared at the same centre, leading the NTA to reverse its decision on grace marks. The change was accepted by Supreme Court .The official statement on Monday read: ""Pursuant to the Order ... a Re-Test was held for 1,563 candidates on 23 June 2024 ..., out of which a total of 813 candidates appeared therein,"" adding, ""It is now informed that revised Score Cards of all Candidates of NEET (UG) 2024 (including of 1,563 Candidates who appeared in the Re-Test on 23 June 2024), are being hosted on the website...""Chandigarh, which had just two candidates registered, saw zero attendance. The Jhajjar centre, which was under scrutiny, registered 58% attendance, with 287 of the 494 candidates taking the test.The NEET-UG exam, held on May 5 across 4,750 centres, saw a little over 23 lakh of the 24 lakh candidates taking the exam. 67 students initially scored a perfect 720, an unprecedented number in NEET's history, with six from one centre in Haryana, raising suspicions of irregularities and the role of grace marks.The NEET-UG exam, conducted by the NTA, is for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH, and other related courses in govt and private institutions across India.The agency is currently under scrutiny for alleged irregularities in the exam, including a paper leak, with various groups calling for a retest.","60% of the 813 NEET applicants who took the re-test after the grace marks awarded to them were rescinded have improved upon their original score.

SC slams Manipur HC for denying medical aid to tribal prisoner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-slams-manipur-hc-for-denying-medical-aid-to-tribal-prisoner/articleshow/111471840.cms,"NEW DELHI:

Supreme Court on Wednesday strongly disapproved Manipur HC ’s refusal to allow an ailing undertrial tribal person, arrested in Oct 2022 for possessing two kilograms of brown sugar, to be treated outside the prison because of simmering ethnic clashes .While ordering immediate shifting of Lunkhongjam Haokip to Gauhati Medical College & Hospital for treatment, a vacation bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Ujjal Bhuyan was critical of HC’s Feb 29, 2024 order declining shifting of the prisoner outside the jail as he belonged to a tribal community as it could be hazardous given the law and order situation.Manipur witnessed clashes last year, to curb which even SC had to intervene. Over 200 persons lost their lives and many were left injured and homeless. While clashes have subsided, the tension — which burst open after HC asked the state govt to respond to a 10-year-old letter from the Centre on tribal status of an ethnic group — continues to simmer. Frowning at HC’s order and state’s lackadaisical approach, the SC bench told Manipur counsel Pukhrambam Ramesh, “We could have observed many things regarding state and HC. But we refrain from doing so for now.”The bench found that the accused was examined in jail by a medical officer as he was suffering from piles, TB, chronic tonsillitis, abdominal pain as well as problems in his lower lumbar spine. “If medical report reveals anything serious, we will take state to task. He may be a criminal, might have committed a serious crime, but state has obligation to provide him medical treatment ,” it said.","Supreme Court disapproves Manipur HC’s refusal to allow an ailing undertrial tribal person to be treated outside the prison.

""The use of an advanced rigid bronchoscope was crucial in safely extracting the coin from the patient's windpipe.""Dr. Amrita Rath, from the Department of Anesthesiology, emphasized the precision required in such surgeries, where even minor errors could endanger the patient's life. She highlighted the successful outcome of the procedure, with the patient expected to be discharged within a day.""This specialized capability to handle tracheal foreign bodies in adults is unique to the Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU, among government hospitals in eastern Uttar Pradesh,"" added Dr Ratnesh Kumar, another cardio-thoracic surgeon involved in the surgery .Reflecting on preventative measures, Dr Kumar noted that incidents often occur when individuals sleep with objects in their mouths or are semi-conscious under the influence of alcohol or drugs.The surgical team, including support staff Trivendra Tyagi, Anand Kumar, Om Prakash, Baijnath Pal, Vikas, and Sanjay, was instrumental in ensuring the successful outcome of the surgery.This accomplishment follows a recent similar case where BHU doctors successfully removed a key stuck in a patient's windpipe for a decade, further highlighting the hospital's expertise in handling complex tracheal foreign body cases.","Doctors at Sri Sundarlal Hospital in Banaras Hindu University (SSH, BHU) successfully removed a 25 paise coin lodged in the trachea ( windpipe ) of a 40-year-old man for the past eight years.

50k doses of semen & counting: Meet UP’s elite breeder bull,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/50k-doses-of-semen-counting-meet-ups-elite-breeder-bull/articleshow/111374226.cms,"Having contributed over 50,000 doses of semen , Gorakh, the lone Gangatiri bull at the Uttar Pradesh government’s Hapur farm, has emerged a pioneer in the conservation and propagation of high quality Gangatiri germplasm in UP .Gangatiri (Hindi for Ganga banks) is a dual-purpose indigenous breed native to eastern UP & western parts of Bihar. The breed, resistant to a lot of diseases and also economical, has high adaptability to the region and lesser input cost.A Gangatiri cow weighs about 300-350 kg and yields 8-10 litres of milk every day.The genetically improved breed, however, may have a higher yield. The breed was registered by National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) in 2015.Born on Jan 29, 2014, Gorakh has his parentage verified and that’s what made him qualify as the donor for production of sexed semen (in which 90% Y chromosomes are removed) for Gangatiri breed of cows in the state. The two female Gangatiri calves, which were born at the govt’s Varanasi farm on March 26 and March 27, using embryo transfer technology and IVF for Gangatiri cows for the first time in the country, are Gorakh’s progenies. The bull produces over 2200 doses of semen every month.Having a specific ID number, 287020, Gorakh will go strong for at least three more years, says his record. He was born at a gaushala in Mirzapur to Rahu and Pinki, both of whom were elite cows themselves. His induction at the Hapur farm took place in Jan 2015, when he was only a year old. His training for semen collection programme started in August 2019 and two months later, the farm started collecting his semen.Considering that bulls become sexually productive mostly by age of three and may go on to be productive for minimum for up to eight years of age and maximum for up to 15 years or even 18 years, as has been seen in a few cases, Gorakh may have a lot left in him still to give to the programme that he is already contributing to, especially when his record says that he is a bull with good libido and good quality semen.As far as his temperament is concerned, his keepers call him gentle. If Gorakh has been able to donate over 50,000 doses of semen till now, it’s because he has been on a herbal libido enhancer and a balanced diet. His daily diet comprises 7.5 kg of balanced concentrate with 12 kg dry fodder and premix of vitamins, minerals and probiotics. His exercise regimen is also strict and regular to keep him healthy and fit. The farm spends around Rs30,000 on his upkeep every month.It is a tough scan that a bull goes through to qualify as a sperm donor. The first stage is rearing. Many bulls get ousted at this very stage as they may not match the physical standards, or their sperm concentration may be low. The second is the training stage, where the bulls are trained to ejaculate with dummy partners present around to stimulate them. It is the final stage, the collection stage, in which the bull starts donating sperm.There are standards defined for the collection stage as well. The sperm count should be at least 500million per ml of semen for the bull to qualify as the donor. Each ejaculation gives 3-4ml of semen. Gorakh may have already matched the minimum standards to emerge as the pioneer sperm donor for Gangatiri cows. At present, he is the only male contributor to the programme. Officials said that there was one more male, but he died a few years ago.Dr Neeraj Gupta, CEO, UP Livestock Development Board, said, “There are norms defined for every stage. Each stage is monitored by experts. The collection is done scientifically and under the supervision of the experts.”The dummy partners for Gorakh are other male bulls, who are given an artificial vagina, which has a standard temperature of 37 degrees C to provide natural warmth to the male during ejaculation. Gorakh would mount the dummy partners each time he issexually stimulated. The process is done in the presence of experts and it has to be a swift collection of semen. The sperm is flushed twice a week, if done more, the semen quality might deteriorate. Every time the semen is flushed, it gives at least 200 doses, which is 400 doses in a week. Going by the standards, 2 lakh doses of semen may be taken from a bull in its lifetime.Gorakh is ten years but fit to go long. When embryo transfer technology (ETT) and IVF were used to produce Gangatiri cows for the first time in the country, at UP’s Varanasi farm, in July-August 2023, four elite females at the farm were selected as the egg donors, after their records of lactation and parentage were verified. The sexed semen from Gorakh was used to fertilize the eggs in-vivo (inside the body).Later, after about seven days, the embryos were flushed from the donor cows and transferred into four recipient cows, who may not have been of high merit for being merely the surrogate. At the end, because only two pregnancies were successful, two calves were born.The ETT is being extensively used for improvement of indigenous cow breeds at various places as elite cows are used as egg and sperm donors. The standard gestation period for cows is over nine months. Going by that standard, one female may produce one calf in a year, mostly. Through ETT, an elite cow can produce multiple progenies in a year. Ravinder, principal secretary, animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries, said, “In the current booming era of Artificial Intelligence, future strategy and better planning on artificial insemination (AI) will bring significant improvement in the entire livestock herd and reduce the risk of financial insecurity of farmers from unpredictable loss of agriculture returns. In the near future, the calf born through AI with elite genetics is going to pay a premium to farmers as predictive analytics can be made much before the progeny comes into production.”","Gangatiri (Hindi for Ganga banks) is a dual-purpose indigenous breed native to eastern UP & western parts of Bihar.

Banks on alert! The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks , following credible intelligence reports. Banks have been instructed to actively monitor their systems round the clock to detect any threats.In an advisory issued on June 24, the RBI said, ""In the light of credible threat intelligence received regarding potential cyberattacks, regulated entities are advised to put in place enhanced state of surveillance and resilience capabilities to guard against these threats.""According to an ET report, RBI's communication preceded a social media post suggesting that LulzSec , a group notorious for several high-profile attacks, was targeting Indian banks.The group, which was thought to have become inactive, is said to have resurfaced.Banks are required to continuously monitor network activities and server logs to identify any malicious intrusions. Additionally, they must keep a close watch on critical payment systems, including SWIFT (the messaging system for international fund transfers), card networks (facilitating card payments), and domestic real-time fund transfer frameworks such as RTGS, NEFT, and UPI.RBI has issued a reminder to banks, urging them to implement standard controls to safeguard against threats such as DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. These attacks involve hackers launching a coordinated assault on a bank's systems, overwhelming them with a flood of queries that hinder the processing of legitimate customer requests and transactions on the website and online services.In addition to DDoS protection, banks are required to impose restrictions on remote logins and access to critical systems. They must also conduct thorough scans of all information systems to detect viruses and malware, and ensure that the latest patches are installed after necessary testing.Also Read | RBI’s overseas gold reserves drop to 6-year low!

The central bank has noted that cyberattacks tend to increase during times of political and economic instability, such as geopolitical tensions, leading to disruptive consequences.An industry official told the financial daily, “About a year ago, a similar communication was issued by the regulator and CERT-In (the Computer Emergency Response Team under the ministry of electronics). Typically, when there is some hint of a possible cyberattack, banks simultaneously test the efficacy of their continuity and contingency plans. It's the same this time”.The regulatory communication emphasizes the importance of banks having robust offline backup and recovery strategies in place, and testing their effectiveness.The official further stated, ""Given the numerous instances of attacks, some of which may go unreported, authorities and institutions can't take intelligence input lightly.""","The Reserve Bank of India has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks.

3 reasons why Roman Reigns can return at WWE Money in the Bank 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/3-reasons-why-roman-reigns-can-return-at-wwe-money-in-the-bank-2024/articleshow/111437868.cms,"Roman Reigns is the hot topic among wrestling fans. Fans are anxiously awaiting the comeback of The Tribal Chief , but it won't be an ordinary one. After what The Bloodline did to Paul Heyman , Roman won't spare the squad members. However, that's just one reason for his return. There are also unresolved issues between him and Solo Sikoa that may lead to his appearance at Money in the Bank.Here are the reasons why Roman Reigns can return at WWE Money in the Bank 20241) For Paul HeymanPaul Heyman is someone Roman Reigns has always admired. He serves not only as Reigns' Wiseman but also as a mentor, a role Roman openly acknowledges. The chemistry between them is extraordinary, and Roman has never mocked or disrespected Paul during his time in the WWE. Solo is fully aware of this and understands that attacking Paul Heyman is something Roman would never tolerate. He knows that by targeting Paul, they have indirectly disrespected Roman. Consequently, Roman is certain to appear at Money in the Bank to demonstrate to Solo and the Bloodline the gravity of their mistake.2) War to become the Tribal ChiefBelieve it or not, the war between Solo and Roman has already begun, with the main issue being the position of The Tribal Chief. Roman earned this title through an undefeated championship streak against the top competitors in the business, and the WWE Universe recognizes his spectacular performances. In contrast, Solo has claimed the position of The Tribal Chief without demonstrating the same level of achievement as Roman.There is speculation that a match between Solo and Roman for The Tribal Chief title might take place at SummerSlam 2024 in August. Roman's return to Money in the Bank would signal the start of his rivalry with Solo Sikoa, making it a significant reason for his comeback at Money in the Bank 2024. Upon his return, Roman plans to teach the Bloodline members a lesson and show them what it means to be a true Tribal Chief, marking the beginning of Roman's babyface era.3) The Bloodline vs The Bloodline 2.0The current members of The Bloodline include Solo Sikoa, Tama Tonga, Tanga Loa, and Jacob Fatu, now known as The Bloodline 2.0, a much more ruthless incarnation than the previous members. Previously, The Bloodline consisted of Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Roman Reigns, and Solo Sikoa. With Sikoa forming a new alliance, Jey, Jimmy, and Roman are now considered part of the original Bloodline. An epic clash is anticipated when these two factions collide.Roman Reigns might need assistance from Jey and Jimmy Uso to defeat Solo Sikoa. While he can handle Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa, Sikoa and Jacob Fatu pose a greater challenge. Therefore, it's likely that Roman will ally with Jey and bring Jimmy along to take down Bloodline 2.0.Recently, there have been rumors about Zilla Fatu, son of the late great Umaga, joining WWE. If this happens, Roman would have Jimmy, Jey, and Zilla backing him against Solo, Tama, Tanga, and Jacob. A clash between The Bloodline and Bloodline 2.0 would be a spectacle to watch at SummerSlam 2024, with the outcome hinging on the Money in the Bank event.",Roman Reigns is expected to return to WWE at Money in the Bank 2024. There are unresolved issues between him and Solo Sikoa that may lead to his appearance. Roman plans to teach the Bloodline members a lesson and show them what it means to be a true Tribal Chief.

Threat to cause 'trouble' is not 'extortion'; hence no MCOCA case attracted says HC; grants bail to 5,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/threat-to-cause-trouble-is-not-extortion-hence-no-mcoca-case-attracted-says-hc-grants-bail-to-5/articleshow/111466017.cms,"MUMBAI: In an order Friday the Bombay high court granted bail to a group of individuals who were charged under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) for alleged extortion . Justice Manish Pitale, sitting singly, stated that the threat in question, which asked ""him to desist from doing certain acts, failing which the informant would face 'trouble',"" did not qualify as a threat to cause death, grievous hurt, or an offence punishable with death or life imprisonment.Consequently, the invocation of MCOCA was found to be prima facie unsustainable.The bail applications were filed by Mohammed Kapadia, Vipul Gajipura, and three others in connection with a 2022 FIR lodged by the Anti-Extortion Cell, Mumbai. The accused had been behind bars since 2022. Senior Counsel Aabad Ponda, along with advocates Rajendra Rathod, Mithilesh Mishra, and Husen Shaikh, for the accused argued that MCOCA was wrongly invoked as the requirements for a third FIR and ""continued unlawful activity"" in Maharashtra were not met. Ponda also contended that the offences under Sections 387 (extortion) and 506(2) (criminal intimidation) of the IPC were not made out, even if the informant's statement leading to the FIR registration was accepted as is.Public Prosecutor Hiten Venegaonkar opposed the bail plea, stating that the complaint's tenor disclosed that the businessman had previously received a threat to extort ₹50 lakh if he intended to carry on business in Gujarat. The complainant also received a call in Mumbai from an international mobile number, asking him to desist from reporting the threats given in Gujarat and to abide by the demands made.However, the High Court accepted Ponda's submissions and granted bail, considering that no prima facie case of extortion was made out in Mumbai, and thus, MCOCA was not attracted. The court also factored in the unexplained delay in lodging the FIR. Justice Pitale held that even if the alleged threat received by the informant in Mumbai was accepted at face value, the essential ingredients of the offence under Section 387 of the IPC could not prima facie be said to be made out.Advocate Nitin Patil for the complainant adopted Venegaokar’s submissions.Justice Pitale held the present case, the threat allegedly received by the informant at Mumbai, indicates that he was asked not to contact two of the accused persons, not to contact them by phone and not to make phone calls here and there, failing which the informant would face “trouble”. The HC said though the State stressed that the informant was also directed to do as demanded by the persons from Surat who are the accused and “none else” yet “essential ingredients” of extortion are not made out.","The Bombay high court granted bail to a group of individuals charged under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) for alleged extortion.

MLAs tussle to land new airport project for Bengaluru,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/mlas-tussle-to-land-new-airport-project-for-bengaluru/articleshow/111473108.cms,"BENGALURU: The govt’s proposal to construct a second international airport for Bengaluru has triggered an intense tussle among Congress MLAs — albeit of another kind.Legislators representing assembly seats around the city are lobbying for the new airport to be situated in their constituencies, setting the stage for a spirited debate within the governing party.Infrastructure minister MB Patil recently held a highlevel meeting to initiate steps to develop a greenfield airport aimed at alleviating mounting traffic and cargo demands at Kempegowda International Airport ( KIA ) in Devanahalli.The current concession agreement with Bengaluru International Airport Ltd ( BIAL ), which operates KIA, restricts the launch of any new airport within a 150km radius until 2033. The state govt is keen on having the new airport operational shortly after this deadline.The govt has hinted that it plans to build the new airport near Tumakuru, about 70km from Bengaluru. Surveys are ongoing at various potential sites, but this hasn’t prevented intense competition among MLAs regarding the optimal location.Home minister G Parameshwara , who represents Koratagere assembly segment in Tumakuru, is advocating Sira in the district or anywhere between Pavagada and Chitradurga, proposing an allocation of 8,000 acres for the project. Deputy chief ministerDK Shivakumar is lobbying for Bidadi or Harohalli industrial area.Magadi MLA HC Balakrishna has proposed Magadi, Solur, or Dabaspet, stressing potential economic benefits and regional development an airport could bring. “We must ensure the benefits of such a big infrastructure project are spread across the state while maintaining fea sibility,” said Balakrishna.Acknowledging the different perspectives, minister Patil said the selection of the site would hinge on meticulous planning and criteria addressing logistical and strategic requirements.Experts and urbanists have also weighed in, suggesting the govt reconsider reopening HAL airport for short-haul flights and proposing locations between Bengaluru and Mysuru, such as Bidadi for the new airport, citing strategic advantages and potential for interstate collaboration since Tamil Nadu plans to build an airport at Hosur on the border.“Bidadi’s strategic location between Bengaluru and Mysuru makes it a suitable choice for the new airport, aligning with historical considerations and fostering interstate cooperation,” said noted urbanist Ashwin Mahesh.","Legislators representing assembly seats around the city are lobbying for the new airport to be situated in their constituencies.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

The turbulence resulted in several injuries among the passengers , prompting the emergency diversion, the airline said on X.The affected passengers received immediate medical attention, with some being transported to Monsenhor Walfredo Gurgel hospital in Natal.The Uruguayan foreign ministry reported that several of the injured passengers have already been discharged.A diplomatic source from Uruguay indicated that ""between 25 and 30"" people sustained injuries, although this figure is not yet final. Most of the injuries were classified as ""mild trauma,"" and there were no immediate life-threatening cases, the source added.Air Europa announced that a replacement plane would depart from Madrid later on Monday to continue the journey to Montevideo with the remaining passengers.Air safety experts emphasize the importance of wearing seatbelts at all times during flights to mitigate the risks associated with sudden turbulence. Scientists have noted an increase in clear air turbulence, attributed to climate change, with a 2023 study showing a 17 per cent rise in annual turbulence duration from 1979 to 2020, and severe cases increasing by over 50 per cent.Earlier this year, a fuselage panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX, and two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 resulted in the deaths of 346 people. These events have intensified scrutiny on Boeing's safety and manufacturing practices.In response to the ongoing safety concerns, Boeing announced the departure of CEO Dave Calhoun in March and revealed plans to acquire its subcontractor Spirit to enhance safety and quality control.Boeing is also under scrutiny from the US Department of Justice (DOJ), which concluded in May that the company could face prosecution for violating a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement related to the 737 MAX crashes. The DOJ has reportedly offered Boeing a plea deal to avoid a trial, but victims' families are calling for criminal prosecution and seeking a nearly $25 billion fine.","Air Europa Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner made an emergency landing in Natal, northeastern Brazil, on Monday after encountering strong turbulence.

Bob Menendez says he didn't testify because prosecution failed to prove its bribery case against him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bob-menendez-says-he-didnt-testify-because-prosecution-failed-to-prove-its-bribery-case-against-him/articleshow/111473958.cms,"NEW YORK: New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez said he chose not to testify Wednesday at his New York trial because he believes prosecutors failed to prove ""every aspect"" of the bribery case against him, a decision that cleared the way for closing arguments as early as Monday.Lawyers for the Democrat rested their case after calling several witnesses over two days to counter seven weeks of testimony and hundreds of exhibits and communications introduced by Manhattan federal prosecutors .Menendez, 70, maintains he is not guilty of charges that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in gold and cash from 2018 through 2022 in exchange for using his clout in the Senate to deliver favors benefiting three New Jersey businessmen.Judge Sidney H. Stein asked Menendez to rise from his seat to confirm that the decision not to testify was his alone. Menendez said that after extensive talks with his lawyers, he had decided against taking the stand.As he left the courthouse, Menendez told reporters: ""From my perspective, the government has failed to prove every aspect of its case.""He said that to ""give them another chance"" by taking the witness stand was ""simply not something that makes any sense to me whatsoever.""""I expect my lawyers will produce a powerful and convincing summation, deduce how the evidence came out, and where they failed across the board, and how the jury will render a verdict of not guilty,"" Menendez said before wishing reporters who followed him to his car a ""Happy Fourth of July.""Two of the businessmen he is accused of accepting bribes from - Fred Daibes and Wael Hana - are on trial with him. A third, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty to charges and testified against the trio during the trial.Daibes and Hana also have pleaded not guilty and were given an opportunity to present a defense, though the judge told jurors that the burden is on prosecutors and a defense was not required. Lawyers for Daibes rested at the same time as Menendez without presenting a defense. Hana's lawyers began presenting their case by calling one of Hana's employees as a witness.Prosecutors took seven weeks to present their case before resting last Friday. They offered evidence to show that Menendez's wife, Nadine Menendez, served as a go-between most times to connect the senator and the businessmen.Nadine Menendez, 57, who began dating the senator in 2018, has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, but her trial has been postponed as she recovers from breast cancer surgery.Lawyers for Bob Menendez have argued that his wife hid her financial troubles from him, including an inability to afford mortgage payments on her Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, home, along with many of her dealings with the businessmen. They've also said she inherited gold found in her bedroom during a 2022 FBI raid on their home.An FBI agent testified earlier in the trial that he ordered the seizure of more than $486,000 in cash and over $100,000 in gold bars during the raid because he suspected that a crime may have taken place.Among witnesses called by Menendez's lawyers was his sister, Caridad Gonzalez, 80, who told the jury that members of her family routinely stored large amounts of cash at their homes after Menendez's parents fled Cuba in 1951 with only the money they had hidden in the secret compartment of a grandfather clock.""It's normal. It's a Cuban thing,"" she said.Bob Menendez was born after the family arrived in Manhattan.Menendez has pleaded not guilty to bribery, fraud, extortion, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent of Egypt. After the charges were announced in September, he was forced out of his powerful post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.He has resisted calls to resign from the Senate and a month ago filed papers to run for reelection as an independent.Prosecutors allege that Daibes delivered gold bars and cash to Menendez and his wife to get the senator's help with a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund, prompting Menendez to act in ways favorable to Qatar's government.They also say Menendez did things benefiting Egyptian officials in exchange for bribes from Hana as the businessman secured a valuable deal with the Egyptian government to certify that imported meat met Islamic dietary requirements.A previous corruption prosecution of Menendez on unrelated charges ended with a deadlocked jury in 2017.","Bob Menendez said he chose not to testify because he believes prosecutors failed to prove ""every aspect"" of the bribery case against him. Menendez, 70, maintains he is not guilty of charges that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in gold and cash from 2018 through 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111473990,imgsize-1304786,width-400,resizemode-4/111473990.jpg"

The Indian-American billionaire said the more the Democrats delay choosing their 'puppet', it's best for them -- contrary to the popular belief as there will be a honeymoon period after a new candidate is picked.The Democrats' ideal situation would be the election to be held during that honeymoon period sans public scrutiny, Vivek Ramaswamy said.""A lot of geniuses are coming out of the woodwork to predict that it won’t be Biden, but that’s been obvious for over a year. The real question is what’s going to happen in the next 4 months. Follow the incentives: the later the Dems make the switch, the more advantageous it actually is for them,"" Vivek posted on X.Explaining, Vivek added, ""There’ll be the initial 3-4 month “honeymoon phase” where the public, aided by MSM coverage, is likely to fall in love with *anyone* they put up as Biden’s successor. At minimum, it’ll be the public’s sense of relief, akin to the feeling of gratitude that a tortured prisoner feels for his liberator.The Democrats’ ideal scenario is for the election to occur during that honeymoon phase, long before the “public scrutiny” of the new nominee begins. Every day that passes between now & late August to make the switch, the better off they will be. Conventional wisdom says it’s messy for them to swap someone out late, but it’s increasingly clear that view is wrong.""Meanwhile, the Republicans will stand for what it stands for ""irrespective of which puppet the Democratic machine puts up next"".""Individual, family, nation, and God beats race, gender, sexuality and climate. Trump’s embrace of national pride & American exceptionalism is something that countless Americans are hungry for, regardless of race or party. That’s how we win & save our nation,"" Vivek posted.","Vivek Ramaswamy, who is being seen as the Republican's VP candidate, offered a piece of advice with a banter to the Democrats as speculations are rife over Biden alternatives.

Donald Trump-Jeffrey Epstein: 'Before marrying Melania in 2005': What new documents claim about Trump-Epstein,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/before-marrying-melania-in-2005-what-new-documents-claim-about-trump-epstein/articleshow/111465121.cms,"What are the new revelations?

According to reports the Trump phone messages, now released, were in a file marked 'Triangle' which was the code for the Epstein case. Before marrying Melania in 2005, Trump was calling Jeffrey Epstein on the regular in 2004. The newly revealed messages are reportedly in between girls calling to confirm massage appointments. The transcripts reveal that Florida prosecutors were aware of Epstein's sexual transgression two years before they cut a plea deal. The transcripts show that the grand jury heard testimony that Epstein, who was then in his 40s, had raped teenage girls as young as 14 at his Palm Beach mansion, often paying them so he could commit statutory rape or assault. The teenagers testified and told detectives they were also paid cash or rented cars if they found him more girls. Another teenager told detectives that she was 17 years old when she was approached by a friend who said she could make $200 by providing a massage at Epstein’s home.

New documents which were unreleased so far claim that Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein were closer than it was believed. Transcripts show Trump called Epstein many times between 2004 and 2006. The screenshots were sealed in 2008 as part of Alexander Acosta's deal for Jeffrey Epstein and were released on July 1.The fresh revelation has the anti-Trump camp up in the arms ahead of the election.""Trump’s name appears over and over again on Jeffrey Epstein’s message logs in the grand jury docs released this week. It is also undisputed: Trump’s name appears 7 times on Epstein’s private jet flight logs, that Epstein flew on Trump’s jet with a young girl of indeterminate age, girls who Epstein trafficked worked at Mar-A-Lago, a girl Epstein trafficked mentioned visiting Trump’s casino in a recently released deposition transcript. Trump said Epstein is a great guy who likes girls on the younger side, Trump frequently “partied” with Epstein, Trump wished Ghislaine Maxwell well at her criminal trial, and someone who testified under the pseudonym JANE DOE at the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal trial stated that she was introduced to Trump by Epstein when she was 14 years old,"" a user posted on X.As the transcripts went viral on X, a community note claimed Donald Trump and Epstein talked about a piece of real estate in which they both were interested. Citing a report of the Washington Post, it said they fell out over the issue.","The newly revealed messages are reportedly in between girls calling to confirm massage appointments.

Ivanka Trump: Ivanka Trump says politics is pretty dark world but...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ivanka-trump-says-politics-is-pretty-dark-world-but-/articleshow/111462749.cms,"Amid speculations over Melania Trump 's blink-and-miss role in her husbands presidential campaign, Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump said she will attend the Republican National Convention where his father will officially accept the nomination for president. Ivanka had a major role in 2016 and 2020 but this time she is not seen around much. In an interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, she said politics is a ""rough, rough business"" and a ""pretty dark world"" but she is there to support her father.Having left politics, she will not be there in any political capacity at the event though.Ivanka spoke about her father's conviction in the hush money case and said it was painful to experience. “On a human level, it’s my father and I love him very much, so it’s painful to experience, but ultimately, I wish it didn’t have to be this way,” Ivanka said.During Trump's presidency, Ivanka served as a senior advisor in the administration but in the last four years, she recoiled from politics and has not been a part of her father's 2024 campaign. She said politics is not a part-time business and it was not possible for her to balance her family and a political role simultaneously.“I think first and foremost, it was a decision rooted in me being a parent, really thinking about what they need from me now...Politics is a rough, rough business and I think it’s one that you also can’t dabble in. I think you have to either be all in or all out,"" she told Fridman.“And I know today, the cost [my children] would pay for me being all in, emotionally in terms of my absence at such a formative point in their life. And I’m not willing to make them bear that cost, the mother of Arabella (12), Joseph (9) and Theodore (7) said.“I also think for politics, it’s a pretty dark world. There’s a lot of darkness, a lot of negativity, and it’s just really at odds with what feels good for me as a human being,” she said.","Ivanka spoke about her father's conviction in the hush money case and said it was painful to experience.

Ra'Ad: Pakistan arming JF-17 jets with Ra'ad nuke missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-arming-jf-17-jets-with-raad-nuke-missiles/articleshow/111454243.cms,"A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft. The photograph depicts a JF-17 carrying what appears to be a Ra'ad air-launched cruise missile (ALCM), marking the first public observation of this configuration.Analyzing images of a JF-17 Thunder Block II from the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade rehearsals, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) confirmed that the fighter jet was equipped with a Ra'ad-I nuclear missile.""Notably, this was the first time such a configuration had been observed in public,"" the FAS said in its report.To determine the specific type of Ra'ad missile in the image, comparisons were made with Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II missiles displayed in previous Pakistan Day Parades. While the Ra'ad-II, first unveiled in 2017, was presented as having nearly double the range capability of the Ra'ad-I, external features did not clearly distinguish the two versions until 2022. The latest Ra'ad-II, displayed in 2022 and 2024, features a distinct 'x-shaped' tail fin configuration, while the missile photographed on the JF-17 more closely resembles the 'twin-tail' configuration of the Ra'ad-I, the FAS report said.Using Photoshop's Vanishing Point feature and reference measurements from the vehicles carrying the missiles, the lengths of the Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II were estimated to be around 4.9 meters each. The missile on the JF-17 was also measured using the aircraft's length as a reference, resulting in a similar 4.9-meter estimate. These measurements, along with the tail fin configuration, suggest that the missile observed on the JF-17 is likely the Ra'ad-I ALCM rather than the newer Ra'ad-II or the conventional anti-ship variant, Taimoor, the FAS report by Eliana Johns said.The image provides evidence that Pakistan has made significant progress in equipping its JF-17s with the capability to supplement or replace the nuclear strike role of the ageing Mirage III/Vs. However, questions remain about the deployment status of the Ra'ad systems and whether Pakistan will continue to retain a nuclear gravity bomb capability or transition to stand-off cruise missiles exclusively.These developments occur amidst an ongoing nuclear arms competition in the region, with Pakistan, India, and China pursuing advanced technologies such as multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). The heightened tensions and the development of short-range, lower-yield nuclear-capable systems by Pakistan have raised concerns about accelerated arms racing and escalation risks in a potential conflict between India and Pakistan.",A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft.
