What is in store for the future?

People engaged in Banarasi sari and textile industry believe that a policy should be formulated keeping ground realities in view instead of tackling it with the policy formulated for MSMEs. What is your take on it?



Arrival of Modi in 2014 had increased expectations of Banarasi textile to compete effectively with Surat industry. How do you see this competition?

What growth is expected in the textile sector, especially in Varanasi and UP?

Why could the dependency on import of silk yarns not be reduced so far?

Markets have been in the shape of ‘mandis’ (depot) for centuries but after the arrival of KV Dham, trade in most of these markets is getting hampered due to overcrowding of pilgrims round the year. How is this issue being tackled?

NEW DELHI: After holding a roadshow on his nomination eve and a Nari Shakti Samvad in Kashi , Prime Minister Narendra Modi left the responsibility of the poll campaign in his parliamentary constituency for his party cadre and the people of Kashi. Among star campaigners, Union textile minister Piyush Goyal camped in Varanasi for several days and met morning walkers, replying to queries of youth entrepreneurs, chartered accountants, and Banarasi sari traders. In an interview with Rajeev Dikshit, Goyal shared the PM’s vision on Varanasi’s development:The journey of Kashi’s development witnessed in the last 10 years made the world aware about the extraordinary capacity of the hardworking people of Kashi as they not only kept the economy growing but also preserved their faith and religion. Kashi Vishwanath Dham is an ideal example. After the arrival of KV Dham, 16 crore pilgrims have visited Varanasi in the last two and a half years and gave a mega boost to the city’s economy.Varanasi will soon emerge as the number one city in India. Rapid development is being ensured under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The infrastructure development carried out in Varanasi in the last 10 years in view of growing economy and demand will bring enormous opportunities for the people of Kashi and Purvanchal. People will utilise these opportunities to increase their wealth, lifestyle and better education for children. The PM works with the vision for long term outcomes. His multidimensional vision will ensure radical change in Varanasi.Each sector has its character and value proposition. Cottage industries, handloom, and khadi have special place, importance and demands. Each sector has its strengths and weaknesses. The world today has become cost conscious. Varanasi makes a major contribution to the growth of cottage and khadi emporiums, Khadi and village industries as well as the handloom sector. Varanasi and cottage industries both are contributing to the country’s economy.Don’t see this competition based on ‘versus’. We work for the co-existence of Banarasi, Surat and all Indian textile hubs. Both have their own importance and place, and we want to see both growing.To meet the requirements of the textile industry, the PM launched a 5F mission (Farm to fibre to fabric to fashion to foreign). For this, seven mega textile parks, including one in Hardoi, were established. It is our vision that a holistic ecosystem is created in UP, a complete value chain comes here and Varanasi as well as all other cities are benefitted from it.Work on ensuring trademark and branding of yarns, be it wool, cotton or silk, is in progress. We have started promoting cotton yarn in the brand name of Kastoori cotton. Brand name of Indian wool has also been finalised. Indian silk like Eri, Mulberry and many more varieties have their value. We are planning their branding too.Under Modiji’s leadership, all the issues are tackled by incorporating the ideas and suggestions of people. I have been apprised about the issues of traders and industry of Kashi. We Centre and state govt will discuss the issue with the industry representative to find a solution. There is no problem that can’t be solved. Modiji believes that lakhs of problems will emerge but the country has crores of brains to find solutions.Work on ensuring trademark and branding of yarns, be it wool, cotton or silk, is in progress.

Tactics and Content

Impact Assessment

NEW DELHI: An OpenAI investigation has revealed that an Israeli company, STOIC , attempted to interfere in the recent Lok Sabha elections in India by peddling an anti-BJP agenda . This covert influence operation, dubbed ""Zero Zeno,"" was part of a larger effort by the firm to manipulate public opinion across various regions, including Canada, the United States, Israel, and Ghana.The operation used artificial intelligence (AI) to generate web articles and social media comments, which were then disseminated across multiple platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and X. The content targeted audiences in India, focusing on criticizing the ruling BJP party and praising the opposition Congress party. This campaign was detected and disrupted less than 24 hours after it began.The Zero Zeno campaign employed a range of tactics to create the illusion of engagement and authenticity. The operation used AI to create fictional personas and social media bios, tailored to specific variables like age, gender, and location. Additionally, fake accounts were set up to comment on and engage with posts made by the operation itself, attempting to fabricate the impression of genuine audience interaction.The campaign's content was divided into several topical clusters. While some focused on local issues such as the Gaza conflict and Jewish-Muslim relations, others specifically targeted political scenarios in different regions. For India, the comments were critical of the BJP and supportive of the Congress party. Other clusters included anti-Hamas, anti-Qatar, pro-Israel, and pro-Histadrut (an Israeli trade union) content.Despite the concerted efforts of the Zero Zeno campaign, the operation failed to attract significant engagement from real audiences. The majority of the interaction was limited to the operation's own inauthentic accounts. Various social media platforms, including Meta and X, have already disabled many of these accounts, limiting the potential reach and impact of the campaign.Using the Breakout Scale, which measures the impact of influence operations, Zero Zeno's activities were assessed at Category 2. This indicates activity across multiple platforms and websites but with no substantial amplification by real users.Reacting strongly to the report IT and electronics minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said, ""It is absolutely clear and obvious that @BJP4India was and is the target of influence operations, misinformation and foreign interference, being done by and/or on behalf of some Indian political parties.""""This is very dangerous threat to our democracy. It is clear vested interests in India and outside are clearly driving this and needs to be deeply scrutinized/investigated and exposed. My view at this point is that these platforms could have released this much earlier, and not so late when elections are ending,"" he added.","An Israeli company, STOIC, attempted to interfere in the recent Lok Sabha elections in India by peddling an anti-BJP agenda.

There will be some rainfall activity over peninsular India in the next few days, but it may be subdued. It will take a few days for the monsoon to re-align, thus causing a delay in monsoon entry over south Maharashtra and later even northwest India. June rainfall forecast for northwest India shows below normal rains.""GP Sharma, president, Skymet Weather Services, said, ""The main trigger for monsoon advancement are systems forming along either side of both the Indian coasts. These features don't seem to be there and may not be there in the next few days. Whatever rain activity we see in peninsular India in the next few days will be akin to thundershowers or localised rain, atypical of monsoon activity. There could be a delay in its onset over parts of Maharashtra and even regions such as Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.""According to an IMD update on Friday, the southwest monsoon advanced into remaining parts of northeast Bay of Bengal and some parts of northwest Bay of Bengal, remaining parts of Tripura, Meghalaya and Assam and most parts of sub-Himalayan West Bengal & Sikkim. Conditions are favourable for its further advance into some more parts of central Arabian Sea, remaining parts of south Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep area and Kerala, some parts of Karnataka, some more parts of Tamil Nadu and southwest Bay of Bengal during next two-three days.","The southwest monsoon lost its steam barely a day after reaching Kerala.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: India is currently grappling with the severe heatwave sweeping across several states, making it harder to deal with important events like s and putting pressure on essential services.In Bihar , soaring temperatures exceeding 44 degrees Celsius have resulted in the tragic deaths of at least 19 individuals, including polling personnel and civilians. The scorching conditions have prompted medical facilities to handle numerous cases of heatstroke, underscoring the urgent need for preventive measures.Similarly, in Odisha and Jharkhand, suspected heatstroke claimed lives and led to a surge in hospital admissions, prompting authorities to issue advisories urging residents to stay indoors and avoid outdoor activities during peak daytime hours.Meanwhile, in Delhi, the heatwave has not only burdened the populace with a water crisis but has also tested the resilience of the legal system, prompting courts to adapt protocols and seek relief measures for lawyers and litigants.Bihar faced intense heatwave conditions during critical election days, resulting in the deaths of at least 19 people. Temperatures soared above 44 degrees Celsius in Aurangabad and Kaimur districts.Medical facilities reported numerous cases of heatstroke, with some casualties including polling personnel and a teacher. Authorities implemented measures to provide medical assistance and urged caution during election activities.Dr Sahil Raj, a doctor at Kaimur's Mohania sub-divisional hospital, said that on Thursday, a total of about 40 people had come to the hospital who had been affected by heat stroke.""Among them, two persons, including polling personnel, had come to me who died due to heat stroke. 30 to 40 people, including police personnel, are undergoing treatment. Many have been sent home after treatment, while others are undergoing treatment,"" he said.Meanwhile, three people have died in Bihar's Arrah in Bhojpur district after suffering from an extreme heatwave in the region.""Three people have been reported dead. One of them is a home guard who was brought to the hospital but could not be saved. In addition to this, there was a presiding officer in Jagdishpur who was on duty. He was stabilised and then referred, but he died in the hospital. Another person, Rajesh Ram, collapsed,"" Bhojpur district magistrate Mahendra Kumar said.In Bihar's Aurangabad, the death toll due to heat wave conditions has reached 12, with more than 20 patients admitted to different hospitals across the district, officials from the Aurangabad Health Department said.Bihar is voting in all seven phases of the Lok Sabha elections, with the final phase scheduled for Saturday, June 1.At least three high courts have permitted lawyers to discard the robes and coats for the summer, although the Supreme Court is being urged to make it a general rule for all lawyers in the country.Judges at one New Delhi court postponed a case this week until later in the year, complaining about a lack of air conditioning and water supply.While India's Supreme Court and most high courts have air conditioning, many lower courts and consumer forums depend on fans and have poor ventilation.Three of the court's judges issued a written order this week stating they had declined to hear a case due to high temperatures in the court room. They adjourned the case for the cooler month of November.""There is neither air conditioner nor cooler in the court room ... There is too much heat. There is no water supply even to go to the washroom to ease ourselves ... In these circumstances, arguments cannot be heard,"" the order said.New Delhi recorded temperatures of around 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit) for the first time this week, forcing authorities to restrict water supply, shut schools and set up heatstroke units at hospitals.They have also deployed paramedics to polling stations for the final day of India's massive general election on Saturday in case any voters fall ill as they queue in the heat. A 40-year-old labourer died of heat stroke on Wednesday.Delhi faced a severe water shortage exacerbated by the ongoing heatwave, prompting the government to seek immediate additional water from neighbouring Haryana.Delhi government in its plea said that it is constrained to file the petition on account of the acute shortage of water being faced by the people of of Delhi, triggered by the ongoing severe heat conditions in North India, particularly in the national capital.""Direct the Respondent no. 1 (Haryana) for immediate and continuous release of water at the Wazirabad barrage,"" the plea stated.The record-high temperatures and heatwave in Delhi, which has resulted in maximum temperature rising up to around 50 degrees Celsius at some places, have caused an extraordinary and excessive surge in demand for water in the city, it said.As a result, the national capital is dealing with a water shortage which has led to frequent supply cuts in many parts of the NCT of Delhi, and has disrupted the daily life of the ordinary residents, added the plea.Madhya Pradesh continued to grapple with a severe heatwave, with temperatures soaring above 48 degrees Celsius in certain districts. The meteorological department issued alerts, predicting light rainfall in some areas due to a western disturbance. Authorities advised residents to stay indoors and take precautions against the scorching heat.According to the met office, Sidhi district recorded 48.2 degrees Celsius temperature and Khajuraho in Chhatarpur district stood at 47 degrees Celsius in the last 24 hours in the state.In what could bring some respite to the residents, the regional met office also predicted a light rainfall in some parts of the state due to a western disturbance as a cyclonic circulation is formed towards Jammu.""The maximum temperature was recorded in Sidhi, 48.2 degrees Celsius and Khajuraho recorded 47 degrees Celsius temperature in the last 24 hours in the state. The severe heatwave has also been recorded here and there are 10 more districts where a heatwave has been recorded in the last 24 hours,"" said Prakash Dhole, meteorologist, at IMD Bhopal.Besides, a western disturbance as a cyclonic circulation is formed towards Jammu, and along with that there is an upper air cyclone in Uttar Pradesh , a trough line has formed from that particular cyclonic wind which is going from Bihar to West Bengal and towards Sikkim. Due to this, IMD Bhopal has predicted that some districts of Gwalior Chambal division can see light rain and isolated rainfall can be seen in Anuppur Dindori in the next 24 hours, Dhole said.The Odisha government confirmed the deaths of five persons due to sunstroke so far, while an inquiry into 18 more casualties suspected to be linked to heat-related illness is currently underway.According to Satyabrata Sahu, Odisha's special relief commissioner (SRC), one death each has been confirmed in Balasore, Dhenkanal, Mayurbhanj, Sonepur, and Bolangir.Additionally, the government has received reports of 18 suspected sunstroke deaths, 12 from Sundergarh district and six from Jharsuguda district. However, Sahu emphasised that the exact cause of these deaths will be confirmed only after post-mortem examinations.Ashutosh Kulkarni, additional district magistrate of Sundargarh, said currently 10 heatstroke patients are receiving treatment at a private hospital in Rourkela, while 23 others are admitted to Rourkela Government Hospital, all in stable condition.Jharsuguda chief district medical officer Jayakrushna Nayak said six unnatural death cases have been reported in the district, with ongoing post-mortem examinations to determine if they were due to heatstroke.Four persons died of sunstroke in Jharkhand today, while 1,326 others were admitted to hospital amid sweltering heat in most parts of the eastern state, officials said.All district hospitals and other medical facilities have been asked to set aside air-conditioned rooms and empty beds for heatstroke patients, they said.A majority of the 24 districts in Jharkhand recorded temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius, with the mercury shooting above 47 degrees Celsius in places like Daltonganj and Garhwa.Apart from humans, the heatwave has also taken a toll on animals, especially bats.Deaths of bats are being reported from Hazaribag, Ranchi, Garhwa and Palamu among other parts of the state, the officials said.It is often seen that bats die during high temperatures, Dr Trivedi said, adding, that there have been reports of locals consuming dead bats in Garhwa.","In Bihar, soaring temperatures exceeding 44 degrees Celsius have resulted in the tragic deaths of at least 19 individuals. In Odisha and Jharkhand, suspected heatstroke claimed lives and led to a surge in hospital admissions. In Delhi, the heatwave has not only burdened the populace with a water crisis but has also tested the resilience of the legal system.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110600043,imgsize-975993,width-400,resizemode-4/110600043.jpg"
San Francisco flight delays: DGCA issues notice to AI over 'passenger discomfort',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/24-hour-delay-fainted-flyers-aviation-ministry-issues-notice-to-ai-over-traumatic-san-francisco-flight/articleshow/110590535.cms,"NEW DELHI: At about 16 hours, Air India ’s nonstops are the fastest way to travel between San Francisco (SFO) and India. But with passengers of two flights to SFO — one from Mumbai (AI 179 of May 24) and the other from Delhi (AI 183 of May 30) — within a week suffering 18 & 24-hour-long waits at the origin, including a long time onboard aircraft without proper air-conditioning in this excruciating heat, the DGCA has finally cracked the whip on the airline. The regulator on Friday issued a show cause to AI over “repeated incidences of passengers being put to discomfort” & “time and again failing to take due care of passengers.”The notice came as over 200 passengers were waiting at Delhi Airport for AI 183 to take off, almost 24 hours after it was supposed to at 3.30 pm on Thursday. Some passengers had reportedly fainted onboard this aircraft on Thursday evening during the long wait, in vain, for it to take off.“Al179 of 24/5 & Al 183 of 30/5 were inordinately delayed. Passengers were put to discomfort due to insufficient cooling in the cabin. Repeated (instances) of passengers being put to discomfort by Air India in violation of various DGCA provisions have come to notice…. AI has violated provisions of ‘facilities to be provided to passengers by airlines due to denied boarding, cancellation of flights and delays in flights’. AI is time and again failing in taking due care of passengers and compliance of (those rules),” the DGCA notice says. AI has been asked to explain within three days “why enforcement action (should) not be initiated against” it. SFO-bound AI 179 from Mumbai last Friday was delayed by 18 hours.AI 183 was to leave at 3.30 pm on Thursday (May 30) and the over 200 passenger had started arriving at T3 accordingly for the same from late morning. Their trauma started when first a technical glitch was detected in the Boeing 777 (of state-owned AI days and not the relatively new ones leased under Tatas’ ownership) that was to operate the route. “After getting engineering nod, passenger boarding started at 7 pm. Then pilots suspected another glitch in the plane and engineering was called in. After a check, engineering decided the aircraft could not operate the flight and had to be grounded for checks,” said sources.One of the passengers took to X (erstwhile Twitter) to highlight flyers’ plight. “Air India, please let mine and numerous other parents stranded at the boarding area go home! AI 183 is over 8 hours late. People were made to board the plane and sit without AC. Then deplaned and not allowed to enter the terminal because immigration was done,” Abhishek Sharma, a passenger, said on X from his handle @39abhishek at 10.44 pm on Thursday.In another post at at 8.43 am Friday, he said: “AI took passengers to a hotel. Room was provided by 2 am (Friday). A new boarding pass was provided with departure time of 11am. Parents are back at the airport and it seems even this flight is cancelled. No one from AI is helping” while requesting the PMO, aviation ministry and DGCA to “take note that these horror stories are a daily affair with AI.”On its part, AI acknowledged the delay and the aviation ministry notice. “No body fainted inside the aircraft but they must have felt uneasy at the long wait in this torrid Delhi summer. AI offered them choice of full refund, free rescheduling and hotel stay,” AI sources add. The flight was rescheduled to leave at 11 am on Friday and then also it was delayed. The same is expected to leave at 3 pm on Friday. AI did not comment on the DGCA’s show cause notice asking them to explain passenger sufferings.This is not an isolated case. Last week passengers of a Mumbai -SFO had a similar experience. Frequent flyers wonder why there is so little improvement in the airline even almost 2.5 years after the founder Tata Group acquired it from the government.""This is truly a daily affair. Second time in seven days (delayed flight to SFO). AI 179 Mumbai-SFO exact same thing. Someone needs to take action against this torture after paying lakhs,"" Tweeted another person.","The regulator on Friday issued a show cause to AI over “repeated incidences of passengers being put to discomfort” & “time and again failing to take due care of passengers” The notice came as over 200 passengers were waiting at Delhi Airport for AI 183 to take off, almost 24 hours after it was supposed to at 3.30 pm on Thursday.

Why do you call Modi’s term an eyewash?

You have raised the issue of e-rickshaws in Varanasi. What exactly is your complaint?

What are the top three issues in your constituency?

Why do you oppose the idea of Varanasi’s development as a tourist place?

You must be meeting a lot of supporters of the PM during campaigning. What do you tell them?

Women voters are said to be holding the key to this election. What sentiment have you gathered from them?

What would you like to tell those who say you took up a lost battle?

What is your winning formula?

INDIA bloc candidate and UPCC presidentis up against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the high-profile constituency of Varanasi. Despite tough challenge, he is confident that the people of Varanasi would support him. Talking to, he says that the problems of Varanasi are yet to be solved. Excerpts:It is awesome. Cadre and members of INDIA bloc, including those from Aam Aadmi Party and the Left parties, are working in unison with their full strength to defeat BJP. People of Kashi are supporting me wholeheartedly.Whenever PM Modi comes, the local administration starts a cover-up exercise. The glittering image of Kashi has a dark side hidden behind the curtains to camouflage the real situation. Why are curtains used if some real development has taken place in Kashi? And on top of it, you compare it with Kyoto. Ganga is still not clean. Sewage water is pouring into the sacred river at Assi and Rajghat. Traffic jams are still there. Youths of Varanasi are searching for jobs. Many good projects for Kashi have been taken to other places. People of Kashi are watching all this, and they would give a befitting reply.People from Gujarat get all kinds of works here while resident of Varanasi are given e-rickshaws. They have been kept in subordination of contractors from Gujarat to clean sewers or work as supervisors.No new industry has come up in Varanasi. Contractors and businessmen from Gujarat are dominating every activity in Kashi. The list includes development of the corridor, and cleanliness of the city. Third and most important is unplanned development and frequent traffic jams. Ropeway cannot solve traffic problems.Varanasi is not a tourist place as mistaken by many people. Ye dharm aur adhyatm ki nagri hai. Ye moksh aur sanskriti ki nagri hai. Yahan jo bhi aata tha, aastha se aata tha. Today, everything has become commercialised. Even the people of Varanasi have to pay for darshan of Baba Vishwanath which was a free facility before the arrival of corridor. We oppose this. Mahadev belongs to one and all.Whenever I meet Modi’s supporters, I leave them with questions regarding the future of their children. I ask them if their children are getting good jobs? I ask them if they aren’t affected by price rise and inflation? Many of them have no answer.Who can forget the (alleged) rape of IIT-BHU student. Modiji didn’t even write a single line condemning the incident. Only token action was taken and Yogiji who claims about strong law and order did not bulldoze the houses of these accused.Someone challenging the PM of India cannot be an ordinary soul. A person who embodies honesty, hardwork, commitment, integrity and desire to serve the people will be in fray. And how are they sure that I will lose? What if Baba Vishwanath blesses me to create history like Raj Narain (another resident of Varanasi, who defeated former PM Indira Gandhi)?I am the true son of this soil and Banaras appreciates honesty and straightforwardness.","Ajay Rai is up against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the high-profile constituency of Varanasi.

""The firm has apologised in writing for the blatant disregard of the honour and integrity associated with the medals after the Army threatened to file an FIR . The firm has also assured us it would not repeat the mistake in the future,"" the officer added.Earlier, the Army even initiated ""appropriate action"" against a retired Lt-Colonel, who appeared in a YouTube podcast wearing the rank of a Colonel , under Section 140 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for violation of provisions outlined in Para 666 of the Regulations (revised) for the Army, 2010.The IPC section provides for imprisonment up to three-months or fine, or both, if a person is found guilty of wearing a uniform or carrying any token used by a soldier, sailor or airman with the intent to make others believe he is a military man. The Army headquarters is now examining the Lt-Col's plea that it was an inadvertent mistake.""The Army and military intelligence, in conjunction with police, has also been conducting raids and taking action in various states like Maharashtra and Rajasthan, among others, against the unauthorised sale of its new patented combat uniform with 'a unique digital disruptive camouflage pattern',"" the officer said.Having registered an intellectual property right (IPR) over the new ergonomically-designed combat uniform that is ""lighter, stronger and more climate-friendly"", the Army says its manufacturing by any vendor who is not authorised to do so is illegal.""The uniform can be misused for terror strikes or gaining access to restricted areas,"" he added.The defence ministry and Army have also been repeatedly asking all ministries and states to not allow their uniformed personnel to wear camouflage fatigues akin to the force. This, for instance, can lead to false alarms that the Army has been deployed for crowd control or other law and order duties. ""Even private security agencies try to copy Army uniforms.

NEW DELHI: The north Indian states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and national capital Delhi are in grip of intense heatwave with temperatures in excess of 50°C in Rajasthan and Haryana. Delhi on Tuesday recorded its highest ever temperature with mercury reaching 49.9°C. Indian Metrological Department (IMD) has predicted the heatwave to continue for another two days.Rajasthan continued to suffer a blistering heat wave for the 17th consecutive day on Tuesday, with Churu being the hottest place in the state where the mercury touched the 50.5°C mark.In most places, the maximum temperature remained almost 5 degrees above the normal for this season.Health department confirmed three deaths caused by heatstroke in Jaipur on Tuesday, taking the official toll to four in the state so far. Two women from Delhi and Karnataka, both aged 63, and a 40-year-old man from Agra were undergoing treatment for heatstroke at Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur. The hospital administration said despite all possible efforts, they could not be saved.Sirsa’s maximum temperature on Tuesday touched 50.3°C in a heatwave-gripped Haryana, where mercury crossed 44°C during peak hours at 18 stations and electrical infrastructure couldn’t take the load. The last time it was so hot in Hisar, the first Maruti car had not come out yet from Gurugram.The next three hottest districts after Sirsa were Hisar, Narnaul and Rohtak, while even the Shivalik ranges couldn’t shield foothill stations Panchkula and Chandigarh from temperatures that baked them like Ambala and Karnal. The day temperature crossed 48°C in NCR districts Faridabad, Gurugram, and Sonipat, which was 1.1-to-6.1°C above normal.The grilled spots included Balsamand in Hisar (49.3°C), Nuh (49°C), Mahendragarh (48.8°C), Jind (48.7°C), Narnaul (48.5°C), Hisar and Faridabad (48.4°C), Jhajjar (48.2°C), Charkhi Dadri (48.1°C), Ottu in Sirsa (48°C), Bawal in Rewari (47.7°C), Rohtak (47.5°C), Mahendragarh outer (47.2°C), Gurugram (47°C), Karnal (46.5°C), Palwal (46.4°C), Sonipat (46.1°C), Karnal outer (45.9°C), Panipat outer (45.4°C), and Panchkula (45°C). Just three locations recorded temperature between 44 and 45°C during peak hours.Scorching heat, cloudless skies and searing winds blowing from Rajasthan sent Tuesday’s day temperature soaring to an all-time high on record in Delhi. While the mercury shot up to 49.9°C — nine notches above normal — in Mungeshpur and Narela, it was 49.8°C in Najafgarh.Apart from Mungeshpur, Narela and Najafgarh, several areas of the city, including Pitampura, Pusa and Jafarpur, also recorded severe heatwave on Tuesday, with the maximum temperature eight to nine notches above normal.With temperatures exceeding 42 degrees Celsius, people are prone to heat stroke, which is a medical emergency characterised by an elevation in core body temperature, often exceeding 104°F (40°C). Doctors say the heat stroke may lead to central nervous system dysfunction. When the body’s ther moregulatory mechanisms fail, extreme dehydration ensues, signalling an alarm.There is little respite in sight in the next two days, with India Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a red alert for heatwave and severe heatwave for Wednesday and an orange alert for Thursday, when the day temperature may witness a very slight drop. However, there’s a glimmer of hope: the capital may receive very light rain on Friday and Saturday, according to IMD.Punjab is due to elect its MPs on June 1, in a severe northwestern heat wave in which extreme highest temperatures have made daytime campaigning hazardous.The India meteorological department recorded the state's highest temperature of Tuesday to be 49.3°C at the Bathinda Airport, which was 8°C above normal. At many places in the state, the maximum temperature was between 44 and 47°C. In Bathinda town, the reading was 47.2°C. On Monday as well, Bathinda had recorded the highest temperature from across the state, at s little above 48°C.The IMD says that the temperature at the airports normally is observed to be 2 to 3°C more than the reading in the plains, since it is recorded from instruments placed at a height. The IMD has issued weather advisory, asking people to remain hydrated and avoid coming out between 11am and 4pm.In Safdarjung, the city’s base observatory, maximum temperature was 45.8 degrees, five degrees above normal, and the highest this year.","Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and national capital Delhi are in grip of intense heatwave.

The political angle

Fathers, grandfather's 'effort'

The bid to implicate a driver

The hospital role

JJB bail conditions

NEW DELHI: A drunk teenage boy from a powerful family crashes his Porsche into a bike, killing two young techies. What follows is a tangled web of cover-ups including blood sample swaps. It sounds like a plot twist in a thriller, but it happened in the real life. And the revelations keep comingThe Pune Porsche crash case took a new turn when experts indicated that the tampered blood samples belonged to a female. This revelation led to speculation that the samples might have been swapped with those of the teenage driver's mother.The police are now focusing their investigation on two key aspects: identifying the ""mystery woman"" who was seen accompanying the teen at the hospital and analyzing the DNA of the exchanged blood sample.According to assistant commissioner of Police (Crime) Sunil Tambe, the swap occurred in an area without CCTV surveillance.He further said, ""Halnor swapped the blood sample on the instructions of Dr Ajay Taware on May 19 when Yerawada police officers took the teen to the hospital for check-up.""The case continues to unfold with a series of unexpected developments leaving the authorities determined to unravel the truth behind the altered blood samples and the identity of the individuals involved.Dr. Ajay Taware, who had been arrested and was the head of forensic sciences at Sassoon General Hospital , was reinstated as the medical superintendent in April.This reinstatement was recommended by medical education minister Hasan Mushrif and NCP MLA Sunil Tingre . Following this, Dr. Vinayak Kale , the dean, was put on compulsory leave on Wednesday evening, just hours after he revealed information that significantly impacted the ongoing Porsche Taycan accident case.Mushrif informed reporters in Mumbai that he advocated for Taware's reinstatement as medical superintendent based on a missive from MLA Tingre.He said that the dean should have informed him that the doctor had not been cleared of previous accusations.The father of the minor, a rich and famous builder accused in the Pune Porsche crash case was arrested from Maharashtra's Sambajinagar.Agarwal faces charges under sections 75 and 77 of the Juvenile Justice Act for allegedly allowing his minor son to drive and imbibe alcohol.Vishal Agarwal tried to trick the police by moving between his properties in Pune and traveling to Kolhapur and Sambhajinagar using his friend's car.The police efficaciously tracked him using GPS technology and arrested him in Aurangabad.The boy's grandfather (77) was produced before a special court. He was remanded in police custody till May 28, although his lawyer, Prashant Patil, informed the court that he was in Delhi with his wife when the accident transpired in Kalyaninagar.He was arrested on the charge of abducting, threatening, and confining their family driver in their Wadgaonsheri residence in an attempt to coerce him to take blame for the crime.Minister Hasan Mushrif stated on Thursday that Dr. Ajay Taware was involved in swapping the blood sample of the teen driver during his long leave and made a deal of Rs 3 lakh with the minor’s father.Mushrif admitted that he had supported Taware’s reinstatement as medical superintendent of Sassoon Hospital in 2023 based on a recommendation from NCP MLA Sunil Tingre.However, he blamed Dr. Vinayak Kale, the dean until Wednesday evening, for not rejecting the appointment due to Taware's questionable history.The JJB's initial decision to grant bail to the 17-year-old with mild conditions like writing an 300 word essay and assisting traffic police for 15 days ignited national outrage. After a police appeal, the board changed its ruling, sending the teenager to an observation home until June 5.Also Read: Pune Porsche Accident","The Pune Porsche crash case took a new turn when experts indicated that the tampered blood samples belonged to a female.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"'911 S5': Chinese national arrested, FBI takes down huge global army of zombie computer devices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/911-s5-chinese-national-arrested-fbi-takes-down-massive-global-army-of-zombie-computer-devices/articleshow/110548700.cms,"The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely.

What was the ""911 S5"" botnet?

The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, it was ""likely the world's largest"" and facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and access to child exploitation materials.

Who was behind the botnet?

Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang was arrested in Singapore on May 24. He allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers.

How did the botnet operate?

The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely. Cybercriminals purchased access to these compromised computers, using them to carry out various illegal activities.

What kind of crimes were committed using the botnet?

Criminals used the botnet for a staggering array of crimes. These included identity theft, financial fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and cyberattacks. The botnet was also involved in defrauding financial institutions and federal lending programs, including pandemic relief scams. US Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that the criminals were responsible for over $5.9 billion in estimated losses from relief program fraud.

What assets were seized during the operation?

Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods valued at $4 million, and about $30 million in real estate. These assets were located in various countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, and others. Additionally, 22 domains associated with the botnet were also seized.

How did the law enforcement operation unfold?

The operation, named Operation Tunnel Rat, involved executing multiple search warrants and conducting interviews in Singapore and Thailand. The FBI, along with international partners, dismantled the botnet's infrastructure and arrested Wang. Authorities are also looking into the possibility of additional arrests.

How did the public get involved in this operation?

The FBI has set up a web page where individuals can check if their IP address was among those compromised by the botnet. This helps potential victims identify and mitigate any security issues stemming from the infection.

What happens next for Yunhe Wang?

The US is currently awaiting Wang's extradition from Singapore. Brett Leatherman, deputy assistant director with the FBI’s Cyber Division, emphasized the urgency of the extradition, stating, “We want him, you know, as soon as possible.”

An international law enforcement team has made a significant breakthrough in the fight against cybercrime, arresting a Chinese national and dismantling a massive botnet that has been operational for nearly a decade. This botnet, known as "" 911 S5 ,"" was responsible for various illegal activities, including identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud . The takedown involved cooperation between authorities in multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of cybercrime and the necessity of international collaboration to combat it.The botnet, managed by Yunhe Wang , infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This network of compromised machines, often referred to as ""zombie"" computers, was used by criminals to carry out a wide array of illicit activities. The US Department of Justice and the FBI have been instrumental in this operation, which has led to significant financial and operational seizures, including millions in cryptocurrency and luxury assets.Here is all you need to know:(With inputs from agencies)","The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries.

Hush money trial: Donald Trump is convicted on all 34 charges. Now what?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-trial-donald-trump-is-convicted-on-all-34-charges-now-what/articleshow/110577474.cms,"What happens now

The next step is for Judge Juan Merchan to approve the verdict and enter a final judgment. This is usually a formality. Sentencing typically follows within several weeks, but legal arguments can delay this process. Lawyers on both sides will recommend sentences, which will be debated at the sentencing hearing where Merchan will make a final decision.

Will Trump go to prison?

That is unlikely. While the maximum sentence for falsifying business records is four years in prison, it is rare for first-time offenders of this crime in New York to receive prison time. ""Punishments like fines or probation are more common,"" and alternatives like home confinement or curfews could be considered, given the logistical challenges of imprisoning a former president with a lifetime Secret Service detail.

Can Trump appeal the conviction?

Yes, Trump is expected to appeal. He may argue that the indictment was legally flawed and politically motivated. His defense will likely focus on several legal points, including that state election laws do not apply to federal elections and that the charges themselves were legally improper.

Could Trump still become president?

Yes, the US Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and natural-born US citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years. Even if he were in jail, Trump could theoretically be sworn in as president on January 20, 2025.

Can Trump vote for himself?

Yes, as long as Trump is not imprisoned in New York, he can vote for himself. Florida defers to other states' rules on felony disenfranchisement, and in New York, felons regain their voting rights once they are out of prison, even if on parole.

Will Trump's conviction affect his campaign?

The conviction does not legally prevent Trump from running for or becoming president. The Republican National Convention, which will take place shortly after his sentencing, has no rules disqualifying a convicted nominee. Trump remains popular among the GOP base, and the party's leadership is aligned with him.

What are the broader implications of this conviction?

The conviction marks unprecedented territory in US politics, especially as Trump faces three other criminal cases. The Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 counts after deliberating for two days. The trial included explicit testimony and evidence that implicated Trump in approving a $130,000 payment to silence Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign.

What are the next steps for Trump legally and politically?

Following his sentencing, Trump can appeal to higher courts. His defense team has already laid groundwork for appeals, citing potential judicial bias and procedural issues. Politically, Trump continues to rally support, painting the conviction as a politically motivated attack. Despite the legal challenges, leading strategists believe Trump remains a formidable candidate for the 2024 election.

"Improving energy resilience in Pakistan could avert 175,000 deaths by 2030, UNICEF says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/improving-energy-resilience-in-pakistan-could-avert-175000-deaths-by-2030-unicef-says/articleshow/110597885.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A new study by the United Nations children’s agency says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.UNICEF said improved energy resilience would also contribute $296 million to the country’s fragile economy over the next 20 years by reducing maternal, adult and infant mortality.The study, conducted by UNICEF’s Economist Impact Unit and released Friday, comes as Pakistan is experiencing an intense heatwave that has sickened thousands of people, further burdening the country's health care system.Temperatures in various parts of Pakistan soared as high as 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday. Authorities are urging people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.“Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,” said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.“Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,” Fadil said. ""We need the private sector to play a bigger role as public sector resources will not be enough. This is everybody’s business.”","UNICEF says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.

Those that started growing were infected with (parasite) black hopper,"" said Yusuf, who has worked half his life growing mangoes.Now over 60 years old, Yusuf said ""climate change has wreaked havoc"" in his village of Tando Allahyar, around 200 kilometres (124 miles) northeast of economic hub Karachi.Pakistan is the world's fourth-largest mango producer and agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of its GDP.Further south in Tando Ghulam Ali, Arsalan, who manages a 900-acre mango orchard, noticed the damage as soon as the harvest started this week.""We have production losses of 15 to 20 percent, and the picking has only just started so this figure will surely increase,"" said the 32-year-old.Exports will be slashed as a result warned Arsalan, who only goes by one name.""The mangoes turn yellow from the outside but remain underripe or overripe inside,"" he explained.Ziaul Haq, a mango grower and exporter from Tando Ghulam Ali, said the ""many attacks on fruit"" by pests were unprecedented.""This, in our history, has never happened before,"" he told AFP.'Feed our families'The proliferation of parasites has led to an explosion in spending on pesticides.This uptick was confirmed by several farmers in Sindh province, where Tando Allahyar and Tando Ghulam Ali are located, as well as those in the leading agricultural province of Punjab further north.They told AFP that chemicals are now used six to seven times per year, compared to just twice three years ago.Farmers in Sindh said they have been struggling since 2022 when a series of severe heatwaves were followed by unprecedented flooding, while those in Punjab said the declining crops yields date back several years more.""The losses in Punjab reached 35 to 50 percent and in Sindh, 15 to 20 percent"" compared to last year, said Waheed Ahmed, head of the Pakistan Federation of Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association (PFVA).Speaking to local media, he said that last year Pakistan had only managed to export 100,000 of the 125,000 tonnes of mangoes it planned to sell abroad.Pakistan's 20 varieties of mangoes come second only to oranges as the most-produced fruit in the country.The income loss from a poor harvest could have a significant impact on the country, which is in talks to secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Mashooq Ali, a 30-year-old labourer in Tando Ghulam Ali, wants the government to help farmers cope.""Landowners will earn less this year,"" said Ali, whose wife has started trading clothes to earn extra cash.""And even if they paid us as much as last year, with inflation, we won't be able to feed our families.""",Pakistan is the world's fourth-largest mango producer and agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of its GDP.

However, they made their stance clear, refusing to leave the premises until they received a firm assurance regarding the supply of the promised six hours of electricity. The siege continued as the grid staff filed the report, unable to provide any assurance without the presence of responsible Tesco officials.Meanwhile, in a related incident, prisoners in the overcrowded Bara sub-jail also raised concerns about the suffocating conditions caused by excessive load shedding, as reported by Dawn. The approximately 200 prisoners communicated their plight to media persons through their relatives, stating that despite having a meter installed at the sub-jail and regularly depositing monthly bills, they were still subjected to excessive load shedding. Some inmates even fainted due to suffocation.Residents of Jamrud reported that the power supply was disconnected following a windstorm that struck the region, severely impacting life in Ali Masjid, Rikiyalai, Shahgai, Ghundi, and the surrounding localities.In response to the widespread complaints regarding power outages across various regions in Pakistan, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was expected to hold an ""urgent meeting,"" as reported by ARY News, citing sources.Last week, K-Electric, an electricity supplying company in Pakistan, issued a stern warning to cut off power supply to the departments of the Sindh government over outstanding dues amounting to billions of rupees.Sources close to the development revealed that the Sindh government and the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) have not cleared any payments to K-Electric since January, leading to a financial crisis for the company and causing significant difficulties in network maintenance.

Nawaz Sharif signals peace as India awaits new government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/nawaz-sharif-signals-peace-as-india-awaits-new-government/articleshow/110542804.cms,"NEW DELHI: While former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif has in the past too accused his own country (read Pervez Musharraf ) of violating the peace agreement he reached with India in 1999, his reiteration of the same on Tuesday is significant because of the timing. The elder Sharif, who is now the most powerful civilian leader in the country, spoke about Pakistan having sabotaged the agreement through its Kargil adventurism while taking back the reins of his ruling party after 6 years, and days before the outcome of the Indian elections.“Once Pakistan conducted five nuclear tests in reply to India’s [then Indian premier] Atal Bihari Vajpayee sahib came here and made a [peace] agreement with us ... but we violated it and it was our fault,” said Nawaz, after being re-elected PML-N president, according to the Dawn newspaper.Nawaz, whose brother Shehbaz Sharif is Pakistan PM, has long maintained that he learnt about Musharraf’s Kargil “misadventure” only from a phone call by his then counterpart A B Vajpayee and that the Pakistani military operation scuttled the peace process he had initiated with Vajpayee in the form of the Lahore Declaration early that year.The latest remarks by Nawaz, who has even otherwise been making favourable noises about ties with India, are seen as significant also because they come in the middle of Indian elections, and just before the results are declared on June 4. “It must be read as a significant signal from Pakistan’s currently most important civilian leader for India’s incoming government,” says former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria.Nawaz enjoys a strong rapport with Indian PM Narendra Modi and it was under him, in 2015, that the 2 countries last had a substantive bilateral engagement, although the comprehensive bilateral dialogue they launched to address all issues, including J&K and terrorism, was quickly undone by the Pathankot terrorist attack.The Sharif brothers may hope to break the deadlock in ties if the Modi government returns next week but, for India in that case, the onus will remain squarely on Islamabad to make the first move as it was Pakistan that recalled its high commissioner and called off trade ties, after India revoked the special status of J&K in 2019.There was a hint of some forward movement by Pakistan in March when foreign minister Ishaq Dar said Islamabad would seriously consider restoring trade ties with India. That Pakistan remains conflicted about ties with India was evident again when his own ministry quickly clarified there was no change in Pakistan’s position and that the responsibility to improve ties lied with India. Pakistan officially maintains that talks are possible only if India reverses its actions in Kashmir.No Indian government of course will accede to any such demand by Pakistan, except for working towards an early return to statehood as asked for by the Indian Supreme Court in a verdict last year that upheld the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state. For the Modi government, the judgment was an endorsement of its position that Pakistan is not a stakeholder in the internal administrative process of J&K. Pakistan of course maintains statehood and elections cannot be a substitute to the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination. Whether it can show any flexibility on the issue, without recourse to cross-border terrorism, may determine the road ahead if the Modi government indeed returns.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif has accused his own country of violating the peace agreement he reached with India in 1999.

We only had some gold jewellery with us. We tried to pawn that but it wasn't easy. The interest was too high.""The fate of Pauktaw's residents reflects a nationwide tragedy. Across Myanmar, around 2.7 million have been forced to flee by the civil war.- Looting -The AA has not allowed residents to live back in Pauktaw, citing the danger of more air or artillery strikes on the town, although it does allow them to come and go to pick up items.The man who spoke to AFP said he had returned to check on his house and found it partly in ruins, with the family statue of the Buddha fallen onto the floor.His savings box -- containing money for a Buddhist ritual for his children and for timber to repair a roof damaged by a cyclone last year -- was gone, he said.""I have lost all of that money,"" he said.""Everything in our house got stolen... my father's fishing nets were stolen,"" another woman said, also requesting anonymity.""I am a tailor, and luckily, I managed to save my sewing machines.""During the fighting, both sides looted houses and damaged buildings, according to local reports.In March, the AA said it would ""investigate"" any reports of looting by its members during the fighting.- 'Decisive battle' -The AA's offensive has seized swathes of territory in Rakhine state and along the border with India and Bangladesh.It has said it will capture state capital Sittwe, 25 kilometres from Pauktaw and the last major town in northern Rakhine in the military's hands.In April, the AA warned residents of the town, which is home to an India-backed deep sea port, to leave ahead of a ""decisive"" battle.Sittwe residents contacted by AFP said the military was restricting travel out of the town by road and river and the prices of basic foods such as rice and eggs had doubled.Those already displaced from Pauktaw fear further fighting nearby.""I am sad that we have fled our own house and we can't live in it,"" one resident told AFP.""I have pawned my necklace for 18 lakhs ($850) so we have money to live. I still hope I can claim it back.""Others said they wanted payback.""I haven't joined the Arakan Army because I am worried about who will look after my child,"" one woman said.""If I wasn't...

The tobacco industry 's targeting of youth is rampant across our member states. As a result, we have a very worrying 11 million adolescents using various tobacco products. Coupled with the approximate 411 million adult tobacco users, our region, unfortunately, has the highest number of adolescent and adult users globally,"" Wazed said in a statement.The tobacco industry lures youths by aggressively introducing new nicotine and tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products, which are becoming increasingly popular among the youths in the region, she said.This multibillion-dollar industry recruits new tobacco users to reward their investors with even more profits. To achieve this, it preys on children and adolescents through marketing tactics, targeting them with new products, Wazed stated.""It is worrying that children and adolescents are regularly exposed to the digital marketing of tobacco products. This is despite having policies and regulations in place to prevent this,"" she said.""This situation is likely to get worse, as youngsters spend more time on social media and other similar platforms,"" Wazed said, highlighting that personalised and targeted advertising by the industry appears to dominate here, exposing them to harm.This year's theme for World No Tobacco Day is 'Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference'.The tobacco industry is fast to launch new products, using every means to expand market share before the regulations can catch up, she said.It continues to oppose evidence-based measures, such as increases in excise taxes, and comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorships.

DHAKA: Bangladesh forest experts warned Tuesday a key tiger habitat hit by a deadly cyclone had been submerged by seawater deeper and longer than ever before, raising fears for endangered wildlife.Cyclone Remal, which made landfall in low-lying Bangladesh and neighbouring India on Sunday evening, killed at least 38 people in both nations and affected millions more.More than a million people fled inland to concrete storm shelters before the cyclone hit.But it was the vast Sundarbans mangrove forest straddling Bangladesh and India, where the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers meet the sea that took the brunt of the force.The forest, which hosts one of the world's largest populations of Bengal tigers, was swamped, said Mihir Kumar Doe, the head of Bangladesh's southern forest department.""The entire Sundarbans was under water for more than 36 hours during the cyclone,"" Doe told AFP.""All its freshwater ponds, numbering more than 100, were washed away by saline tidal water.""At least 114 Bengal tigers live in Bangladesh's portion of the Sundarbans, according to official figures.Abu Naser Mohsin Hossain, Bangladesh's senior forest official for the Sundarbans, had said he feared for the wildlife if the freshwater lakes were tainted.""We are worried,"" said Hossain.

'Rishi Sunak's new policies help Tories narrow gap with Labour',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunaks-new-policies-help-tories-narrow-gap-with-labour/articleshow/110541235.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: In a sudden turn of events, the Conservative Party , led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak , has significantly narrowed the gap with the Labour Party ahead of the upcoming General Election . According to a new poll conducted by JL Partners, Labour's lead over the Conservatives has decreased from 18 points in April to just 12 points. This shift in public opinion marks a critical moment for both parties as they gear up for what promises to be a closely contested election.Prime Minister Sunak's recent policy initiatives appear to be resonating with voters, contributing to the narrowing of the gap. The new policies, aimed at addressing key issues such as the cost of living, healthcare, and national security, have bolstered the Conservative Party's standing in the polls. Sunak's focus on economic stability and pragmatic governance has been a central theme of his campaign, a Daily Mail report said.One of the key factors in this shift has been the public's response to the government's handling of economic challenges. Sunak has emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility while promising targeted support for those most affected by rising living costs. His policies have included measures to reduce inflation, support small businesses, and ensure that public services are adequately funded.Labour leader Keir Starmer, who had been enjoying a comfortable lead for several months, now faces increased pressure to maintain his party's advantage. Starmer's campaign has focused on issues such as social justice, public health, and education reform. However, the recent poll suggests that some voters may be reconsidering their support in light of the Conservative Party's renewed efforts.The tightening race reflects the dynamic and unpredictable nature of British politics. As both parties ramp up their campaigns, they are likely to intensify their efforts to sway undecided voters and solidify their bases. The Labour Party will need to reinforce its message and address any vulnerabilities that may have contributed to the narrowing gap.Political analysts suggest that the upcoming weeks will be crucial for both parties. The Conservatives will aim to continue their momentum by highlighting their recent policy successes and outlining their vision for the future. Meanwhile, Labour will need to counteract this by emphasizing their commitment to addressing inequality and improving public services.The public's perception of the leaders' performances will also play a significant role in the election outcome. Sunak's leadership style, characterized by his economic expertise and calm demeanor, contrasts with Starmer's focus on social issues and reform. Voters' evaluations of these contrasting approaches will be critical in determining the final result, the Daily Mail report said.As the election date approaches, both parties will be keenly aware of the importance of maintaining voter engagement and addressing the key concerns of the electorate. The race is expected to be highly competitive, with each party striving to gain the upper hand.The poll results have injected a new sense of urgency into the campaigns, underscoring the high stakes of the upcoming election. With the gap between the parties narrowing, the outcome remains uncertain, and both Sunak and Starmer will need to navigate the complexities of the political landscape to secure a victory.",The Conservative Party has significantly narrowed the gap with the Labour Party ahead of the upcoming General Election.
