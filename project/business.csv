"On wife’s suggestion, CJI Chandrachud arranges screening of 'Laapataa Ladies' to promote gender sensitisation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-wifes-suggestion-cji-chandrachud-arranges-screening-of-laapataa-ladies-to-promote-gender-sensitisation/articleshow/112417045.cms,"NEW DELHI: On wife Kalpana Das ’s suggestion, CJI D Y Chandrachud on Friday arranged for an exclusive screening of acclaimed Hindi film ‘Laapata Ladies’ for the Supreme Court judges and staff but prior to that producer Aamir Khan and director Kiran Rao had a privileged preview of CJI’s Courtroom proceedings.It was Kalpana, who after watching the film, suggested to CJI Chandrachud for the screening of the film for the entire staff of the apex court as she felt that the movie conveyed a moving message on gender sensitisation.Coincidentally, in the 75th year of its establishment, the SC is observing a year-long gender sensitisation programme.It was a spectacle in the CJI’s courtroom, the largest and most ornate among all SC courtrooms. With a dozen seats separated with a barricade tape from areas crowded by lawyers, Khan dressed in a printed kurta and Rao in a blue saree over a white top, along with half a dozen their associates were seen keenly watching proceedings before the CJI and his colleague judges - J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra.Security too was deployed to avoid any lawyer fan mobbing the celebrated actor. None did, as for them the court proceedings were more important. But, courtroom cameras, which usually focus on lawyers representing petitioners and respondents, were glued to Khan and Rao. So much so that, when the petitioner’s counsel was arguing, many a time he/she was not visible, though audible.After an hour or so, Khan either lost interest in the proceeding or to prepare for smooth screening or for some pressing engagement, left the courtroom, leaving Rao and two three others to continue sitting in the courtroom till 4 pm. The screening was scheduled from 4.15 pm till 6.20 pm.The SC registry informed that the judges interacted with Khan and Rao after the screening for about 15-20 minutes. Some judges did not attend. Few among them felt that close interaction with the actor and producer would not be ethical as there may be a case in future where a film involving Khan and Rao may get challenged in the SC.",CJI D Y Chandrachud arranged for an exclusive screening of acclaimed Hindi film ‘Laapata Ladies’ for the Supreme Court judges and staff.

"SC grants Sisodia bail, says trial yet to even commence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-grants-sisodia-bail-says-trial-yet-to-even-commence/articleshow/112414716.cms,"Travesty of justice if Sisodia sent back to trial court: SC

In a big relief to Aam Aadmi Party leader and former deputy CM of Delhi Manish Sisodia , Supreme Court on Friday granted him bail in the corruption and money laundering cases related to changes in Delhi’s excise policy, and paved the way for him to come out of jail 17 months after he was arrested.“If the govt tries to forcibly put a common individual in jail who speaks against dictatorship, then the Constitution will protect them,” Sisodia told AAP supporters who waited for him outside Tihar jail gate.Noting that far from being concluded in 6-8 months, trial is yet to even commence, a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said it was a fit case to grant bail as prolonged incarceration would amount to violation of his fundamental right to life and liberty which is one of the most sacrosanct rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Sisodia was arrested by CBI on Feb 6, 2023, and was subsequently taken into custody by ED on March 9.“In the present case, in the ED matter as well as the CBI matter, 493 witnesses have been named. The case involves thousands of pages of documents and over a lakh pages of digitised documents. It is thus clear that there is not even the remotest possibility of the trial being concluded in the near future. In our view, keeping the appellant behind bars for an unlimited period of time in the hope of speedy completion of trial would deprive [him of] his fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. As observed time and again, prolonged incarceration before being pronounced guilty of an offence should not be permitted to become punishment without trial,” the court said.Though CBI/ED insisted that Sisodia be subjected to the same conditions which were imposed while granting bail to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal who was asked not to visit his office and Delhi secretariat, the bench turned down the plea. Sisodia, in any case, resigned as minister and does not have an office.The court directed Sisodia to surrender his passport and report to the IO Mondays and Thursdays. He has to furnish bail bonds for Rs 10 lakh with two sureties of like amount and the court also allowed the probe agency to seek cancellation of bail in case of violation of any condition, including not making any attempts to influence witnesses or to tamper with the evidence.We find that, on account of a long period of incarceration running for around 17 months and the trial not even having commenced, the appellant has been deprived of his right to speedy trial. As observed by this court, the right to speedy trial and the right to liberty are sacrosanct rights. On denial of these rights, the trial court as well as the high court ought to have given due weightage to this factor,” the court said, setting aside the orders of the trial court and the HC.This was the third round of litigation on Sisodia’s bail in SC which had in Oct last year rejected his plea. He made a fresh plea before the apex court after being rejected by the trial court and Delhi HC and the court disposed of his plea in June and granted him liberty to revive the petition after filing of chargesheet. Seeking rejection of the third petition for revival of his plea, CBI/ED told the bench that he must first approach the trial court and then HC and finally SC.The bench, however, rejected the plea and said it would be “travesty of justice” if he was sent back to the trial court for bail. “Relegating the appellant to again approach the trial court and thereafter the high court and only thereafter this court, in our view, would be making him play a game of snake and ladder. The trial court and the HC have already taken a view and in our view, relegating him again to the trial court and the HC would be an empty formality. In a matter pertaining to the life and liberty of a citizen which is one of the most sacrosanct rights guaranteed by the Constitution, a citizen cannot be made to run from pillar to post,” it said.The court also found that there was no substance in CBI/ED allegations, upheld by the trial court, that the trial was getting delayed because of Sisodia who filed multiple applications.It noted that none of the applications filed by him was frivolous and the judicial record of the case belied the trial court’s finding that delay was caused by him.“It could further be seen that, though it has been submitted on behalf of the ED that hundreds of applications have been filed for supply of un-relied upon documents, the record would not substantiate the said position. Though various applications have been filed by different accused persons, insofar as the present appellant is concerned, he has filed only 13 applications in the CBI matter and 14 in the ED matter. It would reveal that some of the applications are for seeking permission to meet his wife or permission to file vakalatnama, to put signature on the documents, seeking permission to sign a cheque etc,” the court said.","Sisodia was arrested by CBI on Feb 6, 2023, and was subsequently taken into custody by ED on March 9. He has to furnish bail bonds for Rs 10 lakh with two sureties of like amount. The court also allowed the probe agency to seek cancellation of bail in case of violation of any condition.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112414772,imgsize-100298,width-400,resizemode-4/112414772.jpg"

"Explained: What is 'bail is rule, jail an exception' Supreme Court cited in Manish Sisodia case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/explained-what-is-bail-is-rule-jail-an-exception-supreme-court-cited-in-manish-sisodia-case/articleshow/112410167.cms,"But what is this principle?

Why 'twin test' of PMLA make it difficult?



Why SC quoted 'bail is rule' in Sisodia's case

When the court called for 'bail is rule' principle

NEW DELHI: After 17 months in jail, former Delhi deputy chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia finally walked free on a regular bail . In tears, as he got a rousing welcome outside Tihar jail by party leaders Atishi, Sanjay Singh and supporters, in a cracking voice he thanked Ambedkar and the Constitution because of which, he said, he was free.Sisodia, who got multiple setbacks by lower courts during the last 17 months, finally got bail as the Supreme Court reiterated the principle of 'bail is the rule , and jail is an exception'.Sharply criticising the lower courts, the top court said, ""As observed time and again, prolonged incarceration before being pronounced guilty of an offence should not be permitted to become punishment without trial."" The bench of Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan said, ""It is high time trial courts, high courts recognise principle of bail is the rule and jail is an exception.""The 'bail is the rule, and jail is the exception' principle was first used in the 1977 landmark judgment of the 'State of Rajasthan vs Balchand alias Baliya' case.The ruling underscored that bail should be denied only in circumstances where there is a risk of the accused fleeing from justice, obstructing justice, repeating offenses, or intimidating witnesses. This concept has been cited in numerous cases since, reinforcing its importance in upholding personal liberty.""The basic rule is bail, not jail, except where there are circumstances suggestive of fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offenses or intimidating witnesses and the like by the petitioner who seeks enlargement on bail from the court. When considering the question of bail, the gravity of the offense involved and the heinousness of the crime which are likely to induce the petitioner to avoid the course of justice must weigh with the court,"" the 1977 bench said.The discussion around bail becomes more complex in cases involving the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), especially after the March 2018 amendment. This amendment revived the 'twin conditions' under Section 45(1) of the PMLA, making it significantly harder to secure bail in money laundering cases. These conditions stipulate that when an accused in a money laundering case applies for bail, the court must first provide an opportunity for the public prosecutor to be heard.According to Section 45, no person accused of an offense under the PMLA can be released on bail unless the public prosecutor is given a chance to oppose the bail application, and the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accused is not guilty of the offense and is unlikely to commit any offense while on bail. This effectively places the burden of proving innocence on the accused, complicating the bail process.Before the 2019 amendments of PMLA, if someone was accused of a crime related to money laundering, the law automatically assumed they were guilty of the original crime (called the ""scheduled offence""). The accused had to prove they were not involved in that crime to get bail.The Supreme Court emphasised that delay in trial and prolonged imprisonment are valid grounds for granting bail, even in cases under stringent laws like the PMLA. ""Manish Sisodia is in custody for 17 months and trial has not yet commenced; this deprives his right to a speedy trial,"" the top court said. ""Right to speedy trial is a sacrosanct right... Bail cannot be opposed saying that the crime is serious. In matters of liberty, every day counts,"" it added.The CBI and ED had requested the Supreme Court to impose bail conditions similar to those applied to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. However, the court rejected this plea, stating that each case needs to be treated on its own merits rather than applying uniform conditions across the board.The Supreme Court has consistently reiterated this principle in various judgments. In 2011, the court granted bail to five accused in the 2G spectrum case, including Sanjay Chandra, while underscoring that bail is the rule. Similarly, in 2019, the court granted bail to P Chidambaram in the INX Media case, despite the seriousness of economic offenses, affirming that the fundamental jurisprudence of bail remained unchanged.In November 2020, the Supreme Court extended interim bail to journalist Arnab Goswami, highlighting the critical nature of personal liberty and the principle of bail as the norm.CJI DY Chandrachud, in his address at the All India District Judges Conference in March, voiced concerns about the declining adherence to this principle in lower courts. He emphasized the need for judges to prioritize personal liberty and adhere to the established legal standard.","The 'bail is the rule, and jail is the exception' principle was first used in the 1977 landmark judgment of the 'State of Rajasthan vs Balchand alias Baliya' Case underscored that bail should be denied only in circumstances where there is a risk of the accused fleeing from justice, obstructing justice, repeating offenses, or intimidating witnesses.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112410190,imgsize-1682715,width-400,resizemode-4/112410190.jpg"
"SC stays ban on hijab by Mumbai college, but says no burqa or niqab",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-stays-ban-on-hijab-by-mumbai-college-but-says-no-burqa-or-niqab/articleshow/112412079.cms,"Should it not be left to girls to decide what they want to wear? asks SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday stayed till Nov 18 a Mumbai college ’s circular banning students from wearing hijab, cap or badge but allowed the educational institution to continue enforcing its circular banning wearing of burqa , niqab or stole in its premises.A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar issued notice to the college on a petition jointly filed by three students — Zainab Abdul Qayyum Choudhary, Nasreen Bano Mohd Tanzim Shaikh and Nazneen Mazhar Ansari — appealing against a Bombay HC order upholding the college circular.It said, “In the meanwhile, we stay clause 2 of the circular to the extent that it directs that no hijab, cap or badge will be permitted.”Clause 2 of the Mumbai college circular reads, “You (students) shall follow the dress code of college of formal and decent dress which shall not reveal anyone’s religion such as ‘no burkha, no niqab, no hijab, no cap, no badge, no stole, etc. Only full or half-shirt and normal trousers for boys and any Indian/western non-revealing dress for girls on the college campus. Changing rooms available for girls.”The Justice Sanjiv Khanna-led bench, however, orally clarified that no burqa can be worn by anyone inside the college or classrooms. The interim stay was confined to the ban on wearing hijab, cap or badge.Appearing for ‘ Chembur Trombay Educational Society ’, under which the college in question functioned, senior advocate Madhavi Divan said there were 441 Muslim women students pursuing various courses in the college and none of them, except the three petitioners, had any objection to the circular.She apprehended that allowing hijab, which is a barrier to female students getting educated and interacting with others, inside an education institution would be exploited by vested groups. “How will we stop anyone from wearing saffron shawls to the college?” she asked.Justice Khanna asked, “Will you stop a student wearing tilak from entering the college?” Going a step further, Justice Kumar asked, “Will you stop a student’s entry if she wears a bindi? Should it not be left to the girl to decide what she wants to wear? Where is your initiative to empower women by providing for no dress code? The less said the better.”The bench, while keeping its interim order in force till Nov 18, took note of Divan’s apprehensions about the interim order being exploited by vested elements and said, “If the interim order is misused, the college will be at liberty to move SC for appropriate orders.”The bench agreed with the circular that students must be dressed decently inside the college. Divan said the circular was religion neutral and intended not to reveal the religion of students. She said when the matter was being adjudicated by the Bombay HC, the college had resisted a Hindu outfit’s plea to intervene in the proceedings.Justice Kumar said, “You do not want the students’ religion to be revealed? Won’t their names reveal their religion? Will you give them numbers at the gate so that they are not addressed by their names but by numbers? What is all this?”Justice Khanna said a statutory appeal against the hijab ban was pending adjudication of a larger bench of the SC. A two-judge bench of the SC had on Oct 13, 2022, given a split verdict on the hijab ban in Karnataka govt educational institutions. That issue was referred to a larger bench and it has not been listed for hearing yet.Divan further added, “These (burqa, hijab and niqab) are barriers for students from getting education. We have created lockers. We told them if you like you can come wearing hijabs and keep these in lockers provided by the college. Change rooms are also provided.”Justice Khanna saw merit in Divan’s argument and said, “You may be somewhat right because the background they belong to, the family may be insisting that they must wear hijab and go to college and insist in not taking off the hijab.”Divan said, “Tomorrow how do we prevent students from coming to college wearing saffron shawls when some are permitted to wear niqabs? We cannot be a playground for religion or politics.”Justice Kumar continued in the same vein and asked, “When was the college established? How come suddenly you realised that there are different religions in the country? It is unfortunate that you come up with these kinds of instructions. After so many years of independence, you realise that there are different religions in this country? The college was established in 2008 and till now you had no difficulty and suddenly you have woken up?” When the bench said it was going to stay the circular, Divan pleaded for a detailed hearing. But the bench said it would hear her in Nov.When Divan complained that the college’s autonomy was being taken away, the bench said, “Your autonomy is not taken away but don’t insist that A or B should be coming dressed in a particular manner. The solution to a lot of things, as you said, is proper and good education. I certainly know that burqas can’t be permitted in a college. You can’t sit in a class wearing a burqa.”","Supreme Court stays Mumbai college’s circular banning students from wearing hijab, cap or badge. Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar issued notice to the college on a petition jointly filed by three students. The bench agreed with the circular that students must be dressed decently inside the college.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112412098,imgsize-1350397,width-400,resizemode-4/112412098.jpg"

The resolution must be passed by 50% of the members present, plus one member, of those present in the House on that day. If the resolution gets passed, it has to go to Lok Sabha to be passed by a simple majority for it to get accepted, explained a senior RS MP. This procedure follows from Articles 67 (b), 92 and 100 of the Constitution.Going by this process, the resolution is certain to be defeated in the House, yet opposition members are contemplating moving on it “to prove the point that the chair has deviated from his role as a neutral umpire and hence disrespected the chair”.","The parties have started collating documentary material of instances in the House where Dhankhar has been “partisan in his actions’ The opposition parties are concerned that the microphone of the leader of opposition was allegedly being turned off repeatedly. “The opposition wants the House to be run by rules and conventions, and personal remarks against members are unacceptable,” a source said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112411933,imgsize-1577950,width-400,resizemode-4/112411933.jpg"

Bangladesh foreign policy adviser holds mixed views on India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-foreign-policy-adviser-holds-mixed-views-on-india/articleshow/112412341.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bangladesh foreign policy adviser Touhid Hossain said after assuming office Dhaka will maintain a balance in ties with big powers and seek good ties with all. Hossain, who served as foreign secretary from late 2006 to July, 2009, also said the immediate priority for the interim govt that was sworn in on Thursday is to restore law and order and the country.Hossain is known to have mixed views on India, acknowledging India’s importance for Dhaka on the one hand, but also accusing it of not doing enough to uphold Bangladesh’s interests on the other.Hossain said last year in a lecture that Bangladesh’s interests were not protected as much as India’s in the past 15 years, a period that saw excellent ties between the govts but not necessarily the people. This was the reason, according to him, the relationship could not be considered a “role model’’. India has maintained for years that the relationship with Bangladesh is a model for bilateral relations not just in the region but also beyond.Bangladesh’s Prothom Alo newspaper quoted him as saying last year that, according to history, the best combination for relations between the two countries is Awami League in govt in Dhaka and Congress in Delhi. Significantly, Hossain is seen as pro-West and has long maintained that Dhaka needs to mend its ties with the western countries. Just before the elections this year in Bangladesh, he wrote that while ties with India will always remain important, and Dhaka needs to maintain good ties with Russia and China too, “none of these countries can substitute our relations with western countries’’.In another column earlier this year, Hossain said that by any consideration, the relationship with India is most important for Bangladesh’s foreign policy but added that while Bangladesh had delivered almost everything India asked for, India had displayed indifference and reluctance in meeting Bangladesh’s “few demands’’. To back his argument, he has often cited India’s failure to deliver on the Teesta river water sharing.“People are still being shot along the border by BSF guards . The excuses made by the Indian govt to exonerate themselves of these killings, simply infuriates the people of Bangladesh further. India is also depriving Bangladesh of its share of the river Teesta’s water on the excuse of their domestic politics,’’ he said in a column in January, adding there were other irritants like non-tariff barriers and India not allowing Bangladesh access to Nepal through the Siliguri Corridor.","Hossain is known to have mixed views on India, acknowledging India’s importance for Dhaka on the one hand, but also accusing it of not doing enough to uphold Bangladesh's interests on the other.

MUMBAI: A cryptic announcement by Pune-based industrialist Yohan Poonawalla and his wife Michelle on Thursday about a property acquisition in south Mumbai set tongues wagging in the city’s real estate market.A spokesperson representing the couple said they purchased a “mansion standing on its own grounds in the most coveted and exclusive area of Cuffe Parade in South Mumbai.The standalone property, spanning approximately 30,000 sq ft., joins a prestigious collection of mansions in the area that are typically priced between Rs 400-Rs 750 crore’’.The spokesperson said they had no further information about the name of the mansion the Poonawallas bought.However, sources In the property market speculated that it could be the early 20th century heritage property Taraporewala Mansion where the writer Mulk Raj Anand once lived. Sources said that the ground plus three storey property was on sale for several years but said its price could be in the range of Rs 100 crore to Rs 150 crore only. ``MYP Design Studio, under Michelle Poonawalla’s creative helm, will orchestrate the transformation of this architectural gem into the opulent Poonawalla Mansion , the couple’s secondary residence, their primary home being Poonawalla House in Pune.This project marks a new chapter in the couple’s illustrious journey, promising a harmonious blend of historic grandeur and contemporary luxury,’’ said a source close to the family. The couple plan to showcase Michelle’s art collection from renowned artists as well as her own art and oil.It will also house Yohan Poonawalla’s automobile collection. In 2015, Yohan’s cousin, Adar Poonawalla, successfully bid for the sprawling US consulate property at Breach Candy for Rs 750 crore.

Indore school teacher accused of strip-searching girl students removed

In Indore, Madhya Pradesh, a government teacher was removed and reassigned after allegations of strip-searching girl students in search of a mobile phone. Parents accused the teacher of inappropriate behavior and beating the students. Authorities are investigating the incident, and the police have involved a woman officer to ensure a thorough and sensitive inquiry.

BENGALURU: Various stakeholders of private schools , including managements, teachers, and non-teaching staff, will observe Aug 15 as a black day , protesting against the lack of freedom and ease in running schools.Speaking at a press conference Tuesday, D Shashi Kumar, convener of Karnataka Private School Managements Teaching and Non-Teaching Staff Coordination Committee, said there is no freedom to run a “quality educational institution”.“The education department doesn’t honour any of the court orders. They don’t understand the challenges faced by private schools. Private schools aren’t involved in any of the policy decisions taken by the govt,” he alleged.Shashi Kumar’s accusations come at a time when the department has appealed against a high court order on the matter of renewal of recognition, which was in favour of private schools.“After 20 months of the court order, the education department has appealed against the order. It is impossible for old schools to have the same certificates as the new ones,” he said.“We require around 50 certificates from various departments, including that of fire safety and building safety. All these departments are engulfed in corruption. That the education department wants these rules back is only to encourage corruption,” he added.Meanwhile, teachers of govt primary schools have also threatened to go on a strike on Aug 12. The strike will be held from 9am to 5pm at Freedom Park and is expected to host thousands of teachers.“The new recruitment and promotion rules should be applicable only to teachers appointed after 2017, they shouldn’t be retrospective for those who applied before 2016,” said Chandrashekhar Nugli, president of Karnataka State Primary School Teachers’ Association.In case the govt doesn’t pay heed to the demands, the association plans to observe Sept 5 as a black day and also refrain from teaching classes 6-8.","Chhattisgarh High Court condemned corporal punishment in schools, calling it inhumane and a violation of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.

Panathur Road: BBMP's Oversight Turns 3.5km into 1.2-Hour Epic Trip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bbmps-oversight-turns-35km-into-12-hour-epic-trip/articleshow/112358096.cms,"The winding S-Cross and narrow railway under bridge is a notorious bottleneck on Panathur Rd

BENGALURU: In a quirky twist to the usual race for speed, Bengaluru’s tech hub is now hosting an unintentional contest: “Who takes the longest time to cover the shortest distance?”The spotlight falls on the ever-clogged Panathur Road , where travel time on the nearly 3.5km has hit an astonishing low. Commuters are now spending an average of 1.2 hours navigating this stretch, which connects with Outer Ring Road (ORR) that is dotted with multi-national companies.Panathur Road, especially the winding S-Cross and the narrow railway under bridge, is a notorious bottleneck that turns a short trip into an epic journey, highlighting the city’s never-ending struggle with its road conditions.Namma Balagere, a group of resident welfare associations, recently took to social media platform X to voice their concern, posting an image in which a car took 86 minutes to cover 3.5km. Calling it a ‘new record’, Namma Balagere (@BalagereConnect) dared BBMP to show if there was any other record beating this. “Imagine the condition of commuters,” the X post asked while underlining the fact that the stretch was just 2km from ORR.This sparked a wave of responses, with users sharing their own speedometer readings and journey times. Sandeep Reddy, an ‘X’ user, posted a picture of his speedometer showing a distance of 2.5km taking over 1.54 hours to cover, captioning it, “Can’t beat mine.” Asish Thomas, another user, shared that a 17.6-km stretch took 3.39 hours to traverse. The flood of complaints highlighted the dire state of the road, with users like Cumar K urging residents to take direct action by sitting in front of their MLA’s office, reminiscent of Gandhi’s protests.Manjunath Reddy, a resident, lamented, “The distance between Kadubeesanahalli and Balagere Road is just 6km, but due to poor road conditions, it takes more than two hours to commute.” He added that BBMP officials have promised improvements, though residents remain skeptical.Ramya K, another resident, described the daily challenges, noting that even a short trip to the grocery store can take 45 minutes due to slow-moving traffic and numerous potholes. Sunil P from Balagere, said: “The stretch is already congested, and with heavy vehicle movement, traffic worsens. People can walk to work faster than travelling by car or bike.”A volunteer from Namma Balagere highlighted the lack of alternative routes and the narrowness of the road, calling for the construction of a comprehensive development plan (CDP) road over the rail over bridge (ROB).Residents feel their complaints are falling on deaf ears. “We have written letters, conducted email campaigns, and even met deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar regarding the issue, but nobody seems to care,” a volunteer said. The BJP MLA, except for showing up when public pressure intensifies and assuring road development, has been of little help, he added.BBMP’s engineer-in-chief BS Prahalad said: “We are working with the railway department on finding a solution. In less than six months, we will widen the road and resolve the issue.”","Panathur Road, especially the winding S-Cross and the narrow railway under bridge, is a notorious bottleneck that turns a short trip into an epic journey.

But look at the persons from district judiciary who after being appointed as HC judges have a tenure of less than four to five years. They get a pension of Rs 15-25,000. Their tenure in the district judiciary is not counted. We have a slew of petitions by such retired HC judges.”“To get a pension of Rs 15-25,000 after spending the entire life in the judiciary is no social security for them. Look at the profile of such retired HC judges. They, except a few who can be counted on fingertips, do not return to practice nor do arbitration work after retirement. My earnest appeal to both of you (AG and SG) to sit down with the concerned officials (of the ministry) and examine the issue to arrive at a reasonable solution,” the CJI said.Though the AG reiterated that the issue involves multiple aspects, the SG said he and the AG would surely examine the issues involved regarding the pension. The CJI said, “We do understand the financial implications. But as the Supreme Court, we must also discharge our duties as the guardian of the judiciary,” he said and posted the matter for hearing on Aug 27.","The Supreme Court expressed grave concern over the pittance of pension received by retired HC judges, who were appointed as HC judges after spending their entire life in the district judiciary.

Recognizing the importance of proper equipment for an athlete of Nadeem's calibre, Chopra publicly advocated for support to address the Pakistani athlete's equipment needs.""Arshad is a top javelin thrower, and I believe that the javelin makers will be more than happy to sponsor him and provide what he needs. This is a piece of advice from my side,"" Chopra said.Chopra's appeal was met with a positive response, enabling Nadeem to secure the necessary support and equipment. This intervention was pivotal for Nadeem, who went on to clinch Pakistan's first-ever individual Olympic gold medal in Paris with an impressive throw of 92.97 meters. Chopra, on the other hand, secured the silver medal, adding another medal to his illustrious career tally.Despite being fierce competitors on the field, they showcased the power of friendship and support that transcends borders. Neeraj's gesture played a crucial role in Arshad's historic achievement at the Paris 2024 Olympics, reminding us all that sometimes, the greatest victories come not just from winning medals but from uplifting others along the way.","Neeraj Chopra and Arshad Nadeem exemplify a camaraderie that surpasses the traditional rivalries between their nations.

Mosquitoes bite into health insurance claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mosquitoes-bite-into-health-insurance-claims/articleshow/112415785.cms,"MUMBAI: Nearly a third of the health insurance claims recorded by insurers are due to seasonal infectious diseases . These include vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria , which give rise to high claims in July and August, or water-borne infections such as gastroenteritis . In winter, it is usually bronchitis or influenza.As many of these claims are related to hygiene conditions in the locality they are avoidable to a large extent.However, they impact all segments of society as evident from claims data.According to a study of reported health insurance claims by Policybazaar, vector borne diseases like Dengue and Malaria account for 15% of total seasonal illnesses claims. The cost for treating these mosquito-borne diseases typically ranges from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1,50,000. These claims surge in July and August when humid conditions create ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes .Another illness that peaks during the monsoon is gastroenteritis or stomach flu which has the same treatment expenses as Malaria. This ailment accounts for 18% of seasonal claims. Another 10% of seasonal illness claims are due to allergic reactions where the periodicity varies according to region. Winter sees claims due to influenza and bronchitis peaking to 20% and 12% of seasonal illnesses. However, the cost of treatment is lower ranging from Rs 25,000 to Rs 1 lakh.“If you look at developed countries, the share of seasonal illnesses is much lower compared to developing countries. In case of India, even in developed parts of the country like Gurgaon there are problems of water accumulation and mosquito breeding which leads to an increase in these claims,” said Siddharth Singhal, head of health insurance, Policybazaar.“These seasonal illnesses add to the frequency of claims. However, the average claim amount is much lower than chronic illnesses, and in terms of value, the share of claims would be below 20%,” said Singhal. According to Singhal, the cases of hospitalisation for illnesses that would have earlier been treated at home have gone up. “This is a positive development as it is always good to have professional support. ,” he said.","Nearly a third of the health insurance claims recorded by insurers are due to seasonal infectious diseases.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
UK govt mulls curbs on visas for techies to bring down migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-govt-mulls-curbs-on-visas-for-techies-to-bring-down-migration/articleshow/112416245.cms,"LONDON: Britain’s govt is considering tightening visa rules for hiring foreign IT, telecom and engineering professionals to fill jobs in the UK as it tries to bring down high levels of migration .Thousands of Indian IT and engineering professionals travel to work in these sectors in Britain every year, filling crucial gaps in the labour market .Changes could include raising the minimum salary threshold in these sectors or restrictions based on different regions of Britain.UK home secretary Yvette Cooper has written to Brian Bell, chair of the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), asking him to review the reasons behind the reliance on international recruitment in the sectors of “IT and telecommunications professionals and engineering professionals”.“These sectors feature in the top 10 of those sectors which have been reliant on international recruitment and the govt would like MAC to set out the reasons behind this. The high levels of international recruitment reflect weaknesses in the labour market, including persistent skills shortages in the UK,” she wrote.She asked MAC to find out what is driving the labour shortage and “how have the sectors sought to respond to these shortages, beyond seeking to recruit from overseas from overseas?”“What policy levers within the immigration system could be used to incentivise sectors to focus on recruiting from the domestic workforce,” she said, telling him the system is “not operating in the national interest”.The MAC report is expected in nine months. Ganapati Bhat, an IT consultant from Bengaluru who has worked in the UK since 2007 after arriving on the highly skilled migrant programme, told TOI: “There is no need to change the policy around this just because there is noise around immigration. We can hardly fulfil the vacancies in Britain as salaries for some of these jobs are not that great compared to India and the US when you take into account the cost of living.”","Thousands of Indian IT and engineering professionals travel to work in these sectors in Britain every year.

Joy had earlier said he had no intention of joining politics.Talking to TOI over phone from his residence in Washington , DC on Thursday, Joy said, “I will do whatever it takes to save the party and its workers.If there is a need for me to join politics, I will not refrain from that. My mother would have retired from politics after the current term. I never had any political ambition and was settled in the US. But the developments in Bangladesh in the past few days show that there is a leadership vacuum. I had to get active for the sake of the party and I am at the forefront now.”His statements came after Khaleda Zia was released from house arrest and her son Tarique Rahman, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s acting chairman, is returning to Dhaka.Speaking on the day that an interim govt led by Nobel Prize winner Md Yunus took charge of Bangladesh, Joy said, “I am sure the Awami League will take part in the election and we might even win. We have the largest supporter base in Bangladesh.” Claiming his mother has no plan of seeking asylum in any country, he said, “For the time being, she is in India. She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim govt decides to hold an election in the country. I am thankful to PM Narendra Modi for saving my mother’s life at such short notice.”On Thursday, Joy’s sister Saima Wazed also made it clear she will continue in her role as the WHO regional director. “Heartbroken with the loss of life in my country Bangladesh that I love. So heartbroken that I cannot see and hug my mother during this difficult time. I remain committed to my role as RD WHO,” she wrote on X. In a later post, she wrote, “To everyone who has shown concern: as much as I would love to see Ma, I don’t want to compromise her whereabouts in any way.”Joy stressed there was a need for “introspection”. “There definitely were mistakes. When you run a country, a lot of decisions are made every day. Awami League believes in introspection and we were ready for that. But we did not get a chance to do that this time. We never realized the situation would escalate so fast even after accepting their demands,” Joy said.He also said an alliance of BNP and Jammat will not be able to save the minorities. “If the Awami League is not in power, the eastern border of India will not be secure. If there is an alliance of BNP and Jamaat, that may not be good for India as Jamaat will not refrain from militancy,” Joy said, requesting India to mount pressure on Bangladesh to hold elections soon.","Sajeeb Wazed Joy, son of former PM Sheikh Hasina, said he is ready to enter politics.

No decision on tenure length

Students in supervisory roles

China welcomes interim govt

The head of Bangladesh’s interim govt , Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has appointed former foreign secretary M Touhid Hossain to head foreign ministry “to maintain a balance of relations with the big countries”, while Yunus himself will lead over two dozen ministries and departments, the cabinet division of Bangladesh said Friday.Among the 27 ministries that Yunus has assigned to himself are defence, information, education, energy, food, and water resources.These are in addition to his position as chief adviser, equivalent to interim PM. A surprise inclusion in the “council of advisers” was AFM Khalid Hossain, a former vice-president of the hardline Islamist organisation Hefazat-e-Islam and adviser to Islami Andolan Bangladesh, as the head of religious affairs ministry.Law professor Asif Nazrul, who guided student coordinators during the protests and was vocal against the now-toppled Sheikh Hasina govt, has been given the law ministry, apparently to help the interim govt take legal steps regarding human rights violations and recent killings.The interim govt said it had not taken any decision yet on the length of its tenure but that it wanted to first finalise its reform agenda . “If you don’t want reforms, that is a separate discussion. Now, there is no reason to get restless... Ultimately, we need to walk towards democracy,” Syeda Rizwana Hasan, in charge of the environment, forest and climate change ministry, said.In the “council of advisers”, Brigadier General Sakhawat Hussain (Retd), who also served as the country’s election commissioner from 2007 to 2012, will lead home ministry. Salehuddin Ahmed, the ninth governor of Bangladesh Bank (2005 to 2009) will head finance and planning ministries.Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyian, one of the coordinators of the quota reform protest and pursuing a master’s at the linguistics department of Dhaka University, is now the adviser for the youth and sports ministry. Bhuyian (25) described the new administration as not a caretaker govt but a govt formed through a students’ movement and said they were looking to handing over to a govt brought in by a fair election.Nahid Islam, another student who led the protests, has been appoined adviser to the postal, telecom and ICT (information and communications technology) ministries. He said they have decided to appoint students as assistant advisers or to similar positions so that students can have a supervisory role within ministries.Adilur Rahman Khan, a former deputy attorney general (2001- 2007), has been given the industries ministry. AF Hassan Arif, who was attorney general (2001-2005), will now lead the local govt, rural development and cooperatives ministry. Farida Akhter, a women’s rights activist, has been handed fisheries and livestock, Sharmeen Murshid, a freedom fighter, will take charge of social welfare, and Nurjahan Begum, a Grameen Telecom trustee, will look after health ministry.Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Oikya Parishad, meanwhile, reported 205 incidents of persecution of members of minority communities across 52 districts since Hasina’s resignation on Aug 5.China said it has noted that Bangladesh has formed an interim govt, that it welcomes it, and that Beijing strictly follows the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs. “China values its relations with Bangladesh, and stands ready to work with Bangladesh to promote bilateral cooperation in various areas and further advance our comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership,” a spokesperson said, adding, Beijing respects Bangladesh’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and the development path independently chosen by the Bangladeshi people”.","Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has appointed former foreign secretary M Touhid Hossain to head foreign ministry.

Others in the committee include the secretary of Land Ports Authority (LPAI) and member (planning and development), LPAI.The days after the fall of Sheikh Hasina government have witnessed some activity along the Indo-Bangladesh border, including the arrival of Indian students at the landports and Bangladeshi citizens attempting to cross over to the Indian side.“Indian students with valid passports and documentation are being admitted from the designated landports. Only yesterday, Nepal citizens carrying passports stamped with Bangladesh visa, were allowed to use Indian landports as a transit point to Nepal, with due approval of the Union home ministry. However, no instance of Bangladeshi citizens trying to cross over to India, via Assam, has come to notice,” Assam DGP G P Singh told TOI.Sources said while there is concern that Hindu citizens of Bangladesh may be targeted by the radical Islamic groups, there is no instruction from the higher authorities yet to offer them shelter in India. “The committee tasked with monitoring the border situation was set up as a point of contact was needed to resolve border immigration cases.

Senior leaders of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have stated that the bilateral ties between India and Bangladesh are not dependent on the Awami League. They believe that it is natural for Bangladesh to have adverse reactions to India providing refuge to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina .BNP leader Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said that the adverse reactions to Hasina seeking refuge in India are natural, as people tend to dislike those who support someone they do not like.""The impact of Sheikh Hasina getting refuge in India is quite natural. For example, if I don't like you and someone else is supporting you, then I will naturally have a dislike for that person too. It is natural to have adverse reactions. But the fact is India-Bangladesh always shared good ties irrespective of whether the Awami League or Sheikh Hasina is in power,"" Hossain told PTI.Regarding India's close relationship with the Awami League, Mintoo acknowledged that it might have a minor and short-term impact on bilateral relations. However, he emphasized that maintaining good relations with India is crucial for Bangladesh's interests, given India's size and economic significance.""It is in the interest of Bangladesh that we should have very good relations with India. I would not have said this had this been any other neighbouring country like Bhutan or Nepal, but India is a very big country and one of the largest economies in the world. For the sake of good bilateral ties, both countries need to sit and talk and resolve the differences,"" he said.BNP leader and party spokesman Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said that the decision regarding Hasina's stay in India rests solely with her and the Indian government, and BNP has no influence over the matter.""Right now, she (Hasina) is the most wanted person in Bangladesh to be exposed to justice for numerous crimes – from murders and forced disappearances to massive corruption like siphoning out of billions of dollars,"" he said.""Yet, the people of Bangladesh think, the Indian authorities should take into account their feelings as eventually ties between the two neighbouring countries depend on relations between two peoples and not between a country and an individual or quarter,"" Chowdhury told PTI.""The people (in Bangladesh) will not see it in a good light (Hasina's stay in India),"" he added.",Senior leaders of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have stated that the bilateral ties between India and Bangladesh are not dependent on the Awami League.
