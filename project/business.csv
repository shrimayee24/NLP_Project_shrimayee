He manipulatively estranged her from daughter, says 1st wife

NEW DELHI: Can a marriage solemnised between a man and a woman belonging to the Kuki tribe in a church be dissolved by the Songpijan village committee and 'gaonburas (village elders)' in Assam's Dima Hasao district on proceedings initiated by the husband relying on customary law?The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church in terms with the Christian Marriage Act, 1872, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders. Such a marriage can only be dissolved through proceedings initiated before the HC or the district judge as per section 10 of the Divorce Act, 1869, it had said.This HC ruling landed the Indian ambassador to Cuba, Thongkomang Armstrong Changsan, in a piquant matrimonial situation as he ended up with two wives. Prior to the HC declaring in 2022 that his 1994 church marriage with Neikhol Changsan subsisted, he had married another woman after the customary divorce. From both marriages, he has a daughter each.After failure of the mediation ordered by the Supreme Court, during pendency of Changsan's appeal, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi on Friday orally observed that the HC judgment is legally sound. Finding that the Indian Foreign Service officer is now married for nearly a decade and half, it decided to find a solution to this legal-matrimonial complexity and help the first wife start a new life.The ambassador said he has been paying a monthly maintenance of Rs 20,000 to Neikhol and has given her a house in Delhi.Neikhol argued the case herself and told the court that she had single handedly brought up her daughter without any participation from her husband.Neikhol, the first wife, alleged that he has now manipulatively estranged her daughter (29) from her. For the ambassador, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the father had been meeting the expenses of his daughter, who is pursuing a career in Bengaluru.Neikhol appealed to SC to ""protect her honour and dignity"" while describing how surreptitiously Changsan dissolved the marriage using tribal community elders, and remarried. The Justice Kant-led bench said, ""We have absolutely no sympathy for the man. The HC judgment is in your favour, and you have suffered socially and mentally. But can you think of a way to start life afresh?""Interestingly, 'Kuki Inpi' of Assam, the highest governing body of the Kuki tribe in the state, has said Kuki customary law can neither dissolve a Christian marriage performed in church nor can it force any couple to reunite against the will of the couple.SC said it could be profitable for Neikhol to meet her daughter and discuss future course of action, and asked the ambassador to arrange for her flight tickets to Bengaluru, a place of stay near her daughter's place, and pay her an ad hoc amount of Rs 3 lakh to enable her to meet her daughter.""If at all there is a possibility of settlement, the daughter could have a significant role to play,"" Justice Kant said, adding that the IFS officer must advise his daughter to re-establish contact with her mother.","The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders.

Massive Rescue Operation: Over 300 Trekkers Saved in Maharashtra's Malshej Ghat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/over-300-trekkers-rescued-in-maharashtras-malshej-ghat-kalu-river-surge-traps-group-locals-forest-teams-lead-7-hour-operation/articleshow/122935040.cms,"



PUNE: Over 300 trekkers, including 100 women, were rescued by the Thane and Junnar forest divisions with help from local villagers during a seven-hour operation on Saturday at Wagachiwadi village in the Malshej Ghat region. This area lies on the border between Pune and Thane districts, about 150 km from Pune, near the Kalyan-Ahmednagar highway.The trekkers came from Hyderabad, Pune, and Mumbai but became stranded in the forest after the Kalu River’s water level rose due to heavy rainfall in the afternoon, according to forest officials and locals. The forest officials were notified of their entrapment after receiving a call from the state disaster management cell and district administrations.The rescue operation was particularly hazardous, as locals had to swim through the rushing waters to secure ropes and harnesses to trees, using a zipline to transport individuals across the river. Bhaskar Mengal (24), a villager from Morushi village who played a crucial role in the rescue, told TOI, “The river water was gushing, and there was no other way to reach the other side. Since I am familiar with the local conditions, I swam across the river to tie ropes and a harness to the trees.The tourists were scared, and tensions were high. I had to calm them down.”“I prioritised rescuing women. Since we were using the zipline to cross the river, I had to explain the technique to them and assure them that they would not fall. We successfully sent them across one by one. Eventually, another villager, Kamlu Pokla, and forest guards joined me.” Pokla, who has successfully rescued several stranded tourists in the past, added, “During the night, the tourists began to panic and were hesitant to follow our instructions as everybody wanted to go to the other side. We had to calm them down before rescuing them from the deep forest.”Forest officials said that the tourists ventured into the restricted dense forest that Saturday morning without consulting locals. “They were unaware of the local conditions, which led to their entrapment when the river’s water level suddenly increased within a few hours. This area is extremely treacherous and risky for visitors,” Rajvardhan Bhosale, the Range Forest Officer of the Tokavade forest range in Thane district, told TOI.The rescue operation began at 3 PM and concluded by 10 PM, successfully bringing everyone to safety. Most tourists prefer to approach the Kalu River waterfall from the Murbad tehsil side because the trek to the waterfall is steep. However, this particular zone is located within a reserved forest area, home to a large population of wildlife, including leopards and venomous snakes, said the forest officials.Smita Rajhans, assistant forest officer of the Junnar forest division, said, “As many tourists share videos on social media, an increasing number of visitors from other states are coming to Junnar and the surrounding areas for trekking to enjoy the rains. They often disregard their safety, neglect to hire locals for guidance, and attempt adventurous activities in these dense forest zones, leading to their entrapment as they miss the trails. ”The Malshej Ghat, Naneghat, and several villages in the Murbad tehsil of Thane district are known for their alluring jungle treks and trails. This region receives over 200 mm of rainfall within 24 hours, causing local streams, waterfalls, and rivulets to flow at capacity. Consequently, there are numerous small and medium-sized waterfalls in the area.“The natural beauty of these water bodies attracts tourists from various parts of the country, and even international visitors have started flocking to these spots. Hence, it has become imperative for us to enhance basic safety infrastructure in these locations,” said a senior forest official.Kalu Waterfall: The famous Kalu Waterfall is situated in the Khireshwar village, Junnar tehsil, approximately 150 km from Pune. Due to unfamiliarity with the region's geography, a tourist ventured too deep into the valley near the waterfall and accidentally fell into the rushing water at its base. The Kalu Waterfall, located in the Malshej Ghat region, is renowned for its stunning natural beauty and attracts thousands of visitors, especially from Mumbai and Pune, particularly during the monsoon season. With a height of 1,200 feet, the Kalu River cascades, making it one of the largest waterfalls in the region and the district.However, locals have voiced concerns about safety at the site, noting that inadequate safety measures have resulted in numerous fatalities. The area is prone to slippery patches and unstable rocks, raising the risk of accidents.Visitors are often drawn to the site due to videos shared on social media, compelling them to capture their experiences.Past Incidents: On July 12, a group of local youths rescued a youth from Hyderabad at Kalu Waterfall. On June 6, a 23-year-old woman tragically lost her life after falling into a 150-foot-deep gorge while trekking at Rajgad Fort in the evening hours.On July 13, six trekkers lost their way while descending from Visapur Fort in Lonavala. The members of the local rescue team rescued them. They were in the forest for almost four hours. In 2022, a software engineer (33) from Hyderabad experienced a scare after losing his way during a solo trek on a 30 km treacherous route from Sonavelu village in Murbad tehsil of Thane to Konkan Kada in Junnar, passing through hilly and forest areas.","Over 300 trekkers, including 100 women, were rescued by the Thane and Junnar forest divisions with help from local villagers. The trekkers came from Hyderabad, Pune, and Mumbai but became stranded in the forest after the Kalu River’s water level rose due to heavy rainfall.

TCS Layoffs : What’s Behind The Move?

TCS layoffs: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which is India's largest IT services firm, plans to lay off over 12,000 employees over this year. This is nearly a 2% reduction in the workforce of the IT giant, an unprecedented number for the IT firm.In an official statement, TCS told ET, “TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation… As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2% of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year.”In the April-June quarter, the leading six IT companies saw 72% reduction in workforce expansion, with only 3,847 new hires, compared to 13,935 recruitments during the January-March period.India's IT services sector, which generates combined revenues of over $283 billion, has software companies ranked amongst the biggest private employers. TCS leads as the largest employer in this segment.According to the report, ongoing economic uncertainties and disruptions caused by AI technologies are impacting business demands.The Tata group subsidiary, based in Mumbai, has a total employee count of 613,069 at the close of June 2025.According to a Reuters report, the layoffs will majorly affect people in the middle to senior management positions and around 12,200 people will be asked to leave.According to HFS Research's CEO Phil Fersht, artificial intelligence is diminishing the labour-intensive service delivery approach in the industry.""(That model) is forcing large service providers such as TCS to rebalance their workforces to maintain profit margins and stay price-competitive in a cut-throat market where clients are demanding 20-30% price reductions,"" Fersht was quoted by Reuters.He further noted that this action by TCS, known for providing stable employment, underscores this industry-wide development.The impacted employees who will be asked leave will be provided with notice period compensation and extra severance benefits. Additionally, TCS plans to provide insurance coverage extension and career transition assistance to those affected by this decision, the report said.TCS also said, “This transition is being planned with due care to ensure there is no impact on service delivery to our clients… We understand that this is a challenging time for our colleagues likely to be affected. We thank them for their service and we will be making all efforts to provide appropriate benefits, outplacement, counselling, and support as they transition to new opportunities.""This workforce reduction comes within days of many TCS staff employees initiating legal proceedings challenging the company's modified bench policy. The revised policy stipulates that employees can only remain unbilled for 35 days annually and must achieve a minimum of 225 billable days per year.Recently it was reported that TCS has delayed the onboarding of 600 lateral hires. TCS issued a notice regarding 'indefinite delay', without providing any new joining dates for the selected technology professionals.NITES (Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate) has escalated this matter to Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya through a written communication, highlighting concerns about the financial difficulties and psychological stress faced by these professionals due to the uncertain situation.TCS announced its comprehensive strategic approach, which includes investments in emerging technologies, market expansion, large-scale AI implementation for clients and internal operations, strengthening partnerships, developing advanced infrastructure and restructuring their employment framework.To achieve these objectives, various programmes focused on skill enhancement and staff reallocation have been initiated and are currently in progress.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's largest IT services firm, plans to lay off over 12,000 employees over this year.

She allegedly collected between Rs 20–30 lakh from each client under false pretenses, police said.Police further disclosed that Namratha’s son, an advocate by profession, managed the clinic’s financial operations from the same premises. He also reportedly intimidated clients who raised objections.Authorities, as cited by PTI, added that over 10 previous cases had been registered against the accused at various police stations across Andhra Pradesh. Despite the medical and health department cancelling the clinic’s registration earlier, it continued operations using the name of another certified doctor on official documents.The clinic at Gopalapuram in Hyderabad was sealed with assistance from the medical department.The racket resurfaced after a couple, who believed their child was born through surrogacy, discovered through a DNA test that the baby was not biologically theirs. Alarmed, the couple approached the police.Deputy Commissioner of Police (North Zone–Hyderabad) S Rashmi Perumal told PTI that Dr Namratha, along with her associates and agents, targeted vulnerable women—particularly those seeking abortions—and persuaded them to continue their pregnancies in exchange for money or other inducements. These newborns were then passed off as surrogate babies, misleading clients into believing they were their biological children.According to the police, the victim couple had approached Namratha’s clinic in August 2024 for fertility and IVF consultation. After initial tests, they were advised to opt for surrogacy. They were then referred to the clinic’s Visakhapatnam branch for specimen collection and were told the clinic would arrange a surrogate and handle the embryo transplant.Over the course of nine months, the couple made several payments totaling more than Rs 35 lakh. In June 2025, they were informed that a baby boy had been delivered via C-section in Visakhapatnam. The child was handed over to them along with documentation falsely listing them as the biological parents.""The baby was not shown as a child born to a surrogate, which drew their suspicion. Later, the couple went in for DNA test which revealed that the child’s DNA did not match theirs,"" said Rashmi.When the couple sought clarification from the clinic, they were denied documentation and threatened, prompting them to file a police complaint.In the current case, police traced the baby’s biological parents, originally from Assam and residing in Hyderabad, through agents. They had reportedly been paid a small amount after giving up the child. Both were arrested on charges of baby selling, and the infant has been handed over to 'Shishu Vihar' as per protocol.Dismissing certain media reports, Rashmi clarified, ""It is a case wherein the victim couple were told that they were going in for surrogacy, but in reality the baby was sold by the original parents and that the baby was shown to this complainant couple (by the accused) as their child. But when they did the DNA test it was revealed as not matching with theirs."" She also refuted claims that the child had cancer or that donor sperm had been used, reported PTI.The investigation remains underway, and additional legal action is being taken.","The racket resurfaced after a couple, who believed their child was born through surrogacy, discovered through a DNA test that the baby was not biologically theirs.

BATHINDA: Resistance to AAP-led Punjab government's land-pooling policy is acting as the glue to bring together fractured farm organisations and individual farmers beyond political affiliation, reports Neel Kamal.It appears to be rekindling farm struggles that seemed to be losing momentum - seeing that there was not much hue and cry after Punjab Police slammed shut the protests at Shambhu and Khanauri borders with Haryana.The Bhagwant Mann government has been trying to convince people that land-pooling scheme was beneficial to farmers but it hasn't been able to dispel farmers' apprehension of losing land. Individual farmers from villages where land is being 'pooled' - those so far not associated with farm organisations - are now turning towards them to oppose the scheme.The policy aims to pool over 40,000 acres of farmland to promote planned urban development. It's a land-for-land scheme, where landowners voluntarily give up land and are given developed residential and commercial plots in exchange.SKM's green light to its Punjab chapter to hold tractor rallies on July 30 in villages that are likely to be brought under land-pooling scheme has come as a boost to forces opposing the scheme. The national committee of KMM has also backed the SKM call, further emboldening resistance.","Opposition to Punjab's land-pooling policy brings together farmers beyond political affiliation.

Newborn loses 5 fingers in operation sans parents’ consent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/newborn-loses-5-fingers-in-operation-sans-parents-consent/articleshow/122940372.cms,"CHENNAI: A boy born at 24 weeks in a Perambur hospital lost all five fingers on his right hand to gangrene. The premature delivery was triggered by a cervical pessary procedure performed without informed consent.This procedure set off a chain of events that ended in the baby developing gangrene. According to district consumer disputes redressal commission, Chennai (North), the premature insertion done without adequate testing or emergency justification led to complications including abdominal pain, bleeding, and ultimately, preterm delivery at just 24 weeks.The baby, born with low birth weight and no spontaneous breathing, suffered from poor blood circulation. During post-delivery care and transfer to NICU, swelling and blackened fingertips developed early signs of gangrene.The commission held that the hospital and gynaecologist failed to monitor and manage the baby's fragile postnatal condition, and could not explain how the circulatory failure that caused the gangrene occurred. The cervical pessary procedure was deemed the starting point of a sequence that resulted in the injury.The child's mother was undergoing fertility treatment and was 22 weeks pregnant when the device was inserted, despite a medical scan showing only a 9% risk of spontaneous preterm birth. A pessary is inserted into the vagina to support the cervix and to delay premature labour in high-risk pregnancies.However, the anomaly scan done on July 4, 2023, merely advised progesterone or cerclage ""after discussion with the obstetrician"". Instead, the gynaecologist at Srinivas Priya Hospital inserted the pessary on the same day without waiting, without mandatory antenatal tests, and without documented prior consent.The commission ruled that the hospital and the gynaecologist failed to justify the emergency nature of the procedure or explain why informed consent was bypassed. The commission held them liable for negligence and directed them to pay 23.65 lakh spent on treatment, 10 lakh for pain and suffering, and 10,000 as litigation cost.","A boy born at 24 weeks in a Perambur hospital lost all five fingers on his right hand to gangrene.

HC said accused Mohd Rizwan Ashraf could not be released due to the ongoing investigation, as releasing him and others at a crucial stage would impede the probe.""This court is satisfied that the trial court applied its mind to the grounds set forth.

'Wrong Bodies' Of Ahmedabad Air India Crash Victims Sent to Families: India Dismisses UK Media Claim

NEW DELHI: Brainstorming is on at the highest levels of Tata Group and the aviation ministry to put Air India back on track after the spate of bad news led by the deadly AI 171 crash and regulatory actions in past few months. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran on Friday met Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu and aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha. The meeting came after three days of detailed discussions between the airline management led by CEO Campbell Wilson and officials led by the secretary that have led to concrete suggestions emerging from the same.“We have discussed all issues threadbare including those related to maintenance, leadership and communications. Something positive will come out of this. India needs strong carriers and govt will support airlines wherever needed. The results will hopefully be visible in coming days once the suggestions are implemented,” said people in the know. One such meeting went on till well after 10 pm earlier this week.Sources say Chandrasekaran informed govt about the steps being taken by the airline post AI 171 crash and some recent incidents o bolster safety.“Basically, it was informed how AI plans to win back flyers’ confidence,” they said.It is learnt the areas identified during the recent meetings for immediate attention include airworthiness, engineering and maintenance. A lack of spares, for instance, often forces aircraft to fly under “minimum equipment list” (MEL) for a long time. MEL is a list that conditionally allows aircraft to be used with some equipment inoperative with the condition that the same does not impact safety and that it would be replaced within a certain timeframe.The main issue, say multiple people involved in the exercise, is of culture. “Vistara was merged into AI last Nov, ideally it should have been the other way round. But that is done. Both the airlines have a very different culture and AI is now facing post-merger issues. During the meetings, solutions were suggested. The main issue is not operations but it is about engineering and maintenance,” they said.For some time, having the better run Singapore Airlines (SIA) — which has 25.1% stake in AI with the rest with the Tatas — play a more visible handholding may be considered. It’s not about the image of AI alone, which has taken a beating, but also the Maharaja’s new promoters — Tatas and SIA.The focus has to be on ensuring 100% safety and not growing rapidly. AI has cut flights post the Ahmedabad crash. “The culture has to change to safety first not just for AI but all airlines. Sacrifice growth but ensure safety. That has to be the firm message across the board,” they said.The example being cited is of Boeing which has been through a rollercoaster in recent years from being a “marvellous organisation once celebrated for engineering excellence” to an airline cutting corners for commercial reasons when it tried to counter competitor Airbus’ best-seller A320NEO planes with a hurriedly made B737 MAX. After two MAX crashes in quick succession, Boeing is now trying hard to win back customer airlines’ and flyers’ faith by making safer planes.",Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran met Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu and aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha.

"Operation Grayskull: US justice department shuts child abuse sites; had 120,000 users and millions of files",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/operation-grayskull-us-justice-department-shuts-child-abuse-sites-had-120000-users-and-millions-of-files/articleshow/122944047.cms,"



US federal authorities have taken down a massive dark web network trading child sexual abuse material, in what the justice department described as “one of the most successful” operations of its kind.The move has resulted in the conviction of at least 18 individuals across the United States.The man at the centre of the investigation, William Spearman, known online as “Boss,” was arrested in November 2022 during a high-risk raid on his home in Madison, Alabama.The search warrant for his arrest was deemed so critical it received direct approval from the FBI director himself. Agents breached his home using tactical explosives, and despite Spearman fighting back, with three handguns within arm’s reach, he was subdued and arrested.His capture marked a pivotal moment in Operation Grayskull, a years-long investigation that uncovered four of the most heavily trafficked child exploitation websites on the dark web. The FBI said these platforms were responsible for hosting and distributing hundreds of thousands of sexually exploitative images of children, with a million files, having over 120,000 members and recording upwards of 100,000 visits in a single day.“This is one of the most successful of all time,” said Matthew Galeotti, head of the justice department’s criminal division.“We dismantled four websites that have not regenerated.”Spearman pleaded guilty a year after his arrest and has since been sentenced to life imprisonment. Prosecutors described him as “one of the most significant” distributors of child sex abuse material globally.A sentencing memo noted that his refusal to surrender peacefully stemmed from the troves of incriminating evidence on his devices. “The devices at his desk contained massive quantities of evidence proving that he was the lead administrator of Website A,” the memo cited by CBS News said.“Unsurprisingly, the defendant's devices also contained an enormous collection of images and videos depicting the rape and abuse of children.”The investigation began in 2020 after authorities observed an alarming increase in traffic to a suspected dark web child abuse site. That discovery quickly led to a broader international operation, exposing a deeply embedded and technologically advanced network of abusers.“These are people who have a more of a technical understanding,” Galeotti said. “The defendants in this case, as sadistic as they may be, are somewhat sophisticated,” noting the use of encryption and other evasive tools.Among those convicted was Selwyn Rosenstein, who in 2022 was sentenced to 28 years in prison. His platform, prosecutors said, “was not simply a website; it was a large, active community of pedophiles and (abuse material) enthusiasts.

Partnership Built Over Four Decades







The Republic of Maldives and the United Arab Emirates have marked another milestone in a longstanding partnership centered on sustainable development and infrastructure enhancement. Over four decades of cooperation through the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) has seen the successful implementation of critical projects across sectors like tourism, energy, transportation, and healthcare. Most recently, two significant aviation projects, Maafaru International Airport earlier this month and Velana International Airport today, stand as the latest additions to a portfolio exceeding AED 1.11 billion (approx. USD 302 million). These projects are not only infrastructural upgrades but also strategic interventions to enhance connectivity, drive economic growth, and position Maldives as a global hub.The Government of Maldives today inaugurated the Velana International Airport, a flagship development aligned with the country’s strategic infrastructure goals, with participation from the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) highlighting its key role in the project.The event coincided with the 60th anniversary of the Maldives’ independence, adding symbolic significance to the unveiling of this high-impact development.The airport’s transformation was made possible by a total investment of AED 330.5 million (USD 90 million) from ADFD, executed in two phases, and co-financed by the Saudi Fund for Development, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, and the OPEC Fund for International Development. This multi-stakeholder cooperation highlights a shared commitment among Gulf-based development partners to support inclusive and sustainable growth in developing nations.The inauguration ceremony saw the presence of prominent leaders and officials, including:The upgraded Velana Airport can now accommodate over 7 million passengers annually, a major boost to the nation’s capacity to handle international travel and tourism.

Constructed with an investment of AED 367 million (USD 100 million), Maafaru Airport includes a 2,850-metre-long and 45-metre-wide runway, capable of receiving large wide-body aircraft including Airbus A330 and Boeing 777.The airport is designed to serve as a key gateway to seven surrounding luxury resorts, playing a pivotal role in driving tourism revenue and employment in the region.The inauguration ceremony was attended by:During the event, Minister Mohamed Saeed extended his appreciation to UAE President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, noting the strategic value of the bilateral relationship and the UAE’s unwavering commitment to supporting sustainable development in the Maldives.He also acknowledged ADFD’s vital role in helping the country implement transformative projects and strengthen key economic sectors such as transport and tourism.The Maldives’ development partnership with the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) began in 1978. Since then, ADFD has financed 11 strategic projects across vital sectors such as transportation, tourism, energy, and healthcare, with total investments exceeding AED 1.11 billion (USD 302 million).The recently inaugurated airport projects are a continuation of this enduring collaboration, aligning with the Maldives’ national development agenda and the UAE’s broader vision for international cooperation and sustainable growth.Established in 1971, ADFD is one of the UAE’s leading financial institutions, focused on supporting infrastructure development in emerging economies. The Fund manages UAE government grants for key strategic projects and follows a diversified investment strategy that enhances economic resilience in partner countries. It also finances UAE-based private sector companies to help expand their global reach and competitiveness.","The Velana International Airport project was co-financed by ADFD alongside the Saudi Fund for Development, Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, and OPEC Fund for International Development.

Despite US warnings against participation, India hopes the conference will pave the way for concrete steps towards a two-state solution, advocating for an immediate ceasefire and hostage release.

Jaishankar’s Savage Declaration Of War At QUAD Meeting: ‘India Will Defend Its People’ | Watch

NEW DELHI: India is expected to participate in the UN high-level conference on peaceful settlement of the Palestine question and implementation of the 2-state solution, amid renewed international efforts to end the Gaza war. According to a list of delegates, 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday that will be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, both key strategic partners for India.India had also voted in favour of a UNGA resolution last year that announced an international summit in June 2025 to discuss the 2-state solution. However, the conference couldn’t take place last month because of the Iran-Iraq conflict.The US had last month warned governments around the world against participating in the conference, saying it would mar ongoing efforts to end the war and free hostages, according to a diplomatic cable witnessed and reported by Reuters from Paris and Washington.According to France, the conference aims to chart a path towards the 2-state solution through “concrete measures” proposed by the 8 working groups, which have conducted extensive consultations with UN member-states and civil society.The conference is drawing attention also for the announcement by French President Emmanuel Macron this week that France will recognise the Palestinian state, becoming the first G7 country to do so. The US has condemned France’s decision and will skip the conference along with Israel.Indian ambassador to the UN, P Harish, had in a statement last week in the Security Council on the Palestinian question had taken note of the high-level conference. “While engaging in a forward-leaning and constructive manner, it is our hope that this Conference would pave the way for concrete steps towards achieving a two-State solution,” said the official, while strongly calling for a ceasefire to be put in place and seeking release of all hostages.India, which was among the 19 countries that abstained from voting on a UNGA resolution in June for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, has been in touch with the 8 working groups and is expected to further provide its inputs on the 2-state solution during the conference. The level of India’s participation is still under consideration.On the Gaza issue, India has continued to walk a tightrope between its vital and growing ties with Israel and the traditional support for the Palestinian cause, including the 2-state solution. While the government strongly defends Israel’s right to defend itself from Hamas terrorist attacks, it also expects Israel to follow international law and not target civilians. “India shares historic and strong ties with our Palestinian brothers and sisters. We have always stood by them and our commitment towards the Palestinian cause is unwavering,” said Harish in his remarks in the Council.The ministry of external affairs also reiterated the Indian position in Parliament on Friday that India has always supported a negotiated 2-state solution, towards establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognized borders, living side by side in peace with Israel.","Despite US warnings against participation, India hopes the conference will pave the way for concrete steps towards a two-state solution. 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday.

Qatar is opening new doors for long-term residents with its Permanent Residency programme, a significant move that signals the nation’s evolving approach to retaining skilled expatriates. Introduced through Law No. 10 of 2018 and regulated by the Ministry of Interior (MOI), the policy grants select foreign nationals the opportunity to live, work, invest, and access public services in Qatar without the need for a local sponsor marking a major shift in the country’s traditional sponsorship model.To apply under the standard route, applicants must have legally resided in Qatar for:Eligible applicants must also:These requirements may vary per Council of Ministers decisions.Certain individuals, including children of Qatari women married to non-Qataris, spouses of Qatari citizens, and those with notable contributions or exceptional skills are exempt from residency and income duration requirements. Approval for such exemptions lies with the MOI committee.These routes are codified under the investor-based provision and allow property ownership in designated areas.Permanent residents can start or fully own companies in Qatar without needing a national partner.This provision is designed to attract foreign business, especially in sectors prioritized by Qatar Vision 2030.Permanent residents enjoy various advantages:No need for employer permission to exit or re-enter Qatar. Standard six-month absence rules for temporary visas do not apply.PR holders and eligible dependents can access government healthcare via MoPH‑regulated institutions and enroll in public schools, though many families choose private schools.PR status allows property ownership in designated freehold zones. This makes residency tied not only to living rights but also potential real estate investment.PR holders can register companies under foreign ownership, allowing full control without needing a Qatari shareholder. This is a strong perk for entrepreneurs and investors.Applicants can verify eligibility via the MOI’s official portal using their QID status and residency record.Eligible individuals submit applications through the MOI portal. Required documents typically include:A special MOI committee reviews submissions and makes recommendations to the Minister of Interior.Applicants pay a non-refundable QAR 3,000 (~USD 825) application fee. The same fee applies upon issuance of the Permanent Residency Card.While temporary residence processing typically takes under two weeks, permanent residency applications may take longer, depending on eligibility review and background checks. Monitoring through MOI portals is advised.PR cards are issued for one- or three-year periods, renewable via MOI submission. Permanent residents can remain outside Qatar beyond six months without forfeiting status. However, an extended absence exceeding six months post-application may reset residency duration under MOI discretion.Residency may be revoked if:Official decision lies with the Minister of Interior based on public interest criteria.With economic diversification underway and global mobility shifting, Qatar’s PR program aligns with Vision 2030 goals by attracting long-term talent and investment. PR status offers distinct advantages over temporary residency including stability, access to public benefits, and business freedom.That said, the 100‑permit cap means selection is competitive. Those who qualify, especially via investment or service gain long-term residency options without committing to citizenship. This makes it a strategic tool for international professionals and entrepreneurs with ties to Qatar’s growth sectors.For eligible expatriates born abroad, 20 years of Qatar residency, Arabic proficiency, clean record, and financial stability open the door to permanent residency. Investor pathways reduce the timeline via real estate or economic contribution. PR status grants access to public services, company ownership, property rights, and travel freedom.Strict enforcement of eligibility checks and a fixed annual quota ensures that permanent residency remains a strategic and privileged status, not a mass offering. For deeply committed expats or investors, Qatar Permanent Residency presents a meaningful long-term option.Eligible applicants include expats who have legally resided in Qatar for at least 20 years (10 years for those born in Qatar), have a clean criminal record, and demonstrate sufficient income and Arabic proficiency.Holders can access free healthcare and education, invest in real estate and commerce without a Qatari partner, and work without a local sponsor.Applications must be filed through the Ministry of Interior’s dedicated platform. Required documents include a valid ID, proof of residence duration, income statements, and police clearance.Yes, Qatar issues a limited number of permanent residencies each year, as determined by the MOI.No, it does not automatically lead to Qatari citizenship.

USCIS draws up an implementation plan to narrow birthright citizenship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uscis-draws-up-an-implementation-plan-to-narrow-birthright-citizenship/articleshow/122934930.cms,"USCIS draws up an implementation plan to narrow birthright citizenship





In a surprise move, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has recently drawn up an implementation plan for roll out of President Trump’s executive order (EO) that seeks to restrict birthright citizenship.This EO, signed by Trump on Jan 20, curtailed babies born in the US from getting automatic American citizenship unless one of the parents was a US citizen or green card holder at the time of birth of the child. USCIS explains that in the absence of a parent being a US citizen or green card holder, the new born child will take on the same status as that of the mother.This plan takes into cognisance the preliminary court injunction but states that it has been drawn up in the event that the EO is permitted to go into effect. It seeks to address certain legal issues.Currently, children of foreign diplomats born in the US are excluded from American citizenship due to their parents ‘not being subject to US jurisdiction’. The implementation plan outlines expansion of this exclusion to include children born to individuals in unlawful status or lawful but temporary status (such as H-1B holders).Cyrus D. Mehta, founder of an immigration law firm based in New York, told TOI, “The USCIS has a sinister plan to implement Trump's ‘currently unconstitutional’ birthright citizenship executive order, in case the EO which is currently blocked is allowed to go into effect.Under it, the newborn child will not automatically be a US citizen but would take on the lawful but temporary status of the mother.”In the case of an Indian couple, if the husband holds an H-1B (temporary non-immigrant work visa) and the wife holds an H-4 (dependent visa), the child born in the US to this couple would get a dependent visa status and not American citizenship.As mentioned by TOI earlier, given the decades long backlog for an employment based linked card, hundreds of Indian families with new-borns (post coming into effect of the EO) would be hard hit as neither parent would be a citizen or green card holder and the child would no longer be accorded American citizenship on birth.USCIS proposes to allow children born in the US to register for lawful immigrant status – such as H-4. This approach is modelled after how children of diplomats are currently handled under US immigration law.“If the mother is unlawfully present the child will also be considered unlawfully present as soon as it is born. The immigration authorities can technically remove the child who is unlawfully present,” adds Mehta.Immigration experts point out many challenges that could arise. What would be the situation if a child is born to a mother whose non-immigration visa status such as an H-4 is pending? Would it ridiculously result in the child being born in the USwith a similarly pending status? questions Mehta.Several immigration attorneys with whom TOI spoke are hopeful that if the litigation reaches the Supreme Court, the EO will be treated as unconstitutional.",US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has drawn up an implementation plan for roll out of President Trump’s executive order (EO) that seeks to restrict birthright citizenship.

Investors are also watching for key US economic data, including growth and job figures.The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at its latest policy meeting. However, markets are eager to hear how officials view the rest of the year, especially after Trump’s new tariffs. The Bank of Japan is also likely to avoid any major changes to borrowing costs.","The Euro rose to $1.1779 on Monday after the EU-US trade deal. Hong Kong led the rally, climbing around 1%.

Bengaluru Insect in Food: Rameshwaram Cafe extortion bid: Group accused of staging insect-in-food incident at Bengaluru airport outlet; demanded Rs 25 lakh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/rameshwaram-cafe-claims-extortion-bid-case-filed-after-group-tries-to-blackmail-bengaluru-airport-outlet-with-insect-in-food-video-demanded-rs-25-lakh/articleshow/122892312.cms,"



NEW DELHI: A case has been registered against a group of individuals accused of attempting to extort Rs 25 lakh from the popular Rameshwaram Cafe by allegedly staging a false incident of food contamination at its Kempegowda International Airport outlet in Bengaluru.According to police, the incident took place on the morning of 24 July.According to news agency PTI, a group of five to seven people reportedly caused a public disturbance by claiming that an insect had been found in the food served at the cafe.The complaint, filed by the café’s operations head, alleges that the individuals threatened to release a video of the incident on social media unless they were compensated.Soon after the scene, the team reportedly received a phone call demanding Rs 25 lakh in cash to avoid reputational damage to the brand.The cafe management has submitted call records, message screenshots, and other documents to support their claims and has urged police to take swift legal action.Police say a Zero FIR has been registered under sections 308(2) and 351(4) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), and the case will be transferred to the jurisdiction relevant to the complainant’s address.A Zero FIR allows a complaint to be filed at any police station regardless of the location of the crime.In a statement, Divya Raghav, founder of The Rameshwaram Café, rejected the accusations.“We categorically deny the baseless accusation that a worm or insect was found in our food,” she said. “This is clearly a staged act with malicious intent to extort money and malign our brand.”Ms Raghav said the cafe operates under “the strictest quality protocols” and that food safety, especially at sensitive locations like airports, is non-negotiable.She added that similar extortion attempts had been made in the past.“We will not succumb to intimidation or blackmail,” she said, adding that the company is fully cooperating with authorities and plans to pursue legal action against the alleged perpetrators.","A case has been registered against a group of individuals accused of attempting to extort Rs 25 lakh from the popular Rameshwaram Cafe.

Kolkata hospitals extend OT hours: Lodge patients in hotels to manage rush; viral fever keeps occupancy near 90%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-hospitals-extend-ot-hours-lodge-patients-in-hotels-to-manage-rush-viral-fever-keeps-occupancy-near-90/articleshow/122930780.cms,"Kolkata hospitals are increasing surgery capacity by extending OT hours and using nearby guest houses for pre-op patients to manage high occupancy rates. Facilities like BP Poddar and Peerless are streamlining patient flow, with surgeries up by 20-30%.





KOLKATA: Several private hospitals in the city have extended their operation theatre (OT) hours to accommodate more surgeries.At least two facilities have started accommodating patients lined up for surgeries at nearby guest houses and hotels, conducting their pre-surgical tests at their OPDs to reduce their wait for a bed vacancy.There was a 20%-30% rise in daily surgeries over the last three to four days, allowing several hospitals to discharge patients faster and maintain a high patient turnover. Most hospitals now have an occupancy of 85%-90%, which is considered 'full', and the high footfall is likely to persist until the end of Sept, according to the authorities.""We are putting up patients due for surgery at guest houses and hotels through our existing tie-ups. These patients are being called on an OPD basis for necessary tests and are admitted shortly before their scheduled surgeries,"" said Supriyo Chakrabarty, group advisor, BP Poddar Hospital.The hospital's Cath Lab, CTVS OT, and general OTs remain operational round the clock for emergency cases. However, non-emergency and elective surgeries are generally not scheduled between 10 pm and 8 am. ""All our general OTs, CTVS OT, and Cath Lab are functioning with only a short 2-hour closure between 4 am and 6 am for maintenance and realignment.Our Patient Services Department is carefully balancing non-emergency and elective surgeries,"" he added.At Peerless Hospital, surgery patients are also being helped to check into nearby guest houses. OT hours have been extended. ""While we usually do around 40 surgeries a day, it is now up to 65. We are asking planned surgery patients to check into nearby guest houses and complete their pre-surgery tests. Once the tests are done, we are wheeling the patient directly into the OT, cutting out the waiting time. Since we are now running at around 90% of our capacity and admissions remain very high, more surgeries are necessary to ensure that critical patients are not refused,"" said Peerless Hospital CEO, Sudipta Mitra. Woodlands Hospital, which has seen occupancy rise from 86% to 95% in a week, has experienced a 20% increase in surgeries. ""In the past 10 days, surgical cases have risen even more sharply. This has helped to optimise bed turnover and make room for more patients with viral fever, which is the primary driver of this spike,"" said Rupak Barua, CEO of Woodlands Multispecialty Hospital.Others, like Desun Hospital, have extended OPD hours to cater to more patients. ""We have not extended our OT hours, though all our 22 theatres are working round-the-clock,"" said chairman & MD Sajal Dutta.

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power.Huang’s vision aligns with growing industry momentum around embodied AI—where intelligence is tied to physical systems like robots or autonomous machines. Leading research labs such as DeepMind and Boston Dynamics are already exploring this frontier, integrating reinforcement learning with robotics to train systems capable of real-world interaction and problem-solving. This convergence of AI with physics and motion is what Huang sees as the next great leap.Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics.

Sundar Pichai joins the ‘billionaire club’ after leading Google for over a decade; his net worth is…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sundar-pichai-joins-the-billionaire-club-after-leading-google-for-over-a-decade-his-net-worth-is/articleshow/122897734.cms,"Sundar Pichai achieves rare feat as a non-founder CEO

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes. His rise underscores a shift in Silicon Valley’s power dynamics—where disciplined execution rivals disruptive invention. As Alphabet charts its future, Pichai’s story stands as a model for aspiring global leaders in tech and beyond.","Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO.

Asset managers navigate data security challenges

BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager, has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to China, requiring staff to use temporary loaner phones and prohibiting company laptops during business trips, according to Bloomberg News and Reuters reports.The financial giant detailed the ""policy enhancement"" in an internal memo effective July 16, barring the use of BlackRock-issued iPhones, iPads, laptops, and remote access via virtual private networks while in China. Employees will also lose access to the BlackRock network during personal travel to the country, Bloomberg reported.The move reflects mounting corporate anxiety about business operations in China as geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to strain international business relationships. BlackRock did not immediately respond to requests for comment from either Reuters or Bloomberg.The restrictions come after a series of high-profile incidents involving Western business executives being prevented from leaving China. Wells Fargo suspended travel to China last week after one of its senior trade financing bankers, Chenyue Mao, was blocked from departing the country in what Beijing's foreign ministry described as a criminal matter.Earlier this month, China also prevented a US Patent and Trademark Office employee from leaving during a personal visit, while a US Commerce Department worker has reportedly been unable to leave China for several months.Since China implemented stricter data security laws in 2021, global financial firms have struggled to balance operational needs with compliance requirements. Many banks and asset managers have established onshore data centers to keep Chinese information within the country, adding significant costs and complicating business management.BlackRock maintains a substantial presence in China through a wholly owned mutual fund company and a wealth management joint venture with China Construction Bank Corp. The firm's new travel policy reflects the broader challenges facing global financial institutions operating in an increasingly complex regulatory and security environment between the world's two largest economies.In related news, Amazon is shutting down its AI lab in Shanghai amid rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China. Launched in 2018, this lab contributed to over 100 academic papers and helped develop a neural network framework that generated close to $1 billion in sales, according to a scientist at the lab.As reported by The Financial Times, the development was confirmed by Wang Minjie, a scientist at the lab, via a social media post on China's WeChat. The lab was established by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2018 and Wang stated that his team was being “dissolved due to strategic adjustments amid US-China tensions,” and reflected on the “golden era of foreign research labs” in China.",BlackRock has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to China.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

US Vice President JD Vance does not agree with the idea that AI will lead to mass unemployment . Speaking at the AI Action Summit in Paris, Vance said that “If the robots were coming to take all of our jobs, you would see it already.” Vance emphasised that the sign of a massive AI-driven job takeover would be far more evident if such a scenario were truly imminent. The remark from Vance is seen as a broader defense of Trump administration’s pro-worker AI strategy. Vance stressed on the fact that AI will augment human labour and not replace it. He also criticised the tech leaders who promote dystopian visions of mass layoffs.According to a report by Business Insider, Vice President JD Vance criticised what he called ‘doomsday narratives’ from tech leader who believe that AI will eventually lead to widespread layoffs. “Too many leaders in the AI industry, when they talk about this fear of replacing workers, miss the point,” he said. “AI, we believe, is going to make us more productive, more prosperous, and more free.”His comments suggest a belief that while AI will undoubtedly transform industries and job roles, a sudden, widespread elimination of human labour is not currently underway or immediately foreseeable.Instead of complete job destruction, JD Vance anticipate a period of job evolution. He emphasised that AI as a tool will augment human capabilities and will also help in creating new kinds of jobs and will also create demands for new type of skills.The Vice President's remarks come as discussions around AI's societal implications intensify, with concerns ranging from ethical considerations to economic disruption.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
