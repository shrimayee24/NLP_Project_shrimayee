WHO adds key weight-loss drugs to essential meds list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-adds-key-weight-loss-drugs-to-essential-meds-list/articleshow/123798126.cms,"NEW DELHI: The World Health Organization (WHO) has included popular weight-loss drugs like Semaglutide and Tirzepatide, sold in India under the brand name Wegovy and Mounjaro, respectively, in its Model List of Essential Medicines (EML).This is important because the WHO's model list of essential medicines serves as a basis for public sector procurement, supply of medicines and health insurance, and reimbursement schemes in over 150 countries, including India.If India adopts the list, it could pave the way for a sharp reduction in the prices of these drugs in the future.Currently, Wegovy, one of the most popular weight loss drugs, costs anywhere between Rs 17,000 and Rs 26,000 per month depending on the dosage. Mounjaro, another blockbuster weight-loss drug, costs anywhere between Rs 14,000 and Rs 27,000 per month depending on dosage and the route of administration. Vials are cheaper compared to Kwikpens, a pre-filled, disposable device that contains medication.According to the WHO, the high prices of drugs like Semaglutide and Tirzepatide are limiting access to these medicines. ""Prioritising those who would benefit most, encouraging generic competition to drive down prices and making these treatments available in primary care - especially in underserved areas - are key to expanding access and improving health outcomes,"" the UN health body has said.Diabetes and obesity are two of the most urgent health challenges facing the world today. In India, studies suggest, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has gone up by over five times in the last 30 years - from approximately 53 million people in 1990 to 235 million in 2021.If action is not taken to curb this growing public health challenge, a recent study published in The Lancet warned, the overweight or obesity prevalence in the country may go up to over 520 million (projected figure) - the second highest globally.As part of broader efforts to reduce inequities in cancer care, the expert committee of WHO has also recommended increasing access to PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.","The WHO has included popular weight-loss drugs like Semaglutide and Tirzepatide in its Model List of Essential Medicines.

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports. The move covers offering exemptions covers key materials such as nickel, gold, pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals, according to a Reuters report.Since assuming power in January, Trump has unleashed a global trade war, announcing reciprocal tariffs on most major countries around the world. After announcing high tariffs on most countries in April, the Trump administration later used these as tools to negotiate trade deals which it says are favourable to the US. While some trade deals have been announced, exact details of many are yet to emerge.The new directive identifies more than 45 categories of goods that will qualify for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who agree to framework deals reducing Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security law.It also brings US tariffs into line with commitments under existing arrangements with allies including Japan and the European Union. The exemptions for countries covered by these agreements will begin at 12:01 AM EDT (0401 GMT) on Monday.In the order, Trump notes that any decision to reduce tariffs will hinge on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and broader US national interests.According to the White House, the tariff cuts apply to goods that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or where domestic production is insufficient. Officials said the order also introduces carveouts for certain agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented pharmaceutical articles.Once a reciprocal trade deal is in place, the US trade representative, Commerce Department and customs will have authority to waive tariffs on qualifying imports without requiring a new executive order, a White House official added.The zero-tariff list includes graphite and different forms of nickel, crucial for stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries. It also covers pharmaceutical compounds such as lidocaine, used as an anaesthetic, and reagents used in medical diagnostic testing, as per Reuters.Gold imports in multiple forms, including powders, leaf and bullion, are also exempted. Switzerland, a major supplier, has been hit by tariffs of 39% as it has not yet secured a deal with Washington.Other categories benefiting from the changes are natural graphite, neodymium magnets and LEDs. At the same time, the order scraps earlier exemptions for certain plastics and polysilicon, a material vital for solar panels.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday.

Screams, Chains, Panic: Inside ICE’s Biggest Worksite Raid; Hyundai Georgia Plant Turns 'War Zone'

South Korean companies jittery about US

The US work visa problems





US President Donald Trump ’s ambitious ‘Made-in-USA’ dream is facing hurdles created by his own administration’s actions. The recent immigration raid on a Hyundai-LG Energy Solution battery facility in Georgia is an example of how Trump’s crackdown on immigrants and move to create jobs in the US, may actually face big hurdles, for now.Law enforcement officials have taken 475 individuals into custody at the complex, and according to reports, LG Energy Solution has postponed the commencement of operations at the facility to the first half of 2026. As reported by Yonhap on Monday, immigration authorities have presented the detained individuals with two alternatives: accept deportation with a five-year ban on re-entry, or remain in detention pending trial.According to a Bloomberg report, industry analysts note that these large-scale manufacturing initiatives, which Trump highlights as achievements in domestic job creation, are encountering difficulties due to immigration enforcement targeting their essential workforce.""Your Investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people, with great technical talent, to build World Class products, and we will make it quickly and legally possible for you to do so,"" Trump said on Truth Social on Sunday, emphasising that whilst the US welcomes foreign investment and skilled workers, proper legal procedures must be followed.Trump has expressed his desire to facilitate the training of US workers by bringing in battery plant specialists.Over the weekend, Korean authorities endeavoured to facilitate the release of 300 detained nationals at a Hyundai Motor Co.-LG Energy Solution Ltd. joint venture construction site, according to Lee's chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik during a high-level meeting between government officials and the ruling Democratic Party.The visa status of the workers and their legal authorisation to work at the site remains uncertain.The enforcement action, despite being unusual in its magnitude and the type of workers affected, is creating anxiety among Hyundai's industry counterparts, including Samsung Electronics Co. and SK On Co., who have also pledged substantial investments in the United States.The timing is also sensitive, following the meeting between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Trump that highlighted their partnership and cemented a fresh trade agreement. The arrangement incorporated a $350 billion fund to assist South Korean companies growing their presence in the US, allocating $150 billion specifically for shipbuilding ventures. Additionally, private sector organisations committed $150 billion for direct investment in the US.South Korean conglomerates are working to manage the aftermath, raising apprehension about planned investments worth billions of dollars.The extensive operation caused distress amongst South Koreans when footage emerged showing workers in shackles at the waist, ankles and wrists. This action, part of a larger US initiative against undocumented workers, occurred shortly after a summit between Lee Jae Myung and Donald Trump that highlighted their partnership.""The Georgia episode demonstrates that managing this hurdle with higher tariffs and tighter labor supply will not be an easy task,"" said Homin Lee, a senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier Singapore Ltd., discussing the blanket 15% import duty from the Asian nation. ""We expect South Korea to push for pragmatic tweaks in US visa rules to keep the economic viability of many marquee capex projects,” Homin Lee was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.The presence of South Korean specialists, engineers and sub-contractors is essential for these projects' success. Any restrictions on their movement could potentially disrupt manufacturing schedules, increase expenses and diminish the intended industrial growth. This situation could also affect Hyundai's production expansion plans in Georgia.""Mass production in the first half of 2026 is virtually impossible due to the departure of key personnel during the installation and commissioning phase,"" said Anna Lee, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea in Seoul.This enforcement action has introduced uncertainty regarding South Korea's extensive US investment plans. The incident involving workers at a major Korean investment project might signal to other companies that US operations carry heightened political and regulatory challenges.These multibillion-dollar facilities require substantial numbers of international engineers and contractors, yet organisations like Hyundai and LG face considerable obstacles in securing appropriate visas for their specialist personnel.Under Trump's administration, Korean companies in the US have faced difficulties securing work visas, sources told Bloomberg. Particularly, subcontractors have experienced significant visa processing delays, hampering on-site technical discussions and coordination of visits.These staff members, particularly engineers with production line design knowledge, are considered indispensable, according to a battery sector representative. However, local recruitment remains viable for electrical work and basic technical support roles.Immigration enforcement actions draw attention to an ongoing challenge in US-South Korean relations: the significant gap between trade and immigration regulations.South Korea, despite maintaining a free trade agreement with the US since 2012, lacks a dedicated visa allocation, unlike other FTA nations. Whilst Australia, Singapore and Chile enjoy specific visa quotas, and Canada and Mexico operate without limitations under the Treaty National visa scheme, as legal practitioners note. This disparity creates considerable tension for Seoul, revealing a substantial flaw in the economic partnership between the nations.The core challenge stems from US work permit regulations.The H-1B visa category, which maintains an annual limit of 85,000 permits and operates via a random selection process, presents significant obstacles. South Korean organisations struggle to obtain necessary authorisations, typically securing merely 2,000 visas yearly. This limitation has led some Korean enterprises and their associated contractors to utilise B-1 business visas or ESTA for employment activities, according to immigration specialists. These particular visas, however, are exclusively designated for business gatherings or leisure travel, explicitly forbidding any form of employment.According to Monday's Korean media coverage, citing anonymous industry insiders, approximately 30% of B-1 visa applicants succeed, with deployment taking four to five months post-approval. The extensive application process includes corporate invitation letters, contractual documents, CVs and interviews. This has led workers to adopt a pattern of 70-80 day ESTA-based work periods followed by departures and returns, as reported by Chosun Ilbo.""The incident is likely to exacerbate the shortages of legally qualified skilled workers and increase labor cost pressures, which in turn would result in project delays and cost increases across major US construction projects,"" Eugene Investment & Securities Co. analyst Ryu Tae-hwan said. ""Companies' ability to procure and manage labor in America may emerge as a key factor for project execution.""",US President Donald Trump’s ambitious ‘Made-in-USA’ dream is facing hurdles. The recent immigration raid on a Hyundai-LG Energy Solution battery facility in Georgia is an example.

Cross-voting in VP election? Radhakrishnan's victory margin puts question mark on opposition's unity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cross-voting-in-vp-election-radhakrishnans-victory-margin-puts-question-mark-on-oppositions-unity/articleshow/123769754.cms,"NEW DELHI: NDA candidate C P Radhakrishnan was on Tuesday elected as the 15th Vice-President of India bagging 452 votes against the opposition candidate B Sudershan Reddy's 300. Announcing the result, Rajya Sabha Secretary General and Returning Officer P C Mody said 767 MPs had cast their votes out of the total valid electors of 781. He said 752 ballots were valid and 15 were invalid, bringing down the required majority of first preference votes to 377.That Radhakrishnan would win the VP race was perhaps never in doubt given the numbers advantage that he had over Reddy. But there was still a lot of interest in the final results. The fact that VP polls are held without any party whip thereby leaving a window open for cross voting had instilled some hope in the opposition camp. If not an outright win, they could at least bank on ""conscience vote"" to attract some NDA MPs to their side and embarrass the ruling camp. The Telugu card was a thought out strategy to achieve this objective.Unfortunately, as the final results show, the strategy boomeranged.Instead of NDA MPs ditching their camp, it appears the INDIA bloc members responded to their ""conscience"". The vote tally suggests some cross-voting in favour of Radhakrishnan.The BJP, which had silently ensured that all leaders associated with the ruling alliance voted in favour of NDA candidate, was quick to take digs at opposition's pre-voting claims of unity within their ranks.Union minister Kiren Rijiju claimed ""Many opposition parties have also voted for our NDA candidate. This is also a very good sign."" In fact, BJP claims that at least 15 opposition members voted for the NDA nominee.Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh had earlier asserted that all 315 INDIA bloc MPs were in attendance for the vote.""The Opposition has stood united. ALL of its 315 MPs have turned up for voting. This is an unprecedented 100% turnout,"" he said on X.Since this was a secret ballot, so who all cast conscience vote may perhaps be not known. But the opposition did admit that it suffered a dent, though not a significant one.""There has been a 14% increase in votes secured by this candidate (Opposition candidate B Sudershan Reddy) as compared to the last candidate. This candidate received 40% of the total votes, compared to 26% secured by the previous candidate. So the Opposition is only gaining; there will be a change...They (NDA) could not cause a significant dent ... ,"" Congress MP Imran Masood said.However, with Reddy managing only 300, the deficit of 15 votes raised questions. BJP leader Amit Malviya was quick to take pot shots at this claim. Soon after the results were out, he responded to Jairam's post and wrote:""All 315 voted… but for whom is the real question! 🤔 Despite all the noise and bravado, the INDI Alliance candidate managed only 300 votes, 15 short of what they had confidently claimed. So much for tall claims and unity!""However, Jairam Ramesh put up a brave defence and claimed opposition performance had improved compared to last elections.""Opposition performance has undeniably been most respectable. Its joint candidate Justice (retd) B Sudershan Reddy secured 40% of the vote. In 2022, the Opposition had received 26% of the vote in the vice presidential elections,"" Ramesh said.""The BJP's arithmetical victory is really both a moral and political defeat. The ideological battle continues undiminished,"" the Congress leader added.These claims notwithstanding, the fact remains that the opposition once again put up a poor show. Yes, 15 votes were declared invalid. But this does not explain the dip in INDIA bloc's overall numbers. Moreover, there is still no clarity on how the AAP members, who had promised support to Reddy, have voted.So, while the results are not a surprise, the more than expected victory margin of C P Radhakrishnan is surely is a matter of concern for the opposition. Clearly, they still are far away from their claims of unity.(With inputs from agencies)",NDA candidate C P Radhakrishnan was on Tuesday elected as the 15th Vice- President of India bagging 452 votes against the opposition candidate B Sudershan Reddy's 300.

NEW DELHI: A wildlife survey conducted in Arunachal Pradesh has brought out first-ever photographic evidence of the elusive Pallas’s cat in the state, reaffirming the eastern Himalayan terrain as a global biodiversity hotspot.The survey, conducted by WWF-India in association with the forest department of the Arunachal Pradesh government, also recorded the presence of other wild cats - snow leopard, common leopard, clouded leopard and marbled cat - above 4200 metres, indicating the landscape’s unique wild cat diversity.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh at nearly 5,000 metres is a powerful reminder of how little we still know about life in the high Himalayas,” said Rishi Kumar Sharma, head-science and conservation, Himalayas programme, WWF-India.Pallas’s cat is one of the most elusive and rarely photographed wild cats, and remains one of the least studied feline species. Its documentation in Arunachal Pradesh extends the known distribution of the species in the eastern Himalaya, adding to earlier confirmed records from Sikkim, Bhutan, and eastern Nepal.Though WWF-India conducted the survey during July-Sept last year, its findings were released only recently.The organisation claimed to have deployed 136 camera traps in 83 locations across 2,000 sq km of rugged high-altitude rangelands in West Kameng and Tawang districts, making it one of the most extensive wildlife monitoring exercises.Besides getting photographic record of Pallas’s cat, the survey documented the highest elevation records for common leopard at 4,600 metres above sea level (masl), clouded leopard at 4,650 masl, marbled cat at 4,326 masl, Himalayan wood owl at 4,194 masl and grey-headed flying squirrel at 4,506 masl.WWF-India’s findings noted that the elevation records for these species were the “highest in India to dateand may exceed previously known global elevation limits”.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh is a milestone for wildlife research in the eastern Himalayas. These findings reaffirm the state’s importance as a global biodiversity hotspot and highlight the need for continued investment in scientific monitoring and conservation,” said Ngilyang Tam, state’s principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden (wildlife and biodiversity).",Pallas’s cat is one of the most elusive and rarely photographed wild cats.

He also said long-term solutions — such as introducing a rail cargo service for Kashmir’s fruit produce — are being explored to prevent future disruptions during peak seasons.J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha visited Thard village in Udhampur district on Tuesday and reviewed the ongoing restoration work along NH-44. He also assured assistance to flood-hit residents of Jammu city.Senior officials, meanwhile, said NH-44 is likely to be opened on Wednesday for light vehicles. “The highway is still closed from Jakheni (Udhampur) towards Srinagar and vice versa due to blockages between Jakheni and Balli Nallah. No vehicular movement shall be allowed from Nagrota (Jammu) towards Reasi, Chenani, Patnitop, Doda, Ramban, Banihal, Srinagar, and vice versa,” a traffic official said.Jammu and Kashmir Apple Farmers Federation has warned that prolonged highway closure could push the horticulture sector — which generates around Rs 10,000 crore income and employs around 35 lakh people — to the brink of crisis. “Whenever Srinagar-Jammu highway is opened, only fruit trucks should be allowed to ply at night,” said Federation president Zahoor Ahmad Rather. He said several trucks stranded on the road had to return from Qazigund and unload apple boxes, leading to enormous losses.Border Roads Organisation’s 118 Road Construction Company, meanwhile, managed to restore the critical Gulabgarh-Chasoti road, which was reopened for traffic Tuesday. Twin cloudbursts in Kishtwar’s Chasoti on Aug 14 had triggered flash floods, killing 65 people and leaving several missing.

'Nepotism, Corruption And...': Ex-Envoys Decode What Fuelled Nepal’s Violent Gen Z Protests

NEW DELHI: India has advised its citizens to “defer travel (to Nepal) until the situation has stabilised. Airlines including Indian carriers, have suspended flights as Kathmandu Airport (KTM) was closed on Tuesday afternoon when Gen Z protestors set fire nearby. A few flights between Indian cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru were able to operate Tuesday morning. But as the day progressed and the situation worsened, multiple Kathmandu-bound flights hovered near the city before diverting or returning to India. Subsequently airlines suspended flights.In its advisory, the Indian foreign ministry said: “In view of the developing situation in Nepal, Indian citizens are advised to defer travel there until the situation has stabilised. Indian citizens presently in Nepal are advised to shelter in their current places of residence, avoid going out onto the streets and exercise all due caution. They are also advised to follow local safety advisories from Nepal authorities as well as the embassy of India in Kathmandu…”IndiGo said on X Tuesday afternoon: “In view of the prevailing situation in Kathmandu, the airport has been closed for operations. Consequently, all flights to and from Kathmandu stand suspended as of now. If your travel is impacted, you may conveniently opt for an alternate flight or claim a refund by visiting our website. We are closely monitoring the developments and coordinating with local authorities to resume operations at the earliest. ” Customers have been advised “to keep checking official channels for the latest advisories and updates.”Air India said on X Tuesday evening: “…Air India is offering passengers with confirmed bookings for travel to and from Kathmandu until Sept 11, on tickets issued up to Sept 9, a one-time waiver on rescheduling charges. The safety of our passengers and crew remains our highest priority.” SpiceJet cancelled Tuesday flights. AI Express has suspended Wednesday’s Bengaluru-KTM.By Tuesday afternoon Nepal aviation authorities issued a notice to airmen (NOTAM) about Kathmandu airport being closed.

They have also been asked to add or include new eligible beneficiaries so that deserving people get govt aid.Sources said such a move will ensure lakhs of “deserving” people waiting for inclusion in the list get the benefit. For example, while around 10 lakh new beneficiaries can be added to the list in Delhi, in Maharashtra over 50,000 can be included.Some of the state food secretaries who attended a meeting convened by the food ministry said that they have been urged to expedite the process for ‘correct targeting’ of beneficiaries. “As per the norm, state govts are empowered to create their own criteria for inclusion and exclusion of beneficiaries under the food security scheme. The food ministry has just asked us to follow our own criteria and if any state wants to change the norm, they can do so,” said a state govt official who attended the recent meeting.Earlier an exercise by the food ministry had found that about 10% of the existing 80 crore beneficiaries under PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojna were found to appear in one or more databases such as taxpayers, car owners or company directors. This also included beneficiaries who have not lifted free foodgrain for more than six months and they have been put under the “silent ration cards” category.Sources said states including Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh had initiated steps to weed out ineligible beneficiaries even before the Centre shared the indicative list.","Food ministry has urged states to complete the weeding out of ineligible beneficiaries for the govt’s free foodgrain scheme by this month end.

NEW DELHI: The high-stakes tussle over the inheritance of industrialist Sunjay Kapur took a fresh twist on Tuesday as his children from ex-wife and actor Karisma Kapoor approached Delhi high court challenging their exclusion from his assets, reported at Rs 30,000 crore, alleging his will was forged.Daughter Samaira and son Kiaan, through their legal guardian Karisma, filed a civil suit accusing Priya Kapur, Sunjay's third wife, of fabricating their father's will to gain complete control over his assets.Kapur, 53, died on June 12 this year after suffering a heart attack while playing polo in Surrey, UK. The suit claims that Kapur, while he was alive, never mentioned the will and seeks partition of the estate, rendition of accounts, and a permanent injunction against Priya and other defendants.Likely to come up for hearing on Wednesday, the suit also challenges Sunjay's March 21 will, which purportedly leaves his entire personal estate to Priya. The children have alleged that Priya's conduct since their father's death in June demonstrated ""without a doubt, that the alleged will has been fabricated"" by her.""The purported will allegedly executed by the plaintiffs' father is not a legal and valid document, is forged and fabricated, and in any event, surrounded by suspicious circumstances.It is for this reason that neither the original of the alleged purported will has been shown to the plaintiffs nor a copy of the alleged purported will has been provided,"" the suit submits.Seeking a direction to Priya to disclose the entire personal assets and effects of Kapur at the time of his sudden death, the plea says that ""plaintiffs do not have complete information regarding the personal assets and effects of their father at the time of his bereavement.""Karisma and Sunjay married in 2003 but divorced in 2016. The children argue they enjoyed a close relationship with their father until his sudden death. Accusing Priya of first denying the existence of a will, the plea claims it was in a family meeting on July 30 this year that she presented a document dated March 21, 2025, describing it as a will, prompting suspicions of forgery and manipulation. The plaintiffs added the original will or copy has not been shared with them and sought to arraign Priya, her minor son, Sunjay's mother Rani Kapur, and one Shradha Suri Marwah, as defendants. Marwah is the executor of the will.According to the children, their late father repeatedly assured them of their financial security and future well-being. They claim he initiated business ventures in their names, acquired assets both personally and through corporate entities, and named them as beneficiaries of the family trust. In July, Sunjay's mother Rani publicly objected to Priya's elevation as director in the company, alleging coercion, ahead of Sona Comstar's AGM. The plaintiffs allege they were summoned to corporate meetings of Sona BLW Precision Forgings Ltd (Sona Comstar) and asked to sign paperwork without being provided full transparency regarding the trust deed or associated records.","Daughter Samaira and son Kiaan, through their legal guardian Karisma, filed a civil suit accusing Priya Kapur, Sunjay's third wife, of fabricating their father's will to gain complete control over his assets.

As global mobility continues to rise, the United Arab Emirates, particularly Dubai , has positioned itself as a hub for professionals, entrepreneurs, and remote workers. With 88% of its population made up of expats, the UAE offers a range of visa options tailored to different work profiles. Whether you're employed by a local company, working remotely for a foreign firm, freelancing, or investing, understanding the UAE’s four main work-related visa pathways, Standard, Remote Work, Green, and Golden, is essential for anyone considering relocating to the country.The standard work visa is the most common pathway for foreign nationals working in the UAE across private, government, and free zone sectors. It’s an employer-sponsored visa, usually issued for two to three years, and is renewable.There’s no maximum age for applicants. However, if the worker is over 65, the employer pays an additional AED 5,000 (USD 1,360) every two years.The UAE’s Remote Work Visa, also known as the Virtual Work Program in Dubai, allows foreign professionals to reside in the UAE while working for a non-UAE-based employer. This is ideal for digital nomads or remote professionals looking for a base in the Gulf region.The Dubai Virtual Work Program also allows remote workers to bring their families with them.Introduced to attract global talent and support flexible employment models, the Green Visa separates the work permit from the residency permit. It provides a 5-year residence, without the need for an employer sponsor, and grants extended grace periods of up to 6 months post-expiry to stay in the UAE.The Golden Visa is a prestigious long-term residence permit valid for 5 or 10 years, designed to retain investors, top professionals, and exceptional talent.

MUMBAI: The normally reticent Bombay Parsi Punchayat (BPP) has now complained to union minister of Road Transport & Highways, Nitin Gadkari, about the pathetic condition of National Highway (NH48) between Dahisar and Talasari.In a letter to the ministry, the BPP said this highway is the only road connectivity to the pilgrimage site of Udvada in south Gujarat, where the community’s most important fire temple, the Iranshah, is located.""NH-48 Dahisar to Talasari has become a death trap and our community members and senior citizens suffer untold hardships due to poor construction done by NHAI-appointed contractors. All we ask are for our fundamental rights to good roads so that precious lives are not lost,’’ it said.BPP trustee Adil Malia told TOI that the community lost one of its illustrious members, industrialist Cyrus Mistry, on that road due to poor road conditions and unregulated traffic. ""The community has no alternative but to travel on NH48 and the route between Dahisar and Talasari is literally a 'Death Trap'. Several near fatal and serious accidents have been reported,’’ he said.Filly Bapuna, who frequently drives between Udvada and Mumbai, said, ``Driving on the NH-48 is a harrowing experience.It was cement concreted a few months ago, but there are already potholes everywhere. A new Range Rover had a tyre burst twice on this stretch.’’Dr Boorjis H. Doctor, who is leading a campaign for a safe NH-48, said he had a near-death experience this year due to the negligence of the road contractor. ``When I complained against the contractor at the Panvel police station, I was astonished to find that the senior inspector was unaware of the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) norms, leave aside enforcing them’’ he said.Meanwhile, on Tuesday, advocate Sujay Kantawala, said a journey from Boisar to Mumbai on the NH-48 took six hours.""My sister has sworn to travel by train only and described this highway as ""hell on earth’’.Meanwhile, highway activist Harbans Singh Nanade, said that despite spending Rs 600 crore on repairing the NH-48, traffic jams and accidents continue to occur.""This has raised questions about the functioning of NHAI and the contractor. The BRO (Border Roads Organization) is also primarily responsible for constructing and maintaining roads in border areas and difficult mountainous regions. Without wasting time, the services of BRO should be used for NH48 and the Thane - Ghodbunder road for safe travel.Two ambulances, travelling on Mumbai bound lanes, were seen stuck in Tuesday's traffic jam, and that too on the wrong side on the Gujarat bound lane.""Many motorists switch lanes the moment they see a traffic jam, further creating a traffic gridlock on the opposite lane as well, with no-one to stop them,’’ said a motorist.A senior NHAI official said traffic on NH48 is more due to the traffic flow on the Thane - Ghodbunder road.""Though potholes are there, the main reason was the traffic on the Thane bound lane on the Thane - Ghodbunder road. We are laying mastic on old bridges, said the officer when questioned about potholes on NH48.’’"," Bombay Parsi Punchayat (BPP) has now complained to union minister of Road Transport & Highways, Nitin Gadkari, about the pathetic condition of National Highway (NH48) between Dahisar and Talasari.

Relief for Bengaluru commuters as wait for Yellow Line Metro now reduced to 19 minutes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/wait-for-yellow-line-metro-in-bengaluru-now-reduced-to-19-mins/articleshow/123793044.cms,"Bogie Supply Delays





BENGALURU: Commuters on Namma Metro 's Yellow Line can finally breathe a little easy during rush hour. Starting Wednesday, with the addition of a fourth rake to the route, trains will be available at 19-minute intervals, instead of the current 25 minutes.BMRCL had started operations on the Yellow Line with just three rakes on August 11.The Yellow Line has been drawing more than 60,000 passengers daily, leading to packed coaches and chaotic scenes at the R V Road interchange. Security staff often struggled to manage the crowds, with barricades placed on platforms to prevent mishaps.With the addition of an extra train set, BMRCL now hopes to ease the passenger load and allow a smoother ride, particularly on the Electronics City-R V Road stretch.The addition of a fourth rake will also allow BMRCL to start the service earlier on weekdays: From 6 am, instead of 6:30 am. Sundays, though, will see no change, with the service continuing to start at 7 am.Last train timings will also remain unchanged: 11:55 pm from R V Road and 10:42 pm from Bommasandra.A senior BMRCL official said: ""September 10 was the deadline for deploying a fourth train. To meet the mandatory 750 km mainline operations [for service induction], we conducted trial runs on Monday and Tuesday.""The official further said the fourth train set will ease crowding, especially at R V Road station. ""However, a 19-minute interval is still quite long. So, we're working to bring in more trains soon,"" he added.A fifth train set for the Yellow Line is expected to be dispatched from Titagarh Rail Systems, West Bengal, by mid-September. However, supply delays of bogies from China will affect the manufacturing timeline for subsequent train sets.Despite demands to have the bogies airdropped for faster delivery, officials confirmed it was not feasible due to logistical constraints.The bogies for the sixth train set are scheduled to ship from China on Sept 14, with an estimated arrival in Kolkata after three weeks.""Delay in supply of bogies will impact delivery of sixth train by at least three weeks. Production of the seventh train set will also be impacted,"" the official said, adding: ""The line requires at least eight trains to achieve a 10-minute frequency.""","BMRCL had started operations on the Yellow Line with just three rakes on August 11.

NEW DELHI: Delhi-NCR is set for a major connectivity boost, with two projects likely to be inaugurated around the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sept 17.The 82km Namo Bharat RRTS corridor (Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut) and the 12.3km Majlis Park-Maujpur metro corridor (Pink Line extension) are both expected to open. The metro extension will complete a full circle of the Pink Line, creating one of the longest continuous corridors in Delhi Metro Rail Corporation's network.Of the total 82km Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut corridor, a 55km section across 11 stations, from New Ashok Nagar to Meerut South, is currently operational. Trial runs on the remaining section were completed last month. Although the current frequency of Namo Bharat trains is 15 minutes, it will reduce to 10 minutes after the entire corridor becomes operational.""It will take 58 minutes from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to reach Modipuram in Meerut. Our entire corridor is ready and will become operational soon. The Namo Bharat trains currently go till Meerut South station, located on the border. However, Modipuram is situated in the city and will provide better connectivity,"" said an official of National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), which is executing the project.Of the three stations in Delhi, Anand Vihar and New Ashok Nagar are currently operational.The third station, Sarai Kale Khan, will become a major transport hub due to the presence of the metro station (Pink Line), Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station, Veer Haqeeqat Rai ISBT and city bus services.Similarly, Majlis Park–Maujpur, the first corridor of DMRC's Phase IV expansion, is likely to become operational this month. Currently, the Pink Line (Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar) is the longest in DMRC's network, with a total length of over 59.2km and 38 stations. With the addition of a new corridor with eight stations, it will be able to form the full ring.The two highlights of this corridor — the bridge over the Yamuna and the double-decker section — are also ready. Delhi's first 1.4km-long double-decker viaduct between Bhajanpura and Yamuna Vihar on this corridor will transform the landscape of northeast Delhi. It will have the metro move on the upper deck and vehicles on the lower deck.TOI earlier reported that Delhi Metro will soon cross the Yamuna for the fifth time as the new bridge connecting Soorghat and Sonia Vihar stations on the Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor is ready. It is one of the 25 bridges in the 22km stretch of the Yamuna from Wazirabad barrage to Okhla barrage.None of the eight stations in the Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor — Burari, Jharoda Majra, Jagatpur Village, Soorghat, Sonia Vihar, Khajuri Khas, Bhajanpura and Yamuna Vihar — will be underground.As part of the Phase IV expansion, the construction of three priority corridors is underway: RK Ashram Marg-Janakpuri West (extension of the Magenta Line), Aerocity-Tughlaqabad (new Golden Line), and Majlis Park-Maujpur.However, three more new corridors were approved last year under Phase IV expansion: Lajpat Nagar to Saket G Block (extension of Golden Line), Inderlok to Indraprastha (extension of Green Line), and Rithala-Narela-Kundli (extension of Red Line). In total, DMRC is constructing about 112km of new metro lines as part of its Phase IV expansion across the national capital.Phase IV's first-ever stretch, from Janakpuri West to Krishna Park Extension on Janakpuri West-RK Ashram, was opened to passenger services on Jan 5 this year.","The 82km Namo Bharat RRTS corridor (Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut) and 12.3km Majlis Park-Maujpur metro corridor (Pink Line extension) are both expected to open.

Urvashi Claims ₹70 Lakh Jewellery Stolen at London Gatwick, Claims No Support





MUMBAI: Oil bottles and coconuts—items that are confiscated during the airport security check have, in a twist of fate, ended up becoming ‘dangerous goods' for over 15 senior officials of Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) as they have lost their jobs for taking these goods for personal use, said aviation sources.Last month, the MIAL management allegedly forced over 15 middle management officials to resign for having pocketed these security restricted articles (SRA).These goods were marked for disposal.SRA items are objects such as knives, batteries, toys, cello tape, chilli, lighters, e-cigarettes, coconuts, oil, and so on, which are banned in the passenger cabin and hence confiscated from flyers by the CISF during pre-departure security check.The resignations happened last month, from Aug 1, after MIAL's HR department confronted these officials with CCTV footage taken in the previous months. The footage showed these officials taking these SRA items for personal use. Some of the officials TOI spoke to claimed were told to either submit a resignation right away or face termination.MIAL did not respond to a query sent by TOI.The CISF sends the confiscated items to the MIAL terminal operations department.At the end of each 12-hour shift a register entry is made of the confiscated SRA goods.""The items are bound for the garbage bin or are boxed and collected by NGO Rescue Foundation. We assumed taking an SRA item wouldn't be a major violation which calls for termination. For years now, none of the bosses bothered with the confiscated coconuts, oil bottles. It was more of a nuisance,"" said one of the officials who was made to resign. He added the officials who lost their jobs have been on the rolls of MIAL for over 1 to 2 decades and hold posts such as senior duty terminal officers, duty terminal manager, deputy manager and senior executive, among others. ""Our grievance is that we were kicked out without as much as a warning for a first-time offence,"" the official added.Advocate Ashok Shetty said, ""The punishment should be commensurate with the gravity of the misconduct and the length of service put in by the employee concerned. The Supreme Court of India emphasises due process and a fair hearing before terminating an employee."" He added that 15 people being forced to resign amounts to illegal termination without holding an inquiry.Mumbai airport handles about 1.5 lakh passengers a day. Despite placards displaying pictures of restricted items, passengers pack in these items. For instance: An entry made in May during a day shift duty had items such as e-cigarettes (2), match box (25), coconut (50), cells (10), tools (2), cutter (08), talcum powder (20), scissors (12), knife (9) and screwdriver (14).Passengers apparently pack in all sorts of restricted items. Some days the SRA confiscated items list stretches to over two dozen items—spanners, masking tape, toy gun, rope, candle, plier, spices, luggage chain, pepper spray, big umbrella, big bat, copra and chilli powder.","Over 15 senior officials of Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) have lost their jobs for taking these goods for personal use.

"Mira Road Power Bill: Power bill down to Rs 18,000 a month from Rs 52,000: Why Mira Road society is first in Asia to be awarded certificate for green retrofitting",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/power-bill-down-to-rs-18000-a-month-from-rs-52000-why-mira-road-society-is-first-in-asia-to-be-awarded-certificate-for-green-retrofitting/articleshow/123770339.cms,"



Rahim Karovalia halts briefly between the two floors of a building in Mira Road to demonstrate the small wonder above us: A motion-sensor dimmable tubelight. As we approach it, its pale glow intensifies and lights up the landing. Karovalia's face lights up too as he motions to it, for this seemingly unremarkable electrical fixture has helped reduce the monthly electricity bill of his housing society by 65%.""Our electricity bill, which was previously around Rs 52,000, is now Rs 18,000,"" says Karovalia, 52, a managing committee member of Nav Yuwan Housing Society, a complex of 280 flats in Sector 4 of Mira Road (East), comprising of 1RK (400 sq ft) and 1 BHKs (580 sq ft) apartments.In Oct last year, a range of energy- and water-saving measures were implemented in this community. These included the installation of 150 motion-sensor lights in the buildings' corridors, lift lobbies and staircases; 14 high-efficiency floodlights mounted in the parking bay; a 44-kWp solar photovoltaic system set up on the terraces to power these upgrades; and a kitchen garden to promote urban greening. A composting unit is in the pipeline to feed the garden and support waste management.Nav Yuwan's home improvement solutions are part of a pilot designed and implemented by the nonprofit Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH), which aims to demonstrate that existing buildings can significantly reduce energy and water use, as well as emissions, through green retrofitting. This process involves upgrading or modifying buildings to improve sustainability and reduce their environmental footprint.At Nav Yuwan, the impact has been significant—an assessment reported 41% savings in energy, 35% in water, 59% in material efficiency, and a reduction in operational CO₂ emissions of 232.78 tCO₂/year. These achievements have earned the society a badge of honour, making it the first in Asia to receive the EDGE Advanced green building certification (in March this year) for meeting global benchmarks in emissions reduction and energy efficiency. Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies, or EDGE, is an international green building certification system developed by the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group.""We are very proud of the certification,"" says Karovalia, ""It demonstrates our efforts at sustainability to residents, vendors and the municipal corporation. It will, no doubt, also increase the value of our flats.""Beyond its immediate benefits to residents, the certification is significant because it positions the housing society as a successful model for green retrofitting. Nav Yuwan is not a newly-built development based on sustainable principles, but a 30-year-old housing complex retrofitted with modern materials and technologies to enhance its sustainability. The project's demonstrated efficiencies prove that older buildings can be upgraded to reduce climate-harming emissions—without the need for demolition or new construction—thereby positioning retrofitting as an effective climate solution. A study by the US-based nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) found that retrofitting an existing building produces 50–70% less carbon emissions than constructing a new one from the ground up.""Green retrofits improve thermal comfort, lower energy demand, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and extend the life of existing buildings,"" says Prerana Langa, CEO of AKAH, India. ""The Nav Yuwan pilot is a proof-of-concept for Climate Action Plan interventions on energy and water efficiency in residential sector and institutional buildings. It shows how practical, low-cost interventions can deliver meaningful measurable outcomes and improve resilience, without the need for new construction. ""The Nav Yuwan model aligns seamlessly with the Mira Bhayandar Climate Action Plan (MB CAP) 2024-2050—a joint initiative by the Mira Bhayandar Municipal Corporation and AKAH, launched in Jan this year—which targets a 36% reduction in emissions by 2047 through a focus on heat resilience and low-carbon housing. In 2023, Mira Bhayandar's residential sector accounted for 62% of the city's electricity consumption and 40.5% of its energy sector emissions.Nav Yuwan's retrofit has, therefore, prioritised energy-saving measures. These have not only been implemented in common areas, but in homes too. Each of the 280 flats at Nav Yuwan has been equipped with brushless DC (BLDC) fans that consume less than half the power of older models and generate lower electricity bills. ""We did not realise that small changes can have such big impacts,"" says Parvin Jasani, 64, whose monthly electricity bill has reduced from Rs 1,800 to Rs 1,000. ""We are now able to save more money."" Her husband, Bahadur, 63, notes that most people don't view their households as contributors to climate change—and as a result, don't know what changes to make to reduce their impact. ""Awareness of what people can do at the household level needs to be built,"" he says.AKAH built this understanding systematically through awareness and capacity-building programmes that combined technical guidance—such as the benefits of energy-efficient appliances—with behaviour change tips, like choosing bucket baths over showers and using air conditioners more efficiently. ""We always believed that the longer you use an appliance the more cost-effective it is. We did not realise that an old, energy-draining appliance can actually be more costly in the long run. Neither were we aware of the benefits of high-starred appliances,"" says Anisha Maknojiya, 48. This is why retrofits go hand-in-hand with awareness building.Word about the retrofit and its payoff has spread to other housing societies and several are keen to replicate the model, which costs Nav Yuwan Rs 17,500 per household unit. AKAH itself has retrofitted three municipal schools in Mira Bhayandar..Langa believes the model is easily scalable ""through policy inclusion in city CAPs, financing via CSR and municipal budgets, SHG/community funds for operation and maintenance, and bulk procurement to reduce costs.""""By linking retrofits to routine maintenance cycles, municipal budgets, and commercial investment returns, the model shifts from one-off projects to mainstream adoption,"" she says, ""This makes structural scale-up viable across Mira Bhayandar and replicable in other cities.""","Nav Yuwan Housing Society is the first in Asia to receive the EDGE Advanced green building certification for meeting global benchmarks in emissions reduction and energy efficiency.

A lesson learned early

The “Fortress Balance Sheet” strategy



High liquidity

Conservative capital levels

Robust reserves

A blueprint for long-term success



JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has revealed his half-century of investment experience into a simple but powerful mantra: “Don’t blow up.” Speaking on an episode of Acquired Podcast, Dimon shared how this investment philosophy has helped him. Dimon reveals that born from his first stock purchase at age 14 — has shaped not only his personal approach to investing but also the risk culture at one of the world’s largest banks.Dimon’s first foray into the stock market came in 1972, which was guided by his father. After two years, the market crashed by 45%, giving the teenage investor a harsh but formative lesson in volatility. “Don’t blow up,” Dimon said, referring to the importance of avoiding catastrophic losses, especially during periods of market euphoria.This early experience helped Dimon in laying a strong foundation for a career which is defined by caution, discipline and resilience. He mentioned that these qualities have helped JPMorgan and Chase in navigating through financial crisis and emerge as a global banking leader.Dimon’s investment mantra is more than just personal wisdom— it’s an institutional policy. Under his leadership, JPMorgan has has embraced a “fortress balance sheet” strategy, prioritizing:Dimon’s disciplined and calculative approach has helped the bank in standing strong during economic downturns such as COVID-19 pandemic, the financial crisis of 2008. The strategy helped the bank in maintaining stability without comprising on the reputation.Dimon’s investment policy highlights the importance of risk management in both personal investing and corporate finance. While many people run behind short-term gains, Dimon advocates for a disciplined strategy that avoids overexposure and protects against worst-case scenarios. “It’s not about avoiding risk entirely,” Dimon explained. “It’s about managing it intelligently so you can survive and thrive over time.”","Dimon’s first foray into the stock market came in 1972, which was guided by his father.

However, from past experience the market should judge President Trump by his actions and not words. Investors should understand that the major challenge that the market is facing now is the high valuations, particularly in the broader market, which will constrain any potential rally. India is hugely underperforming other markets now.”“For instance, while Hang Seng and Kospi delivered 51 % and 31% returns during the last one year, Nifty delivered -0.69 % return: huge underperformance.Massive sustained selling by FIIs triggered by high Indian valuations is the principal reason for this underperformance. FIIs who sold in India and moved money to other markets have gained. Therefore, they might do it again. A change in this trend will happen when indications of a recovery in earnings emerge.

Picture stepping into an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle – an eVTOL – that whisks you through the air and gets you to your destination without any hassle. The software to make this tech a reality is being coded, tested, and refined today by engineers in India. These battery-powered aircraft, designed to take off and land vertically like helicopters but operate with the efficiency of aeroplanes, represent perhaps the most ambitious leap in urban mobility since the automobile.Essential parts of this aerial revolution are being developed out of Alten India . Alten is a French multinational company that specialises in providing everything from engineering and IT services, to consulting, R&D, and digital transformation services to various industries, including automotive, aerospace, energy, and life sciences. Its India ops, which began with just 80 people in 2008, is now 9,000 strong.“The eVTOL industry or the sustainable flying industry has seen a lot of investments, ups and downs in Europe,” says Balaji Viswanathan, CEO of Alten India. “Some of the big companies which were founded to do eVTOLs have gone bankrupt because there was not enough funding. But the US is doing reasonably well.” Despite these market fluctuations, Viswanathan remains bullish about the technology’s potential. “We are proud to say that we are working with almost all the eVTOL companies,” he notes.Alten India’s work represents a fascinating convergence of automotive and aerospace technologies. “There is a lot of overlap between the automotive industry, the rail and transport industry, and the aviation industry,” Viswanathan observes. “Earlier, everybody used to say if you are from aviation, you are from aviation. But now, the learning between industries to make sure that the best practices are captured drives more efficiency.”From their laboratories in Bengaluru and Aurangabad, Alten’s engineers are tackling some of the most complex challenges in autonomous flight. Their primary focus is on sustainability and navigation systems, and building crash detection units. “In non-human operated eVTOLs, a big challenge is to make sure that data is not compromised if a crash occurs. How do you make sure that the data is stored similar to how black boxes operate in traditional aircraft? We do that work here.”While the eVTOL work grabs the imagination, automotive engineering remains the mainstay for Alten India. “About 45% of our business in India comes from automotive, and around 30% from aerospace and avionics,” says Viswanathan. Industrial manufacturing covers most of the rest – everything from plastic machines and paper machines, to heavy engineering machines and cutting tools.Alten India’s journey in cars mirrors the sector’s software-first turn. “Initially, ADAS was primarily around labelling and annotation – identifying objects and defining what those objects are,” he says. “Now we are defining what to do when you face that object and what you should tell the driver.” Over 15 years, the company has worked with almost all the European OEMs – Renault, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Volvo – taking best practices from each, building test benches in its labs and delivering to strict standards.The India team’s navigation pedigree shows up in unusual theatres as well. “We are working with the Navy on GPS positioning, object detection, identifying which is dangerous, which is not,” Viswanathan says. “You won’t find so much traffic in the sea, but you still find a lot of objects floating around.” He lists minesweepers, seabed obstacles, even plant matter. “Based on sonic waves, you decide, do you stop, turn, or destroy? Each one needs a different response,” he says.","EVTOLs are battery-powered aircraft designed to take off and land vertically like helicopters but operate with the efficiency of aeroplanes. The software to make this tech a reality is being coded, tested, and refined today by engineers in India.Essential parts of this aerial revolution are being developed out of Alten India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123798987,imgsize-653793,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

SILIGURI/LUCKNOW/MOTIHARI: Violent anti-govt protests in Nepal set off a scramble in India Tuesday to insulate its eastern and northern boundaries from the spiralling storm, with trade routes already blocked and long queues of stranded goods vehicles forming along border towns from north Bengal and Bihar to Uttar Pradesh.The Kakarvitta-Panitanki crossing, 34 km from Bengal's Siliguri, felt the heat of the unrest as protesters torched tyres, blocked roads and set fire to a customs office. About 500 trucks cross over to Nepal from the gate each day, carrying goods ranging from staples to construction materials.As the youth-led agitation escalated, 200-odd cargo-laden vehicles lined up on this side of the border for what transporters fear could be a long wait for the crisis to dissipate. Many Nepal nationals entered India seeking supplies, mostly food, after shops on either side of the border gates were forced to close.Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee urged residents in districts bordering Nepal to ""stay away from trouble and maintain peace"", mentioning that the Union govt hadn't ordered border closures yet. ""If Nepal stays well, India stays well, too,"" she said, stressing that the violence in Kathmandu and other parts of that country was ""an internal matter"".Similar disruptions affected the India-Nepal border at Raxaul where about 50 tourists cancelled plans to cross over. The bustling gateway fell quiet as a curfew-like atmosphere descended on adjacent Birgunj.East Champaran SP Swarn Prabhat said preventive measures were taken to maintain peace, with SSB personnel instructed to ""discourage"" tourist entry due to ""curfew conditions"".UP ramped up security across seven border districts - Pilibhit, Lakhimpur Kheri, Bahraich, Shravasti, Balrampur, Siddharthnagar and Maharajganj. DGP Rajeev Krishna said the strategy entailed round-the-clock patrolling and strict entry-point checks, with 73 checkpoints placed on heightened alert.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Reports: Karisma Kapoor Seeks Stake In Sunjay Kapur’s ₹30,000 Crore Empire

'Mysterious death'





NEW DELHI: Two children of Bollywood actor Karisma Kapoor have moved the Delhi high court seeking a share in the Rs 30,000 crore estate of their late father, Sunjay Kapur.The petition, scheduled for hearing on 10 September, challenges the validity of Kapur’s will. According to the plaint, neither their father nor their stepmother, Priya Kapur, ever informed them about the existence of the will.The children allege that Priya Kapur’s conduct “without a doubt” suggests that the will may have been fabricated.The court is expected to hear the matter and decide on the next steps regarding the dispute over the estate.The plaintiffs argue that until their father's sudden demise on June 12, 2025 while playing polo in Windsor, UK, they shared a close relationship with him, including frequent travels, holidays and regular involvement in his business and personal milestones.According to ANI, the plaintiffs in the case have accused Priya Kapur of initially denying the existence of any will and asserting that all of Sunjay Kapur's assets were held under the RK Family Trust.However, they claim she later presented a document dated March 21, 2025, which she described as a will, prompting suspicions of forgery and manipulation.The legal dispute involves several parties. The plaintiffs are the daughter and minor son of Karisma Kapoor and Sunjay Kapur, represented in court through their mother.The first and second defendants are Priya Kapur, Sunjay's widow and her minor son, both of whom reside at the family's farmhouse in Rajokri.The third defendant is Sunjay Kapur's mother, also living at the same residence.The fourth defendant is a woman who has identified herself as the executor of the contested will, news agency ANI reported.According to the children, their late father had repeatedly assured them of their financial security and future well-being.They claim he had initiated business ventures in their names, acquired assets both personally and through corporate entities and named them as beneficiaries of the family trust.In August, Rani Kapur, Sunjay’s mother and former chairperson of Sona Comstar, has formally requested UK authorities to investigate the “unexplained circumstances” surrounding her son’s death.ANI sources confirmed that she filed an official criminal complaint with British police, stressing the urgency of the probe.Rani Kapur claims to possess “credible and concerning evidence” suggesting her son’s death may not have been accidental or natural, raising the possibility of foul play, including murder, abetment, conspiracy, fraud and forgery.US authorities are reportedly monitoring the case closely, as Sunjay Kapur held US citizenship.In an emotional video statement, her first since her son’s death, Rani Kapur said, “I still don’t know what happened to my son. I’m old now. I need closure before I go.”","Two children of Bollywood actor Karisma Kapoor have moved the Delhi high court seeking a share in the Rs 30,000 crore estate of their late father, Sunjay Kapur.

From cost arbitrage to AI-led innovation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/times-techies/from-cost-arbitrage-to-ai-led-innovation/articleshow/123798701.cms,"NEW ERA: Sailaja Josyula, global head of GCC service line, Cognizant, in a fireside chat with Sangeeta Gupta, senior VP, Nasscom

Traditionally, GCCs were built around functions like finance, HR, or application development – largely driven by costarbitrage considerations. “Today, the focus is on value creation: how can a GCC enable enterprisewide agentification, accelerate product innovation, or even pioneer proprietary models,” Sailaja Josyula, senior VP and global head of GCC service line at Cognizant, said in a tete-atete with Sangeeta Gupta, senior VP and chief strategy officer at Nasscom.Gupta also noted this shift and said every disruption – from geopolitical volatility to environmental challenges – presents an opportunity. “The question is whether GCCs seize that opportunity to create revenue streams and IP, not just efficiency. Will this lead to AIfirst GCCs?” she asked.AI is clearly a force redefining industry. Josyula cautioned that many organisations are rushing into AI execution without a clear strategic foundation. “Building an AI-first GCC requires a thoughtful roadmap, the right talent, and a workplace design that fosters innovation and enables longterm success.”AI, she said, has to be trained, contextualised and embedded into the workflow. “That requires deliberate design across three dimensions: talent, work, and workplace. So, create the collaboration spaces, sandbox environments, invest in people, and give them the right tools to embrace AI,” she said.On future skills, Josyula said quality assurance for AI will be a critical requirement. “Narrow or domain-specific models may prove more successful than large general-purpose models. Building expertise in these areas will define the next wave of GCC talent.”","Traditionally, GCCs were built around functions like finance, HR, or application development – largely driven by costarbitrage considerations. “Today, the focus is on value creation: how can a GCC enable enterprisewide agentification, accelerate product innovation, or even pioneer proprietary models?” Sailaja Josyula, senior VP and global head of GCC service line at Cognizant, said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123798715,imgsize-1124456,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

NEW DELHI: While tracking an Indian SIM card being used in Bahawalpur in Pakistan, Delhi Police's special cell has stumbled upon an espionage module. It has arrested a 43-year-old Nepal national who was allegedly engaged in anti-India activities at the behest of Pakistan's ISI.The suspect, Prabhat Kumar Chaurasiya, came on the police's radar after he was found procuring and supplying SIM cards to ISI operatives. ""Using his Aadhaar card registered at Latur, Maharashtra, Chaurasiya procured 16 SIM cards from Bihar and Maharashtra. After activation, these were smuggled to Kathmandu, Nepal through conduits and were subsequently handed over to ISI handlers,"" additional commissioner Pramod Singh Kushwaha said.Eleven of these SIMs were being operated on WhatsApp from Lahore, Bahawalpur, and other parts of Pakistan to establish contact with Indian Army personnel and to pursue sensitive espionage objectives, the officer added.The Jaish headquarters destroyed in Operation Sindoor was located in Bahawalpur.The role of a prominent businessman from Nepal has come to fore as Chaurasiya's handler, sources said. The businessman is an ISI conduit who was handling Chaurasiya and several other spies and is supposedly a key figure in the ongoing Gen-Z-led unrest in that country, they added.The investigation has revealed that Chaurasiya was lured by ISI handlers in 2024 through a Nepalese intermediary with promises of a US visa and opportunities in journalism abroad. In return, he was tasked with supplying SIM cards and collecting information related to DRDO and Army establishments.During the arrest, the police recovered digital devices containing incriminating material and multiple SIM card envelopes. Chaurasiya, who had previously worked as a medical representative and set up his own firm in Kathmandu, claimed that he was desperate to go abroad and agreed to work with ISI operatives after his business collapsed due to heavy financial losses.The operation was conducted by a team comprising ACP Kailash Bisht and inspectors Rahul Kumar and Vineet Tewatia. ""On the basis of inputs received from sources regarding misuse of Indian mobile numbers in Pakistan, a probe was initiated,"" said a senior cop.Chaurasiya, a resident of Birgunj in Nepal, was found to be living in Vijay Block, Laxmi Nagar. He was apprehended a few days ago and a case was registered under Sections 61 (2)/152 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Investigation is underway to identify Chaurasiya's accomplices, trace the courier network and apprehend the foreign handlers involved. His background is also being probed. Digital devices containing incriminating material and multiple SIM cards envelopes have been seized and are being analysed.Born in 1982, Chaurasiya completed his matriculation in Nepal, pursued intermediate studies in Motihari, Bihar and later obtained a BSc degree and a diploma in computer hardware and networking.

Talent conundrum

When we think of tech and GCCs (global capability centres), we tend to think of Bengaluru, Hyderabad, maybe Pune. But from the earliest days of GCCs (then referred to as captive centres), Delhi-NCR has perhaps been second to Bengaluru, a fact crowded out by the region’s influencers’ focus on govt, politics and macroeconomics. The region hosted pioneering GCCs like those of American Express and GE (through Genpact) in the 1990s, and today is home to 15-18% of the over 1,700 GCCs in India, many of which have scaled to become key centres for global companies, working on critical services, platforms and products.Last week, we brought together four leaders, from GCCs of US, European and Asian companies, at the Nasscom Times Techies GCC 2030 And Beyond conference in Gurgaon – the second in our multi-city series – to discuss how India is writing the new operating system for global enterprises. And we started by asking them how GCCs build leadership in these centres so the parent companies entrust to them not just execution, but also strategy.CV Raman, chief technology officer (CTO) in Maruti Suzuki India , said initially, technology leadership for the company came from Japan, but management, marketing, sales, supply chain, and quality were built in India. But slowly, he said, the Japanese realised Indian engineers could take responsibility and deliver. “By giving opportunities, confidence was built. Today, when we start talking about new technology, we are at the same level as Japan,” he said. The Maruti Suzuki Brezza was conceptualised, designed, developed, validated, and tested solely by the R&D team in India, and later exported. The Fronx brand, designed and developed here, is now even exported to Japan.For Pravin Goel, MD & AI lead for India at US investment management company BlackRock, the leadership story is one of patience and persistence. Goel said, “The presentations 12-13 years ago would say: we’ll take the work that no one else does. Over time things changed – slowly and then quickly. Slowly earning the right to do more, and as capability was demonstrated, more work came, quickly.”What began as routine tasks, looking at financial statements, answering queries and so on, evolved into full-fledged ownership of business units. “The predictability of execution, combined with learnability, built our brand,” Goel said. “And we have a young workforce. They are really keen to get out of the mundane work coming to us, automate it and look for the next.”If India’s advantage is agility, it must also navigate cultural differences. Anku Jain, MD for India at semiconductor company MediaTek, notes that in Taiwan or Korea, people follow the leader without question, but in India, everyone has an opinion. “To manage a team, you must build consensus. Trust is key to building leadership. And also adapt to the DNA of the head office.” MediaTek India, he said, has been able to build that DNA, and some of the long-serving employees are in leadership roles now.Today, MediaTek in India, he said, is designing leadingedge nodes – 3 nanometer chips in Bengaluru and Noida. “Earlier, it was legacy work like 4G. Now we’re working on 5G and even 6G. And the head-office feels more can be done in India.”Even as the leadership matrix is scaling up, wider ecosystems – supplier networks, startups, and academic partnerships – are also taking shape around the GCCs. Raman pointed to Maruti Suzuki’s journey: “Lot of the auto value comes from system suppliers – Bosch, Continental, Visteon and the likes. They must co-develop with OEMs in real time. The same is true of toolmakers and machine suppliers. Over the last 15-20 years, we’ve built this ecosystem. Now, it’s about scaling it and developing new technologies.”For MediaTek, the ecosystem means both talent and manufacturing. “20% of global chip design talent is in India. We also see traction in electronics manufacturing with players like Dixon Technologies and VVDN Technologies. If chip design, manufacturing, and assembly all happen here, it’ll be a big advantage. The foundation is being laid now,” said Jain.Praveen Kumar, CEO of BGSC ( Barclays Global Service Centre ) India, illustrated how ecosystems work across industries. “When we launched a point-of-sale financing solution for Amazon in Germany, the underlying technology was developed in Pune and Bengaluru. That’s cross-border collaboration in action,” said Kumar. Barclays has also partnered with startups in analytics and sustainability. Multiple tasks from KYC to fraud detection to payments converge in India.As the ecosystem matures, talent remains both India’s strongest card and its biggest vulnerability. Companies are here for talent, but note that new capabilities need to be developed.“There’s fantastic talent,” said Barclays’ Kumar. “But domainaligned talent is not easily available. To address this we have partnered with academic institutions to run electives in areas like cybersecurity,” he said.MediaTek’s Jain said that while India has great chip design talent, for semiconductor manufacturing – foundry, packaging – talent is a big problem.Maruti’s Raman noted that colleges still teach carburetor technology when the world has moved to EVs (electric vehicles) and ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems).Blackrock’s Goel noted that parents chase placements, not innovation, and professors teach the same thing for over 20 years.“If you are not refreshing your syllabus every quarter, you are outdated. We need to reimagine education.”","Delhi-NCR is home to 15-18% of the over 1,700 GCCs in India.
