Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection.

Mami Mizutori

tells

Pradeep Thakur

Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people. Excerpts from the interview:

The

estimates 150 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty in 2021 due to Covid-19. How can India minimise the impact?

The US and some other countries reserved enough shots for their citizens. Should India have done the same?

How much success has the UN’s Covax programme achieved?

The second wave of Covid-19 has caused more deaths in India. Where did it go wrong?

Your idea of a ‘global response for future pandemics’ and vaccine distribution?

With Covid disruptions, can countries like India meet the UN’s

target?

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the people and government of India on the tragic loss of life that is taking place across the country.All major disasters which affect low- and middle-income countries result in economic losses on a scale which has a damaging effect on their ability to eradicate poverty and meet other basic needs, including health services and access to education. In the case of Covid-19, we have seen how it has pushed millions into extreme poverty globally, and has contributed to rising levels of hunger in many parts of the world where the informal economy that poor people depend on has been decimated. For all member states, the eradication of poverty cannot be achieved without reducing disaster risk and improved prevention as nothing undermines development like disasters.Much of the world looks to India for vaccine supply but the pharmaceutical supply chain is very complex and specialised to a degree that serving a population the size of India’s was always going to be a gargantuan task. The numbers already vaccinated in India are enormous but manufacturing enough doses to reach over one billion people will take time.The Covax facility portfolio, administered by Gavi, currently consists of agreements related to eight vaccines, including those developed with the Serum Institute of India . Coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO, Covax is making steady progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high risk and vulnerable people, as well as frontline healthcare workers.Covid-19 demonstrates the systemic nature of disaster risk, how a biological hazard can ravage all areas of life starting from public health to all socio-economic aspects of our societies. Unfortunately, many countries, including India, are learning the hard way that prevention requires more patience than previously thought and, in the case of biological hazards, a longer game plan. WHO has warned that when there are mass gatherings, more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low, this can create a perfect storm for the virus to spread in any country. India has done an admirable job in harnessing technology and communication to ensure effective early warning leads to early action in the case of cyclones. The challenge for the government now is to communicate effectively on the continued need for face masks, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings while at the same time rolling out an effective vaccination programme.If the global level of preparedness for this pandemic had matched the warnings, much of the impact could have been reduced. An adequate level of pandemic preparedness would have cost billions instead of the trillions that it is now costing. The loss of life and the economic disruption could have been significantly reduced if we had been adequately prepared from the moment biological hazards were included in the Sendai Framework in 2015. Given the transboundary nature of biological hazards it is obvious that a global response plan is required for future pandemics. A patchwork response is not working for Covid-19, and it will not work against any newly emerging diseases and viruses in the future. It is not acceptable that developing countries should have to wait so long for Covid vaccines. This inequality and lack of solidarity to access affordable vaccines only fuels the spread of the virus, allows the emergence of new variants and prolongs the pandemic. None of us is safe until we are all safe.It is clear that the death toll and economic loss from Covid-19 means that Sendai Framework targets on reducing mortality, numbers of disaster affected people and economic losses has suffered a great setback. However, we are still making significant progress on other targets. Asia and the Pacific are not on track to achieve any of the SDGs.","Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people.

Goa may relax JEE criteria for engineering seats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goa-may-relax-jee-criteria-for-engineering-seats/articleshow/111306792.cms,"'Admission to IT engg in 1st round'

PANAJI: On Wednesday, the first round of admissions to engineering degree programme seats in the five engineering colleges in Goa ended. Of the over 1,500 seats in the five colleges, around 400 were left vacant at the end of the first round. Following this, the directorate of technical education ( DTE ) is set to allow students, who had not appeared for the JEE, to apply for the vacant seats .A file with the proposal will be moved for the state's approval soon, sources said.

Eligibility criteria set by the AICTE is different like PCM score. So, if students meet the eligibility criteria, there is no harm in allowing them to apply for the vacant seats.

80% of public health facilities are substandard: Govt survey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/80-of-public-health-facilities-are-substandard-govt-survey/articleshow/111350919.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nearly 80% of public health facilities in India do not meet the minimum essential standards for infrastructure, manpower, equipment and other benchmarks set by govt.This shocking detail has emerged from a self-assessment exercise carried out by govt in which public health facilities from states and UTs covered under the National Health Mission (NHM) were asked to fill in details, such as the number of doctors, nurses or basic medical equipment they have.There are more than two lakh public healthcare facilities, including district hospitals, sub-district hospitals, community health centres, primary health centers, and Ayushman Arogya Mandir (erstwhile sub health centres) that are covered under NHM - a flagship scheme of govt. Of them, data shared by govt on the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) dashboard shows, 40,451 filled in key statistics about their respective facilities in the Open Data Kit - a digital tool - developed by the health ministry .When the scoring was done based on the statistics shared, it was revealed that only 8,089, approximately 20% of the facilities, scored 80% or higher which is needed to qualify as IPHS compliant . Simply put, these facilities had the required infrastructure, human resources, drugs, diagnostics and equipment available to provide essential services as desired.Total 17,190 (42%) of the facilities that participated in the self-assessment exercise scored less than 50% while the rest, 15,172 facilities, scored anywhere between 50 to 80%. All these details have been put out in public domain on the IPHS dashboard. A senior health ministry official said the self-assessment and its real time monitoring has been started to ensure that the health facilities maintain the required standards of infrastructure, equipment, and human resources, leading to better health outcomes and fostering a healthier and more equitable society.The Centre, an official said, is aiming to make 70,000 health institutions IPHS compliant within the first 100 days of the new govt's formation. ""The aim of this self-assessment exercise is to identify the gaps and push the states/UTs to fill them with full support from the Centre so that quality of services provided to the public improves,"" a senior health ministry official said. She added that self-assessment is the first step and the Centre also plans to carry out surprise inspections to verify the claims being made by health facilities against the benchmarks set by IPHS.While the IPHS assesses health facilities for basic services, National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) is another higher level of evaluation which rates them on the basis of best practices followed such as availability of essential medicines, equipment, waste management, infection control practices, support services and patient's rights. The official said that while NQAS assessment for district hospitals, sub-district hospitals, community health centres and primary health centers will continue to be carried out physically, they have introduced a new provision of virtual assessment for the Ayushman Arogya Mandir that constitute the highest number of public health facilities under NHM.The Centre bears 60% of the expenditure in a public health facilities under the NHM while the rest of the expenditure is borne by the state.","Nearly 80% of public health facilities in India do not meet minimum essential standards for infrastructure, manpower, equipment and other benchmarks set by govt.

""This extends even to the depiction of our Constitutional provisions and duly enacted laws of India. It has selectively picked incidents to advance a pre-conceived narrative as well,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.In some cases, he said, the very validity of laws and regulations are questioned by the report, as are the right of legislatures to enact them. The report also appears to challenge the integrity of certain legal judgments given by Indian courts, added the official.While there's little risk of US taking any action against India, like including it in its annual black list of countries violating religious freedom, Indian govt sees such reports and remarks as pinpricks not in consonance with the growing strategic partnership between the two democracies.According to Indian govt, the report has also targeted regulations that monitor misuse of financial flows into India.

Additionally, an access road will be constructed providing direct connectivity from the west end of Bandra station to Western Express Highway.The rehabilitation project had been stalled since 2002 and locals, along with Khan, had approached courts, seeking permission to renew their agreements under the new slum scheme that offered them more benefits.The developer has been paying monthly rents to the eligible families for transit accommodation after they vacated their shanties.Earlier, the slumdwellers had locked horns with the authorities over their rehabilitation after receiving multiple demolition notices from BMC to allow it to undertake road widening.The slumdwellers had signed the agreement with the builder in 2002, but over the last two decades, govt has changed the eligibility criteria . After the residents approached courts—the issue went till SC—the builder accepted the demand to execute a fresh agreement as per the new rules.","The vacant plot will be used to build several towers to rehabilitate 1,400 eligible slum families.

Unveiling Kerala's Unique Duryodhan Temple: A Taxpaying Tribute to Mahabharat's Arch Villain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/a-temple-for-mahabharats-arch-villain-now-a-taxpayer/articleshow/111325091.cms,"A village where Duryodhan's a benign

, is called 'grandpa'

Even in a land of temples, and more deities than even the most pious can name, a temple for the arch villain of India's greatest epic is unusual. But what really makes the Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala 's Kollam district a standout is an aspect of modernity - per govt records, the eldest Kaurav prince pays taxes.Local lore has it that the prince was tired and thirsty during his travels.Drinking water was scarce, but a woman of a so-called low caste offered him a drink of toddy. Duryodhan, who also famously elevated the supposedly low-born Karna to kingship, accepted happily, blessed the woman and her village, and gave them land. The temple for him was the village saying thank you. Ritual offerings here include a good measure of intoxicants.At the Peruviruthy Malanada temple, the daily offering of toddy to Duryodhan, who's not represented by an idol in the temple but by a polished mace, the Kaurav prince's weapon of choice. In Mahabharat , he's the man who hoots with delight as he orders Draupadi disrobed, the prince who plotted to steal the kingdom that rightfully belonged to the good guys - Pandavs. But in this village, he's a benign, protective deity. Villagers call him 'appoopa' (grandpa).That sharp departure from Mahabharat's narrative treatment of Duryodhan, the fact that there's no idol and the votive offering of toddy are similar to other non-Vedic practices in many southern temples. Villagers have a more interesting take on the toddy offering - a tipple keeps the deity in a mild and cheerful mood, they say.As for those taxes Duryodhan pays diligently, it will be wise to first point out that the tax is not on the temple's income - all temples are tax free in India. The levy is on the 15 acres of temple land at the Poruvazhy village surrounding the temple.""When the pattayam was issued for the temple, the land was registered in the deity's name. The thandaper (land deed) number and survey details show the land is owned by Duryodhan. Ever since taxes were introduced in Kerala, this land tax has been paid in Duryodhan's name,"" a local administrator said. Of the 15 acres of temple land, eight acres are paddy fields, the rest is forested land, said temple committee secretary Rajaneesh R.When in Puruvazhy, don't diss Duryodhan.","Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala's Kollam district is a standout.

However, it expressed its strong disapproval of the coaching centres jumping into the fray with students regarding the NEET-UG.The bench observed, ""We see the role played by the coaching centres as pied pipers.

No justification to charge toll if roads are in disrepair: Nitin Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justification-to-charge-toll-if-roads-are-in-disrepair-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/111267453.cms,"NEW DELHI: Echoing the sentiment of many highway commuters, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said there is no justification of highway agencies charging toll, if roads are not in good condition and people continue to face problems. He was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling, which will be rolled out across 5,000 km during this financial year.Known for not mincing his words, Gadkari said, “If you don’t provide good services, you should not charge toll...We are in a hurry to start tolling to collect user fees and protect our interest.When the condition of any road is not good I get numerous complaints and there are social media posts all over...You should collect the user fee where you provide the best quality road. If you collect toll on roads with potholes, mud, then there will be a backlash from people. We (political leaders) face people’s ire.”The minister said the field officers of NH agencies must be more sensitive towards the pain that people face waiting for long at toll plazas and there must be a mechanism for lodging grievances and their quick redressal.Though govt made the use of FASTag for paying toll on highways mandatory in 2021 for seamless travel through toll lanes and currently around 98% transactions are through these smart tags fixed on vehicles, there have been numerous reports of queues at plazas from across the country. In its bid to put an end to this, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on the roll out and expansion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based toll collection. This aims to remove toll gates from the NH network in the next few years.The highway authority proposes to roll this out in a phased manner, starting with only commercial vehicles and dedicating one lane on each side of toll plazas for them to pass without stopping. It’s mandatory for commercial vehicles to install vehicle tracker system (VTS), an on board unit, which is necessary for GNSS-based tolling.Govt plans to bring private vehicles under this tolling system at a subsequent phase.The road transport ministry has finalised a series of amendments in Central Motor Vehicle Rules and NH Fee Rules, which don’t need legislation, for roll out of the system. While vehicle owners will be incentivised to get a discount in toll charge for complying with their vehicles having OBUs for paying toll without stopping, there will be disincentives for those who don't opt for this.Gadkari said the system (GNSS)-based toll collection will add Rs 10,000 crore to govt’s toll revenue. “We need to put in place a transparent, qualitative and a leak proof system of GNSS-based toll collection in India to ensure no inconvenience to toll users,” he added. The GNSS-based toll collection is expected to enhance efficiency, bring down logistics cost and major relief for the highway users as they will have to pay only for the distance travelled.","Gadkari was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling.

can't be fined for taking

circuitous route

: HC

BENGALURU: In big relief for Bengaluru-based Centre for Wildlife Studies (CWS) founded by scientist K Ullas Karanth, Karnataka high court has quashed a series of orders issued by the ministry of home affairs that led to cancellation of the registration of the organisation.In a series of flip-flops, MHA slapped a suspension order on CWS under Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act on March 5,2021, extended it, and again cancelled it on September 4, 2023, following a show-cause notice on December 3, 2021.CWS challenged the same, contending the cancellation order doesn't bear any reason. It said personal hearing under Section 14(2) of FCRA Act was not given to Karanth, son of Jnanpith laureate K Shivaram Karanth. On the other hand, MHA argued there is no requirement to grant personal hearing before cancellation of certificate of registration under the Act .Justice M Nagaprasanna said Section 14(2) permits cancellation of registration, Section 14(3) would bar such an entity from registration for three years. ""Therefore, it cannot be said Section 14(2) is restricted only to hearing, and hearing would mean only issuance of a show-cause notice,'' the judge added.Bengaluru: In the absence of law , a merchant cannot be faulted for taking a circuitous route instead of a linear one in variance with what he/she has stated to the authorities in documents as long as the travel time and the destination remain the same, the high court said.""As the law now stands in Karnataka, a merchant or his convoy is free to choose the route for movement of goods from the point of origin to the destination. If he has specified a particular route in theconsignment documents , it would not come in the way of that route being altered, though the destination cannot be,"" the bench said.On December 2, 2021, officers intercepted a conveyance of M/s Transway India Transport, Bengaluru, at Bommasandra industrial area, about 20km from the state capital. The goods from Mumbai were to be delivered to several consignees in the city. However, the authorities slapped a tax liability of Rs 3,25423 coupled with a penalty of Rs 21,41,239 on the company under Section 129(3) of the GST Act-2017 for ""transportation and diversion of goods beyond the place of destination.""The company challenged the order, claiming that it had necessary permission to move towards Peenya industrial area but the driver took a wrong turn towards Bommasandra industrial area. On June 23, 2022, a single bench had quashed the levy of tax and penalty. The department appealed against the order. However, the division bench noted that the right to movement whether by foot, cart, boat, aircraft or on a horseback, is constitutionally guaranteed to the citizens as a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(d) and ordinarily avails to the merchants too when they carry goods for trade. ""It is open to a trader to take goods to the destination point in whichever route he opts, unless the law otherwise requires it, the destination point being intact. Such a right needs to be recognised as of necessity to trade or business,"" the bench noted.""What is required by law is the furnishing of consignment documents and specified particulars of the consignor, consignee, goods, route maps and destinations. When law does not require giving reasons for changing the route, whether the reason offered by the driver is true or false, pales into insignificance. However, this does not mean that a driver can lie with impunity, the motto Satyameva Jayate having been inscribed in our national emblem i.e., Ashoka Sthamba,"" the bench added.",Karnataka high court quashes a series of orders issued by the ministry of home affairs.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Family dynamics: How Melania-Ivanka relationship changed after Trump conviction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/family-dynamics-how-melania-ivanka-relationship-changed-after-trump-conviction/articleshow/111292947.cms,"In recent discussions, the dynamics between Melania Trump , her husband Donald Trump, and his daughter Ivanka Trump have come under renewed scrutiny, the relationship between Melania and Ivanka has seen some changes following Donald Trump's legal troubles, according to reports.A source close to the family noted that ""Melania and Ivanka are rumored to be getting along better since Donald Trump was convicted in New York."" This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years, a Newsweek report said.Melania Trump's former friend, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff , weighed in on the evolving dynamics within the Trump family. Wolkoff, who has previously published a tell-all book about her time with the former first lady, described some of the recent claims about Melania and Ivanka's relationship as ""ridiculous."" Wolkoff's comments suggest that the public may not have the full picture of the intricate relationships within the Trump family.This development comes as Donald Trump faces various legal challenges, which have undoubtedly impacted the family's interactions. The former president's conviction in New York has led to increased media attention on his personal life, including his relationships with Melania and Ivanka.Historically, there have been reports of tension between Melania and Ivanka. Ivanka, who served as a senior advisor during Donald Trump's presidency, often took on a prominent role, leading to speculation about her influence and relationship with her stepmother. However, the current situation appears to show a thawing of relations between the two women, perhaps brought on by the pressures of their shared circumstances.Melania Trump has largely remained out of the public eye since leaving the White House, making few public statements and maintaining a low profile. Ivanka, on the other hand, has also stepped back from the political spotlight but continues to be a figure of interest due to her high-profile role during her father's administration.As the Trump family navigates these legal and personal challenges, the evolving relationships within the family continue to be a topic of public fascination. The reported improvement in Melania and Ivanka's relationship adds a new layer to the complex narrative of the Trump family's public and private lives.","A source close to the family noted that ""Melania and Ivanka are rumored to be getting along better since Donald Trump was convicted in New York"" This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111292941,imgsize-10050,width-400,resizemode-4/111292941.jpg"

After the incident the plane continued safely to Baltimore, Southwest said.Several other incidents involving Southwest flights in recent months have raised concerns.Last week, the FAA said it was investigating a Southwest flight that descended to a low altitude of around 500 feet (152.4 m) about 9 miles (14.5 km) from the Oklahoma City airport.After the automated Minimum Safe Altitude Warning sounded, an air traffic controller alerted the flight crew of Southwest Airlines Flight 4069, which had departed from Las Vegas.Earlier this month, the FAA and NTSB said they were investigating a May 25 Southwest flight of a Boeing 737 MAX. The NTSB said the plane experienced a ""Dutch roll"" at 34,000 feet while en route from Phoenix, to Oakland, California. Such lateral asymmetric movements are named after a Dutch ice-skating technique and can pose serious safety risks.The FAA said this month it was also investigating a Southwest 737 MAX 8 flight in April that came within about 400 feet of the ocean off the coast of Hawaii after bad weather conditions prompted pilots to bypass a landing attempt at Lihue airport.During the go-around, the first officer ""inadvertently pushed forward on the control column while following thrust lever movement commanded by the autothrottle,"" according to a June 7 airline memo, and the plane began to descend rapidly, hitting a maximum descent rate of about 4,400 feet per minute.The pilots in a post-debrief said seeing the severity of the flight ""through the animations was a significant, emotional event,"" Southwest said, adding the incident prompted the airline to review data and trends related to its procedures, training, standards, and performance.","Southwest Flight 4805 departed from a temporarily closed runway in Maine earlier this week.

The National Assembly of Pakistan approved the government's finance bill for the upcoming fiscal year on Friday, which includes significant tax increases, the bill was passed ahead of further negotiations with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) regarding a new bailout package, as the country seeks to prevent a debt default amidst the slowest economic growth in South Asia.Despite facing strong opposition from rival political parties, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented the tax-heavy budget in parliament, which was subsequently endorsed by the ruling alliance under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq announced the bill's passage during a live television broadcast.The government has set an ambitious tax revenue target of 13 trillion rupees ($46.66 billion) for the fiscal year beginning July 1, representing a nearly 40% increase from the current year. This target was outlined in the national budget presented on July 12, which aimed to bolster Pakistan's case for a new IMF rescue package, with the country currently in discussions for a loan ranging from $6 billion to $8 billion.The tax increases include a 48% rise in direct taxes and a 35% increase in indirect taxes compared to the revised estimates for the current year. Non-tax revenue, such as petroleum levies, is expected to surge by an astonishing 64%. Textile and leather products, as well as mobile phones, will face an 18% tax, and there will be an increase in the tax on capital gains from real estate transactions. Workers will also be subject to higher direct taxes on their income.Pakistan has forecasted a significant reduction in its fiscal deficit for the new financial year, aiming for 5.9% of gross domestic product (GDP), down from an upwardly revised estimate of 7.4% for the current year. However, the central bank has cautioned about the potential inflationary impact of the budget, noting that limited progress in structural reforms to expand the tax base means that increased revenue must come from tax hikes. The country has set a growth target of 3.6% for the upcoming year, with inflation projected at 12%.",The National Assembly of Pakistan approved the government's finance bill for the upcoming fiscal year on Friday.

Instead, a significant portion of tax revenues is earmarked for debt servicing, a trend expected to escalate in the upcoming fiscal year, as reported by Dawn.""The government would spend PKR 7.21 trillion on domestic debt servicing and an additional PKR 1.04 trillion on foreign debt servicing, taking the total to PKR 8.25 trillion,"" according to the budget document for FY2023-24. This figure is set to rise further in FY25, with allocations totalling PKR 9.77 trillion for debt servicing alone.Amid projections of increased revenue generation, economic experts remain skeptical about achieving ambitious tax collection targets. ""Economy experts believe that the government will not achieve the PKR 12.97 trillion tax collection target set for FY25,"" citing concerns over past targets being missed, including the PKR 9.41 trillion target for FY24.Critically, the high interest rates, recently reduced but still hovering around 20.5 per cent, have polarized opinions within the business community. ""The business community also finds this rate high and is demanding that it be brought down close to the inflation rate,"" as inflation levels stood at 11.8 per cent in May, prompting calls for interest rates to be lowered to 13-14 per cent.""This excessive borrowing practically makes it impossible for the government to spend money on development projects,"" lamented a banker, highlighting the imbalance between public sector investments and private sector participation, Dawn reported.","Pakistani government faces substantial financial challenges as it navigates through economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures.

Melting ice due to climate change unmasks Everest's hidden tragedies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/melting-ice-due-to-climate-change-unmasks-everests-hidden-tragedies/articleshow/111302957.cms,"The sacred slopes of Mount Everest are witnessing the effects of climate change as the snow and ice cover thins, exposing the bodies of hundreds of mountaineers who lost their lives pursuing their dream of reaching the world's highest peak. This year, a team of climbers and military personnel embarked on a mission not to summit the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) mountain, but to retrieve some of the corpses, risking their own lives in the process.As part of Nepal's mountain clean-up campaign on Everest, Lhotse, and Nuptse, the team successfully recovered five frozen bodies, including one that was reduced to skeletal remains.The task was arduous, dangerous, and emotionally challenging.Rescuers spent hours chipping away at the ice with axes and sometimes using boiling water to release the bodies from the frozen grip. Major Aditya Karki, who led the team, said, ""Because of the effects of global warming , (the bodies and trash) are becoming more visible as the snow cover thins.""Over 300 people have died on Everest since expeditions began in the 1920s, with eight fatalities in this season alone. Many bodies remain on the mountain, some hidden by snow or lost in deep crevasses, while others have become landmarks along the route to the summit, earning nicknames such as ""Green Boots"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"".The presence of these bodies can have a psychological impact on climbers, as they believe they are entering a sacred space.Retrieving bodies from the ""death zone,"" where thin air and low oxygen levels increase the risk of altitude sickness, is a controversial and challenging task. It requires significant financial resources, with each body requiring up to eight rescuers and weighing over 100 kilograms (220 pounds).However, Major Karki emphasised the necessity of the rescue effort, saying, ""We have to bring them back as much as possible. If we keep leaving them behind, our mountains will turn into a graveyard.""The retrieved bodies, once brought down from the mountain, are transported to Kathmandu. Two of the bodies have been preliminarily identified, and authorities are awaiting detailed tests for final confirmation. Those that remain unidentified will likely be cremated.Despite the recovery efforts, the mountain still holds its secrets. The body of British climber George Mallory, who went missing during a 1924 summit attempt, was only discovered in 1999. His climbing partner, Andrew Irvine, and their camera, which could provide evidence of a successful summit and rewrite mountaineering history, have never been found.In addition to the body retrieval mission, the clean-up campaign, with a budget of over $600,000, employed 171 Nepali guides and porters to remove 11 tonnes of rubbish from the mountain.The well-trodden route to the summit is littered with fluorescent tents, discarded climbing equipment, empty gas canisters, and even human excreta. While current expeditions are under pressure to remove their waste, historic rubbish remains a challenge.As Tshiring Jangbu Sherpa, who led the body retrieval expedition, said, ""The mountains have given us mountaineers so many opportunities. I feel that we have to give back to them, we have to remove the trash and bodies to clean the mountains.""","Mount Everest is witnessing the effects of climate change as the snow and ice cover thins.

As per the record from the home ministry, landslides have claimed 14 lives followed by 13 deaths due to the lightning in the same period of time.Nepal has a high mortality rate due to landslides and flooding during monsoons on an annual basis, because of the terrain and unplanned urbanization as well as settlement in the slopes prone to landslides.The monsoon season in the Himalayan nation usually starts on June 13 and ends on September 23. Last year, it began on June 14, which was one day later than the usual start date.Nepal is expecting the monsoon to formally arrive on June 13 and will remain active for approximately three months. Over time, the government has estimated that up to 1.8 million people could be affected by rain-related incidents during the season.According to a statement by the 28th Session of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum released on April 29, above-normal rainfall is expected during the monsoon season over most parts of South Asia. However, some areas over northern, eastern, and northeastern parts of the region may experience below-normal rainfall.Landslides triggered by heavy rains in Nepal cause extreme damage to life, property, infrastructure, and the environment.In Tarai, tens of thousands of people are affected by floods every year. In the hills, landslides are the main natural disaster occurring very frequently, mostly during monsoon.This year, South Asian meteorologists say, there is a strong agreement among the experts that La Nina conditions are likely to develop over the equatorial Pacific during the second half of the southwest monsoon season.It is also recognised that the La Nina conditions are generally associated with the normal to above-normal southwest monsoon rainfall over most parts of South Asia.(With inputs from agency)","Eight people have been killed by landslides, five due to lightning, and one due to floods.

The agreement marks a key step in the country's economic recovery after defaulting on debt repayment in 2022.Sri Lanka is under an International Monetary Fund bailout program, and the debt treatment deal is expected to reopen the doors to bilateral transactions and the resumption of foreign projects stalled when the island nation defaulted.""This morning in Paris, Sri Lanka reached a final agreement with our official bilateral creditors . Similarly, we signed another agreement with China's exim bank today in Beijing. ... Sri Lanka won,"" Wickremesinghe said.Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 and suspended repayments on some $83 billion in domestic and foreign loans amid a severe foreign exchange crisis that led to a severe shortage of essentials such as food, medicine, fuel and cooking gas, and hours-long power cuts.Sri Lanka's crisis was largely the result of staggering economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which along with 2019 terrorism attacks devastated its important tourism industry. The coronavirus crisis also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad.Additionally, the then-government slashed taxes in 2019, depleting the treasury just as the virus hit. Foreign exchange reserves plummeted, leaving Sri Lanka unable to pay for imports or defend its beleaguered currency, the rupee.Wickremesinghe said with these agreements, Sri Lanka will be able to defer all bilateral loan instalment payments until 2028. Furthermore, Sri Lanka will be able to repay all the loans on concessional terms, with an extended period until 2043.According to a previous president's office statement, the agreements would cover $10 billion, but further details on the mode of restructuring were not immediately announced.By 2022, Sri Lanka had to repay about $6 billion in foreign debt every year, amounting to about 9.2 per cent of gross domestic product. The agreement would enable Sri Lanka to maintain debt payments at less than 4.5 per cent of GDP between 2027 and 2032.As Wickremesinghe addressed the nation, his supporters the watched the speech on a giant screen in the capital Colombo and celebrated the announcement by lighting firecrackers and partaking traditional milk rice.The economic upheaval led to a political crisis that forced then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign in 2022. The Parliament then elected Wickremesinghe as president.Sri Lanka suspended repayment of its debt as it ran short of foreign currency needed to pay for imports of fuel and other essentials. Shortages led to street protests that changed the country's leadership. The IMF approved a four-year bailout program last March.The economic situation has improved under Wickremesinghe, and severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine have largely abated. But public dissatisfaction has grown over the government's effort to increase revenue by raising electricity bills and imposing heavy new income taxes on professionals and businesses, as part of the government's efforts to meet the IMF conditions.After Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy, all projects funded by foreign loans were also halted.On Wednesday, Wickremesinghe said the new agreements would pave the way to resume the foreign funded projects such as highways, light railway and airport development and also initiate new projects too.",Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 and suspended repayments on some $83 billion in domestic and foreign loans.

Tom Bower 's new book, The House of Beckham, says that ""lost trust"" suggested following supposed information leaks to the media.The Duchess of Sussex had requested designer Victoria Beckham to provide her with a ""coat, dress, boots and a handbag worth £6,000"" to wear during the royal family's traditional ""Christmas Day parade in Sandringham.""Despite this setback, “Later, Meghan wore a Beckham custom-made pregnancy outfit and a white coat and dress for a service in Westminster Abbey,” Bower told during an interview with GB News.According to Bower, prior to her marriage to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle was given ""beauty advice and best facials and hairdresser in London,"" only to later find out that the details of this conversation in a UK-based newspaper.Bower said, ""Only after The Sun reported how Victoria had given Meghan makeup advice did the relationship between the two ambitious women crash. Markle was sensitive to the media probing into her unusual past. Harry was ordered to complain to David Beckham.""Victoria refused the accusation that she was responsible for the information breach and instead accused a beautician of being the culprit.

The growing divide between the two couples became more evident when Harry and Meghan appeared to be overlooked by the Beckhams at their son Brooklyn's nuptials with Nicola Peltz in 2022.The book further said, ""She was irritated to discover that the Beckhams had considerably more wealth than herself. They owned five homes, had constant access to private jets, invitations to sail on yachts and much more money. And she was soon to be a duchess.""This revelation suggests that Meghan's frustration stemmed from the realization that the Beckhams' financial status surpassed her own, despite her impending royal title.","New book claims that Meghan Markle 'longed to by posh' like the former Spice Girl.

They went on strike for six days in January - the longest in NHS history - and hospitals had to cancel tens of thousands of appointments and operations.The latest strike began Thursday and ends on Tuesday, just two days before voters cast their ballots for a new House of Commons.The British Medical Association, the doctors' union, says their pay has dropped by a quarter over the last 15 years and has called for a 35% pay raise. The union says newly qualified doctors earn about 15 pounds ($19) an hour - the U.K. minimum wage is just over 10 pounds an hour - though salaries rise rapidly after the first year.Dr. Sumi Manirajan, deputy chair of the junior doctors committee in the union, said years of underinvestment has resulted in young doctors leaving in droves to countries such as Australia that offer better pay, with those left behind seriously overworked and underpaid.""Doctors that I trained with in London, some of the best in the country, have left to go to New Zealand. And actually what it makes me think of is why am I not doing the same? I want to be valued for the work that I do,"" she said.Manirajan, who recently graduated and works in obstetrics and gynecology, said she sees many women waiting for more than a year for routine procedures.""These patients are in pain, and it hurts us to see these patients come in again and again with the same problem that we know we could treat if we had enough doctors,"" she said.Dr. Shivam Sharma, who was among colleagues chanting on the picket line outside St. Thomas' Hospital in central London on Thursday, said the state of Britain's health service is ""terrifying.""""We used to have real standards in this country. Patients need to be seen at A&E (hospital emergency rooms) within four hours, and now you're lucky to be seen within 12,"" he said. ""Last winter we had 500 avoidable deaths a week. That's like a Boeing jet of patients going down. It's completely unacceptable.""The Conservative government says it gave the doctors pay raises of between 8.1% and 10.3% last year and that it was a generous settlement. It maintained that authorities can't make a pay offer during the preelection period but the union refused to call off the strikes.Manirajan said it was unfortunate that the government chose to call an election while knowing that the dispute was unresolved.The doctors' union said it was ready to talk, and it has already had some discussions with the opposition Labour Party, which has a considerable lead in polls.""It is difficult to comprehend how either the Conservative Party or the Labour Party can deliver on their manifesto commitment to recover NHS performance over the next Parliament without first ending the dispute,"" said Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst at The King's Fund think tank.",Thousands of doctors in England are staging their 11th walkout on Thursday. They are locked in a long-running dispute with the government over pay and working conditions. The five-day strike shines a spotlight on the troubles besetting the chronically underfunded National Health Service.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111317951,imgsize-41888,width-400,resizemode-4/111317951.jpg"
Prince Harry Phone Hacking: Prince Harry deliberately destroyed 'phone hacking evidence': Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-harry-deliberately-destroyed-phone-hacking-evidence-report/articleshow/111317778.cms,"Prince Harry was awarded 140,600 pounds last year after the London high court ruled that he had been the victim of ""modest"" phone hacking and other unlawful information gathering by journalists of British newspapers. Now it has been claimed that the Duke of Sussex deliberately destroyed potential evidence relating to the high court hacking claim, The Telegraph reported.The new claims surfaced ahead of a hearing on the case on Thursday.Prince Harry reportedly had received two encrypted hard drives comprising work documents from his staff's shared drive to which he said he no longer had any access. But before Thursday's hearing, it emerged that the hard drives were found -- one at his California home and the other at the office of his US lawyer.News Group Newspapers (NGN) has now sought the release of emails, as well as text messages and WhatsApp messages, sent and received by the Duke, and material held on two encrypted hard drives.The publisher demanded to see records of communication between the Duke and Sir Clive Alderton, the King’s private secretary, as well as Sir Michael Stevens, the Keeper of the Privy Purse and treasurer to the King.It wanted access to the many texts sent between the Duke and JR Moehringer, the author who ghostwrote his memoir, Spare.David Sherborne, for the Duke, said the pair communicated via Signal and their chat history was wiped before the book was published in January last year. He said three Hotmail addresses used by Prince Harry prior to 2014 – spikewales@hotmail.com; spikewells@hotmail.com and bazasales69@hotmail.com – were no longer accessible.However, the Duke’s legal team has searched other email accounts to which he has access – h@sjpkp.com and ha@sjpkp.com, which span a period from January 2014 until April this year, for three keywords, and is now searching them for the 55 search terms sought by NGN.","Prince Harry was awarded 140,600 pounds last year after the London high court ruled that he had been the victim of ""modest"" phone hacking and other unlawful information gathering.
