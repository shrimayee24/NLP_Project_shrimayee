Why solar-powered prosperity in Thar desert is a mixed blessing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-solar-powered-prosperity-in-thar-desert-is-a-mixed-blessing/articleshow/124731664.cms,"Rajasthan’s Thar desert is glowing with solar panels, powering India’s clean energy dreams. But behind the boom lies a quieter story that goes unsaid — of vanishing camels, felled khejri trees, and fading pastoral life

Solar rush, sore communities

Fight for land and beyond

Economy’s leap, ecology’s slide

Oil, cement, solar, rising incomes

Balancing sun and sand

The Thar desert is dancing, but not to the tune it once knew. Ever since Barmer struck oil in 2004, the desert was catapulted from obscurity to the frontline of India’s energy story. Solar fields — in neat military lines — sprawl where flocks once grazed, and a Rs 80,000-crore crude refinery waits in the wings. Jaisalmer, once a sepiatinted tourist postcard of camels and its famous fort, is adding cement to its desert identity. Prosperity has found a new postcode, dragging people from the margins to the mainstream.Yet, beneath the sheen of progress, another story simmers: of cultural identity of its people and centuries-old pastoral traditions fading, camels and sheep disappearing, vital khejri trees falling to the axe, and the fragile biodiversity fraying. The region is at a crossroads, caught between progress and preservation, megawatts and memories.In Jodhpur’s Bhadla panchayat, Sadar Khan recalls when the 25,000 acres of govt land around his village were still pasturelands — grazing grounds for sheep, goats and cows. That changed in 2014, when the govt carved out 14,000 acres for a mega solar park. “I had 250 animals once. With no pastures left, I had to sell. The few I keep now are only to remember who we were,” he says, pointing out to the blue sea of solar panels that occupy the horizon.But the development has been lopsided, says Khan. “The park brought in investment of about Rs 10,000 crore, but we do not have a doctor, nor a school offering classes beyond class 8,” he says.Solar plants have also mushroomed across Jaisalmer, Bikaner and Barmer. For investors, it’s a dream run: secure a power purchase agreement (PPA) for 25 years, instal panels, and enjoy stable returns without much operational hassle. For villagers, it has meant leasing out one-crop or unproductive land for Rs 30,000 an acre, annually. But there are hidden costs. Lakhs of khejri trees were felled, ponds and sacred groves levelled, and grazing lands erased.For men like Sumer Singh Bhati and his community of herders and farmers, this is not just land, it is also identity. Supported by thousands from Jaisalmer, Barmer, and Bikaner, Bhati has rallied against the large-scale diversion of pastureland and sacred groves — “orans”, in local parlance. “We are not against development, but against the erasure of our ecosystem and culture,” Bhati says. On Sept 26, nearly 15,000 villagers marched in protest, with a sit-in at the Jaisalmer collectorate. The struggle is about ‘ jeevika ’ (livelihood) and ‘ pehchaan ’ (identity), Bhati says. The protest was called off on Oct 19 after the govt assured the protesters that 8,000 acres of community forest land would be notified and safeguarded from destruction, with no allocation for solar or cement projects. However, Bhati said they had also submitted a separate proposal seeking protection for an additional 80,000 acres of community forests, which remains pending at the collectorate level. “We will resume our protest if the 8,000 acres are not formally declared as a protected area,” he said.The desert economy once revolved around livestock — camels, cattle and sheep. But their numbers are dwindling rapidly. The 2019 livestock census showed a 13% fall in sheep and a 35% decline in camels. Professor Anil Kumar Chhangani of Bikaner’s Maharaja Ganga Singh University warned the numbers today would be far worse. “If the census were to be conducted today, the numbers could be appalling. Besides the rapidly falling animal population, about 25 lakh khejri, ker, kumta, jal and rohida trees — central to the Thar desert’s biodiversity — have been felled,” Chhangani claims.The last known census of khejri trees ( Prosopis cineraria ), Rajasthan’s state tree, was conducted by the Central Arid Zone Research Institute in 2015. This study across 12 dry districts, such as Jodhpur and Nagaur, found the density had fallen to fewer than 35 trees per hectare from about 90 in the 1950s and 60s. The institute attributed the decline to groundwater overuse, fungal attacks, and land development.Recently, Bikaner’s master plan has proposed to convert 27,000 bighas (625 acres) of pastureland into commercial and residential use. “Pastures are oxygen for animals, birds, reptiles, and people. Sacrificing them is ecological suicide,” Chhangani cautions.Barmer was once dreaded as a ‘Kala Pani’ posting for officials. Today, oil and thermal power have turned it into an emerging economic frontier.Its per capita income — Rs 1.5 lakh per annum in 2023-24 — doubled in the past five years, nearing the state average of Rs 1.7 lakh. Jaisalmer, Bikaner and Jodhpur, too, boast incomes above the state average. Besides being home to large-scale solar and wind farms, Jaisalmer has recently attracted investment of Rs 18,000 crore in the cement sector, spanning seven plants. In Pachpadra, a Rs 80,000-crore refinery is set to start commercial operation, promising to change the region’s future forever. With 40GW (1 gigawatt = 1,000MW) of solar plants already installed and another 50GW planned, much of it in the desert region, Thar’s development is reaching for the skies, promising more prosperity.Rajasthan accounts for India’s largest solar power capacity, at 20%. It is critical to the country’s global climate commitments, and the target of 500GW by 2030. But the question is not whether solar is important, it is about saving the desert’s soul: its trees, animals, and the pastoral life it is proud of.Chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma promises to plant 10 saplings for every khejri tree that is felled. But people like Bhati and Khan dismiss it as tokenism. Replanting cannot replace centuries-old groves or restore lost pastures, they say.","Rajasthan’s Thar desert is glowing with solar panels.

"‘Harappan site’s trade infrastructure predates Silk Route by 2,000 years’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/harappan-sites-trade-infrastructure-predates-silk-route-by-2000-yrs/articleshow/124731242.cms,"PUNE: Bronze Age traders crossing Gujarat stopped at well-organised roadside facilities that offered shelter, food, security and stables for their pack animals.A new multidisciplinary study by Pune-based Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute, Symbiosis School for Liberal Arts, and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), New Delhi, published in L’Anthropologie (Elsevier, 2025), has identified a 4,000-year-old Harappan settlement at Kotada Bhadli in Kutch as the earliest known caravanserai — a fortified rural stopover that supported long-distance trade between 2300 and 1900 BCE. The findings now push back the origins of organised trade infrastructure in the subcontinent by over 2,000 years.Lead researcher Prabodh Shirvalkar from Deccan College told TOI: “This is the first confirmed archaeological evidence of a caravanserai in the Harappan world — a type of infrastructure previously known only from later historical periods.”Excavated between 2010 and 2013 in collaboration with Gujarat State Archaeology Department, the site has now been reinterpreted using advanced techniques— including ground penetrating radar, magnetic and satellite surveys, isotopic and lipid analyses, and three forms of dating, Shirvalkar added.Researchers, including Esha Prasad and Yadubirsingh Rawat, said the finding bridges a key missing link in the trade mechanism of the Indus Valley Civilization, revealing how long-distance overland trade was supported by an organised system of rest stops and logistical hubs — a structure previously thought to have emerged only in the early historic or medieval periods.While the existence of Harappan trade with Mesopotamia and inland India is well-established, the mechanism of how merchants, animals and goods actually moved across land remained unclear.The new study proposes that Harappan commerce depended on a network of small fortified stopovers, strategically placed along trade routes between urban centres like Dholavira, Lothal and Shikarpur in Gujarat.Earlier excavations revealed a multi-roomed central building, fortified walls with bastions, and large open spaces that were likely used to hold animals and goods — all consistent with a caravanserai’s layout.Shirvalkar added that the site was small, strategically placed and fortified, but non-urban — designed for short halts rather than permanent residence. By identifying caravanserai-like traits — fortification, animal pens, open spaces, food waste and imported goods — the paper said that Harappans maintained an organised trade infrastructure two millennia before the Silk Route “The Harappan economy was not just about city markets and ports like Dholavira or Lothal. It had a logistical backbone. Caravanserais that sustained traders on long inland routes,” Shirvalkar said.","A 4,000-year-old Harappan settlement at Kotada Bhadli in Kutch is the earliest known caravanserai.

NEW DELHI: As residents across the national capital celebrated Diwali with fireworks on Monday night, Delhi's air quality took a sharp hit, with the majority of monitoring stations entering the 'red zone'.Although the Supreme Court had permitted the use of green firecrackers between 8 pm and 10 pm on the festival day, celebrations continued well beyond the allotted hours.Data showed that 36 out of 38 monitoring stations recorded pollution levels in the 'red zone', indicating 'very poor' to 'severe' air quality across the city.Morning visuals on Tuesday reveal Akshardham, partially obscured by haze. Stage II (GRAP-2) measures are in effect across Delhi-NCR.By 10 pm, Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) was classified as 'very poor' at 344, with four stations reporting 'severe' levels above 400. According to the SAMEER app developed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the worst-hit areas were Dwarka (417), Ashok Vihar (404), Wazirpur (423), and Anand Vihar (404).The city’s 24-hour average AQI, reported daily at 4 pm, also remained in the 'very poor' category at 345, higher than Sunday’s 326, according to official data.In the afternoon, 31 stations recorded 'very poor' air quality, while three fell under the 'severe' zone.Authorities warned that air quality is likely to deteriorate further, slipping into the 'severe' category more broadly on Tuesday and Wednesday.The CPCB categorises AQI between 0 and 50 as 'good', 51 and 100 as 'satisfactory', 101 to 200 as 'moderate', 201 to 300 as 'poor', 301 to 400 as 'very poor', and 401 to 500 as 'severe.'Transport emissions contributed 15.6 per cent to Delhi's pollution on Monday, while other sources, including industries, accounted for 23.3 per cent, data from the Decision Support System (DSS) showed.On Sunday, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoked Stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR. The decision followed a review by the GRAP sub-committee on Saturday and forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).Earlier, on October 15, the Supreme Court had allowed the sale and bursting of green firecrackers in Delhi-NCR between 6 am and 7 pm, and again from 8 pm to 10 pm on Diwali eve and the day of the festival.Residents of Delhi reported breathing difficulties and eye irritation following a surge in air pollution after Diwali celebrations.Speaking to media, Sagar, a resident of the national capital, held people accountable for the dip in air quality.He said, ""Pollution hasn't just been increasing today; it's been increasing for years. Everyone blames politicians, but the people themselves are like this. People aren't improving themselves. You'll get firecrackers, but it's up to you whether to burst them or not. Then they'll complain that the government isn't doing anything. There are problems in breathing, irritation in eyes.""Ashish Ranjan, a local who came to Kartavya Path for running, also complained about the breathing difficulties. He said, ""There are difficulties in breathing during running time. I cannot breather properly.""","36 out of 38 monitoring stations recorded pollution levels in the'red zone', indicating'very poor' to'severe' air quality.

"Delhi air pollution: At peak hours, data goes blank at many stations; experts raise alarm",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/as-pollution-peaks-many-stns-go-blank/articleshow/124727657.cms,"Air pollution in Delhi

NEW DELHI: When the air quality station at RK Puram reached peak PM2.5 levels of 1,476 micrograms per cubic metre around midnight, its real-time hourly data went missing from Delhi Pollution Control Committee's website for five hours. The data was available again from 6am, showing a downward trend at 1,187ug/m3, followed by 1,064ug/m3 at 7am.Experts alleged that several stations of DPCC, Central Pollution Control Board and India Meteorological Department stopped showing hourly data after PM10 and PM2.5 levels were close to crossing the 1,000 mark around midnight. They claimed that due to the data gaps, the 24-hour average readings of some stations were skewed. Most stations saw a spike in pollution levels around midnight.At Nehru Nagar, the most polluted station on the Diwali night, the highest hourly PM2.5 concentration was 1,763ug/m3 at 10pm. However, the hourly data for 11pm is unavailable. The station also recorded data gaps from 1am to 5am.Similarly, CPCB's ITO station recorded hourly PM2.5 levels of 923ug/m3 at 1am on Tuesday and 967 at 7am. However, the data is missing for six hours in between.At NSIT Dwarka station of CPCB, PM10 readings were unavailable from 12am to 5am. At 6am, PM10 levels touched 817ug/m3, but data was again unavailable for three hours during the day.Things were no different at IMD's Ayanagar, where hourly PM10 data was missing for five hours while PM2.5 levels were unavailable from 2am to 4am.Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst of think tank EnviroCatalysts, said many stations blanked out on Monday night. This is not an issue with stations run by one monitoring agency; all four agencies, IITM, IMD, DPCC and CPCB, faced this issue, he pointed out.""The observed pattern shows that most stations stopped providing data when they approached 1,000ug/m3 while there were stations such as Anand Vihar, Nehru Nagar, Mundka, etc. that recorded values above 1,000ug/m3, indicating that the technology of monitoring isn't an issue, at least in terms of being available. This is not the first time that the stations have stopped providing data; we have observed this over the past years too,"" said Dahiya.He added that if some stations couldn't monitor beyond a certain limit, these stations should be upgraded to the similar technology as Anand Vihar and Nehru Nagar. If the issue was manual, it should be investigated and shouldn't be repeated in the future. ""Such missing data hampers data-driven insights, understanding the contribution of certain activities, their impact on health as well as skews the daily pollution level recordings, giving a false sense of lower air pollution levels,"" Dahiya emphasised.Activist Bhavreen Kandhari said data gaps during high pollution hours meant ""we are losing sight exactly when it matters most"". She pointed out, ""Transparency in air quality monitoring must be treated as a public health imperative, not an option.""Environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa, however, claimed, ""All data is available on CPCB and DPCC, there is no missing data. You have to check."" Hinting at AAP, which also raised the issue, he said, ""Those who are saying there is missing data, you know what their intentions are.""CPCB, DPCC, Commission for Air Quality Management and IMD did not reply to TOI's queries on missing data.","Air quality station at RK Puram reached peak PM2.5 levels of 1,476 micrograms per cubic metre around midnight.

As per the understanding reached between the 2 sides, India will designate the head of the mission in Kabul as chargé d'affaires, eventually appointing an ambassador, and the Taliban are expected to send 2 diplomats to New Delhi by November this year.The diplomats will work out of the Afghan embassy here, even in the absence of a formal recognition by India of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), the name used by Taliban for Afghanistan. The elevation of diplomatic ties clears the path for expansion of economic cooperation between the 2 countries, allowing India to contribute more meaningfully to the development of Afghanistan, even as its position on recognition remains largely aligned with that of the international community.Muttaqi’s unprecedented visit to India and the decision to ramp up diplomatic ties came in the middle of mounting tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan that saw deadly border skirmishes while Muttaqi was still in India.“In keeping with the decision announced during the recent visit of the Afghan Foreign Minister to India, the Government is restoring the status of the Technical Mission of India in Kabul to that of Embassy of India in Afghanistan with immediate effect,” said the Indian government in a statement, adding the decision underscored India’s resolve to deepen its bilateral engagement with the Afghan side in all spheres of mutual interest.The government also said that the embassy will further augment India’s contribution to Afghanistan’s comprehensive development, humanitarian assistance, and capacity-building initiatives, in line with the priorities and aspirations of Afghan society.India had shut its embassy after the return of the Taliban to Kabul in August, 2021. However, following security assurances from Kabul, India started to run a technical mission from the premises in June 2022, mainly to oversee distribution of Indian humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.The Taliban see Muttaqi’s visit as marking a new phase in the relationship. Significantly, both sides committed to respecting each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and, in a message to Pakistan, also unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from “regional countries”. Taliban’s backing of India’s sovereignty over J&K had also angered Pakistan, leading to lodging of a formal protest by Islamabad with Kabul.Earlier this week, the Taliban also dismissed Pakistani claims about India’s role in fomenting tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan as baseless and illogical.""These accusations are groundless. Our policy will never involve using our territory against other countries. We maintain relations with India as an independent nation and will strengthen those ties within the framework of our national interests,” said Afghanistan’s defence minister Mawlawi Mohammad Yaqoob. The 2 countries agreed to a ceasefire this week after talks in Doha.“At the same time, we will preserve our relations with Pakistan based on good neighborliness. Our aim is to expand relations, not create tensions. Pakistan’s accusations are unfounded, illogical, and unacceptable,” added the minister.Aligning with the global community on the issue of recognition for the Taliban government, India has also continued to raise issues related to the need for a more inclusive government in Afghanistan and respect for rights of women and children. Russia remains the only country to have formally recognised the government in Kabul, while others like China and Pakistan have accepted Taliban ambassadors and diplomats.","India restored its embassy in Kabul Tuesday, following the announcement during Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s recent visit to India.

Bihar Assembly polls: Fewer Yadav candidates fielded by NDA as it looks to consolidate its core base,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-polls-fewer-yadav-candidates-fielded-by-nda-as-it-looks-to-consolidate-its-core-base/articleshow/124728763.cms,"Nitish has fielded only 4 Muslims as against 11 in 2020



NEW DELHI: A push for social engineering in search of additional votes appears to have given way to the governing NDA focusing on consolidation of its traditional support base for the Bihar assembly polls. This turn is most telling in the significant cut in the number of Yadav candidates fielded by its two biggest constituents, BJP and JD(U).BJP has fielded only six Yadavs this time, as against 16 in 2020, while chief minister Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) has chosen eight candidates, as against 18 the last time. The choice of BJP’s replacements for some of its sitting Yadav MLAs points to its new gameplan: it has gone for a Kushwaha, the most populous OBC community after Yadavs; a Nishad, an increasingly assertive extremely backward classes group; and a Vaishya, the party's traditional supporter, for the Patna Sahib, Aurai and Munger seats, respectively.Since it was elected to office at the Centre in 2014 and emerged as the largest party in Bihar, ahead of RJD and JDU, BJP has tried to expand its support base. Overtures to Yadavs were part of the plan to broaden the tent.In both 2015 and 2020, it disregarded Yadavs’ staunch support for RJD to give them a sizeable number of tickets. The community has a population share of 14.2%; that is three times the number of Kushwahas (4.2%).However, the community, which along with Muslims forms the mainstay of Lalu Prasad-headed RJD, refused to leave his side. If anything, it rallied even more vigorously behind INDIA in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.RJD, the principal member of the opposition alliance, is trying to expand its formidable social coalition of Yadavs and Muslims by giving more tickets to candidates from other communities: something that represents a recognition that the powerful M-Y bloc is not adequate to end RJD’s two-decade-long exile from office. In contrast, BJP has decided to focus on preserving and rallying its more diverse and bigger core bloc of upper castes and a large section of non-Yadav OBCs, EBCs and Scheduled Castes. Ram Surat Rai, the sitting BJP MLA from Aurai who has been dropped this time, said Yadav lawmakers like him have borne the brunt of his party’s focus on its core votes as they were never seen as part of its social coalition.Rai was replaced by Rama Nishad, wife of former MP Ajay Nishad who had contested from Muzaffarpur on a Congress ticket after BJP denied him a Lok Sabha ticket in 2024. Nishads are seen as a swing bloc and wooed by RJD and its ally Mukesh Sahani of VIP. The party also dropped its seasoned lawmaker Nand Kishore Yadav, a seven-time winner and speaker in the outgoing assembly, in favour of Ratnesh Kushwaha from Patna Sahib.JDU, too, has followed a similar playbook. Seen as more vulnerable than BJP, it has fielded 25 candidates from Kurmi-Koeri (Kushwaha) castes and 22 each from upper castes and extremely backward classes.Nitish has this time fielded only four Muslims, as against 11 in 2020, in what is being seen as belated recognition that the community would prefer Lalu to him. A JDU functionary noted that all its Muslim candidates had lost last time, and the community has been vocal in its criticism of the party for siding with BJP in supporting amendments to the waqf law.BJP has named 49 candidates from upper castes and 52 from OBCs, EBCs and Dalits.A BJP functionary noted that both his party and JDU were contesting fewer seats (101 each) than the 110 and 115, respectively, they contested last time. “We had to drop many candidates. And members of some communities were easy choices as these groups are not much inclined to support our alliance,” the BJP neta added.","BJP has fielded only six Yadavs this time, as against 16 in 2020.

India is a dairy nation, but paradoxically, one that struggles to digest it. Between 60–74% of Indians are lactose mal-absorbers, according to studies by the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) and market research agencies such as Grand View Research. That makes the country one of the largest pools of lactose-intolerant consumers anywhere in the world.Yet awareness remains startlingly low. Studies by Beanery Foods reveal that fewer than 30% of urban, middle- and upper-class consumers even recognise their own intolerance. This mismatch, widespread prevalence but low recognition, has left the market largely underserved.At present, just a handful of brands are trying to address this gap. Most offerings are niche, metro-focused, or priced at a premium. The result? The everyday Indian consumer, particularly in semi-urban areas, has little access to lactose-free options. And yet, the case for lactose-free is no longer about niche health needs. It is shaping up to be the next big dairy wave in India. It is now mainstream, lifestyle-driven, and powered by rising health consciousness.Medical and nutritional research consistently shows how deep-rooted this issue is. A landmark study by SGPGI Lucknow found that nearly 74% of Indians are lactose mal-absorbers. Broader estimates place prevalence between 60–66% of the population, with India ranking among the top globally for intolerance.The numbers vary regionally. In Delhi, an earlier multicentre study pegged prevalence at just 27.4%, a reflection of North India’s genetic history of dairy farming and relatively higher lactase persistence. By contrast, in southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh, intolerance rates soar to 66–82%. For a country where milk is both a staple and a cultural symbol, this presents a striking paradox. Dairy is central to the Indian diet, but difficult for most Indians to digest.Despite this vast prevalence, the lactose-free dairy market in India is still at a nascent stage. According to MarkNtel Advisors, the market is projected to grow at a 7% CAGR through 2027, with some segments expected to expand at up to 14.8% CAGR by 2030. And yet, most supermarket shelves in metros stock only two or three brands offering lactose-free variants. The products that do exist are often premium-priced, targeted at niche audiences, and concentrated in big cities. This leaves a clear gap for players who can bring innovation, affordability, and wider distribution to the category, especially into Tier-2 and Tier-3 markets where intolerance rates are high.The opportunity, however, is not confined to those with medical intolerance. A growing wave of health-conscious Indians is embracing lactose-free products as a lifestyle choice. Lactose-free milk is naturally sweeter and creamier because the enzyme lactase breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose, eliminating the need for added sugar while improving digestibility. This makes it attractive not only for daily consumption but also for indulgent formats such as flavoured milk, milkshakes, and desserts.The flavoured milk category is already booming, projected to grow at a 15.4% CAGR from 2024 to 2029, adding more than ₹6,000 crore in value. Similarly, the Indian milkshake market, valued at ₹7.6 billion in 2024, is forecast to reach ₹34.2 billion by 2033, growing at a robust 17.47% CAGR. For brands, this shift reframes lactose-free from a medical necessity into a mainstream lifestyle-driven category that promises both health and indulgence.The rise of no sugar and low sugar beverages in India dovetails perfectly with the lactose-free wave. In 2024, sales of no-sugar beverages doubled to ₹700–750 crore, now accounting for about 10% of the overall beverage market. Within dairy, however, the no-sugar ready-to-drink milkshake segment remains underserved. A few brands have launched protein shakes with zero sugar, but a comprehensive portfolio is missing. This creates space for lactose-free beverages sweetened with natural alternatives such as jaggery and dates, a preference that aligns with consumer demand for clean-label, functional indulgence. Government initiatives like the Eat Right India campaign further reinforce this trend by encouraging manufacturers to reduce refined sugar in foods and beverages.The profile of India’s lactose-free consumer is distinct. Unlike traditional dairy, where consumption cuts across all demographics, the early adopters here are younger, more urban, and more discerning. Millennials and Gen Z, especially those in the 25–30 age group, represent the highest consumption cohort. These are consumers who not only recognise the discomfort of lactose intolerance but also actively seek healthier, cleaner, and more functional options.Geographically, metros like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai are leading the trend, driven by exposure to global lifestyles and higher health awareness. But interestingly, the deeper potential lies in semi-urban South India, where lactose intolerance is more prevalent, with rates as high as 66–82% in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh. West India, particularly Gujarat and Maharashtra, is emerging as another hotspot, thanks to a vibrant dairy innovation ecosystem.What makes these consumers unique is not just their health consciousness but their taste preferences. Beanery Foods’ internal studies shows that more than 75% of urban Millennials and Gen Z prefer Indian-inspired flavours such as Rasmalai, Filter Kaapi, or Rose Kulfi over global standards like vanilla or strawberry. They are also overwhelmingly skewed toward clean-label products with over 90% of respondents revealing their preference for beverages without refined sugar, and with strong interest in natural sweeteners like jaggery and dates.Behind the rise of every successful food category in India lies a quiet enabler which is the packaging & processing technology. For lactose-free to scale, packaging technology is now a critical requirement. The UHT milk market in India, already valued at USD 7.75 billion in 2024, is projected to nearly double to USD 15.53 billion by 2034, growing at 7.2% CAGR. This growth is underpinned by one simple advantage which is the fact that UHT packaging allows milk and milk-based beverages to remain safe for six months without refrigeration.In a country where cold chain infrastructure is uneven, this single factor removes one of the biggest barriers to scale. It allows products to travel further, last longer, and remain safe without adding cost or logistical complexity. For retailers, it means lower spoilage and easier inventory management. For consumers, it provides hygienic, ready-to-drink convenience that matches modern on-the-go lifestyles.Solutions like Tetra Pak’s aseptic cartons are playing a critical role in this ecosystem, enabling safe, long-lasting lactose-free products that can reach far beyond metro shelves.Startups are already proving how this category can be reimagined. Zumi, a Hyderabad-based venture, has launched lactose-free, protein-rich milkshakes in flavours inspired by India’s culinary heritage, from Rasmalai to Rose Kulfi. Each 200ml pack delivers 7–8 grams of protein, is sweetened with natural alternatives like jaggery and dates, and comes in hygienic, ready-to-drink Tetra Pak cartons.Backed by Startup India and supported by Tetra Pak’s product development expertise, Zumi represents a new wave of Indian food innovation, clean-label, functional, and rooted in local taste preferences.“We are excited to serve the ever-conscious Indian consumer with our clean, lactose-free, no refined sugar milkshakes and redefine how India snacks and indulges. At ZUMI, our vision is to make better-for-you indulgence a joyful, guilt-free choice for everyone, combining nutrition with exceptional taste”, Thapasya Vijayaraghavan, Founder of Zumi Foods says.Lactose-free is no longer a fringe alternative. It solves a real health challenge that affects a majority of Indians, while also tapping into the aspirations of a younger, lifestyle-conscious consumer base. At the same time, it aligns seamlessly with broader trends shaping the food and beverage industry with cleaner labels, reduced sugar, functional indulgence, and on-the-go convenience.For dairy players, the timing could not be better. The category is expanding steadily, awareness is rising, and packaging solutions have made it possible to distribute safe, long-lasting products across India’s vast geography. What was once a niche product for a select few is now poised to become a mainstream choice for millions.For both startups looking to innovate and established brands aiming to diversify, lactose-free represents more than just an opportunity; it is the next big wave in Indian dairy, carrying the promise of scale, inclusivity, and long-term consumer loyalty.Disclaimer :","Between 60–74% of Indians are lactose mal-absorbers, according to studies.

Both husband and wife must compromise and adjust to maintain a normal marital relationship... (But) the petitioner sought an obedient and sincere maid rather than a wife. His unwillingness to adjust led to the breakdown of the marital relationship,” the court ruled.The appellant, employed in the US, had married a Singapore-based woman in 2015. The couple cohabited for only 25 days, including a ten-day stay in India.In 2016, the man filed a petition seeking divorce on grounds of cruelty. The family court dismissed the petition in 2020, observing that the wife had demonstrated that the husband and his mother were frustrated at not having received any significant dowry amount or property from her.The husband subsequently approached the HC.“According to Hindu customs and religion, marriage is regarded as a sacred union, not merely a cohabitation between a man and a woman. This union cannot be dissolved simply by filing a petition in court and making allegations against one another,” observed a division bench comprising Justices Jayant Banerji and Umesh M Adiga.It further held: “This case exemplifies a situation where the husband has sought divorce for trivial reasons.”","Karnataka high court dismisses a man's appeal against a Bengaluru family court verdict that had rejected his plea for divorce on the grounds of cruelty by his wife.

Ayush & MBBS doctors’ parity: SC refers case to larger bench,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ayush-mbbs-doctors-parity-sc-refers-case-to-larger-bench/articleshow/124729412.cms,"NEW DELHI: Can practitioners of Ayurveda , Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) seek parity in pay scales, service conditions and retirement age with MBBS doctors?Given the conflicting judicial decisions on the issue of parity, a two-judge bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran has referred the matter, a source of perennial conflict between AYUSH and MBBS doctors, to a larger bench for an authoritative pronouncement.The bench said, “There is an area of ambiguity insofar as service conditions, especially of retirement age and the pay packages, with reference to the doctors administering different forms of medical treatment, evaluated for the purposes of parity, should be ideally considered, according to us, on the touchstone of, identity of functions, similarity in work carried out and comparable duties assigned.”It said the claim for parity will have to be decided taking into consideration the qualifications acquired, the treatment practices, the functions, work and duties of practitioners of traditional medicine systems, among other discernible features.Distinguishing AYUSH practitioners from MBBS doctors, the bench said, “It is the MBBS doctors, the allopathy practitioners, who are dealing with critical care, immediate lifesaving measures, invasive procedures, including surgeries and even postmortem; none of which can be carried out by any of the practitioners of indigenous systems of medicine.”The order came on a petition filed by Rajasthan , which through solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the state had brought different retirement ages for AYUSH and MBBS doctors to subserve public good and to address the dearth of adequate number of allopathy doctors.Referring to a previous decision, the CJI-led bench said, “It is common knowledge that the footfalls in allopathy institutions are far more than in the institutions administering the indigenous system of medicine… Further, casualty, critical care, trauma management and the emergency interventional procedures are dealt with by allopathy doctors and not by AYUSH doctors.“These aspects, according to us, put the former (MBBS doctors) in a different class altogether, who can be classified differently for service conditions. This has a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved: the sufficiency of qualified and experienced MBBS doctors with better pay scales and longer service, both,” it said.“We are of the opinion that there should be an authoritative pronouncement on the issue, and hence we refer the matter to a larger bench.

Thereafter, it failed to procure another contract till Oct 1998. It produced before IT officials relevant material to show that between 1993-98, it had continuous business correspondences with ONGC regarding hiring of manpower services in respect of expert key personnel for drilling in deep waters and had unsuccessfully submitted a bid in 1996.Between 1993-98, the company claimed business expenditure deductions. This was allowed by the commissioner of income tax but Uttarakhand HC in 2009 reversed the decision. The company appealed against this before SC.A bench of Justices Manoj Misra and Joymalya Bagchi faulted the HC’s view that since the appellant did not have an office in India, it could not claim to have carried out business in India.SC said, “This view is wholly fallacious and contrary to the very scheme of the IT Act.”Writing the judgment, Justice Bagchi said, “The issue of ‘permanent establishment’ may be relevant for the purposes of availing the beneficial provisions of Double Tax Avoidance Agreement ... which is not a relevant consideration.”“In an era of globalisation whose life blood is trans-national trade and commerce, the HC’s restrictive interpretation that a non-resident company making business communications with an Indian entity from its foreign office cannot be construed to be carrying on business in India is wholly anachronistic with India’s commitment to Sustainable Development Goal relating to ‘ease of doing business’ across national borders,” SC said.","Pride Foramer SA, incorporated in France and engaged in oil drilling activities, was awarded a 10-year contract by ONGC in 1983 till 1993.

Delhi’s Air Quality Deteriorates Sharply to ‘Red Zone’ as Diwali Fireworks Trigger Severe Pollution

NEW DELHI: Two days after Diwali, Delhi on Wednesday was blanketed by a dense layer of smog, as air pollution levels in the capital rose sharply.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 345, categorised as ‘very poor’.Some areas experienced even worse conditions.Early morning readings at 6.15 am showed AQI around 380 in Ashok Vihar, Bawana and Dilshad Garden.Other parts of the city, including DTU, IGI Airport and Lodhi Road, recorded AQI below 300, falling in the ‘poor’ category.On Tuesday, four stations — Dwarka (417), Wazirpur (423), Anand Vihar (404), and Ashok Vihar (404) — entered the ‘severe’ pollution category, according to the SAMEER app developed by the CPCB.The city’s 24-hour average AQI, reported at 4 pm, also remained in the ‘very poor’ range at 345, higher than Sunday’s 326.Authorities warned that air quality could deteriorate further in the coming days, with Stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) now in effect across Delhi-NCR.The decision followed forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).Transport emissions contributed 15.6% of Delhi’s pollution on Monday, while industries and other sources accounted for 23.3%, according to the Decision Support System (DSS).Residents reported health problems, including breathing difficulties and eye irritation. “Pollution hasn’t just increased today; it’s been rising for years,” said Sagar, a local resident. “Everyone blames politicians, but people themselves are responsible. Firecrackers are a choice — then people complain the government isn’t doing anything.”Visuals on Tuesday morning showed Akshardham partially obscured by haze. The Supreme Court had recently allowed the sale and bursting of green firecrackers in Delhi-NCR between 6 am and 7 pm, and again from 8 pm to 10 pm on Diwali eve and the festival day.The CPCB categorises AQI as ‘good’ (0–50), ‘satisfactory’ (51–100), ‘moderate’ (101–200), ‘poor’ (201–300), ‘very poor’ (301–400), and ‘severe’ (401–500).","The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 345, categorised as ‘very poor’ On Tuesday, four stations — Dwarka (417), Wazirpur (423), Anand Vihar (404), and Ashok V Bihar (404) — entered the ‘severe’ pollution category.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124731800,imgsize-21256,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/severe-aqi-in-delhi-seniors-should-avoid-morning-walks-this-week.jpg"

What’s next for her





Canadian entertainer and digital creator Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University, a milestone that highlights her transformation from online sensation to mainstream cultural influencer. The award, bestowed during the university’s Fall Convocation on 14 October 2025, reflects Singh’s impact on pop culture, media representation, and diversity advocacy, signalling the growing significance of digital platforms in shaping global cultural narratives.Singh’s career illustrates a broader trend in global media where social media platforms have become launching pads for internationally recognised cultural figures. Beginning as a teenager posting humorous sketches on YouTube under the moniker ‘Superwoman’, she cultivated a large following through content combining comedy, personal reflection, and commentary on cultural identity. This digital prominence opened doors to mainstream television, literature, and public advocacy.Her recognition also highlights evolving metrics of influence. Universities and institutions increasingly acknowledge contributions beyond traditional academic or professional achievements, valuing social reach, advocacy, and public engagement.Singh’s honorary Doctor of Laws degree is emblematic of this shift, recognising the societal and cultural impact of digital creators in ways that transcend conventional accolades.Globally, Singh’s work resonates beyond entertainment. She has amplified conversations about gender equity, representation of minorities in media, and mental health awareness, reaching audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. Her trajectory offers a lens into how online personalities can shape social norms and public discourse, bridging cultural gaps and challenging stereotypes.On 14 October 2025, York University conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Singh during its Fall Convocation ceremony. The award cited her “contributions to community building and accomplishments in pop culture and entertainment.” Singh, who graduated from York in 2010 with a degree in psychology, described the honour as “immense”, noting the irony of fulfilling her parents’ long-held expectations of having a ‘doctor’ in the family, albeit in an unconventional manner.Singh’s speech to the graduating class underlined her philosophy on failure and growth. She encouraged students to embrace uncertainty and to view setbacks as teaching moments, asserting that “having it all figured out is a false narrative.” Her address also highlighted her experiences as the child of Indian immigrants navigating cultural expectations while forging a career in entertainment, a journey marked by creativity, resilience, and humour.The milestone comes amid Singh’s continued presence in mainstream media. Beyond her YouTube success, she hostedin 2019, becoming the first woman of Indian descent to lead a late-night talk show on a major American network. She has also authored bestselling books blending personal anecdotes with practical advice, further consolidating her influence across multiple platforms.Singh’s recognition signals the increasing legitimacy of digital creators in shaping cultural narratives. In a media ecosystem historically dominated by traditional broadcast networks and print outlets, social media personalities now influence public opinion, social norms, and even policy discussions on inclusivity and diversity.Her work also underscores the importance of representation. By foregrounding South Asian identity, gender equity, and minority experiences, Singh provides a template for how entertainers can leverage visibility to challenge stereotypes and promote social inclusivity. This has implications not only for entertainment but for broader societal attitudes, encouraging younger audiences to pursue unconventional paths while advocating for equity.Economically, figures like Singh exemplify the monetisation potential of digital platforms. Her trajectory highlights how online content can generate significant revenue streams, sponsorships, and brand partnerships, reshaping employment and entrepreneurship in creative industries. The honorary doctorate amplifies her credibility, reinforcing the notion that influence and impact extend beyond formal qualifications.In a wider sense, platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and other streaming networks are indirectly implicated, as Singh’s career reinforces the significance of digital-first pathways in the entertainment ecosystem. Social media companies stand to gain from the visibility and credibility conferred upon creators, while advertisers and sponsors can capitalise on the extended reach of influential figures like Singh.Singh’s trajectory is rooted in the rise of social media as a dominant form of entertainment. Launching her YouTube channel as a teenager, she capitalised on the platform’s global reach, producing content that resonated across demographics. Her channel, Superwoman, addressed universal themes of identity, family dynamics, and humour, building a subscriber base of millions within years.The transition from digital creator to mainstream television host represents a significant milestone in entertainment history, reflecting broader shifts in audience behaviour. Singh’s entry into late-night television in 2019 mirrored an era where streaming platforms and online communities began to rival traditional media in shaping celebrity culture and public discourse.Her literary contributions further illustrate this shift. By authoring bestselling books, Singh transformed personal experiences into a public narrative, extending her influence beyond screen-based content and validating digital creators as authors and thought leaders in contemporary culture.Looking ahead, Singh’s recognition is likely to encourage other digital creators to pursue multi-platform careers, blending online content, traditional media, and advocacy. Institutions may increasingly confer honours upon influencers who achieve societal impact, signalling an expanded understanding of cultural contribution.As digital influence continues to evolve, Singh’s journey exemplifies how a YouTuber can transition from niche online content to mainstream recognition, bridging cultural, generational, and geographical divides in the process.","Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University.

"USCIS exempts F-1 to H-1B status change from the $100,000 fee, easing concerns for Indian students",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uscis-exempts-f-1-to-h-1b-status-change-from-the-100000-fee-easing-concerns-for-indian-students/articleshow/124719982.cms,"Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders

Boost for Indian students transitioning from F-1 to H-1B:

Change of status in other cases:

Pay upfront:

National interest exemptions - A steep climb:

“

Legal challenges continue:





In a major relief for foreign students and American employers the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has clarified that the $100,000 ‘entry’ fee announced by President Donald Trump , that came into effect from Sept 21, will not apply to individuals already in the United States who are seeking a change of status to an H-1B, extension of stay, or amendment (such as a change in the employer)This clarification will benefit thousands of international students on F-1 visas who transit to H-1B status through the annual lottery selection process. While the entry fee has to be paid by the sponsoring employer and not the beneficiary (individual who is sponsored), it was feared that employers would not wish to cough up this significant sum for recent graduates (entry-level hires). International students who face the added pressure of heavy student loans can now breathe easy. However, another proposal in the pipeline, which seeks to give preference in H-1B visa allotments based on wage levels, will dent work prospects for international studentsOwing to the USCIS clarification, US employers such as universities, nonprofit entities affiliated with universities, nonprofit research organizations, and governmental research institutions who are eligible to hire under the cap-exempt H-1B route will also not have to pay this fee, where the international student is transiting from an F-1 visa to a work visa.According to the USCIS guidance note, issued late night on Monday, H-1B petitions “approved for an extension of stay, amendment, or change of status – including change of employer applications – will not be subject to the proclamation or the associated $100,000 fee.” Individuals who are already in the US with approved H-1B applications will also not become subject to the fee if they travel abroad, the immigration agency has clarified.However, new H-1B petitions filed for consular processing, where the worker is outside the US will trigger the $100,000 payment requirement.Also read: $100,000 H-1B visa fee: Who pays, who doesn’t? Trump admin attempts to settle confusion over policy The new guidance provides significant relief for international students, particularly the large Indian cohort who have a significant presence in the H-1B pipeline. As per the latest Open Doors report for 2023-24, 3.3 lakh Indian students were enrolled in U.S. institutions, with 97,556 undergoing Optional Practical Training (OPT).Students who complete their studies in the US typically work under the OPT program – the tenure of which is three years for students from the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Several US employers file H-1B applications for such students. Under the guidance, recently graduated international students, who are sponsored for an H-1B status, while they are in the US will not be subject to this fee.The entry fee would also not apply in ‘change of status’ cases for other categories as well. Such as a L-1 visa holder (intra company transfer visa holder) transitioning to an H-1B.The guidance is also significant for J-1 visa holders—a category that includes medical residents, researchers, teachers and scholars. J-1 visa holders are normally required to return to their home country for two years after completing their program before they can apply for an H-1B visa. Those in the medical field often seek a J-1 home residency waiver, allowing them to transition directly to H-1B status. “This is much-needed clarity and great news for healthcare employers sponsoring physicians for J-1 waivers and the resulting H-1Bs,” said Elissa Taub, partner at Siskind Susser, an immigration law firm.Immigration attorneys warn that if a change of status is requested, but is approved only for consular notification because the beneficiary (F-1 or L-1 visa holder) travelled while the application was pending or was found to have ‘violated status’, the entry fee will have to be paid. For instance, an international student could have violated his status because of unauthorised work.Rajiv S. Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com points out that, “Status determinations are often complex and sometimes arbitrary. Months later, USCIS can find a status violation that was not anticipated, resulting in a $ 100,000 bill!”The $100,000 fee applies to new H-1B petitions filed on or after September 21 for workers who are outside the US and who do not hold a valid H-1B visa, or where the employer specifically asks for consular notification instead of a change of status. Even an H-1B petition for the same worker with the same employer becomes payable if USCIS denies the extension or change of status request and approves it only for consular processing.The guidance note states that payment of the $100,000 fee must be made on the US Department of Treasury portal prior to filing the H-1B application with USCIS. Khanna points out that the sponsoring employer cannot file the application and pay later. “Proof of payment (or proof of exception) must accompany the initial filing. Failure to include this proof results in automatic denial,” he said. However, if the H-1B application is denied, the fee will be refunded.While Trump’s proclamation allows for national interest exceptions, USCIS has set an exceptionally high bar for obtaining a waiver from the payment of the $ 100,000 fee. The agency says exceptions will be granted only in “extraordinarily rare circumstances.”To qualify, employers must prove that: The individual’s presence in the US as an H-1B worker is in the national interest; No US worker is available to fill the role; The foreign national poses no security or welfare threat; and lastly that requiring payment would ‘significantly undermine US interests.Khanna said, “The fourth criterion is particularly challenging. How do you prove that requiring payment would ""significantly undermine"" US interests? This seems to contemplate scenarios like: Critical national security projects where delay would be harmful, or perhaps Emergency healthcare or disaster response situations.”Document everything exhaustively. If as a sponsoring employer you are seeking an exception, assume you are making a case comparable to a National Interest Waiver, but with the added burden of proving the payment requirement itself causes harm,”added Khanna.Two lawsuits challenging the proclamation have already been filed in US federal courts, seeking to block implementation of Trump’s proclamation. Attorneys argue that the fee is punitive, bypasses congressional authority and violates administrative law. But for now, the clarification from USCIS is seen as a temporary balm, which has addressed some but not all concerns of American employers.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has clarified that the $100,000 ‘entry’ fee announced by President Donald Trump will not apply to individuals already in the United States.

When people think of the Burj Khalifa, they often imagine Dubai’s royal family or government behind its glittering success. But the man who truly owns and built this global icon is Mohamed Alabbar, a self-made Emirati entrepreneur and founder of Emaar Properties. From humble beginnings on Dubai Creek to leading one of the world’s most successful real-estate companies, Alabbar’s journey mirrors Dubai’s own transformation, ambitious, bold, and unstoppable.The journey to building the world’s tallest tower did not begin in a palace, but in a modest home. Mohamed Alabbar, born in 1956, grew up in Dubai's Rashidiya area as the eldest of 12 children; his father was a traditional trading vessel (dhow) captain. This humble background fueled his extraordinary drive and ambition.Alabbar’s formal education took him across the world. He graduated in 1981 from Seattle University in the United States, earning a degree in Business Administration, which laid the foundation for his future empire. Upon returning to the UAE, he quickly rose through the ranks, starting at the Central Bank before becoming the founding director general of Dubai's Department of Economic Development.It was during this time that he forged a crucial, career-defining relationship with Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Ruler of Dubai. Tasked with improving the Emirate’s tourism and global reputation, Alabbar used his close position as a chief economic adviser to help execute the vision of transforming Dubai into a global hub. In 1997, he founded Emaar Properties, the company that would ultimately deliver that vision.In 1997, Alabbar founded Emaar Properties, with backing from Dubai’s leadership and a vision to create world-class urban spaces. The company soon became the crown jewel of Dubai’s real estate revolution, responsible for some of the city’s most famous landmarks:Emaar’s most iconic project, however, is the Burj Khalifa, which officially opened in 2010. Standing 828 meters tall, it remains the world’s tallest building, a global symbol of innovation, ambition, and design excellence.The inspiration behind the Burj Khalifa was more than a desire to build tall — it was about symbolism and ambition. In the early 2000s, as Dubai transitioned from an oil-based economy to tourism and services, Alabbar wanted a landmark that would announce the city’s arrival on the world stage. He envisioned a building that could rival New York, Shanghai, and London — a project that would place Dubai at the center of the global map.Architecturally, the design was inspired by the Hymenocallis flower, native to the Arabian desert, whose geometric symmetry influenced the tower’s Y-shaped base. The structure was engineered by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the same firm behind Chicago’s Willis Tower, combining Islamic design elements with cutting-edge technology. Alabbar described the Burj Khalifa as “a statement of the region’s confidence and its future” — a monument representing Dubai’s openness, multicultural energy, and limitless possibility.In short, the Burj Khalifa was born from an idea of identity: to show what Dubai could achieve through vision, collaboration, and courageDespite popular belief, the Burj Khalifa is not owned by the UAE government or any royal. It is owned by Emaar Properties, the publicly traded company founded and chaired by Mohamed Alabbar. As Emaar’s founder and key shareholder, Alabbar oversaw every stage of the project from design approvals to navigating the 2008 global financial crisis that nearly halted construction.The tower’s name honors Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the late President of the UAE, in recognition of Abu Dhabi’s financial support during the crisis. Alabbar’s influence extends well beyond real estate. He has built a global business portfolio that reflects Dubai’s diversification:Through these ventures, Alabbar continues to strategically modernize Middle Eastern entrepreneurship, combining innovation, digitalization, and sustainable development. Today, the Burj Khalifa stands tall at 828 meters, housing luxury residences, corporate offices, and the world-famous At.mosphere restaurant, a living testament to Alabbar’s remarkable vision.","Mohamed Alabbar is a self-made Emirati entrepreneur and founder of Emaar Properties.

Delhi’s Air Quality Deteriorates Sharply to ‘Red Zone’ as Diwali Fireworks Trigger Severe Pollution

AQI past 350, no GRAP-III yet





NEW DELHI: Widespread bursting of firecrackers beyond the time window permitted by Supreme Court on Diwali night drove Delhi’s air quality deeper into the ‘very poor’ category on Tuesday.The surge of toxic smoke, laden with pollutants and heavy metals, caused the city’s average hourly PM2.5 levels to touch 675 micrograms/cubic metre at midnight, the highest since 2021 for Diwali night, when it had stood at 728.However, a rise in wind speed from 6am onwards and above-normal temperatures, along with negligible impact of stubble burning, prevented a further spike in pollution during the day.Delhi’s 24-hour average AQI on Diwali day stood at 345 in the ‘very poor’ category at 4pm — the highest Diwali day reading since 2021, when it had reached 382. On Tuesday, it had risen marginally to 351 — higher than last year’s post-Diwali reading of 339 (on Nov 1) but lower than the level recorded in 2023 (358).The worst post-Diwali air quality on record was in 2021, when the AQI spiked to 462 (‘severe’) on Nov 5.After a gap of five years, the Supreme Court had allowed the bursting of green crackers, which release 30% less particulate matter than conventional crackers, from 6am to 7am and 8pm to 10pm on Oct 19 and 20, respectively.However, crackers were burst till well past midnight, with people also opting for conventional crackers due to their easy availability. A sharp rise in PM2.5 levels across several stations in the city within a gap of a few hours shows that the crackers were used.Delhi Pollution Control Commission’s real-time air quality data showed that the hourly PM2.5 concentration at Nehru Nagar in Lajpat Nagar rose from 679 micrograms per cubic metre at 9pm to 1,763 micrograms per cubic metre at 10pm on Monday. Several stations recorded a similar spike within a matter of a few hours. The AQI remained in the higher end of the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ category in some parts of the city.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said Delhi-NCR experienced the season’s first smog episode on Monday night due to the concentrated bursting of crackers.“Pollution levels have hit very poor to severe levels at this onset of the winter when it’s still much warmer. The particulate levels have increased steadily since early Oct. But on Oct 20, the levels increased by nearly eight times between afternoon and night, causing very high exposures. This has happened even when the contribution of farm fires was less than 1-2%,” said Roychowdhury. She added that the coming months will require much stronger systemic action to control emissions from sources and not just temporary emergency measures that have short-lived impacts.As winds remained calm during the night, it caused an accumulation of pollutants. However, winds picked up from 6am onwards, leading to dispersion. “The hourly particulate matter spiked from 9pm on Monday and saw an increasing trend until 5am on Tuesday and then a sharp decline as the sun came out,” said Gufran Beig, founder of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and chair professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS).According to the India Meteorological Department, the city witnessed shallow fog with visibility dipping to 600 metres at Palam between 3.30am and 5am on Tuesday as winds were calm. From 6am onwards, an average wind speed of up to 10kmph was recorded.Even though the city’s average AQI surpassed 350 on Tuesday, the Commission for Air Quality Management did not impose stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan. A CAQM source said, “Last year, Supreme Court directed that Stage III (Severe) of Grap be imposed at AQI levels above 350 and Stage IV (Severe Plus) when the AQI goes beyond 400. However, there are no such directions this time. So, we will use thresholds as per our schedule — triggering Stages III and IV at 400 and 450, respectively. ”The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi (EWS), which functions under the Union ministry of earth sciences, initially predicted that AQI would touch ‘severe’ on Tuesday and Wednesday. In its updated bulletin on Tuesday, EWS said AQI is likely to remain in the ‘very poor’ category from Wednesday till Friday.","The surge of toxic smoke caused the city’s average hourly PM2.5 levels to touch 675 micrograms/cubic metre at midnight.

Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week, marking the latest restructuring at the startup since Mark Zuckerberg's Meta invested $14.3 billion in the company in June. The shuttered team, known internally as the NPO or New Projects Organization, had over a dozen members who focused on generalist tasks such as improving the writing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.Scale AI attributed the cuts to an industry shift toward more technical, expert-level training work, according to Business Insider. As AI chatbots improve, they increasingly require input from humans with specialised skills in fields like medicine, robotics, and finance, rather than generalist contractors.“Scale wound down a small experimental onsite program in Dallas staffed by a contract workforce,” Scale AI spokesperson Natalia Montalvo said.“This reflects an industry shift toward higher skill, expert data work. It only affects a small fraction of our overall workforce and has no impact on customer delivery,” Montalvo was quoted as saying.Scale AI offered the laid-off workers four weeks of severance pay and healthcare coverage through October, according to an email from HireArt, a staffing agency used extensively by Scale AI.The recently terminated workers were also invited to join Scale's gig-work platform, Outlier, where thousands of freelancers help train AI models.“As you navigate this transition, we want to ensure you are aware of alternative opportunities,” the email stated.Montalvo added that Scale AI continues to expand expert-level programmes and that broader groups of contractors continue to work in Dallas.The Dallas layoffs represent the latest in a series of cuts at Scale AI since the Meta investment. xAI has also made similar moves to focus on specialised AI training, recently downsizing its team of generalist AI tutors in September.",Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week.

MacKenzie Scott’s philanthropic ventures





Focus on diversity and equity causes









MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos , has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the SEC filed Tuesday and dated September 30. Many of Scott’s recent philanthropic efforts have focused on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. First reported by Bloomberg, the filing shows that Scott now holds 81.1 million Amazon shares – down 58 million from a year earlier. This reduction occurred despite Amazon shares more than doubling since Scott's 2019 divorce from Bezos.The filing, however, does not specify whether the reduction in Amazon holdings resulted from share sales, donations, or a combination of both, the report said. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, Bezos retains voting authority over Scott's holdings and is required to disclose them annually.With an estimated net worth of $32 billion, Mackenzie Scott obtained most of her wealth following her 2019 divorce from Bezos and has pledged to give away the majority of it. After ending up with approximately 4% of the e-coomerce giant, Scott has given away $19 billion in gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits over the past five years.The median gift size of her thousands of donations since the divorce is roughly $5 million.As a part of Scott’s philanthropic efforts, one of her most recent donations includes a $42 million gift to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit expanding college access for low-income and largely non-white students.According to a report by Fortune, this followed a $70 million gift to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through the nonprofit UNCF. The program, launched in 2021, aims to help HBCUs close a funding gap compared to white or elite institutions and provide long-term financial stability for minority schools.Furthermore, over the years, Scott has donated to diverse causes including an $84 million gift to Girl Scouts, $20 million to Vermont's Champlain Housing Trust, $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, and $275 million to Planned Parenthood. She previously gave UNCF $10 million in the year 2020.","Mackenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion.

Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi





NEW DELHI: Google ’S decision to select Visakhapatnam for a $15 billion AI hub stirred political waters on Tuesday. The controversy gained a fresh twist with comments from Andhra Pradesh minister IT minister Nara Lokesh.Lokesh shared a screenshot of a TV report on the investment with a three-word caption, “He chose Bharat”.On Tuesday, AIA DMK leader RB Udayakumar also criticised the DMK government over the missed opportunity.

In addition to the hub, Google plans to establish subsea cable infrastructure in the city, integrating it into the company’s global network. Officials say the project will position Visakhapatnam as a key digital backbone for India and enhance the country’s technological ecosystem.At the MoU signing event, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu said, ""It is a very auspicious and happy day for me and all of us. First of all, I have to thank honourable prime minister, he has made it possible.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Who is Najah Al Masaeed?



How the Najah Al Masaeed $7 million scam unfolded?

“Justice for Najah” trends across the arab world

Financial scam trends in the MENA region

Jordanian authorities launch investigation





The Arab world was left stunned this week after Emirati-Jordanian poet and television personality Najah Al Masaeed revealed that she had fallen victim to a massive financial scam, losing what she described as a “very large sum” of money. In a tearful video shared across her social media accounts, Najah said she had been deceived by individuals she trusted deeply, describing the ordeal as a calculated act of fraud rather than a spontaneous theft. The revelation ignited a wave of support and outrage across the Middle East, with fans, journalists, and fellow artists calling for justice and stronger protections against organized scams targeting public figures.Born in Al Mafraq, Jordan, in 1977, Najah Al Masaeed became one of the most influential female voices in Arabic poetry. She gained fame for her emotionally charged verses and eloquent performances, earning admiration from the late King Hussein of Jordan, who offered her a scholarship after she recited a poem in his presence.Najah studied Sociology at Mutah University, becoming one of the few women of her generation to pursue higher education.Her boldness and intellect led her to become a prominent media presenter, poet, and cultural figure, later acquiring Emirati nationality in recognition of her artistic contributions.Over the years, she became a symbol of female empowerment in Arab arts, inspiring countless young women to pursue literature and public life without fear.In her emotional confession, Najah disclosed that she had been the victim of a well-planned fraud that cost her a staggering five million Jordanian dinars (approximately USD 7 million). Though she did not name the perpetrators, Najah made it clear that the scam was perpetrated by someone she personally trusted, likely linked to a business or investment venture “It’s not a small amount. I was deceived in a way that broke my heart and faith in people,” she said in a viral video.According to reports from Youm7 and Al-Mashhad, Najah has filed a formal complaint and initiated legal proceedings to recover her stolen funds. The case is currently being investigated by Jordanian authorities. Sources close to the poet indicated that the scheme involved false investment promises and manipulated documents, convincing Najah to transfer large sums over time.The case quickly became a social media storm, with hashtags like #JusticeForNajah, #NajahAlMasaeedScam, and #ArabCelebrityFraud trending across Jordan and the UAE. Prominent Arab influencers and writers publicly voiced support, urging authorities to hold the perpetrators accountable and applauding Najah for her transparency.According to recent reports from regional financial crime authorities and cybersecurity firms, financial scams targeting high-net-worth individuals and public figures in the MENA region have risen by over 25% in the past three years. In 2024 alone, the Jordanian Anti-Fraud Authority reported losses exceeding JD 120 million (approx. USD 170 million) due to investment, digital banking, and trust-based scams, while UAE authorities cited over AED 500 million in reported fraud cases, a significant portion involving celebrities or public personalities. Most scams involved real estate, online investments, and false consultancy schemes, with an average individual loss of JD 250,000–500,000. Najah Al Masaeed’s estimated loss of JD 5 million (USD 7 million) thus places her among the largest publicly reported cases of celebrity-targeted financial fraud in recent years, highlighting both the sophistication of modern scams and the vulnerability even high-profile figures face.According to early reports, the Jordanian Public Security Directorate has begun examining Najah’s complaint, focusing on banking transactions, digital communications, and contractual documents related to the alleged fraud. Legal analysts say the investigation may expand internationally if the suspects or funds are traced outside Jordan.Under Jordanian law, financial deception and breach of trust can carry severe penalties, including prison sentences and asset confiscation. If the suspects are found guilty, the court could order the restitution of Najah’s funds through asset recovery mechanisms. Najah’s lawyer, whose name has not been disclosed publicly, is reportedly working with financial crime experts to trace the missing money and identify all those involved.The Najah Al Masaeed fraud case combines heartbreak, betrayal, and courage in equal measure. It’s not just a story about losing millions, it's about how trust, money, and fame can collide in today’s interconnected world. Her emotional honesty has made people listen. Her next steps legally and personally could define not only her legacy, but how Arab media and public figures handle financial fraud and accountability in the digital age.","Emirati-Jordanian poet Najah Al Masaeed reveals she lost $7 million to a financial scam.
