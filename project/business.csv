NEW DELHI: As many as 650 weapons were surrendered in Manipur over the past week in response to governor Ajay Bhalla ’s appeal for voluntary surrender of all illegal weapons , including those looted from armouries in the wake of outbreak of ethnic violence in May 2023. This has raised hopes that Manipuri people may be more receptive to the appeal, particularly in view of peace having sustained in the state over the past few months, unbroken even by the exit of N Biren Singh government and imposition of President’s rule.It is this hope that prompted Bhalla to extend the deadline for the voluntary surrender of looted and other weapons to March 6. The extension came ahead of a detailed review of the situation in Manipur by home minister Amit Shah here on Saturday, where Bhalla, heads of various security forces deployed in the state and the state police chief will be present.The strategy that appears to have worked this time with the rebels — who were cold to previous appeals to turn in the looted weapons — is the government’s outreach to village heads and civil society leaders across Manipur to echo Bhalla’s appeal to their respective communities and warn them of the consequences of ignoring it. The ‘consequences’, which will kick in after the deadline is past, include police/security raids in their villages and tough, criminal action against any youth/rebel still in possession of looted or illegal weapons.“Right now there is assurance that the youths will not be penalised if they surrender the ill-gotten weapons. Besides, the option given to them to hand over their weapons to the village head or community leader, rather than going directly to the police, ensures that they don’t get identified by the police and face possible action or profiling at a later stage,” a senior Manipur govt officer told TOI.As many as 6,020 arms were looted after ethnic clashes broke out in Manipur in 2023. While nearly 3,900 weapons have been recovered by the police and other security forces so far in raids and searches, these also include sophisticated arms that the Manipuri insurgents had from before.Surrenders of looted arms in Manipur have been negligible but for the past one week, with people belonging to Valley areas not confident of turning in the weapons they had looted to purportedly defend themselves against ethnic violence by the 'armed' members of the rival community. The fact that the suspension of operations (SOO) pact between the govt and Kuki-Zo insurgent groups, which allows the latter to retain their weapons with certain conditions, has not been renewed, only added to the rival community’s reluctance to let go of their weapons.","As many as 650 weapons were surrendered in Manipur over the past week in response to governor Ajay Bhalla ’s appeal for voluntary surrender of all illegal weapons.

High courts can stay discharge orders only in rare cases: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-courts-can-stay-discharge-orders-only-in-rare-cases-sc/articleshow/118639888.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Observing that staying a trial court's reasoned order to discharge an accused in a criminal case resulted in curtailing the liberty granted to him, Supreme Court on Friday said high courts should stay an order only in rare and exceptional cases when the discharge order prima facie looked ""perverse"".A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said a discharged accused stood on a higher pedestal than an accused who was acquitted after a full trial as discharge order was passed at the threshold when no incriminating material was found against the person. It said staying of discharge order in such cases resulted in the person becoming an accused again.""An order staying the order of discharge is a very drastic order which has the effect of curtailing or taking away the liberty granted to the accused by the discharge order. As a result of the order staying the order of discharge, the order of discharge ceases to operate, and the sessions court can proceed to frame charges against the accused and try him further. Thus, the stay of the discharge order has a grave consequence of depriving an accused of the liberty granted under the discharge order,"" the bench said.The court set aside Delhi high court 's order which had stayed a discharge order without hearing the accused. SC agreed with senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who, appearing for the petitioner, said the consequence of the stay order was that trial would proceed against the petitioner even though he stood discharged.""It is only in rare and exceptional cases, where the order of discharge is ex-facie perverse, that the revisional court can take the extreme step of staying that order. However, such an order should be passed only after giving an opportunity of being heard to the accused. Moreover, while granting the stay, the court must mould the relief so that the trial does not proceed against the discharged accused,"" the bench said.""When a revision application challenging the order of discharge is admitted for hearing, the high court may exercise power under Section 390 by directing the person discharged to appear before the trial court and by directing the trial court to admit him to bail on appropriate terms and conditions. If such an order is passed after the admission of the revision application against the order of discharge, it is a sufficient safeguard for ensuring the presence of the discharged accused at the time of hearing of the revision application and for undergoing trial, if the order of discharge is set aside,"" it added.",Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said a discharged accused stood on a higher pedestal than an accused who was acquitted after a full trial.

SEBI appoints Finance Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey as new chairman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-private-sector-experiment-finance-secretary-tuhin-kanta-pandey-named-sebi-chief/articleshow/118611693.cms,"Tuhin Kanta Pandey

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Government on Thursday named finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey as the new Sebi chairman , opting for a civil servant to once again lead the market regulator after current chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch , a former ICICI Bank executive, faced controversies, including allegations of conflict of interest. Buch's term ends on Friday.Pandey, who turns 60 in August, has been given a 3-year term at Sebi. This marks another instance of a serving bureaucrat being appointed to a regulatory post before retirement. Barring Puri Buch, the other 10 Sebi chiefs have either been IAS officers or have come from the public sector.Once Pandey takes charge, three of four financial regulators will be led by IAS officers, with pension regulator Dipak Mohanty (an ex-RBI executive director) being sole exception. The 1987-batch IAS officer has had a long stint in the finance ministry, having served as secretary in the department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) for five years.During that period, he was involved with privatisation of Air India and involved with several public issues by public sector companies, exposing him to stock markets. In Jan, weeks before the Budget, Pandey was moved to the revenue department.The soft-spoken officer, who hails from Punjab, holds a master’s degree in economics and had served as finance secretary in Odisha and was earlier in Planning Commission. He also holds an MBA from the University of Birmingham.Pandey is known to be a stickler for rules and has a very clean image. Not shy to speak his mind, he makes his point, without offending anyone. One of the first tasks before him would be to deal with staff challenges, which came to the fore during Puri Buch’s tenure, when Sebi employees held a demonstration at the agency’s BKS headquarters, in what was seen as a revolt against new HR policies. He has to restore the confidence among stakeholders that the Sebi chief is impartial.","Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey named new Sebi chairman.

She identified trade, technology and connectivity as other areas for taking India-EU ties to the next level, saying the relationship can become one of the defining partnerships of the century.Without specifically talking about US President Donald Trump or his trigger-happy treatment of allies, she also said both India and the EU stood to lose from a world of spheres of influence and isolationism, and gained from a world of cooperation and working together. ""Because we can offer each other distinctive alternatives and tools to make ourselves stronger, more secure and more sovereign in today's world. The kind of offer that cannot really be replicated by others,"" she said.On a new security and defence partnership with India, von der Leyen said this would help both sides step up work to counter common threats whether on cross-border terrorism , maritime security threats, cyber attacks or the new phenomenon: attacks on critical infrastructure.""There is a lot that we can build on. For instance, the recent collaboration on maritime security. And I am delighted at India's interest in joining defence industrial projects under the EU's Permanent Structured Cooperation. India is working hard to diversify its military supply and to access new capabilities. And I believe we can help each other to deliver on our security objectives,"" she said.Talking about the geopolitical and geoeconomic headwinds that both EU and India are confronted with, von der Leyen said the world had reached another inflection point.

Bihar assembly elections: Has Nitish Kumar lost his bargaining power?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-elections-has-nitish-kumar-lost-his-bargaining-power/articleshow/118633751.cms,"So, is there merit in opposition charge or can Nitish still dictate terms in alliance?

Can Nitish switch again?

Has the BJP has made another flip-flop difficult for Nitish?

NEW DELHI: Has Nitish Kumar lost the sheen and also the bargaining power that helped him dominate Bihar's political landscape for over two decades? The critics of Nitish Kumar say that the recent cabinet expansion, which saw 7 BJP MLAs join his ministry, is a clear indication of who is calling the shots in Bihar.The opposition in Bihar claims that the BJP has ""completely hijacked"" Nitish Kumar's JD(U) and is enjoying power by using the chief minister as a mask.""People should look into the background as to how many cases are against those who have been inducted into Bihar cabinet. This is the last cabinet expansion of the CM (Nitish Kumar). NDA will be finished in 2025. The CM is not able to be at the post. He is tired. He has been losing his credibility. The people of Bihar don't want a Khatara Gaadi (outdated vehicle) but a newer one,"" leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav said.""It was not a cabinet expansion of Bihar but of the BJP. JD(U) has been completely hijacked. The BJP wants to finish the JD(U). Many of the leaders are there in JD(U), but their hearts are with the BJP. The BJP wants to be a dominant force here, but their dream will remain a mere dream,"" the RJD leader added.Another strong critic of Nitish Kumar, former election strategist Prashant Kishor who has floated his own outfit Jan Suraaj Party, also lambasted the BJP for ""enjoying power while using Nitish Kumar as a mask."" The former JD(U) national vice-president claimed that ""loot of public money and assuaging some estranged castes"" were the intentions behind the cabinet expansion ""with hardly six months left for polls"".Both the BJP and the JD(U), two key constituents of ruling NDA, strongly rejected opposition's charge and launched a counterattack.The Janata Dal (United) said that the RJD (Rashtriya Janata Dal) will get so few seats in the Bihar assembly elections that its leader Tejashwi Yadav will not even get the status of leader of opposition. JD(U) national spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan Prasad said the RJD rule under Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi had left Bihar in dire straits and it was Nitish Kumar who worked to improve its condition on every development metrics.The JD(U) leader alleged that the people of Bihar still ""shudder"" thinking of the ""jungle raaj"" of the RJD rule, when numerous caste massacres occurred, and people were killed in broad daylight and were abducted for ransom.Union minister and BJP MP Giriraj Singh also attacked Tejashwi Yadav and said that ""choron ko sab najar aate hain chor."" (Thieves see everyone as thieves). ""There is a proverb used in villages 'choron ko sab najar aate hain chor'. Since Lalu Yadav's government was a government of 'gangsters' and hence they see others with the same lens,"" the BJP MP said.In the 2020 assembly elections, Nitish Kumar was reduced to being the junior partner in NDA for the first time as the BJP got more seats than the JD(U). Interestingly, it was another NDA constituent, the Lok Janshakti Party of Chirag Paswan that played a key role in this change of power dynamics by strategically fielding candidates against JD(U) and ensuring division of votes. However, the BJP kept its pre-poll promise and formed a government under Nitish Kumar.But the change in number dynamics once again sowed the seeds of unease between the two long-term allies. Nitish once again jumped the NDA ship and joined hands with Lalu Prasad's RJD, only to return back to the NDA fold ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Well, Nitish Kumar, who has already made so many alliance flip-flops, can definetly decide for another switch. But the big question is will he dare to do that again? While anything is possible in politics, but with his credibility already under stake - a decision to change alliance ahead of assembly elections will be very difficult for Nitish. Another moot question is will Tejashwi be willing to take him back in Mahagathbandhan and under what conditions? In all his earlier tie-ups with RJD, Nitish was the undisputed leader and Tejashwi his deputy.The BJP has been very focussed on Bihar ahead of the year-end assembly elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made 8 MPs from the state Union ministers after winning the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Bihar has gained the most in the last two Union budgets - getting several projects and central doles. Prime Minister Modi held a mega rally in Bhagalpur earlier this month which was literally the launch of NDA's election campaign in the state. The Prime Minister made a strong farmers' outreach from Bihar disbursing close to Rs 23,000 crore to nearly 100 million beneficiaries of Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana across the country. With so much of largesse from the Centre, it will be difficult for Nitish to think of and justify any alliance switch to the people of the state.Nitish Kumar, who has had a dominating presence in the state, is perhaps passing through the toughest phase of his political career. Rumours around his health have not helped the matters. Little wonder, Prashant Kishor, friend-turned-bitter critic of Nitish Kumar has thrown an open dare at the Bihar chief minister . ""I challenge Nitish Kumar to spell out the names of ministers in the state cabinet without looking at a piece of paper. If he thus demonstrates his mental soundness, I would give up politics and start working for him,"" Kishor said attacking the JD(U) chief.Assembly elections in the state is still many months away and it will be interesting to see how Nitish adapts to the changed ground realities.","Opposition in Bihar claims that the BJP has ""completely hijacked"" Nitish Kumar's JD(U) Nitish once again jumped the NDA ship and joined hands with Lalu Prasad's RJD, only to return to the fold ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118634232,imgsize-974938,width-400,resizemode-4/118634232.jpg"

Above-normal heatwave days likely in March: IMD

NEW DELHI: The past month was the warmest Feb in India since record keeping commenced in the country in 1901 and the upcoming hot weather season (March-May) is likely to be warmer than normal in most parts of the country with a high number of heatwave days during the period, the IMD said on Friday.Both months of 2025 so far have figured among top three warmest on record, as Jan was the third warmest since 1901. Earlier, 2024 was declared the warmest year in records dating back to 1901.Back-to-back warm winter months and the forecast of above-normal heat in March may negatively impact winter crops such as wheat and rapeseed during their maturing phase. Forecast of higher-than-normal heatwave days may threaten the output in certain states where sowing was delayed.""Above-normal heatwave days are expected over Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, MP, Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and north Karnataka from March to May,"" said D S Pai, senior IMD scientist, while releasing the outlook for the hot weather season.India during February recorded 22.04 degree Celsius of mean temperature which was 1.34 degree C above normal. The month recorded the warmest minimum (night) temperature and the second warmest maximum (day) temperature since 1901.Among four homogeneous regions, this was the warmest-ever February in central India, the third-warmest in south India, fifth-warmest in northwest and ninth-warmest in east and northeast India. The mean temperature in central India was 24.6 degree C whereas it was 26.75 degree C in south India, 20.14 degree C in east & northeast India and 17.11 degree C during the month in northwest India.March is likely to be warmer too, with most parts of the country expecting above-normal temperatures both during the day and night. ""Monthly maximum (day) temperatures for March are likely to be above normal over most parts of India, except over some southernmost parts of peninsular India, where below normal maximum temperatures are likely,"" said the senior scientist.During March, above-normal heatwave days are likely over most parts of central India and adjoining northern parts of south peninsula and some areas of northwest and east India.Heatwaves pose significant risks to vulnerable populations, including the elderly, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, leading to heatstroke, dehydration, and strain on infrastructure.","India during February recorded 22.04 degree Celsius of mean temperature which was 1.34 degree C above normal.

NEW DELHI: In contrast to the general refrain that lawyers extract money from gullible clients ignorant about the legal processes, a private company successfully dodged payment of legal assistance fee to a lawyers' firm successfully by exploiting a little-known provision in Indian Partnership Act .'The Chennai Law Firm' had filed a suit against Reyvish Associates Pvt Ltd seeking recovery of over Rs 6.5 lakh legal fees due to it for legal assistance rendered to the company. A Chennai city civil court directed the company to pay up the money with 12% interest.The company challenged this order before the Chennai principal judge in the district court and argued that the law firm was an unregistered one and hence cannot file a recovery suit against any party. The principal judge accepted the argument, reversed the trial court decree and ordered that no suit could have been filed by the unregistered partnership firm of lawyers.Madras HC, refused to entertain an appeal by the law firm saying as the payment arose from a contract, the lawyers' firm could not have filed a suit because of the bar under Section 69(2) of Partnership Act, which provided that - ""No suit to enforce a right arising from a contract shall be instituted in any court by or on behalf of a firm against any third party unless the firm is registered and the persons suing are or have been shown in the register of firms as partners"".In the appeal before Supreme Court bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh, the law firm argued that the lawyer's fee is a statutory due and hence was recoverable through a suit. The bench disagreed. Justice Kant said, ""HC and the lower appellate court are right that you are an unregistered partnership firm, which does not have the right to recover dues by filing suits.

The group had harassed her to pay higher than stipulated wages and stopped others from working at the kiln, disregarding even a Kerala HC order restraining them from disrupting operations.The change came about on a day TOI reported how this six-year-old business started by Pushpakumari and her husband Thankappan, a retired employee of the state transport corporation, had been forced to submit to the old scourge of unionism in the Left-governed state.Forced to shut their kiln for two days following threats and unreasonable wage demands from headload workers owing allegiance to the CPM-affiliated CITU and Congress' trade union wing INTUC, the couple was contemplating winding up their business. ""Per the high court order, we will ensure protection to them if there is any law-and-order issue. We will not allow anybody to disrupt their business,"" said SI Harsha Kumar.Former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar was among those who criticised the Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF govt for failing to protect entrepreneurship.Pushpakumari said she and her husband would reopen their kiln now that police had come out to protect them. The entrepreneur said she had approached the high court after losing faith in police.

NEW DELHI: Himachal Pradesh leader of opposition Jairam Thakur hit out at the Congress government accusing it of pressuring temples under its control to contribute funds for the 'Sukh Ashray' scheme, a government welfare initiative.Taking to social media platform X, former CM Thakur claimed that 36 major temples managed by the state have been asked to provide financial assistance for running the scheme. He alleged that while the Sukhu-led government ""opposes Sanatana Dharma and makes anti-Hindu statements,"" it is now seeking temple funds to sustain its flagship program.In a video message, Thakur further alleged that district administrations were coercing temple trusts to transfer money to the government treasury. “A secretary in the Himachal Pradesh government has issued a letter to deputy commissioners, directing them to collect funds from temple trusts and deposit them in the treasury to finance government schemes. This is unprecedented and unacceptable,” he said.Thakur asserted that previous governments had only sought contributions from temples in times of natural disasters, but this move to divert funds for regular welfare programs was unprecedented. “They are not just requesting funds; they are actively following up and applying pressure. This decision must be opposed. Temple trusts and committees should resist this move,” he urged.The Sukh Ashray scheme aims to provide better opportunities for orphans, single and destitute women, and the elderly. In a letter dated January 29, the Art, Language, and Culture Department formally requested temple trusts to contribute to the Mukhya Mantri Sukh Ashray Yojna/Kosh and Mukhya Mantri Sukh Shiksha Yojna/Kosh as part of their charitable activities.Jairam Thakur vowed to strongly oppose the decision in the upcoming Vidhan Sabha session starting February 10 and beyond. “We will fight this both inside and outside the assembly,” he said, reiterating BJP’s stance against the move.Himachal Pradesh Congress chief Pratibha Singh responded to allegations by Jairam Thakur regarding the state government's request for funds from temples to finance the Sukh Ashray scheme.Singh said that the government was running the Sukh Ashray scheme to support the education of helpless children and to give them a better life. She further stated that the scheme was for a good cause.Speaking to ANI, Singh assured that the scheme's intent was noble, stating, ""Our government is running the Sukh-Aashray scheme for a good cause. This scheme was launched for the helpless children, to support their education and give them a better life...""She further said that the money was not just being used to run the finances of the temple and the government had called everyone to donate amount for the welfare of the children.""It is not only about temples. We are calling everyone who can to come and donate an amount for the welfare of the children. Organisations other than temples should also come forward and contribute to the good cause..."" she further stated.","Former Himachal Pradesh CM Jairam Thakur accuses Congress government of pressuring temples under its control to contribute funds for the 'Sukh Ashray' scheme.

DEHRADUN: The area near Mana village in Uttarakhand, where an avalanche struck the BRO workers' camp on Friday, burying at least 57 men - of which 22 are still missing - is considered one of the most avalanche-prone and high-risk zones in the state.Friday's avalanche hit a stretch of the national highway linking Mana to Ghastoli, a region classified as a high-risk avalanche zone. In fact, this is not the first time that Indian Army and BRO camps were hit by an avalanche in this region. In April 2021, a glacial burst-triggered avalanche struck Malari-Sumna area in Chamoli district, near the India-China border, killing at least 10 people. The victims were BRO workers engaged in construction activities.According to officials of the State Disaster Management Authority (USDMA), several avalanches were recorded in recent years across the state's higher reaches, including Gaumukh Glacier, Hemkund Sahib, Ghastoli, and the Kalindi-Badrinath track.According to USDMA, avalanches are common in the Himalayan region with altitudes over 3,500 metres and where the slope is generally more than 30 degrees. North-facing slopes are known to have avalanches in winter, whereas south-facing slopes usually get them during the springtime.Commenting on the avalanche risk in Uttarakhand, Piyoosh Rautela, former executive director of USDMA, said, ""Just like landslide-prone zones, avalanche-prone areas can also be mapped. Once identified, no camps or settlements should be established in these high-risk zones."" He further added, ""In most avalanche incidents, it is either tourists or workers operating in these regions who usually become the victims since almost all the inhabited villages in these high-altitude regions are migratory, with residents relocating to lower areas during winter.""","Avalanches are common in the Himalayan region with altitudes over 3,500 metres.

NEW DELHI: GNSS-based tolling on NHs won’t take off in the immediate future as senior government officials have told a Parliamentary panel that the new system will be deployed only after India has its own requisite constellation of navigational satellites with full coverage.Sources said that in response to a question on the new tolling mechanism, a top road transport ministry official told the parliamentary standing committee on transport and tourism headed by JD(U) MP Sanjay Jha on Thursday India’s own fully functional satellite navigation system and technology are necessary to protect the privacy of citizens and ensure security of data. The official added that government won’t use any foreign navigational system for this purpose.This comes even as road transport minister Nitin Gadkari has been maintaining that government would soon start the new toll collection system to do away with physical toll barriers and to bring relief to highway commuters. He has also said that the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) will ensure people pay for the exact distance travelled on a highway.GNSS is a network of satellites that provides positioning, navigation, and timing services. Though India has Navigation with India Constellation (NavIC) system, there have been issues. Unlike GPS or Galileo, NavIC is a regional navigation system, meaning its coverage is restricted to India and nearby regions.Sources told TOI that officials referred to the crashing of a plane last year for several reasons, including GNSS disruptions. They added that govt wants to ensure that the new tolling system uses India’s own navigation system.Meanwhile, the recommendation of a high-powered committee set up by the road transport and highways ministry on the roll out of GNSS-based tolling is awaited for preparing the roadmap.At present, the NHAI has started inviting tenders for the multi-lane free flow (MLFF) mechanism for toll collection. In MLFF tolling, there is no physical plaza as well. The tolling system consists of field equipment and sensors mounted on gantries, which capture information from passing vehicles.

Sanjay Bhandari wins appeal against extradition to India over risk of mistreatment at Tihar jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sanjay-bhandari-wins-appeal-against-extradition-to-india-over-risk-of-mistreatment-at-tihar-jail/articleshow/118637201.cms,"Sanjay Bhandari

LONDON: Defence middleman Sanjay Bhandari has won his appeal against extradition to India from London on the grounds that he would be at real risk of extortion, torture or violence in Tihar jail and at risk of a flagrant denial of justice at trial.Bhandari had appealed the Nov 7, 2022 decision of district judge Snow at Westminster magistrates’ court to allow his extradition to India on six grounds. A hearing took place in Dec 2024, and on Friday high court judges Lord Justice Holroyde and Mrs Justice Steyn handed down judgment allowing his appeal on two of those grounds, namely that his extradition would be a breach of article 3 (torture or inhuman treatment) and a breach of article 6 (the right to a fair trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), making it unlawful. They discharged him.The Indian govt has 14 days in which it can apply to get a point of law of general public importance certified by the high court and then apply for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. But this is rarely granted.Delhi was seeking to extradite Bhandari to face two charges: wilfully evading taxes by not declaring foreign assets and foreign income amounting to Rs 665 crore on his Indian tax return and money laundering.His undisclosed foreign assets include 19 foreign bank accounts, six companies and four properties in London and Dubai, the charges state.The judges dismissed an assurance from the Indian govt that Bhandari would only be interrogated in Tihar jail, saying that Bhandari would “ be at real risk of extortion, accompanied by threatened or actual violence, from other prisoners and/or prison officials. The nature of the allegations against him, and the publicity in relation to them in India, are such that he would be perceived to be a very rich man and therefore a prime target for extortion. In view of the extreme overcrowding and very significant level of understaffing in Tihar prison, it would be very difficult for even the most conscientious of prison officials to protect him from extortion and mistreatment at the hands of other prisoners, including gang members. Add to that the compelling evidence that incidents of prison officials, including senior officials, taking bribes, engaging in, and facilitating, extortion, occur all too commonly, it is clear that he would face a real risk of proscribed treatment.”They pointed out that Tillu Tajpuriya was murdered by other prisoners in Tihar jail on May 2, 2023, and Ankit Gujjar was killed on the night of August 3-4, 2021 allegedly by top jail officials.“The evidence is that the use of proscribed treatment to obtain confessions is commonplace and endemic,” the judges wrote. They blamed this on the “lack of will to stamp out the use of torture, reflected in the failure to ratify the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.”They also cited torture allegations made by British citizens Jagtar Singh Johal and Christian Michel. “It is apparent that the acceptance in India of torture or other serious mistreatment as a method of evidence-gathering extends beyond the police and investigating bodies, such that it is unlikely that Bhandari could look to prison officials for protection from the organisations that are engaged in investigating him,” they said.Because Bhandari would have to prove the attempt to evade tax was not wilful, rather than prosecuting authorities having to prove it was wilful, they said this was a flagrant denial of his rights under article 6, as it “fundamentally destroys the fairness of the prospective trial”.","Defence middleman Sanjay Bhandari has won his appeal against extradition to India from London.

Pope Francis, currently hospitalised with pneumonia, suffered a breathing crisis on Friday, causing him to vomit,. However, he was quickly administered oxygen and responded well to treatment, according to AFP report.The 88-year-old pontiff, who has been receiving treatment at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital for the past two weeks, experienced a bronchospasm episode that led to a sudden respiratory decline.""The Holy Father promptly underwent broncho-aspiration and began non-invasive mechanical ventilation, with a good response on gas exchange,"" the Vatican said in a statement.Despite the setback, Francis remained alert and cooperative throughout the ordeal, and doctors are closely monitoring his condition over the next 24 to 48 hours to assess any further deterioration, a Vatican source said.Pope’s condition remains serious but stableEarlier on Friday, Vatican insiders had suggested that Francis' condition was no longer critical, following gradual improvements. However, his medical team remains cautious, keeping his health status “reserved”, meaning no predictions can be made about his recovery.The pontiff, who had part of his lung removed as a young man, is prone to respiratory infections and has battled chronic bronchitis in recent years. His age and pre-existing respiratory condition mean that full recovery could take time, doctors warn.Despite his health struggles, Francis continues to work from his hospital suite, engaging in breathing exercises, resting, and praying.Resignation speculation growsThis fourth hospitalisation in his 12-year papacy—the longest so far—has reignited speculation about whether Francis might step down. With his packed schedule leading up to the Jubilee year celebrations, Vatican expert Marco Politi suggested that if the pope recovers, he may complete the Jubilee year but could then reconsider his position.Francis has previously stated that he is open to resigning, following in the footsteps of Pope Benedict XVI, who stepped down in 2013 due to health concerns. However, before his hospitalization, he repeatedly affirmed that he was not yet ready to retire—and may never be.For now, the focus remains on the pope’s recovery, as the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics await further updates on his health.","Pope Francis, currently hospitalised with pneumonia, suffered a breathing crisis on Friday, causing him to vomit.

After years of negotiations for an India-EU free trade agreement (FTA), PM Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen finally set a deadline - end of this year - for a balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial agreement, in a significant takeaway from the EU leader’s visit.Describing India-EU partnership as natural and organic - one that’s based on trust and shared democratic values - Modi announced both leaders asked their teams to finalise by the year end what would be, according to von der Leyen, the largest deal of its kind in the world. The leaders asked the officials to work as trusted partners to enhance market access and remove trade barriers, according to a joint statement.India and the EU will hold the 10th round of FTA negotiations in March since the talks were relaunched in 2021. Agreeing that meeting the deadline won’t be easy, von der Leyen said timing and determination matters. EU officials reiterated after the meeting that they will continue to seek reduction of tariffs by India on wines and cars, without which the agreement won’t be possible, but said that commitment matters at the political level.Modi also said that to strengthen the investment framework, the leaders discussed progress on the ongoing discussions for an Investment Protection and GI (Geographical Indications) Agreement this year. They agreed to take concrete steps to carry forward the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor initiative, with Modi saying it will drive global commerce, sustainable growth and prosperity in the future.While there was talk about enhancing cooperation in AI, semiconductors and space, both leaders also focused on peace and security in the Indo-Pacific, agreeing to work for inclusive development in third countries in the region. In a joint statement, they reaffirmed their commitment to promote a free, open, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific built on international law and mutual respect for sovereignty. Modi welcomed the EU joining the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI).In her media statement, the president also said that her visit was taking place at a time the 7 planets in the solar system had come into perfect alignment. “They say this signals transformation and growth.

The EU side also welcomed India’s interest in joining projects under the EU’s Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and in negotiating a Security of Information Agreement (SoIA). Citing threats from authoritarian states, von der Leyen said that now is the time to step up security and defence cooperation on land, at sea and in space and have more joint exercises in the Indian Ocean.The leaders also committed to exploring a formal security and defence partnership. “They reiterated their commitment to international peace and security, including maritime security by tackling traditional and non-traditional threats to safeguard trade & sea lanes of communication,’’ said the statement.Modi said that the leaders have prepared a blueprint for collaboration in the areas of trade, technology, investment, innovation, green growth, security, skilling and mobility.“Our growing cooperation on issues related to Defence and Security, is a symbol of our mutual trust. We will take forward our cooperation on Cyber Security, Maritime Security and Counter Terrorism,’’ said the PM, adding a bold and ambitious roadmap will be launched at the India-EU summit later this year. The leader stressed in the joint statement the need for stronger international cooperation to combat terrorism, including cross-border terrorism and terrorism financing in a comprehensive and sustained manner.","PM Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen finally set a deadline - end of this year - for a balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial agreement.

February this year was warmest since record keeping commenced in 1901: IMD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/february-this-year-was-warmest-since-record-keeping-commenced-in-1901-imd/articleshow/118633962.cms,"February 2025 experienced the highest temperatures since 1901, with IMD predicting March to May will also be unusually warm, impacting crops in India. Most regions anticipate above-normal heatwave days, posing risks to vulnerable populations, especially the elderly and children.

NEW DELHI: This year's February was the warmest February in India since record keeping commenced in the country in 1901 and the upcoming hot weather season during March-May in most parts of the country is likely to be warmer with reporting of more number of heatwave days during the period, the IMD said on Friday.It was the second consecutive month of the year that figured among the top three in record terms as Jan 2025 was the third warmest Jan since 1901.Back-to-back warmer months and the prediction of above-normal temperature in March may negatively impact winter-sown crops such as wheat and rapeseed during their maturing phase. Forecast of more heatwave days may threaten the output in certain states where sowing was delayed.“Above-normal heatwave days are expected over Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and northern parts of Karnataka during March to May,” said D S Pai, a senior scientist at IMD, while releasing the temperature/ rainfall outlook for hot weather season.India during Feb recorded 22.04 degree Celsius of mean temperature which was 1.34 degree C above normal. The month recorded the warmest minimum (night) temperature and the second warmest maximum (day) temperature since 1901.Among four homogeneous regions, Feb 2025 was the warmest Feb in central India as well whereas it was third warmest Feb in south peninsular India, fifth warmest in northwest and ninth warmest in east & northeast India. Mean temperature in central India was 24.6 degree C whereas it was 26.75 degree C in peninsular India, 20.14 degree C in east & northeast India and 17.11 degree C during the month in northwest India.March is going to be warmer too with most parts of the country expecting above-normal temperatures both during the day and night. “Monthly maximum (day) temperatures for March are likely to be above normal over most parts of India, except over some southernmost parts of peninsular India, where below normal maximum temperatures are likely,” said Pai.During March, above-normal heatwave days are likely over most parts of central India and adjoining northern parts of south peninsula and some areas of northwest and east India.Heatwaves pose significant risks to vulnerable populations, including the elderly, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, leading to heatstroke, dehydration, and strain on infrastructure.","India during Feb recorded 22.04 degree Celsius of mean temperature which was 1.34 degree C above normal.

MK Stalin: Not Hindi Centre's real aim is to spread Sanskrit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-hindi-centres-real-aim-is-to-spread-sanskrit-says-stalin/articleshow/118612142.cms,"Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin Thursday alleged that attempts by BJP-led Centre to impose Hindi were only a facade and that the real intention was to spread Sanskrit.In his third letter to DMK cadres hitting out at Centre for its alleged plans to impose Hindi, Stalin contended that wherever a three-language formula was adopted, Hindi-Sanskrit had taken precedence. If TN too adopts such a formula, it will end up advancing BJP's Sanskritisation agenda, Stalin alleged.According to him, over 25 languages like Maithili, Braj, Bundelkhandi, Bhojpuri, Avadhi, Kannauji, Garhwali, Kumaoni spoken in various north Indian states were destroyed by Hindi-Sanskrit. Since Tamil fought against direct invasion, BJP wants to impose Hindi-Sanskrit through NEP, he claimed. ""Neither Hindi nor Sanskrit can ever destroy the greatness of Tamil. Fascists have always targeted a people's language and culture to erase their identity,"" Stalin said. He said the fact that Tamil survived without being corrupted by north Indian languages makes it a thorn in the flesh for those in power, forcing them to change their tack.Stalin said Sec 4.17 of NEP clearly promoted Sanskrit at all education levels, relegating Tamil and other languages to secondary status. Only in Sec 4.18, Tamil is mentioned. ""Even that says languages, including Tamil, shall be taught only in addition to Sanskrit.""""Push for a monolithic Hindi identity is what kills ancient mother tongues. UP and Bihar were never just 'Hindi heartlands'. Their real languages are now relics of the past,"" Stalin said.","Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin claims attempts by Centre to impose Hindi were only a facade.

'I am a born Hindu': Shivakumar's response to critics in party. Should Congress be worried?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-am-a-born-hindu-shivakumars-response-to-critics-in-party-should-congress-be-worried/articleshow/118608323.cms,"Shivakumar vs Siddaramiah in Karnataka

Why should the Congress be worried?

NEW DELHI: Is the Congress staring at a crisis in yet another party-ruled state? Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar 's holy dip at the Maha Kumbh and his visit to Sadhguru 's ashram for Mahashivratri celebrations, where home minister Amit Shah was also present, have raised the hackles of some Congress leaders triggering a row that may leave the grand-old-party worried.Shivakumar has reacted strongly to criticism over his ""spiritual"" pursuits from a section of the party - with one senior leader invoking Rahul Gandhi's name to attack the Karnataka Congress leader.In a hard-hitting post on X, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary PV Mohan targeted Shivakumar's Coimbatore visit and wrote: ""Thanking for an invitation from someone who mocks RG (Rahul Gandhi), the hope of the nation & aligns with RSS's narratives, while serving as a president of a secular party, it misleads party workers. It is conviction rather than compromise (that) ensures the party's growth. Otherwise, it damages the core.""When asked about objections to his visit from within the party, a combative Shivakumar said: ""I am a Hindu. I am a born Hindu and I will die as a Hindu but I love and respect all religions. Our Congress president's name is Mallikarjun Kharge . Who is Mallikarjuna? It's Shiva only. Should he change his name?""""Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev of Isha Foundation came and invited me (for Shivaratri celebrations in Coimbatore). He is from Mysuru. He is a great man and I admire his knowledge and stature but there are many who criticise him,"" he said.The Karnataka deputy chief minister also had good things to say about the Maha Kumbh organised by the Yogi Adityanath government.""My experience regarding Maha Kumbh was very good. I appreciated the way they organised it. It is not a small job. There might be some problems here and there. Trains may have caused problems. I don't like to find faults. It is very satisfactory,"" Shivakumar said.Earlier, responding to allegations of cozying up to the BJP, Shivakumar had called it a conspiracy against him and had invoked Sonia Gandhi to silence his critics.""The Congress party has the doctrine of taking everyone together. Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru and Indira Gandhi have done the same. I have seen Sonia Gandhi celebrating the Ugadi festival. She has adopted Indianity rather than us. We have such leadership,"" he said countering criticism.In 2023 Shivakumar had lost out to Siddaramaiah for the chief minister's post in a very tight race after Congress's emphatic victory in Karnataka assembly elections. After days of persuasion, he settled for the post of deputy CM while retaining the position of state president. At that time there were reports of a power-sharing agreement under which Shivakumar would have got the top post after two and a half years. However, there was no official confirmation of this.While Shivakumar's supporters have made regular claims about the rotational CM deal, the Karnataka Congress strongman has backed Siddaramaiah to the hilt, especially when the chief minister faced all-round attack over the MUDA land scam. But the fact remains that Shivakumar was a strong claimant for the top post and would want some assurance from the party leadership on it going forward.The Congress did well in the bypolls held last year winning all the three seats where elections were held. Recently the Karnataka Congress president held a meeting with those candidates who had lost the last elections to prepare a blueprint for their victory in 2028. This was perhaps a clear indication of his desire to lead the party in the next elections.It is in this context that Shivakumar's spiritual pursuits could be a message to the party leadership.The Congress has already suffered in several states due to leadership tussle and has even lost its governments.In Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia campaigned vigorously for the Congress in the lead up to the Madhya Pradesh assembly polls in 2018. Following Congress's win, Kamal Nath was chosen as the chief minister. But Kamal Nath couldn't complete his five-year term and had to step down as the chief minister after Scindia and 22 Congress MLAs resigned from the assembly and moved to the BJP.In Haryana, Bhupinder Singh Hooda took complete control of the Congress campaign and in the process several senior leaders were sidelined. Kumari Selja, a prominent Dalit face of the party, objected to this dominance and stayed away for most part of the campaign.In Rajasthan, bittter leadership tussle between Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot made headlines for long. Gehlot refused to accommodate Sachin and his supporters. Eventually, Pilot revolted against Gehlot and was on the verge of quitting the party. However, Priyanka Gandhi then intervened and persuaded him to stay back. The faction-ridden Congress eventually lost the assembly elections to the BJP.In Assam, having led the Congress's campaign successfully in 2011, Himanta wanted to be the chief minister. He was seen as the successor to then chief minister Tarun Gogoi. But then came Tarun Gogoi's son, Gaurav Gogoi, on the political scene disrupted the handing over of the baton.Himanta resigned from the Gogoi Cabinet in July 2014, citing ""family-centric"" politics. He joined the BJP and campaigned for the party for the 2016 assembly polls. The BJP came to power in Assam that year and Sarbananda Sonowal was made the chief minister. Five years later, in 2021 when BJP won again, Himanta was made the chief minister.Clearly, the Congress would not want another state to slip away from its hands because of leadership tussle. While Shivakumar may have needed the support of 113 MLAs to become the chief minister in 224-member assembly, he will need the backing of far less number of MLAs to destabilise the Siddaramaiah government.", DK Shivakumar's holy dip at the Maha Kumbh and his visit to Sadhguru's ashram for Mahashivratri celebrations have raised the hackles of some Congress leaders. One senior leader invoked Rahul Gandhi's name to attack the Karnataka Congress leader.

Osamu Nishimura loses his year-long battle against esophageal cancer





Osamu Nishimura , one of the most prolific wrestlers from the Japanese wrestling community has passed away at the age of 53. Nishimura had been suffering from esophageal cancer since last year and lost his battle to the vicious disease this year. He leaves behind his wife and 6-year-old son. Nishimura was best known for his time in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and MUGA World Pro Wrestling (MUGA).Osamu Nishimura's cancer diagnosis came late, and in March 2024, when he was diagnosed, he already had stage four esophageal cancer. He had already had a cancer scare back in 1998 when Nishimura was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his retroperitoneal space. He used natural remedies and alternative treatments to fight the cancer and was declared cancer-free two years later, in 2000.Unfortunately for him, this time the battle was already half-lost by the time he came to know about it. The cancer had already spread to his lymph nodes by the time of diagnosis. The entire upper left side of his body, except his head, had been affected. He even underwent a craniotomy to help with his battle, but nothing seemed to be of any help by the end.But cancer did not mean he left his wrestling days behind. His last match was in December 2024, after his diagnosis, where he teamed up with Katsushi Takemura and Shinya Aoki against Atsushi Onita, Mammoth Sasaki, and Raijin Yaguchi. Now less than a year after the diagnosis, Nishimura passed away after losing his battle against cancer.It was announced earlier today, on Feb 28, that Osamu Nishimura had passed away. He was 53 at the time of his death. WWE star Shinsuke Nakamura also posted a condolence message after the passing of Nishimura. Other than wrestling, he was also a representative of the Tokyo Bunkyo Ward Assembly and served as a food education instructor. He was re-elected to a fourth term in 2023 and served as a councilor until he died in 2025.Also Read: Expected Timeline for WWE Veteran Randy Orton’s Return From Hiatus Revealed",Osamu Nishimura had been suffering from esophageal cancer since last year and lost his battle to the vicious disease this year.

Sidney Crosby trade talk: Brian Hayes suggests summer move over deadline deal

Could Crosby have a change of heart before the trade deadline?

Speculation is growing about Sidney Crosby possibly leaving the Penguins to join the Avalanche and reunite with Nathan MacKinnon . TSN analysts Carlo Colaiacovo and Bryan Hayes fueled the discussion after Crosby played alongside MacKinnon at the 4 Nations Face-Off.During a TSN Hockey segment, analyst Carlo Colaiacovo asked insider Bryan Hayes whether Sidney Crosby might reconsider his future with the Pittsburgh Penguins after playing alongside Nathan MacKinnon at the 4 Nations Face-Off.Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon, both former No. 1 picks from Nova Scotia, share a close bond and have showcased strong on-ice chemistry. While Crosby has been a lifelong Penguin, speculation grows about whether he might one day reunite with MacKinnon in the NHL.""I'm, I'm not sure it happens before the trade deadline,"" Hayes said on TSN's OverDrive. ""It feels like an off season move, or sit right like now, if he's gonna eventually conclude.""Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon, both from Nova Scotia, have a well-known friendship, and their on-ice chemistry has often led to speculation about a potential team-up in the NHL.Nathan MacKinnon recently secured his long-term future with the Avalanche by signing an eight-year, $100.8 million contract, making him one of the highest-paid players in the league. With a strong core that includes defenseman Cale Makar, the Avalanche are considered top Stanley Cup contenders, and adding Crosby would only increase their chances of success.Talking about winning with Nathan MacKinnon in the 4 Nations Face-Off, Hayes mentioned that if Crosby contemplates a trade, he would prefer it to be handled discreetly and swiftly.""That's the thing. And... if you're gonna get to that conclusion, do it as quickly as you can,"" Hayes said. ""Yes, like, if it's in the back of your mind that you kind of realize, all right, I don't think I can finish this dance. It's gonna get worse before it gets better. And that's likely what's gonna happen in Pittsburgh.""Also Read: NHL Score: Nathan MacKinnon led the Avalanche past Devils in a 5-1 win with two goals While the thought of Sidney Crosby teaming up with MacKinnon in Colorado is exciting, his deep commitment to the Penguins makes a trade seem unlikely.

Veteran presence and contract stability make Brayden Schenn a trade candidate

TSN analyst Mike Johnson recently discussed Brayden Schenn’s trade value on First Up with Korolnek & Colaiacovo, as the St. Louis Blues captain ’s name has come up in trade talks ahead of the March 7 NHL trade deadline . Schenn, known for his leadership and two-way play, has drawn interest from teams looking to bolster their center depth for a playoff push.Brayden Schenn has been a consistent performer for the St. Louis Blues since 2017 and played a key role in their 2019 Stanley Cup win. TSN analyst Mike Johnson noted that long-term contracts like Schenn’s are seen as beneficial since they provide cost stability as the salary cap rises, making him an attractive option for contending teams.“One of the things we’re realizing about Brayden Schenn — and really about players with term in general — is that term is no longer a negative,"" Johnson said on Thursday. ""It’s actually a positive because it gives teams control. The cap is going up, but their salary stays the same, making them more affordable as time goes on.""Brayden Schenn’s long-term contract makes him a compelling trade target, as it offers cost stability with the rising salary cap. However, his $6.5 million cap hit through 2027-28 poses a challenge for teams like the Maple Leafs, who may need salary retention from the Blues or a third-party team to facilitate a trade.""Schenn has a couple of years left on his deal, so acquiring him wouldn’t just be a short-term move,"" Johnson said. ""Losing a young player like Fraser Minten would be tough, though. Prospects and entry-level contracts are crucial, especially for top teams that rely on young guys to support their core. But I think you have to consider it.""Also Read: “Try to correct it”: NHL Insider reveals bold prediction for J.T. Miller’s future with the Rangers as trade deadline approaches St. Louis is expected to demand a first-round pick and a top prospect for Brayden Schenn, which could be difficult for Toronto given their limited draft assets. His full no-trade clause adds another complication, though his past connection with Leafs coach Craig Berube could influence a deal. If acquiring Schenn proves too challenging, the Leafs may consider other options like Scott Laughton. However, Schenn’s leadership and playoff experience make him a valuable but costly trade target.","Brayden Schenn has been a consistent performer for the St. Louis Blues since 2017 and played a key role in their 2019 Stanley Cup win.

Nvidia: How almost $600 billion wipe out in Nvidia market value has been proved Wrong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-almost-600-billion-wipe-out-in-nvidia-market-value-has-been-proved-wrong/articleshow/118604904.cms,"Nvidia's meteoric rise



Remember Mayhem Monday in January 2025, when the biggest AI success story $595 billion vanished from Nvidia’s market value wealth in just minutes. The almost $600 billion wipeout in Nvidia's wealth happened on the day frenzy over DeepSeek sent shockwaves in US and European stock markets. Other than Nvidia, other technology stocks including Google, Apple and Microsoft too lost billions. The launch and popularity of low-cost AI models from China's DeepSeek rattled the technology industry. However, no company was as badly hit as Nvidia.Now it seems that the Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang correctly said that the market hugely over reacted. For, Nvidia has reported a record-breaking fourth quarter for fiscal year 2025, with revenue reaching $39.3 billion, a 78% increase from the same period last year, and net income rising 80% to $22.1 billion. The company's data center revenue nearly doubled, contributing significantly to these results.At the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the ""extraordinary"" demand for Nvidia's latest Blackwell AI chips, which generated $11 billion in revenue this quarter. Despite concerns last month over Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's advancements, Huang emphasized that reasoning models like DeepSeek's R1 require substantially more computing power, potentially up to 100 times more, underscoring the continued demand for Nvidia's high-performance chips.Looking ahead, Nvidia projects first-quarter revenue of approximately $43 billion, indicating sustained growth in the AI chip market. “We will grow strongly in 2025,” CEO Huang asserted at the earnings call.Over the last two years, Nvidia, the poster child of the AI boom, has grown into the second-largest company on Wall Street. While Magnificent Seven stocks added roughly $11 trillion in market capitalization between the debut of ChatGPT in November 2022 and their combined peak in mid-December 2024, with Nvidia adding $2.7 trillion in market value, making it the world's second-most valuable company at $3.2 trillion. Nvidia's stock has surged around 1,800% in the last five years. Magnificent Seven stocks on average more than tripled in that time, while the benchmark S&P 500 has gained about 65%.","$595 billion vanished from Nvidia’s market value wealth in just minutes.

Jimmy Butler is in some hot waters with his Miami stay



Jimmy Butler is making good play as the newest member of the Golden State Warriors



Jimmy Butler might be having a pretty good time after joining the Golden State Warriors , but his professional life is not reflecting on the personal front. Butler is being sued by a South Florida company over a luxury home that he had leased during his tenure with the Miami Heat . Allegedly, there was property damage, as well as multiple other issues, leading to the athlete getting sued for $257,282 in total.Jimmy Butler is being sued by a company named Five Star Marketing and Promotions , according to a lawsuit filed on Feb 26. According to the lawsuit, Butler is being sued for staying in a home for an extra two months. His lease expired in August of 2024, which he signed in August 2022. As per the lease agreement, if the ex-Heat star stayed past the agreed term without written permission from the landlord, he would have to pay double the rent, which would amount to $130,000 per month.The lawsuit also states that Butler caused $125,000 in damages, including mold issues, damaged drywall, and flooring. His pool was not maintained properly, and the HVAC system was malfunctioning. He also allegedly changed the locks to the house, thus preventing the house owner from checking in on his property or having an inspection.Five Star Marketing and Promotions is suing Butler for a total of $257,282. The damage he caused to the property is worth $127,282, plus the two months’ rent that is due. Butler had paid a $130,000 security deposit, which Five Star said they were legally entitled to apply to his outstanding balance, and have not included in the number they are suing the athlete for.Earlier this month, Jimmy Butler was one of the names that was being linked to every possible team. Before the deadline, the Miami Heat finally traded him to the Warriors in a multi-team deal. And he is doing pretty well as the newest forward for the San Francisco team.Unlike his personal woes, his professional front is excelling, as the Warriors are on a 7-1 run since he joined. He has also become the first Warrior in franchise history to have 120+ Points, 30+ Rebounds and 30+ Assists through a player's first six games with the team. Hopefully, his excellence in his professional life can mirror his personal life, and the recent legal issues can be solved without much difficulty.Also Read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Golden State Warriors might bag $186 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form Big 3 with Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler","Jimmy Butler is being sued by a South Florida company over a luxury home that he had leased during his tenure with the Miami Heat.

Our hills are getting hot: Researchers warn of heatwaves in Tamil Nadu hill stations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/our-hills-are-getting-hot-researchers-warn-of-heatwaves-in-tamil-nadu-hill-stations/articleshow/118641042.cms,"Periyar University's research suggests that hill stations in Tamil Nadu, including Ooty and Kodaikanal, could face heatwaves due to global warming and local factors such as urbanisation and vehicle emissions.

Projections made by centre for climate change and disaster management, Periyar University

Escaping to a hill station may no longer be the best option for people in cities such as Chennai. Researchers at Periyar University forecast that places such as Ooty and Coonoor in Nilgiris district, Kodaikanal in Dindigul district, and Yercaud in Salem district may experience heatwaves lasting a few hours a day in the coming years, progressively worsening until the end of the century when they could persist for more than seven days a year due to global warming. Local factors including rapid urbanisation and vehicle emissions may also contribute to hotter days in these destinations.Mountainous regions have diverse microclimates due to rapid temperature and precipitation changes over short distances, supporting varied vegetation and wildlife, researchers said. Climate models show these areas are warming faster than the global average, requiring detailed study to understand global warming’s impact. “Our models projected higher variation in terms of temperature with higher elevation,” said R Jagannathan, Periyar University vicechancellor.Hotter days in hill stations are already here. On April 28, 2024, Ooty’s day temperature touched 29°C, the hottest in 73 years. IMD defines a heatwave at a hill station as a rise in day temperatures by 4.5°C-6.4°C or temperatures touching 30°C.At the university’s Centre for Climate Change and Disaster Management (CCCDRM), heatwave projections were generated using global climate models using projected maximum temperatures for the districts. Overall, TN is set to experience day temperatures reaching a maximum of 36.9°C, 2.36°C higher than the historical record.Many TN cities, including Chennai, are already experiencing urban heat islands due to expansion of urban areas and reduced vegetation in addition to global warming. Climate experts say northern districts such as Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Vellore, Chengelpet, and Ranipet may witness the maximum increase in temperatures by end of the century. This could be due to extension of the existing heatwave-prone region of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha.“The global average temperature has already exceeded pre-industrial era by more than 1.5°C. We are experiencing the heat island effect in core city areas across the country compared to industrial and suburban areas,” said P Thangavel, director, CCCDRM.Former IMD deputy director general Y E A Raj said in hill stations, temperatures could be higher in areas where there is increased development. “Vehicle exhaust is a major culprit in CO2 emissions. In hill stations, we are seeing an increase in vehicular traffic because people want a weekend getaway. Obviously, temperatures could get warmer during the weekends than on weekdays.”TN govt recently declared heatwave a state-specific disaster, enabling it to provide immediate relief to the affected. Forest department officials said the Tamil Nadu Urban Green Mission, Green Climate Company, and Tamil Nadu Wetlands Mission are initiatives taken in the state to handle the climate crisis.The average maximum temperature may touch 36.9°C in Tamil Nadu, 2.36°C higher than historical recordThe average minimum temperature may touch 25.7°C in Tamil Nadu, 4.4°C higher than historical normal minimum temperatureDistricts such as Ariyalur, Kallakurichi, Kancheepuram, Cuddalore, Ranipet, Tiruvallur, Tiruvannamali and Villupuram show huge rise in maximum temperaturesDelta region such as Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Thiruvarur as well as Chengalpet, Ramanathapuram, Tiruvallur and Trichy show rise in minimum temperatures","Researchers at Periyar University forecast that places such as Ooty and Coonoor in Nilgiris district, Kodaikanal in Dindigul district, and Yercaud in Salem district may experience heatwaves.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.
