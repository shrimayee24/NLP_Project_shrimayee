NEW DELHI: USAID did not provide funding of $21 million for voter turnout in India between 2014 and 2024, the US embassy has informed the Indian govt, according to a reply by ministry of external affairs in response to a Parliament question. US President Donald Trump had earlier questioned the alleged funding, saying he suspected ""they were trying to get someone else elected"".MoS for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said that on July 2, 2025, the US embassy shared data that, it said, covered USAID funding in India from 2014 to 2024, including details of implementing partners, objectives and key accomplishments of each activity undertaken.""The embassy also maintains that USAID/India did not receive or provide funding of $21 million for voter turnout in India from fiscal years 2014 to 2024, nor has it implemented any voter turnout-related activities in India,"" said the minister, in response to a written query in Rajya Sabha.""On July 29, 2025, the US embassy conveyed to MEA that it plans to bring all USAID operations to a close by Aug 15, 2025,"" he added. The MEA had earlier requested the embassy to urgently furnish details of expenditure incurred on all USAID-assisted/funded projects in India over the last 10 years (other than those being implemented under the seven partnership agreements with Indian govt).MEA also sought a list of NGOs/implementing partners through which such initiatives were executed.Trump had earlier accused USAID of working to effect a change of govt in India. Reports later suggested that the funding might have been meant for Bangladesh. ""Why do we need to spend $21 million on voter turnout in India? I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian govt... Because when we hear that Russia spent about $2,000 in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for $2,000. This is a total breakthrough,"" Trump had alleged.","USAID did not provide funding of $21 million for voter turnout in India between 2014 and 2024, the US embassy has informed the Indian govt.

Aadhaar curbs in Assam to check frauds by illegals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aadhaar-curbs-in-assam-to-check-frauds-by-illegals/articleshow/123441802.cms,"Himanta Biswa Sarma

GUWAHATI: The Assam cabinet approved Thursday a proposal to freeze issuance of Aadhaar to first-time adult applicants in the state from October 1 as part of a revised SOP meant to curb fraudulent enrolment, especially by suspected illegal immigrants.CM Himanta Biswa Sarma , who had announced in June that all new Aadhaar applications would need to be vetted by the district administrative heads, said citizens above 18 without the 12-digit unique identification number would get ""a final one-month window"" until Sept-end to apply for theirs.Applicants from the SC, ST and tea tribes will get an additional year to enrol for Aadhaar. After the general deadline ends, only deputy commissioners are authorised to approve enrolment in the ""rarest of rare cases"" based on reports from police, special branch and foreigners' tribunals.Sarma said Aadhaar coverage in Assam had exceeded the state's population at 103%. SC, ST and tea tribes are the exception, with 4% still unregistered.""We have taken this decision based on the surge of Bangladeshi immigrants caught entering the state illegally, especially over the past year. Just the other day, we pushed back seven of them,"" the chief minister said.""We aren't sure we have been able to catch all of them. So, we want to create a bulwark against people trying to enter Assam illegally, enrolling for Aadhaar and living as Indian nationals.We want to completely close that door.""Assam's Aadhaar policy is now the most restrictive in the country, driven by concerns over illegal immigration and demographic changes.

Poll Do you believe the recent bomb threats in Delhi schools are serious or just hoaxes? Serious threats Just hoaxes

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Delhi schools faced another wave of panic on Thursday after at least five institutions, including BGS International Public School in Dwarka Sector 5, reported receiving bomb threats.According to officials, Delhi Police and Fire Department teams rushed to the spots immediately, cordoning off the premises and launching thorough searches with bomb disposal squads, sniffer dogs and advanced detection equipment.Ambulances and fire tenders were stationed outside the schools as a precautionary measure.The fresh alerts come barely a day after over 60 schools in the capital received near-identical hoax threats that forced emergency evacuations and widespread checks.Officials said the latest threat emails bore a resemblance to Wednesday’s messages, which were traced to a sender using a VPN to mask identity.Police sources revealed that the original email, received late Tuesday night by over 380 IDs, had demanded $2,000 in cryptocurrency (Ethereum) and claimed bombs were planted across schools.The sender, identifying as “Terrorizers 111 group,” threatened to trigger high-yield explosives if the payment was not made.Investigators are working with the Cyber Crime Unit and intelligence agencies to track the origin of the threats. Authorities, however, stressed that all schools targeted so far have been declared safe.“Though these seem to be hoax threats, we cannot take chances when children’s safety is involved. All response protocols have been activated again today,” a senior police officer said.This marks the third major bomb scare in Delhi schools within a week, raising questions over cybersecurity and the psychological impact on students and parents.Earlier on Monday, similar threats were sent to around 32 schools, which were later confirmed to be hoaxes.","At least five schools in Delhi received bomb threats on Thursday.

First uncrewed Gaganyaan mission launch likely in December: Isro chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-uncrewed-gaganyaan-mission-launch-likely-in-december-isro-chief/articleshow/123441574.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI The first uncrewed mission of the Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme is ready to launch with a robot and the liftoff is expected in December, said Isro chairman V Narayanan here on Thursday.“The first uncrewed mission, G1, is going to lift off by this year's end, maybe close to December. And in that, the Vyommitra, the half-humanoid, is going to fly,” Narayanan said.Addressing the media in the presence of space minister Jitendra Singh and astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, the Isro chief lauded Shux for his successful mission to the International Space Station (ISS) — the first ever by an Indian. His experience of piloting the Axiom-4 mission is set to be crucial for the Gaganyaan mission Narayanan said SpaceX had probably taken “lightly” the liquid oxygen leak in the Falcon-9 rocket that launched the Axiom-4 mission to the ISS, putting at risk the lives of the four astronauts, including Shukla. “If with a crack the rocket lifts off, with the vibrations, it will give way the moment it lifts off. Once it gives way, it will be a catastrophic situation, nothing else,"" he said.Shux, who achieved the ISS feat on June 26, called it the “mission of an entire nation”.“I would like to thank every citizen of this country who behaved in a way that made it feel like they actually owned this mission. I truly felt that this was a mission for the entire nation,” he said. Shukla said being on the space station “is very different from what you learn on the ground. It was an unbelievable experience”.“We have been able to achieve all our technical objectives,” he said. ""We had seven different experiments to conduct, ranging from stem cell research to growing sprouts on the space station. Some of them started showing results while we were there. The results were very encouraging”.“Crew Dragon is one of the three vehicles that can currently take humans to space. We were also fortunate to have training on the Soyuz, which launches from Russia, besides Crew Dragon. The ISS, as you know, is an orbiting laboratory that has been operational since 2000. It has been conducting cutting-edge science and is a perfect example of international collaboration,” he added.Narayanan said Isro has had a lot of accomplishments in the last four months. “The entire Isro programme is the result of teamwork of 20,000 employees, 450 industrial partners and 300 academia partners. Today, we also have the Gaganyatris for our programmes”. Mentioning various Isro programmes, he said, ""There is telemedicine, tele-education, television broadcasting, and real-time connectivity for around 8,600 trains and 21,000 shipping vessels”.“A total of 13 out of 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals are being supported by Isro,” the Isro chairman said, while also listing the space agency’s other achievements like the Aditya L1 Sun mission and the NISAR mission. “We have made a major breakthrough in cryogenic engine technology. The tests are going very well, and a lot of indigenisation activities are progressing well. Coming to the Aditya L1, this year we have released 13 terabit data,” he said.“In two to three months, we are also going to launch a 6,500-kg communication satellite of the US, on our launch vehicle. To date, 433 satellites of 34 countries have been launched from India,"" Narayanan said.","The first uncrewed mission of the Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme is ready to launch with a robot.

SC: Should courts stay passive if governor fails to discharge duties?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-should-courts-stay-passive-if-governor-fails-to-discharge-duties/articleshow/123440843.cms,"Supreme Court

CJI calls for restraint, says judicial activism should not become judicial adventurism or judicial terrorism



NEW DELHI: The Centre on Thursday asserted that a governor's action on a bill passed by an assembly - withhold assent, return it to assembly or reserve it for President's consideration - is non-justiciable and the governor-state impasse over such issues must be resolved not in the Supreme Court but through the political mechanism, leading the apex court to ask should it remain passive if a governor fails to discharge his constitutional obligation.On the third day of the hearing, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar that there are hundreds of aspects that a governor examines while taking a decision on a bill and SC does not have the wherewithal to examine the validity of such considerations while arriving at a decision.This led the CJI to ask, ""If a governor does not do what the Constitution mandates him to do and sits over a bill without taking a decision for years, should courts be powerless to examine such inaction? What will happen to the federal democratic set-up? What happens to the will of the people? And, what does an elected govt in a state do?""Justices Kant and Narasimha, also part of the five-judge bench, said, “The court may not go into the aspect of why a governor takes a particular action on a bill. But if the governor does not take any action for a very long period, can the situation be remediless? If the aggrieved state moves SC, should it keep silent? There cannot be a vacuum in the Constitution.”Mehta said mere justification (on the grounds of a governor’s inaction) does not give jurisdiction to the court to tinker with the Constitution and amend its provisions to provide a timeframe for a governor to mandatorily act.“There had been such impasses between governors and states. They were resolved through political statesmanship of the CM concerned, the PM and the President. Solutions have been found in the political set-up. If a timeframe is required to be prescribed for a governor to act on a bill, Parliament will decide,” he said. “Every problem of the country need not have to be resolved by SC. The political set-up and heads of the other branches of governance are equally capable of resolving political issues through a collaborative exercise,” the SG said.The CJI asked, “If SC, as custodian of the Constitution, finds a constitutional functionary refusing to discharge his/her functions without valid reasons, should it be powerless to act?” He, however, also emphasized the need for judicial restraint. “Judicial activism should not become judicial adventurism or judicial terrorism. I have always said separation of powers must be respected,” Gavai said.Mehta said SC can interpret the Constitution and its provisions, but it cannot insert a timeline for governors to act on bills, which is impermissible given the rigid separation of powers between the legislature, executive and judiciary. He said the constitutional heads of each of the three organs must have deference to each other’s core constitutional functions. He asked, “If a trial in a criminal case is pending for decades and a person approaches the President saying justice has been denied to his son, should the President declare him innocent and end the trial? Can the legislature fix a timeline for the judiciary to complete a trial in a case?”“Whether the governor should grant assent, withhold, return the bill to assembly or reserve it for President’s consideration are all actions which are non-justiciable. There are no judicial standards by which the SC can test the validity of governor’s action on Bills. SC does not have the wherewithal to decide the validity of political decisions,” the SG said.Mehta said India follows the principle of constitutional supremacy and the supremacy is neither with the legislature, executive or judiciary, all three operating in distinct spheres governed by the principles of separation of power. “The National Judicial Appointments Commission was unanimously passed by Parliament and ratified by two-thirds of the state and yet it was struck down by SC terming the presence of a single member from the executive in the panel for selection of judges as an interference in judicial independence,” he said.Every organ has the freedom to operate independently in their respective core constitutional functions, Mehta said, adding that if the presence of one executive member was interference in judiciary, could SC have fixed a timeframe for a governor to take a decision on a bill when the Constitution was silent on it, he further argued. Mehta cited several provisions of the Constitution where the text provided for a time frame for taking action by constitutional authorities and concluded his arguments saying the silence of the Constitution on the deadline for a governor to take a call on legislations was deliberate and cannot be tinkered with by SC.","CJI calls for restraint, says judicial activism should not become judicial adventurism or judicial terrorism.

Foreign minister S Jaishankar Thursday defended India's energy imports from Russia, saying the US (former Biden administration) wanted India to do ""everything to stabilise the world energy markets, including buying oil from Russia"".After meeting his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow, Jaishankar said, ""Incidentally, we also buy oil from America and that amount has been increasing. So, quite honestly, we are very perplexed at the logic of this argument that is referred to"". He was replying to a question on President Trump slapping an additional 25% tariff on India, accusing it of profiteering from Russian oil and bankrolling Russia's war on Ukraine.Jaishankar pointed out that China, not India, is the biggest buyer of oil from Moscow. ""We aren't a country that has (had) the biggest trade surge with Russia after 2022 (start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict),"" he said.Jaishankar also called on President Vladimir Putin. ""Appreciate his sharing perspectives on the global situation and recent developments on Ukraine,"" he said on X, adding preparations for the Modi-Putin summit towards the end of the year are well underway.Jaishankar said he and Lavrov discussed possible outcomes from India-Russia annual summit that will have Putin visiting India towards the end of the year. “We’ve looked at energy, including not just fossil fuel energy but also nuclear energy where we have a very strong history of cooperation with Russia...very good discussions on fertilizer supply,” he said.Jaishankar and Lavrov discussed issues related to Ukraine war, West Asia and reform of global governance, while taking stock of bilateral relations. On terrorism, Jaishankar said he conveyed India’s strong resolve to adopt a zero-tolerance policy against terrorism and its sovereign right to defend citizens against cross-border terrorism.He also raised the issue of Indians serving in the Russian Army, expressing hope that the Russian side would expeditiously resolve these matters.“We believe relations between India and Russia have been among the steadiest of the major relationships in the world after the Second World War. Geo-political convergence, leadership contacts and popular sentiment remain its key drivers,” he said. “Our defence and military-technical cooperation also remains robust. Russia supports India’s Make in India goals, including through joint production and technology transfer,” Jaishankar said.On global and multilateral cooperation, both sides reaffirmed their shared commitment to reform of global governance. “We underlined the imperative to expand and energise the UN Security Council to reflect contemporary realities.

Scrutiny of cellphone records indicated that Andrabi had been in touch with terror operatives across the border.Andrabi’s counsel submitted that he was a political activist who had been falsely implicated after his release from preventive detention in 2019, and there was no direct evidence against him. Citing that he had been behind bars for around half a decade, the defence sought parity with co-accused persons who were granted bail.Representing NIA, the prosecution — deputy solicitor general of India Vishal Sharma, along with special public prosecutor Chandan Kumar Singh — opposed the bail petition, arguing that Andrabi was found to have direct links with Pakistan-based handlers of terror outfits such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen and was part of the narco-terror syndicate.Despite acknowledging that Andrabi had spent almost five years incarcerated, HC held that the seriousness of the charges and evidence on record outweighed his request for parole.

NEW DELHI: Exactly a month after he resigned, on the first day of the monsoon session of Parliament, Trinamool Congress raised the issue of former vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar’s disappearance from public life, and Communist Party of India wrote to Dhankhar expressing grave concern over his sudden resignation and his silence and withdrawal from the public domain since then.On Wednesday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had raised similar concerns as he asked, “where has the old VP gone?”As the Parliament session came to an end on Thursday, TMC’s Derek O’ Brien reflected on the state of affairs under the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre. “No byte, no video, no trace...,” he said referring to Dhankhar’s disappearance since Aug 21 evening, when he submitted his resignation, citing health reasons.The TMC leader also took a dig at BJP for failing to elect a party president yet. “No candidate, no face, no consensus....,” he said.Meanwhile, CPI MP and leader of the party in the Rajya Sabha, P Sandosh Kumar, in his letter to Dhankhar, said that his resignation a month ago, citing “health reasons,” came as a shock to Parliament and the entire country. “While differences during his tenure in the Chair were natural, the dignity of the office he held was always respected,” he said.What has caused greater anxiety, the letter noted, is Dhankhar’s complete absence from the public domain since his resignation. The CPI MP observed that Dhankhar has not addressed the press, nor appeared in public, with even his pre scheduled events being cancelled. “Such silence and withdrawal, after citing health reasons, has understandably created deep concern among fellow parliamentarians and citizens regarding his well-being,” Kumar said.The letter urged Dhankhar to respond and reassure Parliament and the public about his well-being at the earliest. Kumar said that while the process to elect his successor is already underway, clarity and reassurance from Dhankhar himself would help “dispel speculation, unease, and unanswered questions that continue to surround his unprecedented resignation”.","Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned on August 21, citing health reasons.

The Principal Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), New Delhi, has asked the Punjab government to respond on a plea filed by Shabri Prasad, daughter of Punjab cadre IPS officer Late R C Prasad, seeking payment of statutory interest on her delayed pension arrears.Shabri, an unmarried daughter of the 1976-batch Punjab cadre IPS officer who died in service in December 2003, has been a legitimate recipient of family pension under Rule 54 of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972. However, her pension was abruptly discontinued when she turned 25 years old, despite government orders clarifying that unmarried daughters above that age are eligible for continued family pension if they remain unmarried and dependent.Her pension was restored only in 2020 after she pursued repeated representations, following which she received arrears aggregating to Rs 43.61 lakh in three installments. However, the arrears were paid without the statutory interest mandated under Rule 65(2) of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, which requires payment of interest in cases of delay attributable to administrative lapses.The unpaid interest on delayed payments has been tentatively calculated at around Rs 43.21 lakh at 9 per cent per annum.In her plea before the principal bench of CAT, she has submitted that despite several representations — including letters dated September 2024 and emails to senior Punjab officials — no action was taken to release the interest component. The denial of statutory interest is in violation of Rule 65(2) of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, she has submitted before the tribunal.The matter was last heard on July 14, 2025, when the Tribunal fixed it for August 27 asking the Punjab government to respond.For Shabri Prasad, the matter is not merely financial but also symbolic of a long struggle against bureaucratic indifference. “My father served the Punjab Police with dedication.

‘Dissolve Lok Sabha Immediately’: INDIA Bloc Leaders Tear Into Election Commission At Joint Presser

NEW DELHI: In a twin blow, the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) on Wednesday issued a show cause notice to the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), asking it to disclose the source of funding for its studies on the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise and the Maharashtra Assembly polls.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Benin’s coastline, once part of the historic “Slave Coast,” was a major hub in the transatlantic slave trade. From 1580 to 1727, the Kingdom of Whydah, located along today’s Benin coast, exported over a million enslaved Africans to the Americas, including the U.S., the Caribbean, and Brazil.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Russell Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016. Attendees consisted of their closest family and friends, including Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony. Both Ciara and Russell Wilson know just how to keep the love alive.The power couple, Russell Wilson and Ciara has been married for nearly a decade now, but they have some rules and traditions that keep their relationship going strong.As the 2025-26 NFL season nears, the New York Giants made some big moves at the quarterback position this offseason.

China lifts rare earths export curbs: India’s electronics sector could benefit from relaxations – what industry experts have to say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/china-lifts-rare-earths-export-curbs-indias-electronics-sector-could-benefit-from-relaxations-what-industry-experts-have-to-say/articleshow/123444671.cms,"China eases Rare Earths curbs (AI-image)

The electronics sector, India's major Make-in-India achievement, could gain lasting global advantages due to a surprise backing from its strategic competitor, China.The Chinese government's decision to relax restrictions on rare earth metals and critical mineral exports addresses a significant supply constraint for electronic products, including electric vehicles , computers, mobile phones, gaming devices and display-based instruments, as industry leaders told Economic Times.The removal of import restrictions is expected to create additional prospects for advanced manufacturing and research activities in India, whilst helping to maintain stable costs.Also read: India to ease China business visa process- Top executives' applications from Vivo, Xiaomi and more likely to be approved; move amid improving ties Rare earth metals are essential components in manufacturing magnets for electronics, EVs, robotics and emerging technologies. Previously, India's electronics supply chain faced difficulties, with Foxconn's Hyderabad facility experiencing supply constraints for Apple AirPods production following initial restrictions.Subhrakant Panda, managing director, Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys, said, ""Industry will be relieved by China lifting its export curbs on rare earth elements and critical minerals. Moreover, it is a positive development which will aid in the normalisation of ties that are in mutual interest.""The recently improving relations between India and China will enhance Beijing's industrial and diplomatic position, according to Jason Oxman, President and CEO of Washington DC-based Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), in his statement to ET.""Whenever the US vacates policy space, China wins. Where Washington pulls back from trade agreements or imposes tariffs, Beijing steps in with offers of tariff-free trade. That is a long-term risk to U.S. competitiveness,"" he said.Indian electronics producers welcomed the announcement. Rajoo Goel, secretary general, Electronic Industries Association of India (ELCINA), told ET, ""The bigger hit was for Indian electronics companies in wearables and electric vehicles (EVs), which rely on rare earth magnets in larger quantities. We heard from companies such as Brandworks and boAt which faced difficulties due to shortages. EV makers were also impacted because rare earths are critical for motors and battery systems. However, I would add that while production slowed, no company had to completely shut down operations.""This brief disruption points to the necessity of self-sufficiency and strategic planning, he noted. ""Unlike China, India hasn't sufficiently invested in securing rare earth supply chains despite a decade of efforts to grow its electronics ecosystem. We need to anticipate such risks, prepare alternatives, and allocate resources for domestic exploration, research, and processing of these critical minerals,"" he said.Experts indicated that the disruption revealed India's susceptibility to global fluctuations in critical minerals and emphasised the urgency of establishing its own rare earth infrastructure.Abhishek Bhatia, managing director and partner, BCG India, told ET, ""Curbs on export on the select rare earth elements and related magnets from China to India presented significant production risks to industries like automotive, consumer electronics, and wind power, and any change in the current status will be a welcome relief to the industry.""China dominates the global rare earth value chain from extraction to oxide processing and downstream industries, representing over 90% of worldwide production across various applications including magnets, ceramics, catalysts and alloys, Bhatia elaborated. This is where India should actively be looking to build self-reliance through strategic acquisitions of assets globally via mechanisms like KABIL as well as encouraging the private sector to invest across the exploration, mining and downstream value chain,"" Bhatia said.KABIL, or Khanij Bidesh India Limited, combines three Indian public sector enterprises: NALCO, HCL, and MECL. It aims to ensure critical and strategic mineral supplies through overseas resource identification, exploration and acquisition. KABIL currently sources minerals including lithium and cobalt from Argentina and Australia.Industry experts suggest that consistent supply will enable Indian manufacturers to increase production, maintain stable raw material costs and plan long-term research investments.Discussing China's policy change implications, T Senthil Siva Subramanian, head, Institute Industry Interface Programme, Hindustan College of Science and Technology (Sharda Group of Institutions), Mathura, told ET, ""Lifting export curbs on rare earth metals, particularly Yttrium, will catalyse growth in India's opto-electronics ecosystem. As the global leader in yttrium production, China's policy shift opens new avenues and enormous opportunities for India to accelerate innovation in advanced plasmonic sensing technologies. ""He also detailed Yttrium's hydrogen-sensing capabilities for plasmonic hydrogen gas sensors, noting that with India's progress in indigenous chip design and fabrication, Yttrium-based Sensor Systems on Chip (YSoC) could represent a significant advancement.These sensors will support defence, space exploration and green energy initiatives, including the National Green Hydrogen Mission, Indian Semiconductor Mission, National Quantum Mission and National Manufacturing Mission. The availability of rare earths will also enable Indian MSMEs to conduct research, innovate and produce rare earth-based opto-electronic chips, advancing domestic capabilities.","China relaxes restrictions on rare earth metals and critical mineral exports.

Seattle Kraken’s interest in Marco Rossi could involve Jared McCann trade package

Marco Rossi’s uncertain future with Minnesota Wild also draws interest from Vancouver Canucks

The Seattle Kraken could be exploring a major roster move, as a new report suggests the team has shown interest in acquiring Minnesota Wild center Marco Rossi. The 23-year-old forward remains at odds with the Wild in contract negotiations despite coming off a breakout 24-goal, 60-point season. With Rossi’s future uncertain, both the Kraken and Vancouver Canucks have emerged as potential suitors in what could become one of the offseason’s biggest storylines.The report, from RG, links Seattle to ongoing discussions surrounding Rossi, noting that while the exact offer is unclear, Jared McCann could be involved as a potential centerpiece. McCann, the Kraken’s leading scorer and a consistent producer, is entering the fourth year of a five-year, $5 million deal. Though Seattle is not actively shopping him, his age, contract value, and scoring ability make him an attractive piece for Minnesota.Rossi, drafted ninth overall in 2020, has made it his mission this offseason to add weight and strength to counter perceptions that his 5-foot-9 frame limits his durability. His proven scoring touch and two-way instincts have already made him one of the Wild’s most promising young players, but his stalled contract talks leave open the possibility of a trade.The Vancouver Canucks are also said to be monitoring Rossi’s situation, though his price tag remains unclear. For the Kraken, a deal involving McCann would be bold but could create an exciting one-two punch down the middle with Matty Beniers and Rossi leading the offense. Seattle already boasts a pool of young centers, including Shane Wright, but Rossi offers a more proven scoring profile at his age.From the Wild’s perspective, general manager Bill Guerin could still commit to Rossi long-term, ending the speculation. However, the chance to acquire a reliable scorer like McCann, who also brings positional versatility, may hold some appeal if negotiations continue to stall.Marco Rossi’s contract impasse has quickly become one of the NHL’s most intriguing offseason storylines, drawing interest from both the Seattle Kraken and Vancouver Canucks.

MUMBAI: Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told TOI. She was airlifted from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday and is under the care of doctor Farokh Udwadia.Simone, 95, is battling symptoms of Parkinson's, the same illness that her stepson and former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata passed away from last October. ""She and Noel arrived in Mumbai from Dubai on a medical plane at Terminal 8,"" sources said.Simone is most famous for turning the Lakmé cosmetic brand into a household name in India. The name Lakmé comes from the French word for Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, in Hindu mythology. The Tata Group was urged by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to launch a makeup brand as Indian women were spending valuable foreign reserves on Western makeup brands. Lakmé was established by the Tata Group in 1952.Originally from Geneva, Switzerland, Simone first visited India as a tourist in the summer of 1953 at age 23. During her visit, she met Naval Tata, who was 26 years her senior and divorced from his first wife Soonoo.They fell in love, got married in 1955, and she decided to make Mumbai her permanent home.In 1996, the Tata Group sold Lakmé to Hindustan Unilever as part of a restructuring strategy. Simone used the proceeds to create Westside, a popular department store. She managed the Tata Group's consumer-facing businesses including Lakme and Trent (which owns Westside and Star India Bazaar stores) for over four decades until her retirement in 2006. She also served on the board of Tata Industries, an investment company within the group.After her retirement, Simone made fewer public appearances. She was last seen at Ratan Tata's funeral in Oct 2024. Following his passing, her son Noel took over his position at Tata Trusts, the driving force behind the $180-billion Tata Group.","Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition.

A call for guardrails and awareness



As part of a new revelation about AI, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’. For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a recent interview, Suleyman explained AI psychosis as a “real and emerging risk” which can easily affect vulnerable individuals who become deeply immersed in conversations with AI agents. The condition will mainly affect the individuals whose interactions blur the line between human and machine.As per the Microsoft AI CEO, AI psychosis is a state of mind in which individuals start to anthropomorphize AI, attributing emotions, intentions, or consciousness to systems that are fundamentally non-human. ""It disconnects people from reality, fraying fragile social bonds and structures, distorting pressing moral priorities,"" he said.The condition can lead to delusional thinking here individuals feel that AI is sentiment or has some personal relationships with them. Along with this, it can also cause emotional dependency to users who are either isolated or mentally fragile. Lastly, AI psychosis can also lead to distorted perception of reality as users rely a lot of AI for validation, companionship and also decision-making.Suleyman also stressed on that fact that while AI can be helpful and engaging but it is definitely not a substitute for human or clinical support.As per Business Insider, Suleyman also has asked the tech industry to take this risk quite seriously and also help in implementing some ethical guardrails, which include:* Clear disclaimers about AI’s limitations* Monitoring for signs of unhealthy usage patterns* Collaboration with mental health professionals to study and mitigate risksAlong with this, Suleyman also urged the regulators and educators to raise public awareness as AI is slowly becoming more embedded in the daily life in the form of personal assistant and therapeutic chatbots.""AI companions are a completely new category, and we urgently need to start talking about the guardrails we put in place to protect people and ensure this amazing technology can do its job of delivering immense value to the world,"" Suleyman added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’ For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems.

Unconventional leadership and office creativity

Monthly “work church” meetings with grammar lessons

Other companies embracing unconventional office setups



A billionaire breaking the mold

Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company, yet she has never taken a single share for personal use. Instead, she has committed to giving away nearly all her wealth to philanthropic causes, signing Bill Gates’ Giving Pledge in 2015 to donate 99% of her fortune. Beyond finances, Faulkner has created a corporate culture that values creativity, curiosity, and learning. From whimsical themed office buildings to innovative company-wide gatherings, she proves that leadership and generosity can coexist, while setting an example for other business leaders that success can be measured not only in profits but also in positive impact on employees and society.Faulkner, together with her husband, launched Roots & Wings to provide grants to nonprofits dedicated to improving the health, education, and well-being of children and families. Since its inception, the foundation has grown into a major philanthropic vehicle: in 2020, it granted $15 million to 115 organizations, and by 2024, it projected $67 million in grants to 305 nonprofits nationwide. Faulkner intends to steadily expand giving, aiming to distribute $100 million annually by 2027. To responsibly manage the sale of her non-voting Epic shares without destabilizing the company, she established a trust that governs these transactions. This careful planning ensures that her philanthropic mission can continue without affecting Epic’s stability or long-term growth.Epic Systems’ 1,670-acre campus in Wisconsin is far from a conventional office environment. Its 28 buildings feature fantastical themes ranging from Harry Potter and Alice in Wonderland to The Wizard of Oz, organized into mini-campuses such as Prairie Campus, Wizards Academy, and Storybook Campus. Inside, employees help source artwork and whimsical installations, including chocolate chip trails leading to a mock chocolate factory, hanging bridges to treehouses, and magical sculptures scattered across the grounds. This imaginative setting reflects Faulkner’s philosophy that creativity, play, and aesthetic engagement foster learning and productivity, making the workplace not just a location for tasks but a space for inspiration and collaboration.Once a month, Epic employees gather in the underground auditorium called Deep Space for a mandatory meeting affectionately nicknamed “work church.” These gatherings cover essential business news, company updates, and operational targets. Yet Faulkner adds unique elements that transform standard corporate meetings into engaging learning experiences. For instance, she incorporates grammar lessons, teaching employees proper usage of words such as “who” and “whom,” and emphasizing communication skills alongside company strategy. By blending education with corporate updates, these meetings reinforce a culture of continuous learning, intellectual curiosity, and attention to detail, encouraging employees to grow professionally and personally within the company. Her story demonstrates that visionary leadership can redefine both corporate culture and philanthropy on a global scale.Epic Systems is part of a broader trend of companies reimagining office culture to enhance employee engagement. Wellstar Health System, for example, offers wellness rooms with massage chairs, calming music, and healthy snacks, resulting in a 10% drop in employee turnover in 2024. Nonprofit Understood designs offices specifically for neurodivergent employees, with adjustable lighting, temperature zones, and assistive listening systems to support diverse needs. Even CEOs like Jeff Bezos favor “messy meetings” over rehearsed discussions to stimulate open debate and creativity. These examples show that unconventional setups, when thoughtfully implemented, can increase productivity, employee satisfaction, and innovation across industries.While many billionaires sign high-profile pledges without fully following through, Faulkner stands apart as a rare example of commitment and action. By giving away nearly all her wealth through philanthropy, cultivating a creative and educational workplace, and fostering employee engagement through unconventional office design and corporate rituals, she sets a benchmark for responsible, visionary leadership. Her approach demonstrates that a CEO can combine financial success, ethical responsibility, and innovation to create a lasting impact—not just on a company’s bottom line, but on the lives of employees, communities, and society at large. Faulkner’s legacy shows that generosity and innovation are not mutually exclusive but can reinforce each other. Her model inspires future leaders to pursue business success with purpose, creativity, and a commitment to societal well-being.","Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company.

OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar reveals future plans: Company will build trillion-dollar data centers and sell AI infrastructure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-cfo-sarah-friar-reveals-future-plans-company-will-build-trillion-dollar-data-centers-and-sell-ai-infrastructure/articleshow/123426669.cms,"OpenAI tackles surging AI demands





Trillion-dollar data centers to power the AI future

OpenAI eyes AI infrastructure as a service

Financial growth and innovative funding

OpenAI is gearing up for a bold expansion, with Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar revealing ambitious plans for the company’s future. According to Friar, OpenAI intends to invest heavily in trillion-dollar-scale data centers to meet the surging demand for artificial intelligence computation. Beyond supporting its own AI models like ChatGPT-5, the company is considering selling AI infrastructure services to other businesses, creating a new revenue stream. These moves reflect OpenAI’s strategy to control both the technology and physical resources driving AI innovation, while exploring financing avenues for large-scale growth.OpenAI faces unprecedented pressure to scale its computational resources. Friar highlighted that the company is “constantly under compute,” pointing to the skyrocketing demand for GPUs, AI-optimized chips, and high-performance servers. Partnerships with Microsoft, Oracle, and Coreweave are helping to secure the required hardware, while the company’s internal Stargate initiative focuses on building massive, AI-optimized data centers both in the U.S. and internationally. These efforts aim to keep OpenAI at the forefront of AI development, supporting not only ChatGPT-5 but also enterprise applications, developer workloads, and next-generation AI experiments that require vast computational power.CEO Sam Altman has indicated that OpenAI may spend trillions of dollars on constructing and optimizing data centers in the near future. These facilities are designed to efficiently handle enormous AI workloads, increase model training speeds, and reduce latency for enterprise and consumer applications. Beyond raw computing, these data centers also represent a strategic asset, giving OpenAI control over the underlying infrastructure that powers its AI models. By owning and optimizing its own facilities rather than relying solely on third-party providers, OpenAI can maintain a competitive edge and protect proprietary innovations.Friar revealed that OpenAI is considering renting out its AI infrastructure to other businesses, inspired by Amazon Web Services’ cloud model. While the company is currently focused on securing resources for its own operations, this potential business line could create a major new revenue stream in the future. Friar emphasized the importance of retaining control over intellectual property, stating that relying too heavily on external vendors allows competitors to learn from OpenAI’s infrastructure design. By offering AI-as-a-service, OpenAI could help other companies tap into cutting-edge AI capabilities while monetizing its massive investment in data centers.OpenAI recently achieved its first $1 billion revenue month in July 2025, with projections to triple revenue to $12.7 billion for the year. Paid ChatGPT subscriptions, particularly following the launch of ChatGPT-5, have driven enterprise and developer adoption. To support its infrastructure ambitions, OpenAI is exploring novel financing approaches, including debt financing with banks and private equity, as well as potential stock sales for employees and early investors. Friar also hinted at a future IPO, signaling that the company is preparing for broader access to capital to fund its ambitious plans.Friar urged companies aiming to remain competitive in AI to focus on automating real-world tasks and solving meaningful, high-impact problems. She stressed the importance of securing access to unique datasets, since more than 90% of the world’s data is locked behind universities, corporations, and other institutions. Firms that can harness exclusive information while efficiently deploying AI solutions will likely dominate the emerging market, mirroring OpenAI’s own strategy of combining technological innovation with control over infrastructure and data.","OpenAI is gearing up for a bold expansion, with Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar revealing ambitious plans for the company’s future.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

NEW DELHI: The FBI, in collaboration with Indian law enforcement agencies, has arrested suspect named Cindy Rodriguez Singh who was on US' top-10 wanted list. Accused of killing her son (6), Singh had fled to India in 2023.FBI director Kash Patel posted on X about the breakthrough. ""FBI has arrested another Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitive: Cindy Rodriguez Singh. This is the 4th ""10 Most Wanted"" fugitive arrested in the last 7 months. Thanks to our local partners in Texas, where this case originated, @TheJusticeDept, as well as partners in India for coordination"".

Born in Dallas, Texas, Singh has ties to India and Mexico. According to the FBI, Singh's younger son, Noel Alvarez, had disappeared in Oct 2022.""On March 20, 2023, at the request of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, Everman Police Department officers conducted a welfare check on behalf of the boy.During the interview, Singh lied to officers when she explained that the boy was living with his biological father in Mexico and had been there since Nov 2022,"" the FBI said.It came to the fore later that Singh had applied for passports for all of her children except Noel in Nov 2022.On Mar 22, 2023, Rodriguez Singh, her husband, and six other children, boarded an international flight bound for India.

Supreme Court greenlights Donald Trump’s NIH cuts: Impacts $783 million in DEI grants; critics raise alarm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sc-greenlights-trumps-nih-cuts-impacts-783m-in-dei-grants-critics-raise-alarm/articleshow/123441448.cms,"Supreme court (AP)





The US Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with slashing $783 million in research grants awarded by the national institutes of health (NIH), lifting a lower court’s block on the move. The grants were originally aligned with federal diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, reported news agency AP.The 5-4 decision marks a significant development in a broader legal battle over federal funding priorities. While allowing the past cuts to stand, the apex court has continued to block the administration’s guidance on future research grants.The conservative majority, including Justice Neil Gorsuch, found that the dispute over the NIH cuts belonged in the federal claims court, in line with an earlier ruling on teacher-training programme funding. “All these interventions should have been unnecessary,” Gorsuch noted in his opinion, as quoted by the agency.Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court’s three liberal justices in dissent. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a detailed dissent, wrote: “A half paragraph of reasoning (issued without full briefing or any oral argument) thus suffices here to partially sustain the government’s abrupt cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars allocated to support life-saving biomedical research.”The cuts are part of an estimated $12 billion worth of NIH research funding halted under the Trump administration’s review of federal DEI spending. Sixteen Democratic attorneys general and several public-health advocacy groups, who challenged the move, argued that such cancellations disrupt scientific research and threaten public health.“Halting studies midway can also ruin the data already collected and ultimately harm the country’s potential for scientific breakthroughs by disrupting scientists’ work in the middle of their careers,” the plaintiffs argued, according to the report.Earlier in June, US district judge William Young had blocked the funding cuts, calling them “arbitrary and discriminatory.” At a hearing, he remarked: “I’ve never seen government racial discrimination like this... Have we no shame.”The Trump administration, represented by solicitor general D John Sauer, maintained that funding decisions are executive functions and should not be “subject to judicial second-guessing,” arguing that DEI programmes can “conceal insidious racial discrimination.”The case continues to unfold in lower courts even as the Supreme Court’s interim order enables the administration to move ahead with rolling back funding for multiple research programmes.","The US Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with slashing $783 million in research grants awarded by the national institutes of health.

Heatwave states at risk in US: Areas facing dangerously high temperatures this week



Health risks and recent fatalities due to the heatwave: Who is most vulnerable

Advisories and warnings for extreme heatwave: Government actions and alerts

Safety tips during the heatwave: How residents can stay protected





A dangerous heatwave is set to scorch the US Southwest this week, affecting over 80 million people, with triple-digit temperatures expected to persist through the weekend. Cities such as Phoenix may reach 112°F (44.4°C), Las Vegas 110°F (43.3°C), and Death Valley a blistering 120°F (48.8°C). The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued extreme heat warnings and advisories across California, Nevada, Arizona, and surrounding states. Experts warn that vulnerable populations—including the elderly, children, outdoor workers, and those with health conditions—face serious risks. Authorities urge residents to stay hydrated, limit outdoor activity, and follow safety protocols to prevent heat-related illnesses.The extreme heatwave is primarily impacting the Desert Southwest, including Arizona, California, Nevada, and parts of Utah and New Mexico. Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and Death Valley are forecasted to experience some of the highest temperatures, reaching or exceeding 110°F. These conditions are fueled by a strong ridge of high pressure over the Four Corners region, causing warm air to descend and persist throughout the week.The intense heat is expected to continue through the weekend, with nights remaining unusually warm and limiting recovery from daytime temperatures.Heat poses severe threats to human health, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children, and outdoor workers. Maricopa County, Arizona, recently reported 44 heat-related deaths. Symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke include dizziness, nausea, rapid heartbeat, and confusion. Authorities urge residents to seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms occur and to check on neighbours who may be at higher risk. Prolonged exposure can also exacerbate chronic health conditions, making caution and preventative measures critical.The NWS has issued extreme heat warnings and advisories across affected states, with many remaining in effect through the weekend. California and Nevada have red flag warnings in some areas due to increased wildfire risks. Local governments have activated cooling centers in major cities such as Los Angeles to help residents cope with the dangerous conditions. Authorities recommend monitoring official updates, as alerts may change rapidly depending on local temperatures, wildfire developments, and regional humidity levels.Residents are advised to stay indoors during peak heat hours, wear lightweight and loose-fitting clothing, and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid strenuous outdoor activities during midday, and use air conditioning when possible. Checking on elderly neighbours, children, and outdoor workers is strongly recommended. Additionally, monitoring local news and NWS updates can help residents stay informed about changing weather conditions. Using sun protection such as hats and sunscreen, and ensuring pets have access to shade and water, are also critical steps to prevent heat-related emergencies.","The extreme heatwave is primarily impacting the Desert Southwest, including Arizona, California, Nevada, and parts of Utah and New Mexico.

'Laundromat for Kremlin': Trump aide Peter Navarro says Modi is a great leader; 'India doesn't need Russian oil',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/laundromat-for-kremlin-trump-aide-peter-navarro-says-modi-is-a-great-leader-india-doesnt-need-russian-oil/articleshow/123440776.cms,"White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the road to peace runs through New Delhi.





White House trade adviser Peter Navarro accused India of being a ""laundromat for the Kremlin"" and said New Delhi does not need oil from Russia. ""India doesn't appear to want to recognize its role in the bloodshed. It simply doesn't. It's cozying up to Xi Jinping,"" he said, adding that India doesn't need the oil from Russia. ""It's a refining profiteering scheme. It's a laundromat for the Kremlin. That's the reality of that,"" Navarro said.""I love India. Look, Modi is a great leader. But, please, please, India, look at what your role here is in the global economy. What you're doing right now is not creating peace, it's perpetuating the war,"" Navarro said.""When you think about the tariffs we are putting in place -- 25% because they cheat us on trade, 25% because of the Russian oil, I ask you what is the net impact on Americans? "" Navarro said.""They have higher tariffs, Maharaja tariffs, higher non-tariff barriers. We run a massive trade deficit with them, so that hurts American workers, hurts American businesses. Then they use the money they get from us when they sell us stuff to buy Russian oil, which is processed by refiners, and they make a bunch of money there.But then the Russians use that money to build more arms and kill Ukrainians, and so American taxpayers have to provide more military aid to the Ukrainians,"" the trade adviser said.""That's insane. And President Trump sees that chessboard beautifully, and you guys need to write about that. That's what going on here.
