"R-Day parade this year to have more cultural elements, says defence secretary",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/r-day-parade-this-year-to-have-more-cultural-elements-says-defence-secretary/articleshow/117410966.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: The Republic Day parade this year will have more cultural elements, though its basic military character will be retained, with the new indigenous Pralay missile being among the wide array of weapon systems to be showcased.“The military and martial character of the parade is being maintained, but we want to make it a broader societal-cultural programme, with wider participation from our society, both in terms of the performers and the invitees,” defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said on Monday.With Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto being the chief guest at the 90-minute parade down the majestic Kartavya Path on Jan 26, a marching contingent and band from the country will also take part in the annual celebration. In all, there will be 18 marching contingents, 15 bands and 31 tableaux.The parade, with the theme “Swarnim Bharat: Virasat aur Vikas”, will be “heralded” by 300 cultural artistes with Indian musical instruments. It will also witness a performance by 5,000 folk and tribal artistes that will cover the entire Kartavya Path from one end to the other.Around 10,000 “special guests” have been invited to the parade this year to ensure “Jan Bhagidari”, which include “best performers” in various fields and those “who have made the best use” of various govt schemes.India’s two main indigenous aviation showpieces, Tejas fighter jets and Dhruv advanced light helicopters (ALHs), however, will not be part of the Republic Day fly-past this year, as was earlier reported by TOI.“The grounding of the ALH fleet (there are 330 such choppers in the armed forces) is a slight setback. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is currently conducting safety checks, and it will be sorted out soon. However, it is unlikely the fleet will return to action in time for the parade,” Singh said.","Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will be the chief guest at the 90-minute parade.

'Halal' certification making items costlier: Govt tells Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/halal-certification-making-items-costlier-govt-tells-supreme-court/articleshow/117409105.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: A legal battle over imposing a ban on manufacture, sale and distribution of food products with halal certification has intensified with the Centre on Monday telling the court that few lakhs of crores of rupees were being collected by giving certification for various products including cement, iron bars, bottles and this pushed prices of products higher.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices B R Gavai and Augustine George Masih that he was shocked to know that ‘Halal’ certification is not confined to food items but it was done for all sorts of products. “So far as Halal meat etc. is concerned, nobody can have any objection. But your Lordships would be shocked, as I was shocked yesterday, even cement used is to be halal-certified! Sariyas (iron bars) used have to be halal-certified...Water bottles which we get are required to be halal-certified...Few lakhs of crores are collected through certification,” the SG said.His plea was opposed by senior advocate M R Shamshad, appearing for various petitioners including Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind Halal Trust , and told the bench that concept of Halal has been well explained in central govt policy and it is a matter of lifestyle. He said that everything is voluntary and no one is forced to have Halal-certified products.Food Security and Drug Administration of UP govt had in Nov 2023 banned the “manufacture, sale, storage and distribution of halal-certified products with immediate effect”. “In compliance with Section 30(2)(d) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, in exercise of the authority vested in Section 30(2)(a) of the said Act, in view of public health, food with Halal certification is being banned within the limits of Uttar Pradesh ,” the notification said.The solicitor general submitted that the issue has to be adjudicated by the apex court while highlighting that price of product increases due to halal certification and it affected consumers. The court was hearing a plea challenging UP government notification.UP govt in its affidavit said the ‘halal’ certification of food products acts as a parallel system that creates confusion regarding the quality and is completely against the basic intention of the Food Safety and Standards Act.The court posted the hearing to March 25.","The Centre told the court that few lakhs of crores of rupees were being collected by giving certification for various products including cement, iron bars, bottles.

Makes no sense to arrest after filing chargesheet: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/makes-no-sense-to-arrest-after-filing-chargesheet-supreme-court/articleshow/117408296.cms,"Supreme Court

Merely because an arrest can be made because it’s lawful doesn’t mean it should be done: SC said

NEW DELHI: Despite the Supreme Court passing several directives to restrain investigating agencies from arresting an accused in a routine manner, particularly when it’s not needed, they had very little impact on ground. The apex court has now come to know that there is an unusual practice in Uttar Pradesh that the arrest is effected after the chargesheet is filed, which the court said ""makes no sense"".A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan stated that there is no point in arresting a person once the investigation in the case is complete.We are of the view that once the investigation is over and a chargesheet is filed, the accused should be asked to appear before the court concerned and granted bail to the satisfaction of the trial court. If the investigating officer wants to interrogate the petitioner, the person can be arrested during the course of the investigation itself. At this stage, there is no point in making a formal arrest,” the bench said while granting bail to an accused who expressed apprehension of being arrested.The court was informed that there is a practice in UP that arrest is effected after the chargesheet is filed and the court takes cognizance of the chargesheet. “We do not propose to say anything as regards in this unusual practice except that it makes no sense,” the bench said.The court decried such practice in various orders, including in case of Siddharth vs State of UP. “The trial courts are stated to be insisting on the arrest of an accused as a pre-requisite formality to take the chargesheet on record in view of the provisions of Section 170 of the CrPC. We consider such a course misplaced and contrary to the very intent of Section 170 of CrPC... In the present case, when the appellant has joined the investigation, investigation has completed and he has been roped in after seven years of registration of the FIR we can think of no reason why at this stage he must be arrested before the chargesheet is taken on record,” the court had said in its 2021 order.“We may note that personal liberty is an important aspect of our constitutional mandate. The occasion to arrest an accused during investigation arises when custodial investigation becomes necessary or it is a heinous crime or where there is a possibility of influencing the witnesses or accused may abscond. Merely because an arrest can be made because it is lawful does not mandate that arrest must be made.“...”If the accused has cooperated with the investigation and there’s no reason to believe they’ll abscond or disobey summons, there should be no compulsion for arrest,” it had said.","There is an unusual practice in Uttar Pradesh that the arrest is effected after the chargesheet is filed.

Opt out of Ladki Bahin scheme if income is Rs 2.5L+/year: Ajit Pawar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opt-out-of-ladki-bahin-scheme-if-income-is-rs-2-5l/year-ajit-pawar/articleshow/117408065.cms,"Ajit Pawar (File photo)

SAMBHAJINAGAR: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Monday reiterated his party’s commitment to secularism and progressive politics, and issued a stern warning against divisive tactics and corruption. He also urged Ladki Bahin beneficiaries earning an annual income of Rs 2.5 lakh and above to voluntarily opt out of the scheme.“Maharashtra has always been a beacon of progressive thought and social harmony. NCP stands firmly for unity and secularism. We will not allow anyone to spread hatred or indulge in divisive politics,” Pawar said, while speaking at the inauguration of NCP’s district office in Jalna.He urged party workers to ensure transparency while inducting new members, and “avoid admitting individuals with a tainted image”.While claiming that state government had allocated Rs 3,700 crore to WCD department for Ladki Bahin Yojana, fulfilling its poll promise, the deputy CM appealed to the ineligible beneficiaries to voluntarily give up the benefits. “This scheme is meant for economically disadvantaged women. Unfortunately, even women who file income tax are availing themselves of its benefits. I request them to step back so that the aid can reach the people in need,” Pawar said, adding that eligible women would start receiving their monthly Rs 1,500 allowances by Jan 26.Pawar took a swipe at opposition parties for their campaign against EVMs. “When they win elections in other states like Karnataka and West Bengal, they praise EVMs. But when they lose, they blame the same machines,” he said.","Ajit Pawar urged Ladki Bahin beneficiaries earning an annual income of Rs 2.5 lakh and above to voluntarily opt out of the scheme.

BHOPAL: The third batch of 18 cheetahs, scheduled to be relocated from South Africa to Madhya Pradesh in Feb 2025, may take more time. Sources indicate that South Africa is awaiting quarterly progress reports on Project Cheetah, which are supposed to be sent by India’s ministry of environment, forest, and climate change as part of the MoU signed between the two countries.An officer associated with the project, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that the next batch would come once SA govt receives quarterly reports. The MoU, signed Jan 17, 2022, specifies that India’s govt must submit quarterly progress reports on the cheetahs translocated to India from South Africa.The project is also stalled due to pending import permission from Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). These cheetahs are expected to be relocated to Kuno National Park in Sheopur and Gandhi Sagar in Mandsaur, but the delay in CITES approval is preventing the next phase of the reintroduction effort. Cheetahs, which were last found in India in the 1950s, are included in CITES Appendix I, which heavily regulates their trade to protect them from illegal international trade and over-exploitation.Once import permission by CITES is granted, South African authorities will need to secure export permission from the body before the translocation can proceed. Authorities have reportedly overlooked the need for CITES consent during the planning stages of the project, further complicating the process.Cheetahs are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, with fewer than 7,000 individuals remaining in the wild, primarily in the savannahs of Africa. While southern Africa is considered the species’ stronghold, populations in north and west Africa are critically endangered. In Iran, a small population of Asiatic cheetahs also faces the threat of extinction.In 2019, SC approved the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)’s proposal to reintroduce African cheetahs to India’s national parks, with Kuno National Park in MP selected as the relocation site. The Cheetah Conservation Fund in Namibia had pledged to donate cheetahs for the project, with the only funding required being for transportation costs.",The project is also stalled due to pending import permission from Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Cheetahs are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117407771,imgsize-134114,width-400,resizemode-4/117407771.jpg"

PRAYAGRAJ: Model-influencer Harsha Richaria’s participation in the Shahi Snan at Prayagraj Maha Kumbh has become a bone of contention among seers.After Shambhavi Peethadheeshwar Swami Anand Swaroop ’s objections to her participation in the first Amrit Snan on Makar Sankranti, Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) president Mahant Ravindra Puri has announced that he would take Harsha to Sangam in the chariot of Niranjani Akhara on Jan 29, the second Amrit Snan.“She is our daughter and the pride of Uttarakhand. I told her that she’ll be taking the holy dip on Mauni Amavasya sitting on a chariot in a full royal and grand manner, and she will bathe like a ‘devi’. I requested her to stay back and complete her stay at Kumbh,” said Puri.Not everyone is pleased with the attention being showered on the influencer. Swami Anand Swaroop urged Mahant Puri to reconsider the decision, citing his responsibility to protect Sanatan Dharma as ABAP president. “My view is very simple: a model should not and cannot take part in the Amrit Snan along with other seers just because she has worn bhagwa ( saffron ). It is disrespectful to the seer community, and we will certainly stop this from happening. Ab aar paar ho hi jaaye (Now, it should be settled once and for all),” said Anand Swaroop, chief of Kali Sena , while talking to TOI.Richaria, on her part, told the media: “I have come home to my Maharaj ji. If he is blessing me, I don’t need any other person’s support. If a daughter gets the support of her father, what else does she need? As I said earlier, I am here to learn about Sanatan Dharma to get connected with it, so that I can spread awareness in society.”Richaria grabbed attention at Maha Kumbh as she moved on a chariot on the day of the first Amrit Snan (Jan 14). Her videos and photos went viral on social media platforms, making her an instant sensation, with some followers referring to her as the “most beautiful sadhvi”.However, the kind of attention she has been getting has met with disapproval from a section of ascetics.

UK Colonial Era: UK's richest 10% took half of India's wealth during colonial era,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uks-richest-10-took-half-of-indias-wealth-during-colonial-era-oxfam-report/articleshow/117387937.cms,"Representative image

Wealth extraction from India



Impact on India's economy and society



Multinational and colonial exploitation



Continuing Inequities



Colonialism's lasting impact



Global South struggles



A new report by Oxfam International , titled 'Takers, Not Makers,' reveals staggering figures on wealth extracted from India by Britain during the colonial era, claiming that $64.82 trillion was taken between 1765 and 1900. Of this, $33.8 trillion, which is more than half of the total wealth, adjusted for today’s value, is said to have enriched the UK’s richest 10%.Released at the World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting in Davos, the report pointed out colonialism’s lasting impact on inequality and economic systems. ""Legacies of inequality and pathologies of plunder, pioneered during the time of historical colonialism , continue to shape modern lives,"" Oxfam said.The report also specified that colonial practices perpetuated systemic wealth extraction from the Global South to the Global North, benefiting a select elite. “This has created a deeply unequal world, a world torn apart by division based on racism, a world that continues to systematically extract wealth from the Global South to primarily benefit the richest people in the Global North,” the report said.Oxfam calculated that the wealth extracted from India alone by Britain could carpet London’s surface area in £50 currency notes nearly four times. ""This would be enough to carpet the surface area of London in British pound 50 notes almost four times over,"" the report mentioned.The wealth extraction, Oxfam claimed, not only enriched the wealthiest 10% but also majorly benefited Britain’s emerging middle class, which received 32% of this income.The report details how India’s share of global industrial output dropped precipitously from 25% in 1750 to just 2% by 1900, primarily due to Britain’s protectionist policies targeting Asian textiles. ""This dramatic reduction can be attributed to Britain's implementation of stringent protectionist policies against Asian textiles, which systematically undermined India's industrial growth potential,"" the report added.During World War I , disruptions in colonial trade patterns inadvertently stimulated industrial growth in colonies, disclosing how external shocks temporarily alleviated colonial suppression.Oxfam also linked modern multinational corporations to colonial practices, tracing their origins to entities like the British East India Company . ""The concept of private multinational corporations, bankrolled by rich shareholders, was a product of the colonial era,” Oxfam stated, adding that these corporations employed private armies to suppress resistance.The East India Company alone had an army of 260,000 soldiers, double the size of Britain’s peacetime army, who engaged in land dispossession and violent repression.The report highlighted modern parallels, stating that wages in the Global South are 87–95% lower than for equivalent work in the Global North. It also mentioned the exploitation of natural resources and poor working conditions in supply chains dominated by multinational corporations.Oxfam also targeted global institutions like the WTO and World Bank for perpetuating inequities. “The inequality that these countries experience today is significantly of colonial making,” the report said.Oxfam also addressed the societal divisions entrenched during colonial rule, such as caste, religion, and language. For instance, it pointed out that only 0.14% of India’s mother tongues are used as mediums of instruction.The report further pointed out the devastating Bengal famine of 1943, which resulted in an estimated three million deaths. “Grain import restrictions during World War Two, underpinned by racist thinking, appear to have significantly contributed to or caused the Bengal famine,” Oxfam stated.Oxfam detailed how colonialism’s legacy continues to affect public services, education, and health in the Global South. It cited biopiracy, as seen in the case of neem, and the systemic exploitation of resources.Calling colonialism’s impact a “fruit from the poisoned tree,” Oxfam summed up its report stating that global inequality remains deeply rooted in the historical practices of extraction and exploitation.","Oxfam says $64.82 trillion was taken from India by Britain between 1765 and 1900.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand cabinet on Monday approved the rules & regulations for the Uniform Civil Code, paving the way for its implementation in the next 10 days. With this, Uttarakhand is set to become the first state in the country to adopt UCC since Independence.“We will soon announce the date for implementation. It will be a big change, which will start from Uttarakhand and spread to other states,” chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami told TOI. While he did not specify the exact date, sources indicated that the code may be rolled out on Jan 26 or 28. Dhami added that the training of over 2,000 govt employees has already been completed, and the trial run is expected to conclude in the coming days.UCC law includes seven schedules and 392 sections, addressing critical issues such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and live-in relationships. It aims to eliminate practices like polygamy, polyandry, halala, iddat, and talaaq. The code also ensures equal property rights for all children and protects the rights of unborn children. According to the new rules, marriages and divorces conducted since 2010 must be registered within six months of the law’s notification. Similarly, marriages must be recorded within two months to avoid penalties, while live-in relationships and separations must be registered within 30 days.Asked about any changes to the report submitted by the rules and regulations panel in Oct 2024, home secretary Shailesh Bagauli told TOI, “Around 80-90% of the report has been retained, and the law’s essence remains unchanged. At the same time, it needs to be understood that rules are subordinate legislation and only define the procedures for implementing the Act. Rules cannot amend the Act.”","Uttarakhand cabinet on Monday approved the rules & regulations for the Uniform Civil Code.

Lost & found: Gujarat town & university dating to 300 CE,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lost-found-gujarat-town-university-dating-to-300-ce/articleshow/117410681.cms,"Valabhi was capital & a port city at one point: Researcher

AHMEDABAD: Present-day Vallabhipur , 40km from Bhavnagar, is a town in Gujarat with 15,000 people. But between the 3rd and 8th centuries CE, it was the seat of the Maitrakas , one of the region’s early rulers. The town was famed for its university, Valabhi Vidyapith, which was compared with Nalanda in Bihar by Chinese travellers Xuanzang and Yijing in 7th century CE. A recent study has found remains of the town in satellite imagery.The findings, published in the Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing, claim to have located the ancient town’s ruling seat, university and monastery.The study, “Ancient Valabhi: A Remote Sensing Perspective”, by Arya Pradeep and M Rajani of National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru, draws parallels with existing structures of similar nature to identify the remains, buried beneath the existing town.Rajani told TOI that it started with a collaborative project with SAC-ISRO on geo-archaeology. The sites selected were those that had undergone geomorphological changes. “Along with Gangetic delta and Krishna-Godavari delta, we selected Valabhi.”Pradeep, an architect and researcher, said Valabhi was a capital and port city at one time. “But we do not have much evidence regarding location or extent. Thus, satellite images were used to find patterns and spectral signatures of the landscape. It revealed important clues about an ancient site and its probable linkages to other significant cultural sites,” she said.The researchers identified two archaeological mounds — named by them as Mound M and Mounds M1 to M6. Mound M is a rough square of 350 x 350 metres and is believed to be the fortified part of the town. Mounds M1 to M6 are in straight line with a length of about 350 metres — the researchers believe these are the monasteries.The study points at a square construction that can be found in Vikramshila in India and Somapura in Bangladesh, whereas a very similar monastery pattern is found in a group of monasteries at Nalanda Mahavira complex.“The information from Maitraka copper plate grants testifies to presence of several monasteries and prominent monastic clusters in ancient Valabhi,” the study says.What next? Rajani said systematic surveys using other non-invasive techniques can help identify specific sites that can be excavated.","Present-day Vallabhipur, 40km from Bhavnagar, is a town in Gujarat with 15,000 people.

KOLKATA: A sessions court in Kolkata Monday sentenced former traffic police volunteer Sanjay Roy (35) to jail for the remainder of his life for raping and murdering a 31-year-old junior doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Aug 9 last year, acknowledging that it resisted “the temptation to bow to public pressure or emotional appeals” and pronounce death as the case couldn’t be categorised as “rarest of rare”, report Rohit Khanna & Srishti Lakhotia.Citing SC guidelines stating that capital punishment should be handed “only in exceptional circumstances where the community’s collective conscience is so shocked that it expects death”, Sealdah additional sessions judge Anirban Das’s 172-page order states, “We must rise above the primitive instinct of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a nail for a nail, or a life for a life.”The order further states, “The court must focus on delivering a verdict that upholds the integrity of the legal system and serves the broader interests of justice...Considering the overall facts and circumstances, we hold this is not a case where the possibility of reformation is completely ruled out. It would be inappropriate to accede to the prosecution’s request for the death penalty. The court’s duty is to pass a sentence that is proportionate, just and in accordance with established legal principles.”Acknowledging “the immense grief and suffering of the victim’s parents, for which no sentence can provide complete solace,” the court asked the state to pay Rs 17 lakh — Rs 7 lakh as compensation for rape and Rs 10 lakh for murder – to the victim’s kin. The junior doctor’s parents, who were present in the courtroom, stood up and told the judge they only wanted justice. The couple had previously turned down the state government’s offer of compensation.Convict Roy, who was fined Rs 1 lakh, pleaded innocence again and claimed to be unaware of the contents of documents he was made to sign in police custody. He was convicted Saturday under sections 64 (rape), 66 (causing injury resulting in death of rape victim), and 103 (1) (murder) of the new penal code Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) after a 66-day trial.Section 103(1) mandates the death penalty or life imprisonment; Section 66 provides for imprisonment of not less than 20 years, which may extend to life; and Section 64 recommends imprisonment of not less than 10 years, which may extend to a jail term spanning the remainder of the convict’s life.“The convict’s act was barbaric and brutal. The gruesome acts were diabolical in conception and cruel in execution,” the verdict states.“Roy attacked the victim and raped and then smothered and throttled her to death. The CCTV footage, Roy’s contradictory statements in court and the DNA reports all indicated he was the only perpetrator...I have no confusion that the seminar room, more particularly the dais, again more precisely the mattress on the dais was the scene of crime.”The crime on campus had sparked spontaneous protests that spread from Kolkata to various parts of the country and even abroad. A 10-week junior doctors’ agitation ended on Oct 21 after meetings with CM Mamata Banerjee, who made a series of administrative changes and promised reforms in the health department to placate the protesters. Monday’s proceedings started at 12.30pm in courtroom number 210, with the CBI counsel pushing for the death penalty.“She (the victim) was a meritorious student. It is not only a loss for the family but for (the entire) society, which has been shattered by the brutality (of the crime). People will lose confidence if Roy is not given death. A lot of girls go for higher education; people will lose confidence if they are not safe,” the prosecution said.The victim’s parents, too, pleaded that the court pronounce capital punishment.Roy, who was given a microphone to speak, declared, “I have been framed. I was tortured in custody. I was made to sign documents about which I have no idea.”The judge stopped Roy at this point and said he wanted his opinion only on the maximum punishment he deserved. “I am here to judge the case based on the evidence placed before me. I feel that the prosecution’s charge is correct and that is why you have been convicted,” Judge Das observed.",A sessions court in Kolkata Monday sentenced former traffic police volunteer Sanjay Roy (35) to jail for the remainder of his life for raping and murdering a 31-year-old junior doctor.

NEW DELHI: Regional parties received the lion’s share of their donations in 2023-24 via electoral bonds before they were scrapped by Supreme Court on Feb 15, 2024, as per annual audit reports filed by them with Election Commission.Trinamool Congress received Rs 612.4 crore between March 31, 2023 and Feb 15, 2024, followed by BRS with bonds receipts worth Rs 495.5 crore, BJD at Rs 245.5 crore, TDP’s at Rs 174.1 crore, YSR Congress Party’s at Rs 121.5 crore, DMK’s at Rs 60 crore, JMM’s at Rs 11.5 crore, and Sikkim Democratic Front’s at Rs 5.5 crore.While 95% of TMC’s total income was from bonds, it was 72% for BRS, 82% for BJD, 61% for TDP, 64% for YSRCP, 33% for DMK, 73% for JMM.Among the four national parties whose annual audit reports for 2023-24 are available on the Election Commission’s website, only AAP has declared contributions via electoral bonds, albeit under the broader category of receipts through electoral bonds/electoral trusts. However, since AAP’s contribution report for 2023-24 did not declare any donation from electoral trusts, it may be safe to assume that the entire Rs 10.1 crore shown under the ‘donations from bonds/trusts’ head has flown from bonds. This constitutes over 44% of the total income declared by AAP in 2023-24.A comparison of annual audit reports for 2023-24 and 2022-23 shows an 88% jump in TMC’s receipts from electoral bonds, 61% rise for BJD, 133% for YSRCP, 412% for TDP and 858% for JMM. SDF did not declare any donations through bonds in 2022-23. However, DMK’s funding through the electoral bonds route fell by 67% in 2023-24 as compared to the previous year, as did that of BRS by 6.3%.As regards to the total income declared by the four national parties — BSP, AAP, CPM and National People’s Party (NPP) — for the year 2023-24, BSP’s was the highest at Rs 64.8 crore (up from Rs 29.3 crore in 2022-23), followed by AAP at Rs 22.7 crore (down from Rs 85.2 crore), NPP at Rs 22.4 lakh (down from Rs 7.6 crore) and CPM at Rs 16.8 lakh (up from Rs 14.2 lakh). The total expenditure declared by BSP for the last fiscal is Rs 43.2 crore, by AAP Rs 34.1 crore, by NPP Rs 1.1 crore, and by CPM Rs 12.7 lakh.Among the regional parties, BRS has declared the highest income at Rs 685.5 crore in 2023-24 (down from Rs 737.7 crore in 2022-23) followed by TMC at Rs 646.4 crore (up from Rs 333.4 crore), BJD at Rs 297.8 crore (up from Rs 181 crore), TDP at Rs 285.1 crore (up from Rs 64 crore), YSRCP at Rs 191 crore (up from Rs 74.8 crore), DMK at Rs 181 crore (down from Rs 214.3 crore), Samajwadi Party at Rs 26.1 crore (down from Rs 32.9 crore), CPI Rs 19.5 crore (up from Rs 15.3 crore), JMM Rs 15.8 crore (up from Rs 2.7 crore).YSRCP incurred an expenditure of Rs 295.8 crore in 2023-24, BRS Rs 254.9 crore, TMC Rs 231.5 crore, DMK Rs 200 crore, TDP Rs 121.1 crore, BJD Rs 44 crore, SP Rs 39.4 crore and CPI Rs 13.8 crore.","Trinamool Congress received Rs 612.4 crore between March 31, 2023 and Feb 15, 2024.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday witnessed heated exchange of words between solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocate Colin Gonsalves over the burial of a Christian man from a Scheduled Tribe (ST) community in Chhattisgarh and the court also expressed its pain that a man had to move to top court to bury his father.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma was hearing a plea filed by Ramesh Baghel who moved SC against the Chhattisgarh HC order refusing to allow him to bury his father in his native village.Opposing the plea, the SG said that petitioner’s insistence to bury the man in the burial ground of his family’s native village was an attempt to create unrest between tribal Hindus and Christians. Gonsalves, appearing for the petitioner, countered saying that it was an attempt to kick out tribal Christians.Amidst heated exchange, the court said, “Why should a person who has lived in a particular village be not buried in that village? The body is lying in the morgue since January 7. Sorry to say that a man has to come to the Supreme Court for burial of his father. We are sorry to say that neither the Panchayat, nor the state govt or the high court was able to resolve this problem. We are surprised by the high court’s remark that there will be a law and order problem . We are pained to see that a person is unable to bury his father and has to come to the SC.”Mehta informed the court that there was no burial ground for Christians and the man could be buried in a place 20 kilometres away from the village.Gonsalves, however, said the affidavit submitted by the state showed his family members were also buried in the village. Referring to the affidavit, Gonsalves said the deceased was not being allowed the burial as he was Christian.

He urged them to work unitedly for social and spiritual progress, adding that the community should play a vital role in promoting Sanatana Dharma. “For the Vedic religion to be stable, there should be Brahmanism.”The pontiff said that Brahmins shouldn’t outsource practices like ‘sandhya vandana’, Gayatri worship and agni puja. They should strive to remain in India where their presence is vital for preserving Bharat’s spiritual and cultural heritage.Brahmins should counter their negative portrayal by ensuring that media and movies showcase their contributions in music, art and cinema, the pontiff said, adding that the community should live together in mutual cooperation.He urged Brahmins to stay connected with rural communities and establish detailed records of gotras in every household and temple.

NEW DELHI: The govt on Monday partially lifted the “restriction” on export of sugar after almost 31 months by permitting mills to ship 10 lakh tonnes for the 2024-25 season ending Sept, a move that will support the industry.However, nearly two dozen sugar mills have been barred from exporting their stock as they had violated rules by selling excess sugar in the domestic market than their allotted monthly quantity.The food ministry has put out detailed guidelines for mill-wise allocation of 10 lakh tonnes export quota. The decision came barely days after the govt reduced the reserve price of rice stored with the FCI from Rs 2,800 a quintal to Rs 2,250 for sale to state govts, their corporations, and ethanol distilleries.","The food ministry has put out detailed guidelines for mill-wise allocation of 10 lakh tonnes export quota.

MUMBAI: Vacancies in all departments and verticals of private companies may soon have to be mandatorily notified to govt, signalling a shift in employment regulation.The Centre plans to replace the Employment Exchanges (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959, with the new Social Securities Act, in order to formalise a mechanism for disseminating information on job vacancies and introduce steep penalties for non-compliance —govt wants to hike fines, which were once a negligible Rs 100, to as high as Rs 50,000.“We have employment exchanges, but they have become defunct. With the changes in the Act, we will revive and strengthen them to ensure companies inform the state about vacancies,” said Mangal Prabhat Lodha, state minister for skill education, employment, and entrepreneurship. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Lodha said nominal penalties of Rs 100-500 have discouraged companies from reporting vacancies, a practice that will change under the revamped law.Currently, most companies post their vacancies on employment-oriented social media platforms like LinkedIn. It is not clear why the govt wants to duplicate this effort. To ease compliance, the govt plans to develop a state-specific job portal for companies to list their openings. This initiative, according to the minister, forms part of a broader 100-day action plan.","The Centre plans to replace the Employment Exchanges (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959, with the new Social Securities Act.

'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: "" Sab sawaal ahamiyat rakhte hai, jawaab toh banta hai; aadatan kalam band jawaab dete rahe, aaj rubaroo toh banta hain.Kya pata kal ho ya na hon, aaj jawab banta hai ( All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Saif Ali Khan stabbing: Drama in Mumbai court as lawyers clash to represent accused Shariful,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/saif-ali-khan-stabbing-high-drama-in-mumbai-court-as-lawyers-clash-to-represent-accused-shariful/articleshow/117383102.cms,"vakalatnama

NEW DELHI: The seriousness of a Bandra courtroom gave way to chaos on Sunday as two lawyers scrambled to represent the man accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan. The scene unfolded during the remand proceedings of Mohammad Shariful Islam Shehzad , a 30-year-old Bangladeshi national arrested for the attack. The magistrate, caught in the middle of the unexpected tussle, was forced to mediate, ultimately suggesting that the competing advocates represent the accused as a team, news agency PTI reported.Shehzad has been accused of sneaking into Khan’s upscale Bandra residence in the early hours of January 16. According to police, he climbed to the 12th floor of the Satguru Sharan building using a pipe and entered the actor’s apartment through a bathroom window.Once inside, he was confronted by domestic staff, leading to a scuffle during which Khan was allegedly stabbed multiple times. The 54-year-old actor sustained injuries near his neck and spine and was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. Khan is said to be in stable condition and recovering well.The clash unfolded moments before the accused could sign the legal document () authorising representation, causing confusion. Another lawyer pushed his way to the accused's box and secured Shehzad's signature on his own, leading to a brief moment of confusion over who would represent the alleged attacker.The accused was arrested after a three-day manhunt. Police tracked him to a labour camp in Thane using CCTV footage and inputs from a labour contractor. Authorities allege that Shehzad, a Bangladeshi national who entered India illegally six months ago, had assumed the alias Vijay Das.While initial investigations suggest theft as the motive, police have not ruled out the possibility of an international conspiracy. Shehzad was remanded to police custody for five days to allow further interrogation.Outside the court, Sherkhane, the lawyer representing the accused denied allegations of Shehzad’s Bangladeshi origin, saying, “The police have no evidence to prove my client is from Bangladesh. He has been living in Mumbai for over seven years with his family. The claim that he entered six months ago is baseless.”The lawyers also criticised procedural lapses in the investigation. “The remand copy lacks any mention of an intent to murder, yet serious charges have been levelled against him. No proper investigation has been conducted,” Sherkhane added. Prajapati echoed these concerns, arguing that no substantial recovery had been made, and no documentation supported claims of Shehzad’s foreign origin.","Mohammad Shariful Islam Shehzad, 30, is accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan.

$500,000: Provides access only to the candlelight dinner, a reduction from 2017 when this tier included both dinners.

$50,000: Offers limited access, such as attendance at events with Cabinet officials, though this now costs half as much as in 2017.

For Lower-Level Donors: Limited Returns

Major donors to Donald Trump ’s inaugural committee face a steeper price tag for exclusive access to the former president and vice-president-elect JD Vance. Fundraising materials reveal that a $1 million contribution is now the minimum requirement for top-tier perks—double the $500,000 asked during Trump’s first inauguration.This highest-tier package grants two tickets to an exclusive dinner with Vance and six tickets to the ""candlelight dinner,"" where Trump is expected to attend.Lobbyists and donors aiming to secure favor with the incoming administration view these opportunities as essential, reflecting the increased demand for proximity to Trump following his return to power.The dramatic increase in donation levels aligns with a surge in enthusiasm after a contentious election. With over $170 million raised so far and expectations of surpassing $200 million, the committee's funds far exceed the costs of hosting the events, including receptions, lunches, and balls. For donors with business interests before the government, the $1 million price point is seen as a calculated investment in influence.In contrast, lower-tier contributions—$100,000 or $250,000—now offer significantly diminished access. According to one transition official, donors at these levels may be better off directing their funds to Trump-affiliated political action committees. “At $100,000, you’re not even noticed,” the official remarked, underscoring the exclusivity of this year’s fundraising strategy.The five-tier structure outlines donation levels from $50,000 to $1 million, each with decreasing benefits:Promotional materials describe the black-tie ""candlelight dinner,"" hosted at the National Building Museum, as a marquee event featuring Trump and Melania Trump. Meanwhile, the vice-president’s dinner at the National Gallery of Art is presented as an exclusive affair.Even the $1 million package delivers fewer benefits than in 2017, as events like the ""leadership luncheon,"" previously featuring Cabinet appointees and congressional leaders, have been cut. Insiders suggest that private gatherings hosted by Trump allies, such as Donald Trump Jr., Turning Point’s Charlie Kirk, and Steve Bannon, may offer more meaningful opportunities for access.Donors at lower levels should not expect face time with Trump but may still gain access to events featuring Cabinet officials and Trumpworld figures. However, with scaled-back perks across the board, the value of these contributions is markedly less compared to previous years.",Donors to Donald Trump's inaugural committee face a steeper price tag for exclusive access to the former president and vice-president-elect JD Vance.

Meghan Markle’s leadership style led to staff needing therapy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/couldnt-live-with-myself-anymore-meghan-markles-leadership-style-led-to-staff-needing-therapy/articleshow/117347715.cms,"File photo: Meghan Markle (Picture credit: AP)

Shocking Change In Trump's Inauguration Plans; Americans 'Upset' After Unexpected Shift | Watch

Meghan Markle’s leadership style led some staff members to require therapy or take extended leave after working with her on professional projects, according to reports by Vanity Fair.In a recent profile marking five years since the Sussexes stepped back from royal duties, multiple individuals described their experiences working with the Duchess as emotionally taxing.The staff involved in Meghan’s projects, such as her Archetypes podcast for Spotify, reportedly found the work environment so challenging that they sought extended breaks or long-term counselling.One source likened the experience to being in a high-stress teenage drama, claiming, “It’s talking behind your back. It’s gnawing at your sense of self. Really, like, Mean Girls-teenager.”A former colleague shared how they were initially excited to join Meghan’s team but later grew disillusioned upon realising that the negative atmosphere was more common than they had expected.Another said the tension stemmed from undermining behaviours, adding, “You can be yelled at even if somebody doesn’t raise their voice. It’s funny that people don’t differentiate between the energy of being yelled at and literally somebody screaming at you.”The Vanity Fair report alleges that several staff members either left their jobs or required professional help after enduring the demanding environment. One individual who worked on the podcast reportedly took a leave of absence after just three episodes, with others describing the need for extended breaks to escape scrutiny.One source claimed that working under Meghan led them to reevaluate their own principles: “I left because I couldn’t live with myself anymore.”These new claims echo earlier allegations from 2018, when Meghan faced a formal bullying complaint during her time as a working royal. That complaint alleged she had driven two personal assistants out of the household. While Buckingham Palace conducted an internal investigation, the findings were never publicly released.Meghan has consistently denied all bullying allegations.Sources quoted by Vanity Fair also suggested Meghan’s leadership approach involves harsh scrutiny of team members. One insider remarked: “She’s constantly playing checkers, not chess, but she’s very aware of where everybody is on her board. And when you are not in, you are to be thrown to the wolves at any given moment.”Another observer said the Duchess’s approach has damaged perceptions of her: “I think if Meghan acknowledged her own shortcomings or personal contributions to situations rather than staying trapped in a victim narrative, her perception might be better.”While Meghan’s media projects, including her podcast and Netflix collaborations, have drawn significant public interest, insiders suggest the couple has faced challenges navigating the entertainment industry.","Vanity Fair profile marks five years since the Sussexes stepped back from royal duties.

International reactions

Pres. Trump signs batch of executive orders after inauguration

More proposals

Newly appointed US president Donald Trump announced plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from the two major US trading partners, Canada and Mexico starting from February 1.He accused the two nations for not failing to tackle illegal immigration and the flow of narcotics into the United States, and pledged to use tariffs extensively as a foreign policy measure.Speaking in the Oval Office hours after being sworn in,Trump said, “We're thinking in terms of 25 percent on Mexico and Canada, because they're allowing vast numbers of people -- Canada's a very bad abuser also -- vast numbers of people to come in, and fentanyl to come in.”In his inaugural address, he emphasised that he would rather impose taxes and tariffs on foreign nations to benefit US citizens, rather than burdening Americans for taxes.Early Monday, he vowed: ""I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families.""Trump’s return to the White House has reignited his previous calls for aggressive tariff policies. He had already proposed additional duties, including a 10 percent hike on Chinese goods, with even steeper rates of up to 60 percent, on imports from nations he accused of unfair trade practices or inadequate action on illegal immigration and drug trafficking.As per US trade data, Mexico, Canada, and China were among the United States' largest trading partners.The White House separately announced plans to introduce the "" America First Trade Policy .""On Monday, the president also signed a directive aimed at tackling the country’s cost-of-living crisis, with focus on reducing housing costs and other everyday expenses.Trump reiterated his intent to create an ""external revenue service"" to collect tariffs and duties, claiming it would pour in ""massive amounts of money"" for the country. The initiative is a twist on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which aims at administering and enforcing US tax laws.International reactions to Trump’s tariff plans have been cautious. Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, stated that Ottawa would prepare to respond to any US trade policies, while the EU’s economy commissioner also promised to defend European interests.Critics have warned that higher tariffs could, in turn, lead to increased consumer prices and hurt economic growth. A 2021 tax foundation report noted that tariffs typically burden businesses and consumers, though it found no evidence of driving economy-wide inflation.Despite these warnings, Trump supporters have also pointed to his other proposals, such as tax cuts and deregulation. Commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick suggested companies relocate manufacturing to the US in order to avoid duties.However, treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent dismissed concerns that tariffs would impact domestic consumers.Trump also announced plans to establish a ""department of government efficiency"" (DOGE) to identify and implement $1 trillion in federal spending cuts, reinforcing his commitment to fiscal responsibility.","US president Donald Trump announced plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from the two major US trading partners, Canada and Mexico starting from February 1.

Tom Brady was shocked by Gisele Bündchen's pregnancy news

Tom Brady was shocked when Gisele Bündchen revealed she was expecting a child with boyfriend Joaquim Valente , indicating that the 44-year-old supermodel was ending her relationship with him. Brady never imagined they would be having a child together, even though he knew things were serious between Bündchen and Joaquin.Tom Brady was shocked by Gisele Bündchen's pregnancy news, as he had never imagined his ex-wife would start a family with her boyfriend Joaquim Valente. Bündchen is expecting a third child with her jiu-jitsu trainer, nearly two years after filing for divorce from Brady, who ended 13 years of marriage.In the wake of his ex-wife's pregnancy, a source told the outlet that “Tom knew that things were serious between Gisele and Joaquin but he never imagined they would be having a child together.” “It just wasn’t something that was on his radar. So when Gisele broke the news to him he was stunned, to say the least,” the insider went on.The source explained that “after the initial shock wore off,” the 47-year-old athlete has “grown used to the idea and he’s happy for Gisele.” “At the end of the day, Tom’s sole focus is on his children and his career. What Gisele decides to do with her own life is really none of his business,” the insider added.After Bündchen’s pregnancy got public, Brady posted a sunset picture on Instagram accompanied with the cover of Fleetwood Mac's ""Landslide"" and three red heart emojis. Other than three red heart emojis above the lyrics to the song, which are ""Oh mirror in the sky, what is love / Can the child inside my heart rise above / Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?"", the former quarterback provided no other kind of context about the meaning of the post.Brady, after divorcing Bündchen, began dating Irina Shayk in late 2023. The relationship was intermittent for four months, but never seemed to take a serious turn. Brady was connected to Brooks Nader, a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model who most recently starred on Dancing With the Stars during the summer. However, after learning of Bündchen's pregnancy with Joaquim Valente, Brady is putting his dating life on hold to focus on his children and work.Also Read: Tom Brady reportedly knew of his ex-wife Gisele Bündchen’s pregnancy with Joaquim Valente's child before the news was made public Bündchen is seven to eight months pregnant, with a due date in early 2025.

He documented the existence of a temple including the shrine of Shiva inside the fort adjacent to a sacred banyan tree.Presently, the temple is recognised as Akshayavat Patalpuri , a subterranean temple accessed through a tunnel situated beneath an elevated mound in the centre of a courtyard.Read more: Maha Kumbh stories The temple connects from the west to its altar, buttressed by pillar tops fashioned in ancient temple architecture. There are seven rows of pillars, each row comprising 12 columns.The temple houses over 40 exquisitely embellished ancient statues of deities and sages arranged systematically along the periphery. The present structure of the temple was erected by Emperor Akbar in the 16th century as part of fort construction.“The temple is located around the roots of Akshayavat—the undecaying holy banyan tree. Patalpuri means beneath the earth. This is a unique temple, which is not below the adjacent flowing river, and nor above the land surface.As per folklore, there is no meaning to Sangam snan until one visits this temple and prays to all deities. Lord Rama came here from Ayodhya to perform Pind Daan of his father Raja Dashrath after completing 14 years of his exile,” said Mahant Ashok Goswami of the temple.Life events of all the deities and sages in the temple are illustrated through intricate murals on the exterior walls of the temple complex.In 2024, Kumbh Mela administration renovated the Akshayavat Patalpuri temple corridor for pilgrims, and illuminated the tunnel of the cavern temple which is now predominantly refurbished with red stones, and wall carvings portraying various Hindu mythological narratives.Speaking to TOI, Hemendra Nath Yojeshwar, who was part of Akshayavat Patalpuri temple management, said, “After renovation, the Akshayavat Patalpuri temple is now more easily accessible to pilgrims who come for Sangam snan. However, the other side of the holy Akshayavat tree is still under Army jurisdiction and thereby a restricted area. Currently, pilgrims can watch the holy tree from a distance while walking through the newly developed corridor. The corridor culminates with a visit to Saraswati koop temple.”",Chinese pilgrim Hiuen-Tsang visited India during the reign of emperor Harshavardhan in AD 644.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Barron Trump’s role in the campaign

Barron Trump has turned 'LADIES' MAN'?!

“He knows his generation”

Where does Barron Trump study?

Will Barron live in the White House?

Barron Trump, the president-elect’s only child with his wife Melania, has been acknowledged for having a notable influence on his father during the election campaign. At the inauguration, all eyes were on Barron again who stood out ofr his remarkable height. The youngest child of president-elect Donald Trump is 6 feet 8 inches tall, making him as tall as LeBron James. At just 18 years old, Barron stands approximately 6 feet 8 inches tall. Remarkably, this may make him the tallest child of a US president in history.According to his mother, Melania Trump, Barron, the youngest son of Donald Trump, played a “very vocal” role in the 2024 presidential election campaign. The 18-year-old helped his father connect with younger voters, contributing to his November election victory.“I’m very proud of him for his knowledge, even about politics and giving advice to his father,” Melania said during an appearance on the Fox News show Fox & Friends last month. “He brought in so many young people. He knows his generation because, nowadays, the young generation, they don’t sit in front of the TV anymore. They’re all on tablets, phones, podcasts, and streamers.“He was very vocal, and he gave advice to his father. It was incredible how he contributed to the campaign’s success because he knew exactly who his father needed to connect with.”Born in New York City on 20 March 2006, Barron is Melania’s only son and Donald Trump’s fifth child. In September 2024, he began his first year at the Stern School of Business at New York University.Unlike many students, Barron is not living in the NYU dorms. Instead, he resides at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan.Speaking on Fox & Friends last week, Melania confirmed that Barron will continue living in New York but will have a room at the White House. This arrangement will allow him to visit with friends whenever he wishes.“Yes [he can bring his friends with him], whatever he would like to do,” Melania said. “I feel that we have our children until they’re about 18 or 19 years old. We teach them, guide them, and then give them the wings to fly. I always respect Barron’s ‘yes’ and ‘no’—what he likes to do and where he wants to be.”","Barron Trump, the president-elect’s only child with his wife Melania, has been acknowledged for having a notable influence on his father during the election campaign.

In a glittering celebration of style and politics, Vice President-elect JD Vance and his wife, Usha, hosted a spectacular dinner at the National Gallery of Art on Saturday evening, serving as a significant prelude to the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump . The event, which also functioned as a reception for Trump’s cabinet selections, was a perfect blend of political significance and glamour.Dressed impeccably for the occasion, the Vances exuded sophistication. Vice President-elect JD Vance donned a classic tuxedo, embracing the formal tone of the evening, while his wife, Usha Vance, wore a custom noir black velvet gown by Oscar de la Renta. The dress featured asymmetrical floral accents and a sweetheart neckline, combining elegance with contemporary style and captivating many onlookers.The designer shared photos of the couple from the ceremony on their official Instagram account. The caption read: “Incoming Second Lady, Usha Vance, wears a custom noir velvet gown with asymmetric floral accents and a sweetheart neckline for the Vice President’s Dinner.”The story of JD and Usha began in the halls of Yale Law School, where they met as students. At that time, JD was vocal about his atheism, having drifted from the Christian faith he was raised in. Yale Law was where he began questioning many aspects of his life, including his worldview and spiritual beliefs, influenced by his tumultuous upbringing in Ohio, as documented in his memoir Hillbilly Elegy. While JD entered law school as a self-described atheist, his relationship with Usha sparked a journey of spiritual exploration.Raised in a Hindu family with deeply ingrained spiritual practices, Usha’s upbringing instilled a sense of devotion, introspection, and a search for purpose, which resonated with JD.Usha’s approach to life and faith became a steadying force for JD, inspiring him to revisit spiritual questions that had long been dormant. Hinduism, with its emphasis on inner peace, self-discipline, and moral duty (dharma), encouraged JD to explore faith beyond mere ritual and dogma. Usha’s perspective helped JD see religion not just as a set of rules but as a path to personal growth, resilience, and understanding—qualities that would eventually shape his political career.In 2014, JD and Usha married in a ceremony that included both Christian and Hindu elements, symbolising a fusion of their faiths and cultural identities. This blending of traditions was significant, marking the beginning of JD’s journey back to Christianity while honouring Usha's Hindu heritage. The marriage ceremony embodied respect for each other’s beliefs, laying the foundation for JD’s eventual conversion to Catholicism, a decision deeply influenced by Usha’s faith journey.For JD, being with Usha brought a newfound respect for the role of spirituality in providing guidance, purpose, and resilience. Her encouragement helped him understand that faith could be a private, personal journey, rather than a public declaration of belief. Gradually, he found himself attending church services, drawn back to the teachings he had left behind in his youth. By 2018, JD had officially returned to the Christian faith, converting to Catholicism. This transformation, though rooted in Christianity, was infused with the spiritual openness that Hinduism often encourages—a respect for different pathways to self-understanding and fulfilment.As JD rose in the political arena, Usha’s Hindu values continued to influence his approach to leadership and policy. Hinduism emphasises duty to one’s community and a moral obligation to uplift society—ideals that have informed JD’s focus on rural America’s struggles and the working class, as seen in his advocacy for middle-American families. The Hindu philosophy of karma yoga, or selfless service, resonated with JD’s desire to address the issues facing his hometown and others like it across the US.JD’s renewed commitment to faith also reshaped his political philosophy. While he had previously held anti-establishment views that often came across as harsh and critical, his relationship with Usha helped him temper this outlook with empathy and a commitment to service. Her influence guided him toward policies focused on economic justice, family welfare, and community values, aligning with the Hindu principle of seva (service).The 2024 election saw JD Vance emerge as the vice-presidential candidate on Donald Trump’s ticket, representing a new era in the GOP. His marriage to Usha, an Indian-American woman rooted in Hindu spirituality, has introduced a unique cultural dimension to the political discourse. This has opened up a dialogue on how diverse backgrounds can enrich American politics, setting an example for cross-cultural understanding and respect.For the Indian-American community, the presence of Usha Vance in the White House signals a historic representation of Hindu values in American leadership. Usha’s Telugu heritage and commitment to her faith resonate with many Indian-Americans, who see her as a symbol of the community’s growing influence in the US. Her fluency in Telugu, and her familiarity with Indian culture, strengthen her potential role as a bridge between the US and India, contributing to a richer, multicultural approach to governance.Usha’s role in the White House holds significance beyond her influence on JD’s faith journey. As an Indian-American, she brings insights that could bolster US-India relations. With her understanding of Indian cultural and religious nuances, Usha is uniquely positioned to facilitate diplomatic conversations that respect cultural heritage, fostering goodwill between the two nations. Her presence in the administration underscores the shared values of family, spirituality, and duty that bind both countries.Moreover, Usha’s background as a Yale-educated attorney with clerkships under Supreme Court justices reflects the potential for intellectual and diplomatic contributions in policy matters, particularly those that intersect with cultural and international relations. Her blend of Hindu spirituality and American legal training is likely to add a nuanced perspective to her husband’s administration, aligning with the increasing recognition of South Asian contributions to American society.Usha Vance’s Hindu faith has been transformative in JD Vance’s personal and spiritual journey, helping him reconnect with Christianity while deepening his understanding of spirituality’s role in public service. Their story exemplifies how interfaith partnerships can enrich personal and professional lives, fostering empathy, tolerance, and a broadened worldview. This union has not only been a cornerstone of JD’s political and moral evolution but also serves as a testament to the growing diversity in American politics.With JD Vance poised to take on the role of Vice President, his journey from atheism to faith, spurred by Usha’s Hindu beliefs, adds a powerful narrative to the American political landscape. It is a story of transformation, resilience, and the unifying potential of faith across cultural divides. Through this partnership, the Vances embody a modern vision of America—one that celebrates diversity and draws strength from shared values, making their story an inspiring chapter in the ongoing journey towards a more inclusive nation.","Vice President-elect JD Vance and his wife, Usha, hosted a spectacular dinner at the National Gallery of Art on Saturday evening.

Executive order amid LA wildfires

Withdrawal process requires one year

Half of Americans oppose withdrawing from accord

Trump's second term could severely impair future climate efforts

US President Donald Trump has announced the United States' second withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement , at the Capital One Arena in Washington during his inaugural parade event. This decision by one of the world's largest carbon polluters undermines international efforts to address global warming and sets the US apart from its allies. The announcement, made as Trump began his second term on Monday, mirrors his 2017 stance.The agreement aims to restrict long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels, or at minimum, maintain temperatures below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels.The voluntary Paris agreement of 2015 enables nations to establish their own targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption. These targets are intended to become progressively stricter, with countries required to submit new plans by February 2025. The departing Biden administration recently proposed reducing US greenhouse gas emissions by over 60 per cent by 2035.Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and a principal architect of the Paris agreement, acknowledged the US withdrawal as unfortunate but emphasised that climate action transcends individual national policies.The current situation differs significantly from 2017, according to Tubiana, noting substantial economic momentum in the global transition, which the US has benefited from but might now lose.The International Energy Agency projects the global market for essential clean energy technologies will reach over $2 trillion by 2035, tripling its current size.Tubiana pointed to the severe wildfires in Los Angeles as evidence that Americans, like others worldwide, are experiencing the intensifying effects of climate change.Gina McCarthy, former White House climate adviser under President Biden, stated that achieving American leadership in the global economy, energy independence, and job creation requires continued focus on expanding the clean energy sector.Current global temperatures exceed mid-1800s levels by 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.3 degrees Celsius). Most climate monitoring organisations reported that global temperatures surpassed the 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit warming threshold last year, unanimously declaring it the warmest on record.The Paris accord withdrawal process requires one year. Trump's previous withdrawal became effective the day after the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden.Despite the initial shock of Trump's first withdrawal from the UN agreement - endorsed by 196 nations - no other country followed suit, according to Alden Meyer, a veteran climate negotiations analyst at E3G.Other nations, along with US investors, businesses, governors, and mayors, maintained their commitment to addressing climate change, experts noted.Nevertheless, they expressed concern about the loss of US leadership in global climate initiatives, particularly as the world faces increasingly severe weather events and record temperatures.""Clearly America is not going to play the commanding role in helping solve the climate crisis, the greatest dilemma humans have ever encountered,"" said climate activist and writer Bill McKibben. ""For the next few years the best we can hope is that Washington won't manage to wreck the efforts of others.""AP-NORC Centre polling indicates approximately half of Americans oppose withdrawing from the climate accord. Republican support for withdrawal is not overwhelming, with slightly less than half in favour and about one-fifth opposed.China surpassed the United States as the largest annual carbon dioxide emitter several years ago. The US, now second, emitted 4.9 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2023, an 11% reduction from a decade earlier, according to Global Carbon Project scientists.However, due to carbon dioxide's atmospheric longevity, the US remains historically responsible for nearly 22 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions since 1950.Experts worry that a second Trump term could severely impair future climate efforts, potentially influencing other nations, particularly China, to reduce their environmental commitments.UN climate change executive secretary Simon Stiell remains hopeful about US participation in the global clean energy transition, warning that non-participation would benefit competitor economies while climate-related disasters intensify.",US President Donald Trump has announced the United States' second withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.

ISLAMABAD: Zalmay Khalilzad , the former US special envoy for Afghanistan during Donald Trump’s first term as president, said on Monday that Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai ’s remarks calling upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women was a “promising development”.Stanikzai’s rare public criticism coincided with ongoing international pressure on Afghanistan ’s leaders to lift restrictions on women’s access to public life in general and to allow girls to attend secondary schools and beyond. He made a direct public appeal to the country’s reclusive leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, to lift the ban and called the exclusion of girls from education an “injustice” on part of the Islamic Emirate against half of Afghanistan’s 40-mn population.“The whole world has a problem with us on this issue. They criticise us for it. But the path we have taken is a matter of our own liking, not the Sharia,” Stanikzai said.Welcoming the stance, Khalilzad highlighted that Stanikzai is an important IEA official who played a key role in the Doha negotiations . As special envoy for Afghanistan, Khalilzad was lead negotiator during the Doha talks.He also asked Afghan religious scholars and leaders of the Islamic Emirate who privately oppose the ban on girls’ education to make their opposition public. Further, he emphasised that schools and universities should be reopened by the beginning of the new solar year, in late March.After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, Akhundzada had imposed his strict interpretation of Sharia law through dozens of decrees, mainly restricting girls’ access to education beyond the sixth grade and banning the majority of women from working or participating in public life.Last August, the Taliban announced a new law on the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, which bars women from traveling or using public transportation without a male guardian. The law requires women and girls to cover their faces in public and prohibits them from singing in public or letting their voices be heard outside the house.","Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai called upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women.

Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif and Chinese officials were present, celebrating the $230 million project, which has a capacity to handle 400,000 passengers annually.The event followed the virtual inauguration of the airport earlier this year by Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.Built under Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the airport aims to bolster trade and attract international investment. It complements the deep-sea port in Gwadar, positioning the coastal city as a key regional trade hub.“The airport will play a crucial role in improving the economy, fostering international investment, and bringing prosperity to Balochistan,” Asif stated during the ceremony.The airport, spanning 4,300 acres, can accommodate various aircraft, including ATR 72, Airbus A-300, and Boeing 747, for both domestic and international routes, according to the Ministry of Planning and Development.The project’s completion faced delays due to increased attacks by separatists in Balochistan, who oppose Chinese investments and accuse them of economic exploitation. The region has long been plagued by an insurgency demanding greater autonomy or independence.Ethnic Baloch groups have criticized the development projects, claiming they benefit outsiders while leaving local communities marginalized.Despite the challenges, Gwadar International Airport symbolizes deeper Pakistan-China ties and reflects China’s strategic interest in the region. The airport is expected to enhance connectivity, trade, and tourism while contributing to the broader goals of the Belt and Road Initiative.As the largest airport in Pakistan by area, the Gwadar facility is set to become a vital link in regional and international trade, though its success depends on addressing ongoing security and political concerns in the province.","Gwadar International Airport is Pakistan’s largest airport, funded and constructed by China in the restive Balochistan province.
