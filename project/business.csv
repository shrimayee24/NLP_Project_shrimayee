Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection. Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group.

Mami Mizutori

tells

Pradeep Thakur

Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people. Excerpts from the interview:

The

estimates 150 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty in 2021 due to Covid-19. How can India minimise the impact?

The US and some other countries reserved enough shots for their citizens. Should India have done the same?

How much success has the UN’s Covax programme achieved?

The second wave of Covid-19 has caused more deaths in India. Where did it go wrong?

Your idea of a ‘global response for future pandemics’ and vaccine distribution?

With Covid disruptions, can countries like India meet the UN’s

target?

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the people and government of India on the tragic loss of life that is taking place across the country.All major disasters which affect low- and middle-income countries result in economic losses on a scale which has a damaging effect on their ability to eradicate poverty and meet other basic needs, including health services and access to education. In the case of Covid-19, we have seen how it has pushed millions into extreme poverty globally, and has contributed to rising levels of hunger in many parts of the world where the informal economy that poor people depend on has been decimated. For all member states, the eradication of poverty cannot be achieved without reducing disaster risk and improved prevention as nothing undermines development like disasters.Much of the world looks to India for vaccine supply but the pharmaceutical supply chain is very complex and specialised to a degree that serving a population the size of India’s was always going to be a gargantuan task. The numbers already vaccinated in India are enormous but manufacturing enough doses to reach over one billion people will take time.The Covax facility portfolio, administered by Gavi, currently consists of agreements related to eight vaccines, including those developed with the Serum Institute of India . Coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO, Covax is making steady progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high risk and vulnerable people, as well as frontline healthcare workers.Covid-19 demonstrates the systemic nature of disaster risk, how a biological hazard can ravage all areas of life starting from public health to all socio-economic aspects of our societies. Unfortunately, many countries, including India, are learning the hard way that prevention requires more patience than previously thought and, in the case of biological hazards, a longer game plan. WHO has warned that when there are mass gatherings, more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low, this can create a perfect storm for the virus to spread in any country. India has done an admirable job in harnessing technology and communication to ensure effective early warning leads to early action in the case of cyclones. The challenge for the government now is to communicate effectively on the continued need for face masks, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings while at the same time rolling out an effective vaccination programme.If the global level of preparedness for this pandemic had matched the warnings, much of the impact could have been reduced. An adequate level of pandemic preparedness would have cost billions instead of the trillions that it is now costing. The loss of life and the economic disruption could have been significantly reduced if we had been adequately prepared from the moment biological hazards were included in the Sendai Framework in 2015. Given the transboundary nature of biological hazards it is obvious that a global response plan is required for future pandemics. A patchwork response is not working for Covid-19, and it will not work against any newly emerging diseases and viruses in the future. It is not acceptable that developing countries should have to wait so long for Covid vaccines. This inequality and lack of solidarity to access affordable vaccines only fuels the spread of the virus, allows the emergence of new variants and prolongs the pandemic. None of us is safe until we are all safe.It is clear that the death toll and economic loss from Covid-19 means that Sendai Framework targets on reducing mortality, numbers of disaster affected people and economic losses has suffered a great setback. However, we are still making significant progress on other targets. Asia and the Pacific are not on track to achieve any of the SDGs.","Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people.

"3 new criminal laws kick in today, data ousts 'danda' as policing tool",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-new-criminal-laws-kick-in-today-data-ousts-danda-as-policing-tool/articleshow/111387621.cms,"Top Picks For You New criminal laws to change the way justice is delivered

NEW DELHI: The criminal justice system is set for a major overhaul with the three new criminal laws - Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA) - coming into force on Monday, replacing the British-era Indian Penal Code , Criminal Procedure Code and the Indian Evidence Act .Starting Monday, all FIRs will be registered under the provisions of BNS.However, all cases registered before July 1 will continue to be tried under IPC, CrPC and Indian Evidence Act until final disposal.BNS has 358 sections, down from 511 in IPC. As many as 21 new crimes have been added in BNS compared to IPC, duration of imprisonment extended in 41 crimes, fines increased in 82 crimes, minimum punishment introduced in 25 crimes, community service introduced as penalty in six crimes and 19 sections removed.BNSS has 531 sections as against 484 in CrPC, with changes in 177 sections, addition of nine sections and 39 sub-sections and deletion of 14 sections. The Indian Evidence Act, with 166 sections, is being replaced with BSA having 170 sections, with change in 24 sections, addition of two new sub-sections and deletion of six sections.BNS, BNSS and BSA are being implemented six months after they were enacted based on protracted and detailed consultations with all stakeholders including SC and HC judges, governors, chief ministers, civil servants, police officers, collectorates and Members of Parliament and legislative assemblies. Around 3,200 suggestions were received and examined over several rounds of talks, with home minister Amit Shah having taken 158 such meetings, leading to the drafting of a whole new set ofcriminal laws that seek to leverage technology to make India's criminal justice system one of the most modern in the world. The BNS, BNSS and BSA bills were referred to a parliamentary standing committee and most of its recommendations were accepted by the govt before bringing the bills to Parliament for approval.The underlying spirit of the new criminal laws , as PM Modi had stated at the All-India DGPs conference in Jan, is ""citizen first, dignity first and justice first"", with emphasis on the 'danda' (baton) being replaced by 'data' as a policing tool.While replying to the debate in Parliament on BNS, BNSS and BSA bills, Shah had underlined that the focus of the new laws was on justice delivery, while safeguarding the rights of victims as well as accused, rather than on punishment. Also, the colonial mindset apparent behind ordering of IPC sections - with those dealing with 'rajdroh' (treason) preceding ones related to serious offences like 'murder' and 'rape' - was being done away with.Under the , a person may report crime online, without having to visit a police station (online FIR) and also file a zero-FIR at any police station. A free copy of the FIR will be provided to the victim. In the event of arrest, the individual will have the right to inform a person of his choice. Arrest details will need to be prominently displayed within police stations and district headquarters.The new laws prioritise investigation for offences against women and children, ensuring timely completion within two months of recording information. Victims shall be entitled to updates on the progress of their case within 90 days.Courts may now grant a maximum of two adjournments to avoid unnecessary delays in case hearings.","Three new criminal laws come into force on Monday. They replace the British-era Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and Indian Evidence Act. As many as 21 new crimes have been added in BNS compared to IPC.

NEET-UG re-test

will ensure there is no change in number of toppers

NEW DELHI: 60% of the 813 NEET applicants who took the re-test after the grace marks awarded to them were rescinded have improved upon their original score, excluding the grace marks. They include 4 of 5 whose score after the addition of grace marks totalled 720, the maximum possible in the test. Marks of another member of the 720 club came down by just 4.However, none of them could match the scores they had with the addition of grace marks.The increases over what they had scored minus the grace marks range between 10 and 40 marks. Although the NTA , unlike in the case of the general NEET, has not released scores, 11 candidates are learnt to have scored 670 or above.These students were among the 1,563 who were given grace marks because they had initially been given a wrong set of question papers and could not get the full three hours and 20 minutes allotted for the test.The grace marks for them sparked an uproar with many led by well-known coaching institutes alleging corruption, leading the National Testing Agency (NTA) to reverse the award of grace marks and give the 1,563 students the choice of appearing for a fresh test or settling for their scores without any grace marks. In the event, only 813 volunteered to take the test afresh.The results of the re-test, announced on Monday, will ensure that there is no change in the number of toppers, which came down to 61 after the exclusion of six whose score had reached 720 after the addition of grace marks.Of the 1,563 candidates, 750 opted to retain their scores without the grace marks. Though their ranks slipped, their original marks; i.e, what they achieved without grace marks, are good enough to land them seats in good govt medical colleges .Allegations of scam gained ground after six of the students who scored 720 were found to have appeared at the same centre, leading the NTA to reverse its decision on grace marks. The change was accepted by Supreme Court .The official statement on Monday read: ""Pursuant to the Order ... a Re-Test was held for 1,563 candidates on 23 June 2024 ..., out of which a total of 813 candidates appeared therein,"" adding, ""It is now informed that revised Score Cards of all Candidates of NEET (UG) 2024 (including of 1,563 Candidates who appeared in the Re-Test on 23 June 2024), are being hosted on the website...""Chandigarh, which had just two candidates registered, saw zero attendance. The Jhajjar centre, which was under scrutiny, registered 58% attendance, with 287 of the 494 candidates taking the test.The NEET-UG exam, held on May 5 across 4,750 centres, saw a little over 23 lakh of the 24 lakh candidates taking the exam. 67 students initially scored a perfect 720, an unprecedented number in NEET's history, with six from one centre in Haryana, raising suspicions of irregularities and the role of grace marks.The NEET-UG exam, conducted by the NTA, is for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH, and other related courses in govt and private institutions across India.The agency is currently under scrutiny for alleged irregularities in the exam, including a paper leak, with various groups calling for a retest.","60% of the 813 NEET applicants who took the re-test after the grace marks awarded to them were rescinded have improved upon their original score.

Dowry Case: Dowry Case Quashed: US-Based Husband Granted Liberty to Prosecute Wife by HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-grants-us-based-man-liberty-to-prosecute-wife-in-dowry-case/articleshow/111372527.cms,"‘Gross misuse of law’

Bengaluru: Citing gross abuse of the process of law, the high court has quashed a dowry harassment and cruelty case brought by a Bengaluru woman against her US-based husband.Quashing the FIR registered by Basavanagudi women police and the chargesheet filed before the city’s 37th additional chief metropolitan magistrate against the husband, Justice M Nagaprasanna has granted liberty to him to prosecute his wife for “malicious prosecution”.The couple married in May 2020. After about two months, the husband went to the US as his H1B visa was to expire soon.He claimed that in Jan 2021, his wife left her matrimonial home to live in a relative’s house. Though the wife got four appointments till May 2021, she failed to attend the visa office to complete the formalities. In Sep, 2021, she was granted a visa in the 5th attempt. As the relationship between the couple turned incorrigible, the husband moved the family court in Bengaluru in Dec 2021, seeking divorce and also filed a police complaint against his wife.In Feb 2022, the wife too filed a complaint against her husband for offences punishable under the Dowry Prohibition Act. Police filed a chargesheet against him and the magistrate court took cognizance of the same in June, 2022.The wife argued that her husband suffered from a sexually transmitted disease and didn't intend to take her to the US and had blocked all channels of communication. She stated that though her husband earned more than Rs 2 crore annually, he didn’t want to part with the same on settlement.Challenging the proceedings, the husband claimed that she had left no stone unturned in painting him black by getting him medically tested, including a test for human papillomavirus infection, a sexually transmitted disease, which all went in vain. According to him, she only wanted his money and demanded Rs 3 crore after all conciliation efforts failed.Justice Nagaprasanna noted that the wife was given 614 grams of silver and 160 grams of gold as per tradition of ‘streedhana’ and the statements of her mother and brother as well as chargesheet materials did not indicate any demand for dowry made by the husband or any cruelty inflicted upon her.The judge pointed out that a mail communication in Dec 2021 showed that the husband had sought confirmation regarding her travel to the US and therefore, it was clearly a bogey projected by her by saying he was not interested in taking her to the US. “The unmistakable conclusion is that the complainant, in gross misuse and abuse of law, has set the criminal law into motion” the judge said.“Such frivolous cases registered by the wife have taken enormous judicial time, be it before the concerned court or before this court, and has led to enormous civil unrest, destruction of harmony and happiness in society. It may not be that these would be the facts in every given case. The court is only concerned about frivolous and vexatious litigations clogging the criminal justice delivery system, where genuine cases lie in the cold storage,” he said.“If the facts narrated herein above are noticed and as observed, the complainant has, in gross misuse and abuse of the process of the law, has set the criminal law into motion. Therefore, it becomes a fit case where the husband must be given the liberty to initiate proceedings for malicious prosecution or initiate proceedings under Section 211 of the IPC. Liberty is thus reserved to the husband, for such action to be initiated in accordance with law, if he so desires,” the judge observed while quashing the proceedings against the husband.","Citing gross abuse of the process of law, the high court has quashed a dowry harassment and cruelty case brought by a Bengaluru woman against her US-based husband.

50k doses of semen & counting: Meet UP’s elite breeder bull,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/50k-doses-of-semen-counting-meet-ups-elite-breeder-bull/articleshow/111374226.cms,"Having contributed over 50,000 doses of semen , Gorakh, the lone Gangatiri bull at the Uttar Pradesh government’s Hapur farm, has emerged a pioneer in the conservation and propagation of high quality Gangatiri germplasm in UP .Gangatiri (Hindi for Ganga banks) is a dual-purpose indigenous breed native to eastern UP & western parts of Bihar. The breed, resistant to a lot of diseases and also economical, has high adaptability to the region and lesser input cost.A Gangatiri cow weighs about 300-350 kg and yields 8-10 litres of milk every day.The genetically improved breed, however, may have a higher yield. The breed was registered by National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) in 2015.Born on Jan 29, 2014, Gorakh has his parentage verified and that’s what made him qualify as the donor for production of sexed semen (in which 90% Y chromosomes are removed) for Gangatiri breed of cows in the state. The two female Gangatiri calves, which were born at the govt’s Varanasi farm on March 26 and March 27, using embryo transfer technology and IVF for Gangatiri cows for the first time in the country, are Gorakh’s progenies. The bull produces over 2200 doses of semen every month.Having a specific ID number, 287020, Gorakh will go strong for at least three more years, says his record. He was born at a gaushala in Mirzapur to Rahu and Pinki, both of whom were elite cows themselves. His induction at the Hapur farm took place in Jan 2015, when he was only a year old. His training for semen collection programme started in August 2019 and two months later, the farm started collecting his semen.Considering that bulls become sexually productive mostly by age of three and may go on to be productive for minimum for up to eight years of age and maximum for up to 15 years or even 18 years, as has been seen in a few cases, Gorakh may have a lot left in him still to give to the programme that he is already contributing to, especially when his record says that he is a bull with good libido and good quality semen.As far as his temperament is concerned, his keepers call him gentle. If Gorakh has been able to donate over 50,000 doses of semen till now, it’s because he has been on a herbal libido enhancer and a balanced diet. His daily diet comprises 7.5 kg of balanced concentrate with 12 kg dry fodder and premix of vitamins, minerals and probiotics. His exercise regimen is also strict and regular to keep him healthy and fit. The farm spends around Rs30,000 on his upkeep every month.It is a tough scan that a bull goes through to qualify as a sperm donor. The first stage is rearing. Many bulls get ousted at this very stage as they may not match the physical standards, or their sperm concentration may be low. The second is the training stage, where the bulls are trained to ejaculate with dummy partners present around to stimulate them. It is the final stage, the collection stage, in which the bull starts donating sperm.There are standards defined for the collection stage as well. The sperm count should be at least 500million per ml of semen for the bull to qualify as the donor. Each ejaculation gives 3-4ml of semen. Gorakh may have already matched the minimum standards to emerge as the pioneer sperm donor for Gangatiri cows. At present, he is the only male contributor to the programme. Officials said that there was one more male, but he died a few years ago.Dr Neeraj Gupta, CEO, UP Livestock Development Board, said, “There are norms defined for every stage. Each stage is monitored by experts. The collection is done scientifically and under the supervision of the experts.”The dummy partners for Gorakh are other male bulls, who are given an artificial vagina, which has a standard temperature of 37 degrees C to provide natural warmth to the male during ejaculation. Gorakh would mount the dummy partners each time he issexually stimulated. The process is done in the presence of experts and it has to be a swift collection of semen. The sperm is flushed twice a week, if done more, the semen quality might deteriorate. Every time the semen is flushed, it gives at least 200 doses, which is 400 doses in a week. Going by the standards, 2 lakh doses of semen may be taken from a bull in its lifetime.Gorakh is ten years but fit to go long. When embryo transfer technology (ETT) and IVF were used to produce Gangatiri cows for the first time in the country, at UP’s Varanasi farm, in July-August 2023, four elite females at the farm were selected as the egg donors, after their records of lactation and parentage were verified. The sexed semen from Gorakh was used to fertilize the eggs in-vivo (inside the body).Later, after about seven days, the embryos were flushed from the donor cows and transferred into four recipient cows, who may not have been of high merit for being merely the surrogate. At the end, because only two pregnancies were successful, two calves were born.The ETT is being extensively used for improvement of indigenous cow breeds at various places as elite cows are used as egg and sperm donors. The standard gestation period for cows is over nine months. Going by that standard, one female may produce one calf in a year, mostly. Through ETT, an elite cow can produce multiple progenies in a year. Ravinder, principal secretary, animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries, said, “In the current booming era of Artificial Intelligence, future strategy and better planning on artificial insemination (AI) will bring significant improvement in the entire livestock herd and reduce the risk of financial insecurity of farmers from unpredictable loss of agriculture returns. In the near future, the calf born through AI with elite genetics is going to pay a premium to farmers as predictive analytics can be made much before the progeny comes into production.”","Gangatiri (Hindi for Ganga banks) is a dual-purpose indigenous breed native to eastern UP & western parts of Bihar. The breed, resistant to a lot of diseases and also economical, has high adaptability to the region and lesser input cost. A Gangatiri cow weighs about 300-350 kg and yields 8-10 litres of milk.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111374239,imgsize-47912,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/111374239.jpg"

The bills included one for the creation of four new corporations—Karaikudi, Tiruvannamalai , Pudukottai , and Namakkal—by upgrading existing municipalities.The assembly approved amendments to allow for the declaration of local areas as a town panchayat, municipality and corporation without adhering to the population and income criteria specified in the Urban Local Bodies Act.Currently, a local area must have a population of at least three lakh and an annual income of at least Rs 30 crore to be constituted as a municipal corporation. However, the government declared Karaikudi , Tiruvannamalai, Pudukottai, and Namakkal as corporations in March due to their historical significance and pilgrimage appeal, despite their populations being under three lakh.“In many of the district headquarters, historically important towns and pilgrimage towns having less than the prescribed population and income limit, there is continuous vertical growth because of robust urbanisation, and there is a need for better infrastructure facilities necessitating the declaration of such local areas as a town panchayat, municipality or corporation,” said municipal administration minister K N Nehru.He noted that there were 11 district collectorates located in village panchayats in the state which have to be upgraded and tourist destinations which also have to be upgraded. More than 56 MLAs have given representations to upgrade to municipalities.The assembly passed a bill mandating that owners or occupiers of any premises or private streets where there is a sewer within 30 metre must get a sewer connection.Other bills approved include the repeal of 111 outdated and redundant laws and 115 Appropriation Acts enacted between 2001 and 2022.

Banks on alert! The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks , following credible intelligence reports. Banks have been instructed to actively monitor their systems round the clock to detect any threats.In an advisory issued on June 24, the RBI said, ""In the light of credible threat intelligence received regarding potential cyberattacks, regulated entities are advised to put in place enhanced state of surveillance and resilience capabilities to guard against these threats.""According to an ET report, RBI's communication preceded a social media post suggesting that LulzSec , a group notorious for several high-profile attacks, was targeting Indian banks.The group, which was thought to have become inactive, is said to have resurfaced.Banks are required to continuously monitor network activities and server logs to identify any malicious intrusions. Additionally, they must keep a close watch on critical payment systems, including SWIFT (the messaging system for international fund transfers), card networks (facilitating card payments), and domestic real-time fund transfer frameworks such as RTGS, NEFT, and UPI.RBI has issued a reminder to banks, urging them to implement standard controls to safeguard against threats such as DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. These attacks involve hackers launching a coordinated assault on a bank's systems, overwhelming them with a flood of queries that hinder the processing of legitimate customer requests and transactions on the website and online services.In addition to DDoS protection, banks are required to impose restrictions on remote logins and access to critical systems. They must also conduct thorough scans of all information systems to detect viruses and malware, and ensure that the latest patches are installed after necessary testing.Also Read | RBI’s overseas gold reserves drop to 6-year low!

Typically, when there is some hint of a possible cyberattack, banks simultaneously test the efficacy of their continuity and contingency plans. It's the same this time”.The regulatory communication emphasizes the importance of banks having robust offline backup and recovery strategies in place, and testing their effectiveness.The official further stated, ""Given the numerous instances of attacks, some of which may go unreported, authorities and institutions can't take intelligence input lightly.""","The Reserve Bank of India has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks.

Supreme Court justice criticizes HC judges for lack of discipline and efficiency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-justice-criticizes-hc-judges-for-lack-of-discipline-and-efficiency/articleshow/111418162.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court 's justice Bhushan R Gavai on Monday shockingly noted that some high court judges discharge their judicial work for just one hour daily against a stipulated six hours, some misbehave with lawyers , and some others arrogate themselves to such an extent to summon government officials at the drop of a hat.Speaking at the eastern zone judicial conference at National Judicial Academy, Kolkata, Justice Gavai said, ""Some Judges in some HCs do not sit on time.It is shocking to know that some of the Judges, though the court timings are 10.30 am, sit at 11.30 am and get up at 12.30 pm though the court timings are up to 1.30 pm. It is more shocking to know that some of the judges do not sit in the second half.""Justice Gavai, who is part of the SC Collegium that selects candidates for judgeship, said, ""Information is also received about how the Judges behave with the lawyers. The lawyers are not treated with the dignity they deserve and are often humiliated by Judges. We should not forget that judges and lawyers are co-equal partners in the administration of justice; none superior, none inferior. Misbehaving with lawyers does not enhance the dignity of the institution, but rather undermines it.""Deprecating the habit of certain HC judges to derive pleasure in summoning government officials at the drop of a hat, the SC judge said, ""They should understand that Government officials are also required to discharge their duties in the field and unless the conduct is so reckless, such directions should be avoided.""He also cautioned HC judges against breaching judicial discipline by passing orders contrary to precedential judgments and said, ""such a practice is not in consonance with the principle of judicial discipline and fraternity and harms the reputation of the pious Institution.""Justice Gavai, who would become CJI mid-next year, also found it rather strange that certain HC judges canvass for their elevation with SC judges when the Collegium decides appointments purely on merit and suitability. ""When we are talking about discipline, it pains to mention that some of the Judges even go to the extent of canvassing their candidature for elevation to the Supreme Court,"" he said.""They try to prove their case as to how they are more suitable for elevation to the Supreme Court than the other senior Judges of the said Court…. In my view, such canvassing by Judges is injurious to the principle of discipline that we should maintain,"" he said. The SC judge also appealed to HC judges to deliver judgments expeditiously and write in simple language for a litigant to understand.He said the integrity of the judicial process is intertwined with the ability of the judges to remain unaffected by what is circulated in social media and decide cases solely based on law and facts, without being swayed by public sentiment or media commentary.""While live telecasts of judicial proceedings of the SC and the HCs further the objective of judicial transparency and accountability, there are growing concerns about misinterpretation and misquoting of observations made by the judges in ongoing cases... Judges' remarks, intended as tentative thoughts or questions to probe the arguments of counsel, can be taken out of context and used to influence public opinion or pressure the judiciary,"" he said.Touching upon the contentious issue of cooperative federalism, Justice Gavai said, ""Goods and Services Tax (GST) was a step towards advancing cooperative federalism and strengthening the country’s economic integration…. While cooperative federalism is essential for maintaining India’s unity and integrity, competition, contestation or friction between the different federal units, when exercised in a democratic and constitutional manner, is equally necessary for the country’s overall development.""He said conflicts continue to arise despite a detailed constitutional framework for the distribution of powers between the Union and the States. ""Despite this clear demarcation, conflicts inevitably arise due to overlapping jurisdictions, differing political interests, and the evolving nature of governance challenges. Therefore, courts have to play a crucial role in resolving the conflict,"" he said.",Supreme Court's justice Bhushan R Gavai on Monday shockingly noted that some high court judges discharge their judicial work for just one hour daily against a stipulated six hours.

This will require upgrade of the courts, which is in the works since 2020 in consultation with the Supreme Court and the necessary software having been readied.“With the required technological readiness at the level of police and courts, the laws will be fully implemented and the process from registration of FIR to final disposal right upto the level of Supreme Court will not take more than three years,” the home minister assured at a press conference here.“From today, all FIRs will be registered as per provisions of BNS,” he said, adding that over 6 lakh police officers across the country’s 17,000 police stations, 21,000 subordinate judiciary officials and 20 thousand public prosecutors have been trained. He added that the Cabinet recently cleared the setting up of additional campuses of the National Forensic Sciences University (CFSU) and establishment of more Central Forensic Science Laboratories (CFSL) in the states. Shah said this will help create more than 40,000 trained forensic manpower in three years, meeting the additional requirement of forensic experts thanks to the provision in BNSS for mandatory visit by a forensic team to the crime scene in offences punishable with seven years or more.Shah on Monday said that the criminal justice system is now fully “swadeshi”, based on laws passed by Parliament, unlike the IPC, CrPC and Indian Evidence Act that were a legacy of the British rule. “The new laws have replaced punishment with justice...and delay with speedy trial. Earlier laws only protected the rights of the police but the new ones protect the rights of victims and complainants as well,” he stated.Shah said the new criminal laws prioritise crimes against women and children, with a chapter dedicated to these and the provisions made more sensitive towards the victim. For the first time, mob lynching has been defined and severe punishment provided for it.As per the home minister, provisions have been made in the laws for embracing technologies to be developed over the next 50 years. Almost 99.9 per cent of the country’s police stations have been computerized with the process of generating e-records having started in 2019. Shah said zero-FIR, e-FIR and chargesheet will all be digital in the new laws. The laws set timelines for investigation, chargesheet and trial, etc, enabling time-bound justice for the common citizen.Shah said the new laws — when fully implemented with interoperability of the police, courts, prosecution, forensics and prisons — are expected to raise the conviction rate to 90 per cent .Shah said BSA has leveraged technology in the field of evidence. Now server logs, location evidence and voice messages will be admissible as evidence.","All the Union territories, including Delhi, are expected to fully roll out the three criminal laws by August 15.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Pornography Prevention: Australian firms given six months to develop code to prevent children from seeing porn,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australian-firms-given-six-months-to-develop-code-to-prevent-children-from-seeing-porn/articleshow/111418386.cms,"NEW DELHI: Australia is giving the internet industry six months to develop an enforceable code to prevent children from accessing pornography and other inappropriate materials online, or the government will intervene and implement mandatory regulations, a regulator announced on Tuesday.The eSafety commissioner said that it reached out to members of the online industry demanding a plan by October 3 explaining how they plan to protect minors from seeing the stimulating high-impact material before they are ready, also including themes of suicide and eating disorders.The code should be standardized for how app stores, websites including pornography and dating websites, search engines, social media platforms, chat services, and even multi-player gaming platforms verify that the content is suitable for the users, the commissioner said.The demand starts a second phase of industry codes overseen by the regulator, which has previously approved codes, looking at how internet companies stop the spread of terrorism or child sexual exploitation content.The code for protecting children from pornography should have certain measures including, age verification, default parental controls , and software that blurs or filters unwanted sexual content, the regulator said.""Kids' exposure to violent and extreme pornography is a major concern for many parents and carers, and they have a key role to play,"" said Commissioner Julie Inman Grant in a statement.""But it can't all be on them. We also need industry to play their part by putting in some effective barriers,"" she added.A spokesperson for Google , a unit of Alphabet, said the company would collaborate with the industry on the new code and a spokesperson for Facebook and Instagram owner Meta said the company continued to engage constructively with the eSafety commissioner.Representatives of X, formerly Twitter, and app store provider Apple were not immediately available for comment.","Australia is giving the internet industry six months to develop an enforceable code to prevent children from accessing pornography and other inappropriate materials online.

Tropical Storm Beryl: Hurricane Beryl razes southeast Caribbean as a record-breaking category 4 storm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hurricane-beryl-razes-southeast-caribbean-as-a-record-breaking-category-4-storm/articleshow/111417768.cms,"BRIDGETOWN: Hurricane Beryl ripped off doors, windows, and roofs in homes across the southeastern Caribbean on Monday after making landfall on the island of Carriacou as the earliest storm of Category 4 strength to form in the Atlantic, fueled by record warm waters.There were no immediate reports of possible deaths or injuries, with communications largely down across the region.Streets from St. Lucia island south to Grenada were strewn with shoes, trees, downed power lines, and scores of other debris scattered by winds up to 150 mph (240 kph), just shy of a Category 5 storm. The storm snapped banana trees in half and killed cows that lay in green pastures as if they were sleeping, with homes made of tin and plywood tilting precariously nearby.""Right now, I'm real heartbroken,"" said Vichelle Clark King as she surveyed her damaged shop in the Barbadian capital of Bridgetown that was filled with sand and water. Beryl was still swiping the southeast Caribbean late Monday afternoon even as it began moving into the Caribbean Sea on a track that would take it just south of Jamaica and toward Mexico's Yucatan peninsula by late Thursday as a Category 1 storm.Late Monday, Beryl's winds increased to 155 mph (250) kilometers, on the brink of becoming a Category 5 storm.Beryl was located about 575 miles (925 kilometers) east-southeast of Isla Beata in the Dominican Republic and was moving west-northwest at 21 mph (33 kph), with hurricane conditions possible on Jamaica Wednesday.A hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, and a tropical storm warning for the entire southern coast of Hispaniola, an island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.""Beryl is expected to remain an extremely dangerous major hurricane as it moves over the eastern Caribbean,"" the National Hurricane Center said.The last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.On Monday afternoon, officials received ""reports of devastation"" from Carriacou and surrounding islands, said Terence Walters, Grenada's national disaster coordinator. Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said he would travel to Carriacou as soon as it's safe, noting there's been an ""extensive"" storm surge.Grenada officials had to evacuate patients to a lower floor after the hospital roof was damaged, he said.""There is the likelihood of even greater damage,"" he told reporters. ""We have no choice but to continue to pray.""In Barbados , Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information, said drones - which are faster than crews fanning across the island - would assess the damage once Beryl passes.Historic hurricane Beryl strengthened from a tropical depression to a major hurricane in just 42 hours - a feat accomplished only six other times in Atlantic hurricane history, and with Sept. 1 as the earliest date, according to hurricane expert Sam Lillo.It also was the earliest Category 4 Atlantic hurricane on record, besting Hurricane Dennis, which became a Category 4 storm on July 8, 2005.Beryl amassed its strength from record-warm waters that are hotter now than they would be at the peak of hurricane season in September, said hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry.Beryl also marked the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher.On Sunday night, Beryl formed a new eye, or center, something that usually weakens a storm slightly as it grows larger in area. Experts say it's now back to strengthening.Jaswinderpal Parmar of Fresno, California, who was among the thousands who traveled to Barbados for Saturday's Twenty20 World Cup cricket final, said he and his family were now stuck there with scores of other fans, their flights canceled on Sunday.He said by phone that it's the first time he has experienced a hurricane - he and his family have been praying, as well as taking calls from concerned friends and family as far away as India.""We couldn't sleep last night,"" Parmar, 47, said.Looking ahead Even as Beryl bore down on the southeast Caribbean, government officials warned about a cluster of thunderstorms mimicking the hurricane's path that have a 70% chance of becoming a tropical depression.""There's always a concern when you have back-to-back storms,"" Lowry said. ""If two storms move over the same area or nearby, the first storm weakens the infrastructure, so the secondary system doesn't need to be as strong to have serious impacts.""Beryl is the second named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto made landfall in northeast Mexico and killed four people.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.","Beryl is the earliest storm of Category 4 strength to form in the Atlantic, fueled by record warm waters.

"Australia foreign student visa policy changes: Fees doubled, extension gets difficult",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-foreign-student-visa-policy-changes-fees-doubled-extension-gets-difficult/articleshow/111391412.cms,"Gets difficult to extend stay

NEW DELHI: Australia has significantly increased the visa fee for international students, more than doubling the cost from A$710 to A$1,600. This new fee structure, effective from July 1, aims to manage record migration numbers that have exacerbated housing market pressures.Furthermore, recent regulations prohibit visitor visa holders and students with temporary graduate visas from applying onshore for a student visa.""The changes coming into force today will help restore integrity to our international education system, and create a migration system which is fairer, smaller and better able to deliver for Australia,"" said home affairs minister Clare O'Neil in a statement.Official data released in March indicated that net immigration surged by 60%, reaching a record-high of 548,800 people in the year leading up to September 30, 2023. This new fee places Australia significantly higher than its competitors, with the US charging approximately $185 and Canada around C$150 ($110) for student visas.In addition to the fee hike, the government is closing existing loopholes that allow foreign students to extend their stay in Australia continuously. The number of students holding a second or subsequent student visa rose by over 30% to exceed 150,000 in the 2022-23 period.This move adds to a series of policy changes since late last year aimed at tightening student visa rules. The removal of Covid-19 restrictions in 2022 has contributed to a substantial increase in annual migration.In March, English language requirements for these visas were made more stringent. In May, the requisite amount of savings international students needed to secure a visa was increased to A$29,710 from A$24,505, marking the second hike in less than a year.International education is a significant export industry for Australia, contributing A$36.4 billion to the economy during the 2022-2023 financial year. These policy changes may impact the sector's strength going forward.","Australia has significantly increased the visa fee for international students, more than doubling the cost from A$710 to A$1,600.

Increase in juvenile crimes: The shocking way China is reacting to brutal murders of little girls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/increase-in-juvenile-crimes-the-shocking-way-china-is-reacting-to-brutal-murders-of-little-girls/articleshow/111391229.cms,"China is grappling with a series of horrific murders of young girls perpetrated by boys as young as 12 years old. However, the way the communist country handles juvenile killers is almost as shocking, often allowing them to avoid jail time and instead sending them to mental institutions for brief periods. In some instances, the young offenders are even permitted to return to school shortly after committing their crimes, according to a news report from New York Post.As China attempts to address the issue of holding children accountable for these heinous acts, which are most notoriously committed against other children, the parents of the victims frequently find themselves waiting for justice that may never arrive.For many years, nations across the globe have grappled with the challenge of striking a balance between imposing penalties and extending mercy to young lawbreakers. This discussion is particularly significant in China, where the historical approach of showing relative clemency to juvenile offenders sharply contrasts with the restricted rights afforded to adult criminal defendants. The Chinese government has long prioritized the education and rehabilitation of young offenders over incarceration.However, in recent times, there has been a growing public outcry in response to this approach. A series of high-profile murders allegedly perpetrated by minors in the past few years has prompted many Chinese citizens to demand stricter measures against juvenile crime . The government has taken notice of these calls for change and has begun to take action in response to the shifting public sentiment.Gong Junli, whose 8-year-old daughter was brutally stabbed to death by a 13-year-old boy, is one of the latest grieving parents awaiting the Supreme People's Court 's (SPC) decision on whether to sentence his child's killer to prison.In March, the story of a single father's ordeal gained attention when authorities decided to file criminal charges against a teenage boy. Red Star News reported that the boy allegedly lured the man's daughter into a wooded area in Xinjing Township in September 2022.Once in the woods, the boy reportedly stabbed the girl several times and left her body among a group of poplar trees, according to officials.The authorities reported that the 13-year-old suspect had allegedly gathered various items, including knives, blades, disposable gloves, and plastic ropes, in preparation for the crime. These tools were strategically hidden in a wooded area where the suspect had asked the victim to join him for play.Authorities reported that the teenage suspect displayed a lack of remorse and spoke about the incident in a casual manner during police questioning.In 2021, China reduced the age of criminal responsibility from 14 to 12. However, unlike in the United States, children are not sent to detention centres, and adult-level punishments are seldom imposed for murder. The lenient sentencing practices were common even before the 2021 amendment, with young offenders often being sent to juvenile rehabilitation centres or psychological correction facilities for short periods.Despite the new law, China continues to witness increased cases against juveniles. Between 2020 and 2023, prosecutors charged 243,000 minors, with an average case increase of 5% per year. The SPC recently announced that it had handed down sentences against 12,000 minors in the first three months of 2024 and issued new guidelines on preventing juvenile crime, suggesting that courts could hold parents and guardians responsible for their children's actions.The court specifically noted that 30% of those who committed violent crimes between 2021 and 2013 were from ""left-behind"" or single-parent families. Left-behind children, who remain in rural areas while their parents work in cities, also make up a significant portion of bullying victims in China. The recent spate of violent incidents has prompted calls for parents to return home and focus on raising their children, with the Supreme People's Court urging communities to work together to address the issue.","China is grappling with a series of horrific murders of young girls perpetrated by boys as young as 12 years old.

US said to seek Boeing guilty plea to avoid trial in 737 Max crashes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-said-to-seek-boeing-guilty-plea-to-avoid-trial-in-737-max-crashes/articleshow/111413451.cms,"The US justice department plans to allow Boeing to avoid a criminal trial if it agrees to plead guilty to a fraud charge stemming from two fatal crashes of its 737 Max more than five years ago, according to two lawyers for families of the crash victims.Federal officials shared details of the offer on a call with the families Sunday before bringing the deal to Boeing, according to the lawyers, Paul G Cassell and Mark Lindquist.The terms include a nearly $244 million fine, a new investment in safety improvements, three years of scrutiny from an external monitor, and a meeting between Boeing's board and the victims' families, said Cassell, a University of Utah law professor. The justice department did not respond to a request for comment, while Boeing declined to comment.Cassell, who represents more than a dozen of the families, said that he and the families found the deal to be ""outrageous"". He described the offer as a ""sweetheart plea deal "" because it would not force Boeing to admit fault in the deaths of the 346 people who died in the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in late 2018 and early 2019.The terms reportedly being offered to Boeing would update a 2021 settlement that resolved the criminal charge accusing the aerospace giant of a conspiracy to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration. The new agreement would require Boeing to plead guilty to that charge, according to the lawyers. The 2021 criminal charge centered on two employees who were accused of withholding information from the FAA about changes made to software known as MCAS, which was later implicated in the crashes.If Boeing agrees to plead guilty to the charge, the company would also admit to a set of facts laid out in that 2021 agreement, which Cassell criticised as a ""whitewashed"" narrative in which Boeing escapes blame for the deaths.Under the earlier deal, the company agreed to pay $500 million to the victims' families. It also agreed to pay more than $1.7 billion to its customers because they could not take deliveries of the Max during a 20-month global ban on the jet. The 2021 settlement is known as a deferred prosecution agreement, a type of deal often used in criminal cases against corporations, allowing companies to avoid charges if they do not engage in wrongdoing for a certain period.The new plea deal comes just days before a July 7 deadline for the justice department to file criminal charges in the case. Boeing will have until the end of the week to decide whether to accept the deal, according to Cassell.","Federal officials shared details of the offer on a call with the families Sunday before bringing the deal to Boeing.

We really severed those interactions, and you don't get that time back for kids.""Researchers said several aspects of the pandemic affected young children - parental stress , less exposure to people, lower preschool attendance, more time on screens and less time playing. Brook Allen, in Martin, Tennessee, has taught kindergarten for 11 years. This year, for the first time, she said, several students could barely speak, several were not toilet trained, and several did not have the fine motor skills to hold a pencil. Children don't engage in imaginative play or seek out other children the way they used to, said Michaela Frederick, a pre-K teacher for students with learning delays in Tennessee. She's had to replace small building materials in her classroom with big soft blocks because students' fine motor skills weren't developed enough.Perhaps the biggest difference Lissa O'Rourke has noticed among her preschoolers in Florida has been their inability to regulate their emotions: ""It was knocking over chairs, it was throwing things, it was hitting their peers, hitting their teachers."" One explanation for young children's struggles, experts say, is parental stress during the pandemic. A baby who is exposed to more stress will show more activation on brain imaging scans in ""the parts of that baby's brain that focus on fear and focus on aggression"", said Rahil D. Briggs, a child psychologist. That leaves less energy for parts of the brain focused on language, exploration and learning, she said. Time on screens also spiked during the pandemic as parents juggled work and children were cooped up at home. Experts believe that this affected attention spans and fine motor skills.It's too early to know whether young children will experience long-term effects from the pandemic, but researchers say there are reasons to be optimistic. ""It is absolutely possible to catch up,"" said Dr. Dani Dumitriu, a pediatrician at Columbia. Sarrah Hovis, a preschool teacher in Michigan. said she has seen great progress. By the end of this year, some of her students were counting to 100, and even adding and subtracting. ""If the kids come to school,"" she said, ""they do learn.""","Pandemic's babies, toddlers and preschoolers are now school-age. Many are showing signs of being academically and developmentally behind. One explanation for young children's struggles, experts say, is parental stress. It's too early to know whether young children will experience long-term effects from the pandemic.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111413446,imgsize-1251575,width-400,resizemode-4/111413446.jpg"
Flash flood warning issued in parts of New York,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/flash-flood-warning-issued-for-parts-of-new-york/articleshow/111411863.cms,"National Weather Service (NWS) has released flash flood warnings for several areas within the New York metropolitan region, which are expected to remain in effect until at least 8.00pm EDT on June 30. The boroughs under the warning include Brooklyn, Manhattan, Richmond, and Queens. Authorities may update or modify the warning for the affected areas or nearby regions in the upcoming hours.Persistent heavy rainfall could lead to flooding in low-lying areas close to rivers, streams, and creeks.Flooding in urban areas is also a possibility, particularly in developed regions with drainage systems that can quickly become overwhelmed by stormwater. Areas situated downstream from sizable reservoirs or rivers may be vulnerable to flash flooding after relatively brief periods of intense rainfall. In hilly or mountainous terrain, especially where the soil has been saturated by heavy precipitation, there is a risk of landslides.In low-lying areas, localized business disruptions may occur due to flood damage to facilities, potential evacuations, and the inability of some employees to reach their workplaces. As a result, some businesses might not be able to operate at full capacity.Google Trends data show a significant spike in searches related to flash flood safety tips and real-time weather updates as residents seek information on how to protect themselves and their property.On Sunday, severe thunderstorms moved through New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, bringing torrential downpours, damaging winds, hail, and the potential for tornado formation. Some regions were forecasted to receive 2 to 3 inches of rainfall, which could result in flash flooding.A severe thunderstorm warning issued for New York City expired at 5.15 pm (local time). The rest of the Tri-State Area was under a severe thunderstorm watch until 7pm.In September 2023, New York City experienced chaos as relentless rainfall caused flash floods , disrupting subway services and transforming city streets into water-filled obstacles.

Congress, CPN-UML strike overnight deal to form new coalition",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/kp-sharma-oli-to-be-nepals-next-pm-congress-cpn-uml-strike-overnight-deal-to-form-new-coalition/articleshow/111418185.cms,"In a surprise political shift, the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) ( CPN-UML ) struck a deal to form a new coalition government.This agreement, reached between Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli , is set to see Oli becoming the Prime Minister for the next one and a half years, followed by Deuba for the remaining term until the next election.This development is set to collapse the government formed on March 4, led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda with a formal announcement expected soon.The agreement, signed overnight, allows KP Sharma Oli to lead the government initially while Deuba will take over after one and a half years. The formal announcement of this new alliance is expected soon. “Agreement has been signed between Nepali Congress leader Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli overnight to form a new government. As per which Oli will lead the government for the next one and a half years and Deuba the remaining time until the election which lies three years ahead,” a senior Nepali Congress leader present at the meeting told news agency ANI.The two parties also agreed on the division of ministries. According to a UML leader, the party leading the government will not get the home ministry. Apart from the central government, the two parties also agreed on the distribution of leadership in various provinces. The CPN-UML will lead the governments in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces, while the Congress will lead in Bagmati, Gandaki, and Far-Western provinces. The Madhesh-based parties will head the government in Madhesh Province. The UML leader confirmed, “The party who will be leading the government will not get the Home Ministry has been agreed. Apart from the union government, the CPN-UML will be forming a government in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces while the Congress will lead the Bagmati, Gandaki and Far-Western provinces. The Madhesh-based parties will lead the government in Madhesh Province has been agreed between the two leaders.”Additionally, the new alliance has established a committee to suggest amendments to the election procedures and the constitution. The committee is led by former Chief Justice Kalyan Shrestha. The largest and second-largest parties in the parliament also drafted a constitutional amendment agreement, which states that the Vice President would be made the chairman of the National Assembly.Before signing, leaders from the Congress and UML briefed President Ram Chandra Paudel about the coalition change. During their meeting, the leaders informed the President about activating Section 76 (2) to form a new government if the incumbent Prime Minister, Prachanda, failed to take a vote of confidence after UML withdrew its support.Prachanda, who came to power after the 2022 general elections and has tested the floor of parliament four times, must now seek a new vote of confidence. There has been no immediate reaction from the Maoist Center, led by Prachanda, regarding the change in coalition. However, during Monday's cabinet meeting, Dahal assured the ministers that the current alliance would remain intact.The minister for communication and information technology Rekha Sharma, quoting Dahal, said, “The reports in the media are just rumors. We are still in dialogue with our coalition partners.” “The Prime Minister briefed us on the internal situation and dismissed external rumors. There are concerns about what will happen to this government, but there will be no changes. Some want this coalition to be short-lived, but we are determined to keep this government stable for a long time,” she added.Earlier on March 4, Prachanda revived a coalition with the CPN-UML, surprising the largest coalition partner, Nepali Congress. A new coalition, including the CPN-UML, CPN-Maoist Center, Rastriya Swatantra Party, and Janata Samajwadi Party, was initially formed. However, the Nepali Congress formally withdrew its support the following day, activating Article 100 Sub-section (2). According to this article, a Prime Minister is required to secure the threshold of 50 percent, which is 138 votes as per the present number of parliamentarians.As a result of the coalition split, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal also left the government and joined the opposition. Pushpa Kamal Dahal came to power in December 2022 by aligning with arch-rival CPN-UML, after previously forging an alliance with the Nepali Congress for the November 2022 election.The vote of confidence on January 10, 2023, saw extensive support for Dahal, with 268 out of 270 present parliamentarians voting in favor, marking the highest percentage in the known history of the Nepali parliament since the establishment of democracy. However, within three months, Dahal realigned with the Nepali Congress, securing a majority in the vote of confidence on March 20, 2023. In this second vote, Dahal received 172 votes out of 262 lawmakers present, with 89 votes against him, while one abstained.","The Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) ( CPN-UML ) struck a deal to form a new coalition government.

Melting ice due to climate change unmasks Everest's hidden tragedies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/melting-ice-due-to-climate-change-unmasks-everests-hidden-tragedies/articleshow/111302957.cms,"The sacred slopes of Mount Everest are witnessing the effects of climate change as the snow and ice cover thins, exposing the bodies of hundreds of mountaineers who lost their lives pursuing their dream of reaching the world's highest peak. This year, a team of climbers and military personnel embarked on a mission not to summit the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) mountain, but to retrieve some of the corpses, risking their own lives in the process.As part of Nepal's mountain clean-up campaign on Everest, Lhotse, and Nuptse, the team successfully recovered five frozen bodies, including one that was reduced to skeletal remains.The task was arduous, dangerous, and emotionally challenging.Rescuers spent hours chipping away at the ice with axes and sometimes using boiling water to release the bodies from the frozen grip. Major Aditya Karki, who led the team, said, ""Because of the effects of global warming , (the bodies and trash) are becoming more visible as the snow cover thins.""Over 300 people have died on Everest since expeditions began in the 1920s, with eight fatalities in this season alone. Many bodies remain on the mountain, some hidden by snow or lost in deep crevasses, while others have become landmarks along the route to the summit, earning nicknames such as ""Green Boots"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"".The presence of these bodies can have a psychological impact on climbers, as they believe they are entering a sacred space.Retrieving bodies from the ""death zone,"" where thin air and low oxygen levels increase the risk of altitude sickness, is a controversial and challenging task. It requires significant financial resources, with each body requiring up to eight rescuers and weighing over 100 kilograms (220 pounds).However, Major Karki emphasised the necessity of the rescue effort, saying, ""We have to bring them back as much as possible. If we keep leaving them behind, our mountains will turn into a graveyard.""The retrieved bodies, once brought down from the mountain, are transported to Kathmandu. Two of the bodies have been preliminarily identified, and authorities are awaiting detailed tests for final confirmation. Those that remain unidentified will likely be cremated.Despite the recovery efforts, the mountain still holds its secrets. The body of British climber George Mallory, who went missing during a 1924 summit attempt, was only discovered in 1999. His climbing partner, Andrew Irvine, and their camera, which could provide evidence of a successful summit and rewrite mountaineering history, have never been found.In addition to the body retrieval mission, the clean-up campaign, with a budget of over $600,000, employed 171 Nepali guides and porters to remove 11 tonnes of rubbish from the mountain.The well-trodden route to the summit is littered with fluorescent tents, discarded climbing equipment, empty gas canisters, and even human excreta. While current expeditions are under pressure to remove their waste, historic rubbish remains a challenge.As Tshiring Jangbu Sherpa, who led the body retrieval expedition, said, ""The mountains have given us mountaineers so many opportunities. I feel that we have to give back to them, we have to remove the trash and bodies to clean the mountains.""","Mount Everest is witnessing the effects of climate change as the snow and ice cover thins.

Who is expected to emerge victorious?

How does the UK decide its Prime Minister?

Key issues in UK

The following are the key figures and parties contesting in this crucial national poll:

Keir Starmer

Rishi Sunak

Nigel Farage

Swinney, Davey and Denyer

In a surprising move, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called for an early general election on July 4, a decision that many in Westminster believe will result in his defeat. The outcome of this election will determine whether the Conservative party's 14-year rule will come to an end, paving the way for a centre-left Labour government led by Keir Starmer , or if Sunak can pull off an unexpected victory and extend the Conservative dynasty.The general election will decide the composition of the House of Commons, with each of the UK's 650 constituencies electing one Member of Parliament (MP) to represent local residents. Voters will cast their ballots at polling stations between 07 am and 10 pm on election day, with some opting for postal voting in advance. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency will become the MP for that area under the ""first past the post"" system. A record number of candidates, exceeding 4,000, are campaigning for the July 4 election.Sunak had until December to call an election, with the vote to be held by the following month. Despite hints that the election would take place in the second half of 2024, he remained tight-lipped about his decision, fueling speculation in Westminster. Faced with challenging options, including a gloomy economy and a controversial plan to process asylum seekers' claims in Rwanda, Sunak ultimately decided to call the election following rare positive economic news.The prevailing expectation is that the Conservative Party will lose the election, as Labour has maintained a substantial lead in opinion polls since late 2021. The Conservative brand has been tarnished by various scandals, including Partygate, which led to Boris Johnson's downfall, and the chaotic six-week tenure of his successor, Liz Truss.Despite the significant lead the opposition party holds in the polls, Rishi Sunak's campaign team finds solace in certain underlying figures. Although Keir Starmer is ahead of Sunak when respondents are asked who would be a better prime minister, the margin is considerably narrower than the overall difference in party voting intentions. Sunak has attempted to maintain a ""me versus him"" narrative to capitalise on this.However, since assuming leadership, Sunak has been unable to shift the polls in his favour, and the gap has remained unchanged since the beginning of the campaign.On July 4, Britons will cast their votes, and the winner will be declared in the early hours of Friday morning. In the UK, voters elect MPs to represent their local constituencies, and the leader of the party that wins a majority of the 650 constituencies becomes the prime minister and forms the government.If no party secures an overall majority, they may rule as a minority government or form a coalition. The monarch, King Charles III, has a formal role in approving the formation of a government, the decision to hold an election, and the dissolution of parliament, but he will not contradict the prime minister or overrule the election results.Labour is expected to frame the election as a referendum on the Conservative party's 14-year rule, highlighting public fatigue with the party's multiple prime ministers, Brexit, a struggling economy, and various scandals. Starmer will likely focus on the cost of living and the state of the National Health Service (NHS).In contrast, Sunak will emphasise migration, particularly his ""Stop the Boats"" pledge and the Rwanda policy, while attempting to convince voters that the economy has improved and that a change in governance would be risky. Early indications suggest that Sunak will also make leadership a central issue, highlighting his experience as finance minister during the Covid-19 pandemic and criticizing Starmer's record.Keir Starmer, the 61-year-old leader of the Labour Party, is a former human rights lawyer and chief public prosecutor who is favoured by pollsters to emerge victorious in the upcoming election and assume the role of prime minister.Since taking over as leader from the left-leaning Jeremy Corbyn in April 2020, Starmer has been praised for steering his party towards the political centre and eradicating anti-Semitism within its ranks.His supporters view him as a pragmatic and reliable leader, well-equipped to guide Britain out of its economic downturn.However, his detractors argue that he lacks charisma and has been indecisive, failing to articulate a clear vision for the nation during a cautious campaign.Born in London to a toolmaker father and a nurse mother, Starmer's unusual first name was chosen by his socialist parents as a tribute to Keir Hardie, the founding father of the Labour Party. An avid football fan and supporter of Arsenal, Starmer was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his contributions to criminal justice, although he seldom uses the title ""Sir"" before his name.Rishi Sunak, aged 44, is aiming to secure a personal mandate from the British electorate after being appointed as the Conservative leader and prime minister by his fellow MPs in October 2022. He took over from Liz Truss, who was forced out of office after a mere 49 days due to her tax-cutting economic policies that alarmed financial markets and caused her to lose the backing of her party.Sunak, who has Indian heritage, holds the distinction of being the UK's first British Asian and Hindu prime minister. The former financier has been praised for bringing stability to the government following the turmoil of the Truss and Boris Johnson administrations and for successfully reducing inflation.However, he has been unable to fulfil several commitments, such as reducing healthcare waiting lists, curbing irregular immigration, and deporting migrants to Rwanda.Sunak's campaign has been lacklustre and marred by missteps, beginning with his rain-drenched announcement of the election date and including criticism for his absence from the main D-Day anniversary commemoration. According to opinion polls, his approval ratings are among the lowest of any prime minister in history.Nigel Farage, the 60-year-old former member of the European Parliament, is a polarizing figure in British politics. Known for his love of beer and cigarettes, he played a significant role in convincing a majority of Britons to vote in favour of leaving the European Union in 2016, earning him the moniker ""Mr Brexit"" from former US President Donald Trump.Despite his influence on the Brexit referendum, Farage has been unsuccessful in his attempts to become a Member of Parliament, having stood for election seven times previously. He currently leads the hard-right Reform UK party, which could potentially impact the Conservative Party's chances of winning re-election by taking away crucial seats.Recently, Farage and his party have been embroiled in a racism scandal after several Reform activists were caught on camera making racist and homophobic comments. As a result, Reform disowned three candidates over the weekend due to their offensive remarks. Farage also faced criticism for suggesting that the West ""provoked"" Russia into invading Ukraine.While neither Ed Davey 's Liberal Democrats nor John Swinney 's Scottish National Party (SNP) are expected to win the election outright, they could play a significant role in determining the outcome. Davey, 58, aims to prevent a Conservative victory by winning several seats in southern England and overtaking the SNP to become the third-largest party in parliament. He has balanced campaigning on serious issues with lighthearted stunts to gain attention.Swinney, 60, is not a member of the UK parliament but serves as the first minister in the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, having assumed leadership of the SNP in May following Humza Yousaf's resignation. The SNP is currently facing challenges from a resurgent Labour Party in Scotland, which could jeopardize its hopes for independence for a generation.Meanwhile, Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer , 38, is aiming to win the newly created seat of Bristol Central as her party seeks to increase its representation in parliament from one to four MPs.","UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called for an early general election on July 4.

The Pat Tillman Award, named after the former NFL player and US Army Ranger killed in Afghanistan, is intended for individuals with strong ties to sports who have made significant contributions to others, honoring Tillman's legacy.The announcement has sparked controversy, including displeasure voiced on air by TV host Pat McAfee and dissatisfaction expressed by the mother of the fallen soldier, who noted she was not consulted about the decision.""I am shocked as to why they would select such a controversial and divisive individual to receive the award,"" Mary told the Daily Mail.""There are recipients that are far more fitting. There are individuals working in the veteran community that are doing tremendous things to assist veterans. These individuals do not have the money, resources, connections or privilege that Prince Harry has. I feel that those types of individuals should be recognised.""The ESPY Awards, run by ESPN, typically honor unsung heroes with this particular accolade. Last year, the award was given to the Buffalo Bills' training staff for their heroic efforts in saving a player's life on the field. Prince Harry is being recognised for his 'tireless work in making a positive impact for the veteran community through the power of sport,' particularly through his Invictus Games.However, McAfee and others argue that Harry's selection does not align with the award's intended purpose and have questioned the criteria behind his nomination. ""A lot of conversation about Pat Tillman's name American hero,"" McAfee noted. ""Now there's an award named after him, as there should be in the sports world because that is somebody who is the definition of selfless.
