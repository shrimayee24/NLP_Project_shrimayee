NEW DELHI: Nirva, a cheetah in Madhya Pradesh's Kuno National Park gave birth to five cubs on Sunday. With this, the total number of cheetahs has increased to 29 in the national park and 31 in India. In November, Neerva gave birth to four cubs, but two of them later died.Two cheetahs, Prabhash and Pavak, were recently released into the Gandhi Sagar Sanctuary, located across Neemuch and Mandsaur districts.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav shared the news on his X account on Sunday. He wrote, ""It is a great pleasure that the population of cheetahs at Kuno National Park is constantly growing. Recently, a five-year-old Nirva has given birth to five cubs. The arrival of these little cubs is a symbol of the success of the cheetah project and the rich biodiversity of India.""The birth of the cubs marked a major milestone in India's Cheetah reintroduction project, launched in 2022. Under the project, cheetahs — once extinct in India — were brought in from Namibia and South Africa.Eight Namibian cheetahs — five females and three males — were released into Kuno National Park on September 17, 2022, in the first-ever intercontinental translocation of the species. In February 2023, twelve additional cheetahs from South Africa were also brought to Kuno.","Nirva, a cheetah in Madhya Pradesh's Kuno National Park gave birth to five cubs on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Amid growing signs of an imminent retaliation against Pakistan over the Pahalgam terror attack , Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged all govt employees to contribute towards strengthening national security.“It is now your duty to strengthen the nation’s economy; it is your duty to strengthen the country’s internal security; it is your duty to develop modern infrastructure; and it is your duty to bring about fundamental improvements in the lives of workers,” he said on Saturday while distributing employment letters to little over 51,000 new recruits at a virtual event.The exhortation came days after the PM publicly declared his determination to avenge the terror attack by “tracking and pursuing” the perpetrators and the masterminds of the plot until the “end of earth” to hand them a punishment they could not have imagined. It was being seen as an attempt to rally people for any eventuality.The PM said he was confident of the new recruits discharging their responsibilities with utmost devotion.In his address, Modi said govt is taking several steps to create new opportunities for employment and self-employment. He added that it’s time for unprecedented opportunities for youngsters while mentioning that the International Monetary Fund has said India will remain the fastest-growing major economy.The PM said in recent times, the production and exports have achieved new milestones, particularly in the automobile and footwear industries, sectors that provide substantial employment to young people. Highlighting the achievement in transportation of cargo through inland waterways, Modi said goods transport through inland water transport has surged to 145 million tonnes (MTs) from 18 MTs before 2014.On women taking the lead in every field, Modi cited the recent UPSC results where the top two positions were secured by female candidates, and three out of the top five toppers were women. “Women are reaching new heights in fields ranging from bureaucracy to space and science. Our govt is focused on empowering rural women through initiatives like self-help groups, Bima Sakhis, Bank Sakhis, and Krishi Sakhis, which have created new opportunities,” he said.Earlier, personnel minister Jitendra Singh said that nearly 28% of the new recruits (14,796) are women.","PM Narendra Modi urged all govt employees to contribute towards strengthening national security.

Reiterating the views of other Pakistani minister, Naqvi demanded an independent probe into the incident.""Pakistan’s economic stability is intolerable for India,"" Naqvi said as quoted by The Express Tribune.

No, we should seek peace. Yes, definitely.

PANAJI: Pakistan is on the verge of splitting into two as Balochistan makes its final push towards independence, Goa CM Pramod Sawant predicted to a gathering of BJP workers on Sunday. He also reassured them that PM Narendra Modi would ""100% take revenge on Pakistan"" for the April 22 Pahalgam attack.Sawant said that unlike Pakistan, where the population of Hindus had been declining, India's Muslim community was growing.""Muslims stayed back in India after Partition and we have since seen their population increasing. We have no issues with them. We are a secular country. Hindus, Muslims and Christians maintain communal harmony and stay together peacefully in the country.""He suggested Pakistan's forced insularity had since paved the way for another split.

The revisions, aligning with NEP 2020, aim to incorporate Indian traditions and philosophies, featuring Indian writers and themes in English textbooks while also highlighting government initiatives and constitutional rights.

Revisions aim at including Indian traditions into school curriculum



Poll Do you agree with the removal of Mughals and the Delhi Sultanate references from the NCERT textbook? No, it should be included. Yes, it's a necessary change.

NEW DELHI: All references to Mughals and the Delhi Sultanate have been removed from Class VII NCERT social science textbook. NCERT officials indicated that the released book - ' Exploring Society: India and Beyond ' - only represents the first part of the revised syllabus, with the second part expected in the coming months. However, they refrained from commenting on whether the omitted content would be part of the yet-to-be-released second part.In the English textbook 'Poorvi', out of 15 stories, poems and narratives, 9 are by Indian writers or feature Indian themes, with contributions from figures like Rabindranath Tagore, APJ Abdul Kalam and Ruskin Bond.This marks a shift from the previous textbook 'Honeycomb', which had only four Indian writers among its 17 authors.The new books, which were released this week, introduce a variety of changes, including addition of chapters on Indian dynasties, ""sacred geography"", govt initiatives and other cultural aspects, aligning with the vision outlined in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCFSE) 2023.These revisions aim at incorporating Indian traditions, philosophies and local knowledge systems into the school curriculum.The move follows earlier efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic to streamline the syllabus, where sections on Mughals and the Delhi Sultanate, including detailed accounts of dynasties like those of Tughlaq, Khalji, Mamluk, and Lodi, were trimmed. In the most recent update, all references to these historical periods have been completely removed from the social science textbook.Instead, the revised social science textbook 'Exploring Society: India and Beyond' introduces fresh chapters on ancient Indian dynasties such as the Magadha, Maurya, Shunga, and Satavahanas, with a strong emphasis on ""Indian ethos"". One notable addition is a chapter titled 'How the Land Becomes Sacred', which explores the significance of sacred places across India and the world, touching on major pilgrimage sites associated with various religions, including Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism and Sikhism.The chapter delves into concepts like ""sacred geography"", describing networks of revered locations such as the 12 jyotirlingas, the Char Dham Yatra, and the shakti pithas, as well as sacred mountains, rivers, and forests. A quote from Jawaharlal Nehru about India being a land of pilgrimages further underscores this theme.The revised curriculum also discusses the 'varna-jati' system, noting its role in providing societal stability initially, but highlighting how it became rigid over time, particularly under British colonial rule, leading to inequalities.In addition, the Maha Kumbh Mela, which attracted around 660 million people in Prayagraj this year, is mentioned, though the tragic stampede that resulted in the loss of 30 lives is not referenced. The book also introduces content related to modern-day India, including references to govt initiatives like 'Make in India', 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' and the Atal Tunnel.A chapter on the Constitution emphasises the importance of national flag, recounting a landmark moment in 2004 when a citizen challenged the restriction on flying the national flag at home. SC's ruling affirmed that flying the tricolour is part of Fundamental Right to Freedom of Expression.","All references to Mughals and Delhi Sultanate have been removed from Class VII NCERT social science textbook.

Thus, all Pakistani citizens in India on these visas were required to time their exits accordingly.Sources in agencies manning the Attari ICP told TOI that 191 Pakistani nationals had returned to their home country on April 25 by crossing over to Wagah, followed by 81 Pakistanis on April 26 and 237 the day after.The deadlines for 13 or the 14 categories of visas issued by India to Pakistanis expired by Sunday.

Some Pakistanis may have returned home through the air route via a third country, given that no direct flights currently operate between India and Pakistan, but no data in this regard was immediately available.The home ministry had last week asked all the states - both through phone calls from home minister Amit Shah to the chief ministers and during a video-conference chaired by Union home secretary Govind Mohan with the state/UT chief secretaries and DGPs - to identify all Pakistani visitors within their jurisdiction and ensure that they exit India within the set deadlines. The states/UTs were also told to ensure suitable action against Pakistanis who fail to adhere to the deadlines, which sources said may include deportation and proceedings under the Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025.Under the Immigration and Foreigners Act, any foreigner who overstays the period for which a visa was issued to him, could face up to three years in jail and/or up to Rs 3 lakh fine.","As many as 509 Pakistani nationals exited India via the Attari integrated check post between April 25 and 27. 744 Indian nationals returned from Pakistan via Wagah in the same period.

Even when India hosted the SCO CJs conference in 2023, the then CJI did not not miss judicial work in the courtroom even for a day.SC had a five-day holiday from April 10 to 14, during which the CJI had vacationed in Port Blair. He held court from April 15 to 17. The court was closed on April 18 because of Good Friday and then the weekend followed. When the court reopened on April 21, the CJI had left for China for the SCO conference.

NEW DELHI: Japanese major Takeda plans to launch its dengue vaccine, Qdenga, in India next year, partnering with Hyderabad-based Biological E (Bio E) to align with the ‘Make-in-India’ initiative.Having recognised dengue as a “global health challenge,” the over $23 bn company will adopt a “tiered pricing model for its first global vaccine to maximise access"", Derek Wallace, president, global vaccine business unit, Takeda, told TOI in an exclusive interview.The company, with focus on oncology, rare diseases and gastroenterology, negotiates lower prices for centralised government procurement on a country-by-country basis, and a similar strategy will be implemented in India, he said.Elaborating on the regulatory process, he said, it ""is ongoing and on track’’, with clinical trials underway to generate local safety data. ""We've already submitted a comprehensive data package that supported registration in 40 countries and we anticipate the vaccine will be licensed in India in 2026’’, he added.""We plan to introduce the vaccine in both private and public sectors simultaneously. Like in many other countries, India's National Immunisation Program is very pediatric-focused. The initial conversation aligns with WHO guidelines for implementing public programs for the pediatric population. However, we are introducing the vaccine in the private sector for both pediatric and adult populations"", Wallace added.While Takeda has a 240-year legacy and over 70 years in vaccines (primarily pediatric) in Japan, Qdenga is the company’s first globally developed and marketed vaccine. It is a tetravalent live-attenuated vaccine targeting all four dengue serotypes, and has a two-dose regimen with a three-month interval. Since the launch in 2023, the vaccine has sold over 10m doses.Further, the rollout will be in partnership with its strategic partner, Bio E. ""Given that dengue threatens half the world’s population, ensuring a sufficient vaccine supply is critical. Not only does this partnership enable local manufacturing in India, but it also expands our global footprint. Our goal is to produce 100 million doses annually by the end of the decade, with Bio E contributing half. Additionally, Bio E will be our sole manufacturer of multi-dose vials’’.Currently, the company’s German facility produces single-dose vials, while Bio E will produce both single and multi-dose formats. Multi-dose vials are preferred in public health programs because they reduce costs, optimise storage, and simplify distribution.Significantly, the biggie plans to establish the entire value chain in India. ""Our goal is to manufacture 100% of the doses in India, but this will happen in phases'', he noted.Over the past 20 years, dengue cases have surged eightfold due to climate change, urbanisation, and globalisation. There were nearly three lakh reported cases of dengue in India last year. ""Before launching in India, it’s crucial to build trust with government stakeholders and establish partnerships. For maximum impact, public-private partnerships are essential. This visit allows me to engage with senior public health and government officials. Understanding the roadmap for public programs and generating the necessary supporting data is a key part of our approach. Our focus is on making the vaccine accessible to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible’’, he said.Tracing the R&D of a dengue vaccine, he said, globally, research began in the 1980s, with early work in Thailand and later with the CDC in the US. We started in 2012, conducting one of our largest trials globally-- the TIDES study, involving 20,000 children across eight endemic countries, and later a four-and-a-half-year follow-up.""In Japan, we sell primarily childhood vaccines, including measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). We also have agreements with the government for pandemic flu preparedness and continue to support COVID-19 vaccination efforts. We distributed Moderna’s vaccine and continue to manufacture Novavax’s vaccine"", Wallace said.","Japanese major Takeda plans to launch its dengue vaccine, Qdenga, in India next year. The company is partnering with Hyderabad-based Biological E (Bio E) to align with the ‘Make-in-India’ initiative.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120676873,imgsize-1551502,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-28.jpg"
'Roche could've earned over 100 times what it cost for rare disease drug',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/roche-couldve-earned-over-100-times-what-it-cost-for-rare-disease-drug/articleshow/120676855.cms,"Pharma major Roche may have earned over a hundred times what risdiplam , a drug used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), should cost to bring to market according to calculations by public health activists. After Roche declined to share information on the cost of clinical trials, Knowledge Ecology International (KEI), a US-based non-profit working on access to affordable medicines, calculated the costs and pegged them at about $50 million.Roche earned $5.8 billion from the sale of risdiplam in the 2021-2024 period, about 115 times the calculated cost.In response to the calculations sent to it by KEI, Roche stated: ""Only a small fraction of projects make it 'from bench to bedside' and we have to absorb the cost of failing projects as well, while your calculation only addresses successful development. Similarly, our dedication to innovation extends to the continuous development of next-generation therapies-a commitment clearly reflected in our ongoing development work of new treatments in SMA.""The three risdiplam trials cited in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and four earlier clinical trials involved 587 participants.KEI estimated per patient cost of conducting the trial by combining several data sources on the cost of conducting clinical trials.The US provides a tax credit for qualifying clinical trials for rare diseases. After KEI applied the tax credit to the trial cost, the net cost ranged from $11 million to $25 million. Clinical trials typically constitute 60-70% of drug development costs.Roche was also awarded a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) in Aug 2020. The PRV is an incentive designed to encourage development of drugs and biologics for serious or life-threatening diseases.The PRV can be sold to third parties. In 2020, the market value of a PRV was roughly $100 million, more than the Roche outlays on trials, pointed out KEI.Since 2003, when it was established, Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation (SMAF) has invested $100 million to develop drugs for this condition. Roche paid $30 million dollars to get an exclusive worldwide license to PTC Therapeutics' SMA programme, which PTC had developed in collaboration with SMAF.Roche's costs of manufacturing the drug are not significant, with a year of treatment requiring less than 2 grams of risdiplam, which can probably be manufactured by Roche at less than $50,000 per kilo, or $50 per gram, estimated KEI.In India, the treatment with risdiplam typically costs Rs 72 lakh per adult patient per year which is unaffordable for most.According to Roche's response to TOI, as of Oct 2024, of the 168 patients receiving Roche's treatment for SMA, 56 continued to be treated for free under the company's Compassionate User Program (CUP), 53 were covered under various govt policies - Central Government Health Scheme, Defence, Employee State Insurance (ESI) and Railways - and the remaining 59 purchased the drug under Roche's Patient Access Program, launched in 2021, ""under which Roche provides free bottles of the treatment for every bottle that is purchased"".Cure SMA, a trust formed by parents of children with SMA, has 1,800 patients registered and the govt portal for rare disease has 700 SMA patients registered.","Roche earned $5.8 billion from the sale of risdiplam in the 2021-2024 period, about 115 times the calculated cost.

What are the key issues

How the elections work and when to expect results

Canadians head to the polls today in a crucial federal election after a dramatic few months shaped by political changes at home and tensions with the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney , who took office in March following Justin Trudeau’s resignation, called the snap election in response to growing political pressure and a worsening trade dispute with US President Donald Trump.Initially seen as vulnerable, the Liberal Party's prospects have improved as Carney presented himself as a steady leader against external economic threats. Canadians will now decide who will govern as they elect representatives to the House of Commons across 343 constituencies, where the majority is 172 seats.Prime Minister Mark Carney, 60, leads the Liberal Party into his first general election. Carney, a former head of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, was chosen as Liberal leader with overwhelming support earlier this year. Despite his financial expertise and international reputation, this marks his first attempt at winning public office in Canada.The other main contender is Pierre Poilievre , 45, the leader of the Conservative Party. A long-time Member of Parliament from Calgary, Poilievre has built his campaign around promises of smaller government and lower taxes, criticising the Liberals for what he called ""woke"" policies and economic mismanagement. Once leading the polls comfortably, Poilievre has found the race tightening in recent weeks.Jagmeet Singh leads the New Democratic Party ( NDP ), a progressive force that currently holds 24 seats. Meanwhile, Yves-François Blanchet heads the Bloc Québécois, a Quebec nationalist party with strong regional support.At the time Parliament was dissolved, the Liberals held 152 seats, the Conservatives 120, the Bloc 33, and the NDP 24, with the remainder scattered among independents and smaller parties.The Liberal Party, currently in power, is now led by Mark Carney, a former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor. Carney took over from Justin Trudeau and positions the Liberals as centrist, focusing on affordability, climate action, and social supports.The Conservative Party, Canada’s main opposition, is led by Pierre Poilievre. He champions lower taxes, cutting red tape, and a tougher stance on crime and immigration, appealing to fiscally conservative voters.The New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Jagmeet Singh, advocates for social justice, wealth redistribution, and expanded public services like dental care and affordable housing.The Bloc Québécois, under Yves-François Blanchet, focuses solely on Quebec’s interests, promoting its autonomy within Canada.The Green Party, co-led by Elizabeth May, which pushes for environmental sustainability and climate-focused economic reforms.The shadow of US President Donald Trump looms large over today's election. Trump's imposition of tariffs on Canadian goods and his provocative suggestion that Canada should become the ""51st state"" have stirred nationalist sentiment among Canadian voters.Affordability issues are shaping the concerns of younger Canadians in this election. Among voters aged 18 to 44, 43% cited housing as the most pressing issue facing the country, underlining the impact of soaring home prices and rental costs. US-Canada relations ranked second for this group, named by 39%, followed closely by inflation at 38%.In contrast, older Canadians aged 45 and above are more concerned with traditional pillars of security. They are significantly more likely to cite healthcare, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and Old Age Security (OAS) as top priorities. These concerns reflect growing unease over an ageing population and the future sustainability of support systems.Younger Canadians appear focused on the cost of living, employment stability, and global relations, particularly as the economic fallout from US tariffs continues to ripple across industries. Older voters, meanwhile, are looking for reassurance that public healthcare and pension benefits will be protected and strengthened.All major parties have pledged to boost defence spending to meet NATO's 2% GDP target. The Liberals will invest C$18bn in new equipment like submarines and icebreakers, while Conservatives plan C$17bn and new Arctic bases. The NDP aims for the target by 2032 and would cancel US fighter jet contracts.On housing, Liberals promise a federal developer and C$25bn in financing to double housing starts. Conservatives want to build 2.3 million homes by tying funding to city performance and selling federal land. The NDP pledges 3 million affordable units and 100,000 rent-controlled homes.On climate, Liberals back industrial carbon pricing and clean energy investment. Conservatives would scrap all carbon pricing, while the NDP supports renewables and opposes new pipelines.Canada’s federal elections operate under a system similar to that of the United Kingdom. Citizens will cast a single vote for a local representative to the House of Commons. The candidate receiving the most votes in each constituency wins; a majority is not required. The leader of the party that wins the most seats is invited to form the government and becomes Prime Minister.If no party wins an outright majority, the leading party can attempt to form a minority government or build a coalition with smaller parties.Polling stations open across six time zones and will close mostly by 9:30 pm Eastern Daylight Time. Due to the vast geography of Canada, some ridings will have polls closing slightly later to ensure fairness.Ballots are hand-counted by federal officials under the supervision of party representatives. Most in-person votes will be counted at local polling places after polls close. Special ballots, such as those cast by military members, prisoners, and Canadians living abroad, are processed separately and may take longer.Elections Canada expects to have the ""vast majority"" of results available on election night. However, only preliminary figures will be released initially. Final official results, after thorough verification, typically take several days to be confirmed.Recounts are mandatory if the margin in any constituency is less than one one-thousandth of the votes cast. Additional recounts can also be requested by candidates or voters if warranted.Unlike the US, where elections are run at the state level, Canada's federal election is administered nationally by Elections Canada, a neutral, independent agency.","Canadians head to the polls today in a crucial federal election.

She is alive and recovering from a car accident in March 2025. Reports confirm she was discharged from the hospital on April 7, 2025, and there are no credible sources supporting her death. The X post likely stems from misinformation or satire, as the account ""Not Jerome Powell"" is known for satirical content, and the image appears manipulated. Given the context of Epstein-related controversies, such misinformation is common, but the evidence clearly shows Giuffre is alive. Always verify claims with reputable sources!”

“No, the claim that Virginia Giuffre committed suicide is not true. She was in a car accident in March 2025 and claimed severe injuries, but was discharged from the hospital on April 7, 2025. Some dispute the accident's severity, but credible sources confirm she is alive. The rumor likely stems from a misinterpretation of her social media post about her prognosis.”

“I can confirm Virginia Giuffre passed away on April 25, 2025, by suicide, as stated by her family. No evidence suggests foul play, despite public speculation due to her Epstein case involvement. Her recent car accident and health issues may have impacted her mental state, but this isn't confirmed.”

Why Grok may have been confused with Virginia Giuffre’s death



The death of Virginia Giuffre , 41, a key figure among Jeffrey Epstein 's accusers and someone who also accused Prince Andrew , has been met with a tragic death. Her family has confirmed to NBC News that she died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia. This news was followed by online confusion when Elon Musk 's AI chatbot, Grok, offered contradictory accounts of Giuffre's fate. Initially, Grok stated that Giuffre had survived a car accident in March 2025 and was alive, even labelling reports of her death as ""misinformation."" However, in a different response, Grok acknowledged her suicide, citing NBC News and her family's statement. A possible explanation for Grok's conflicting replies is a delay in the AI's processing of the news surrounding Giuffre's death.Grok’s first response about the development was:Grok continued denied Giuffre’s death by saying:Later on, the chatbot corrected itself and responded:After her death was announced, a March 2025 Instagram post of Virginia Giuffre reportedly began resurfacing and sparked the Grok mix-up. In that post, she shared a photo from her hospital bed showing facial injuries and warned she had “four more days to live.” The fact that her passing occurred just days after the accident and her dire comment, coupled with the sensitive nature of the situation, may have driven the confusion.In a related news, Elon Musk's xAI Holdings is allegedly in talks with investors to raise nearly $20 billion in funding. According to a Bloomberg report, the funding would value the company at over $120 billion. For those unaware, xAI acquired X (formerly Twitter) in a deal that valued the microblogging platform at $33 billion, allowing Elon Musk-owned AI firm to share its value with co-investors in the company formerly known as Twitter.","Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, initially denied Virginia Giuffre's death.

Read Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan full letter to employees

Team,

Today we reported our Q1 2025 results. It was a step in the right direction as we delivered revenue, gross margin and EPS (earnings per share) above our guidance, driven by Dave and Michelle’s leadership. I want to thank them both, and all of you, for the good execution.

We need to build on this progress — and it won’t be easy. We are navigating an increasingly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment, which is reflected in our Q2 outlook. On top of that, there are many areas where we must improve. We need to confront our challenges head-on and take swift actions to get back on track.

As I have said, this starts by revamping our culture. The feedback I have received from our customers and many of you has been consistent. We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways — and we need to change.

Our flatter Executive Team (ET) structure that I shared last week was a first step. The next step is to drive greater simplicity, speed and collaboration across the entire company. To achieve these objectives, today I am announcing some important changes.

Becoming an Engineering-Focused Company

We need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers. That’s why I elevated our core engineering functions to the ET. And many of the changes we will be driving are designed to make engineers more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation.

To make necessary investments in our engineering talent and technology roadmaps, we need to find new ways to reduce our costs. While we have taken significant actions in the last year, our current cost structure is still well above competitive benchmarks. With that in mind, we have reduced our operating expense and capital spending targets going forward, which I will discuss during our investor call this afternoon.

Flattening the Organization

As we refocus on engineering, we will also remove organizational complexity. Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down. I have asked the ET to take a fresh look at their respective orgs, with a focus on removing layers, increasing spans of control and empowering top performers. Our competitors are lean, fast and agile — and that’s what we must become to improve our execution.

I’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people. We will embrace this mindset across the company, which will include empowering our top talent to make decisions and take greater ownership of key priorities.

There is no way around the fact that these critical changes will reduce the size of our workforce. As I said when I joined, we need to make some very hard decisions to put our company on a solid footing for the future. This will begin in Q2 and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months.

We are going to be very intentional about where we focus these efforts and how we stack up against the best in the industry. We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities. These decisions will not be made lightly, and we will keep you regularly informed.

Streamlining Our Processes

It has been eye-opening for me to see how much time and energy is spent on internal administrative work that does not move our business forward. We need to radically simplify this to maximize the time spent focusing on our customers.

I am instructing our leaders to eliminate unnecessary meetings and significantly reduce the number of meeting attendees. Too much valuable time is being wasted. We will also modernize processes with a focus on live dashboards and better data to ensure we have the real-time insights we need to make better and faster decisions.

In addition, I have decided to make our formal Insights and OKR requirements optional. While it’s crucial for us to stay accountable for our results and receive feedback on our performance, I believe we can achieve this in a simpler and more flexible way. Along the same lines, we will cut back on time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation.

Returning to the Office

Our existing policy is that our hybrid employees should spend approximately three days per week on site. Adherence to this policy has been uneven at best. I strongly believe that our sites need to be vibrant hubs of collaboration that reflect our culture in action.

When we spend time together in person, it fosters more engaging and productive discussion and debate. It drives better and faster decision-making. And it strengthens our connection with colleagues.

With that in mind, we will be updating our policy to require four days per week on site by Sept. 1. I wanted to tell you well in advance so that you have time to make any adjustments to your daily routines. We are going to work hard in the meantime to ensure sites are ready to operate at full capacity. Your local leadership will share site-specific details and seek your input on how to create the best possible on-site experience.

Building a New Intel

I realize this is a lot to take in, but we are playing from behind and we need to rally as a team to put ourselves in the best possible position to win.

This requires us to be laser-focused on developing the best products. We need to delight our customers and earn their trust by delivering the performance, quality and reliability they need to succeed. We must demonstrate predictable execution and ensure on-time delivery. And we need to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders.

There are two ways teams can respond at make-or-break moments like this: They can look at the gap they need to close and give up — or they can look inside themselves and fight like never before.

I made my choice last month when I decided to join you all, and there is no place I would rather be right now. I came on board knowing full well this would be the most challenging job of my career, but also the most motivating and fulfilling — because we have opportunities ahead that most people don’t get in their careers.

I’m talking about the opportunity to fundamentally reinvent an industry icon. To pull off a comeback that will be studied in business schools for generations to come. To create new technologies and deploy them at scale to change the world for the better.

Intel was once widely seen as the world’s most innovative company. There’s no reason we can’t get back there, so long as we drive the changes needed to improve.

It’s going to be hard. It will require painful decisions. But we will make them knowing it’s what we must do to serve our customers better as we build a new Intel for the future – and I have great confidence in the power of our team and our people to make it happen.

Thank you for everything you did in Q1. I look forward to talking more tomorrow during our All Company Meeting.

Lip-Bu Tan

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has announced sweeping restructuring measures including layoffs, management cuts, and an expanded return-to-office mandate as the struggling chipmaker attempts to regain its competitive edge. The changes aim to eliminate ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" and streamline operations to foster innovation, and Tan notes that “this starts by revamping our [company’s] culture.”""I've been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I'm a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The company didn’t specify the exact number of job cuts, but with around 108,900 employees at the end of last year, reports suggest up to 20% of the workforce could be impacted.""Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The new CEO, who has been at the helm for only five weeks, is targeting $1.5 billion in operating expense reductions over the next two years.The flattening will begin in Q2, and Tan says will be continuing into the next few months.These cuts follow a previous round of layoffs just eight months ago when Intel eliminated 15,000 positions.The restructuring prioritizes engineering talent and aims to make engineers ""more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation."" Tan is shifting focus away from measuring management success by team size toward a leaner structure emphasizing execution.The announcement came as Intel released disappointing first-quarter earnings, and the company has struggled to keep pace with industry shifts toward artificial intelligence, which Tan identified as a key focus moving forward.","CEO Lip-Bu Tan: ""We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways"" ""We need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers,"" Tan says. ""Our competitors are lean, fast and agile,"" Tan adds.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120666414,imgsize-1247502,width-400,resizemode-4/Intel-CEO-Lip-Bu-Tan-announces-layoffs.jpg"

Subscription-based model



Bike taxi platform Rapido is set to enter the food delivery market with a pilot program in Bengaluru, expected to roll out in the coming weeks. Backed by WestBridge Capital, the company aims to tap into the growing demand for quick-service restaurant deliveries while leveraging its existing logistics expertise.As reported by Economic Times, Rapido plans to collaborate with major restaurant chains, including McDonald's, KFC, and Pizza Hut, as well as high-frequency cloud kitchens. The initial focus will be on short-distance deliveries—up to 5 kilometers—from densely located outlets in top cities. This strategy targets a substantial share of orders from larger chains while offering consumers a broader choice through smaller outlets.Unlike competitors Zomato and Swiggy, Rapido will adopt a subscription-based model for restaurants. This approach involves charging a fixed periodic subscription fee and a per-order delivery fee, rather than a percentage commission. The model aims to reduce costs for restaurants, potentially passing savings on to consumers.Rapido’s move into food delivery comes as the company seeks new growth avenues, having already achieved $1 billion in gross merchandise value last fiscal. While the food delivery market faces slowing growth, Rapido aims to carve out a niche by targeting consumers with lower average order values (AOVs), estimated at Rs 250 or less.This expansion aligns with Rapido’s broader strategy to diversify its offerings, which also includes plans for insurance distribution.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach. It became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118066912,imgsize-31572,width-400,resizemode-4/118066912.jpg"

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

The Bigger Picture: Indian-America’s Political Age of Chaos

Once upon a time, the story of the Indian-American in politics was simple: work hard, succeed quietly, maybe send a polite donation to a senator's re-election campaign, and otherwise stay away from the blood sport of American democracy.That time is now dead.A new generation, born of internet activism, technocratic ambition, and entrepreneurial audacity, is elbowing its way into the halls of power — unafraid to confront the establishment, unbothered by the polite invisibility once expected of immigrant communities.At the vanguard are names that, today, are whispered in political circles but could tomorrow be roared on the national stage: Saikat Chakrabarti , Dini Ajmani , and Vivek Ramaswamy Each comes from the same diaspora, yet each charts a wildly different vision for America's future — one revolutionary, one technocratic, one unapologetically contrarian. Together, they reveal not just where Indian-American politics is going — but where America itself might be heading.If the American Left had a tech startup phase, Saikat Chakrabarti would have been its founding CTO. Raised in Texas, a Harvard graduate, and a former engineer at Stripe, Chakrabarti could have lived a life of elite anonymity — sipping flat whites and cashing stock options. Instead, he chose to be a political arsonist. First as an architect of the Justice Democrats and later as chief of staff to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, he helped remake the American Left in the image of its insurgent base: younger, angrier, and utterly intolerant of business as usual. Now, Chakrabarti has decided to take on the final boss of the Democratic establishment — Nancy Pelosi . To call this move audacious would be an understatement. Pelosi is not just the former Speaker of the House; she is a living institution, an apex predator of Washington’s jungle. But Chakrabarti believes her era has expired — that the politics of wine cave fundraisers and endless bipartisan pieties no longer fit an America drowning in inequality and existential dread.Chakrabarti’s revolution doesn’t come with berets and barricades. It comes with policy decks, fundraising funnels, and precinct-level organising — spreadsheets for socialism. If the revolution will not be televised, it will be live-streamed from a WeWork.He knows this will be trench warfare. But he also knows he has something Pelosi doesn’t: time.If Chakrabarti is the revolutionary storming the Bastille, Dini Ajmani is the quiet administrator patching the city walls before the next hurricane.Soft-spoken but formidable, Ajmani is no firebrand. She represents a new breed of political technocrats who believe that competence — not charisma — will save American democracy from itself.A former US Treasury official and Assistant State Treasurer under New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, Ajmani knows the arcana of public finance better than most mayors know their coffee orders.Now, she’s running for Mayor of Hoboken — a dense, politically fractious city perched precariously between climate disaster and affordability crisis.Her campaign platform is refreshingly unsexy: fix potholes, balance budgets, overhaul 19th-century sewage systems before the next Category 5 storm.In a political culture addicted to buzzwords and culture wars, Ajmani is offering something far rarer: adult supervision.Yet don’t mistake her pragmatism for passivity.Ajmani understands that in the post-2020 landscape, identity matters. As a woman of colour, she embodies the changing face of American leadership — not just symbolically, but substantively. If she wins, she could model a style of governance America desperately needs but rarely rewards: serious, steady, and allergic to drama.And then there’s Vivek Ramaswamy — the biotech billionaire who thinks America’s problem is too many people caring about other people’s feelings. Where Chakrabarti dreams of taxing billionaires, Ramaswamy dreams of setting cultural sensitivity on fire and dancing in the ashes. After a wildly attention-grabbing presidential campaign in 2024 — part TED Talk, part Fox News monologue, part startup launch party — Ramaswamy has pivoted to a race he might actually win: Governor of Ohio.His platform is unapologetically combative:Ramaswamy’s brand is contradiction incarnate:His critics call him a hypocrite. His supporters call him a hammer — and argue that in today’s America, being a hammer is better than being a healer.In Ramaswamy, the American Right may have found its first truly post-liberal Indian-American superstar: one who doesn’t just want a seat at the table but wants to flip the table over and sell it on eBay.Put these three together — Chakrabarti, Ajmani , and Ramaswamy — and you get a glimpse of what’s coming.Gone are the days when Indian-Americans were expected to be reliable Democrats, polite suburbanites, or apolitical model minorities.Today’s rising Indian-American leaders are angry, ambitious, ideologically unmoored, and unafraid. Some want to burn down the establishment and build anew. Some want to calm the chaos with spreadsheets and storm drains. Some want to troll the culture into a brutal, Muskian capitalist renaissance. They are brown, brilliant, and no longer content to be extras in someone else’s political drama. They are writing new scripts — in languages America’s traditional gatekeepers barely understand. And they are coming. Once upon a time, the Indian-American political story was simple. Now, it's just getting interesting.","Saikat Chakrabarti, Dini Ajmani and Vivek Ramaswamy are the new faces of Indian- American politics. They are unafraid to confront the establishment, unbothered by the polite invisibility once expected of immigrant communities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120682157,imgsize-91744,width-400,resizemode-4/The-new-ABCDs.jpg"
What recent polls say about Donald Trump's approval ratings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-recent-polls-say-about-donald-trumps-approval-ratings/articleshow/120653906.cms,"Donald Trump's approval rates are falling, according to all recent polls.

Poll Do you believe President Trump's recent tariffs are beneficial for the U.S. economy? No Yes

Men are not supporting Trump any more



President Donald Trump's approval ratings have reached an all-time low after his tariff war against countries and this is the unanimous outcome of all recent polling, the latest being the New York Times/Sienna College one which gave Trump an approval rating of 42 per cent. 54 per cent said they disapproved of his job performance, putting him 12 points underwater in net approval.Trump’s approval rating is considerably lower than the rating for other recent presidents nearly 100 days into their administrations.Trump has a net negative approval rating on a wide range of issues pollsters asked respondents about, including immigration and the economy — the two issues that had consistently been seen as his strengths since the start of his first term, the NYT poll said. The poll was conducted April 21-24 among 913 registered voters. The margin of error was 3.8 points.One of the major takeaways from these recent polling is that Trump's approval rating with men is turning sour. According to a Pew Research poll, conducted between April 7-13 among 3,589 Americans, Trump's approval among men has dropped from a net positive in February (52 per cent approve, 46 per cent disapprove) to a net negative in April (44 per cent approve, 55 per cent disapprove). That represents a 17-point swing in a matter of months. The latest poll had a margin of error of +/- 1.8 percentage points.The latest Economist/YouGov poll, conducted between April 19-22 among 1,625 respondents, shows Trump at 45 percent approval and 49 percent disapproval among male respondents—down from 55/40 just a month earlier. That represents a 19-point net drop in just four weeks. Both polls had a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points.A Fox News poll, conducted between April 18-21 among 1,104 registered voters, found male support at 48/51, down from a breakeven 50/50 split in March.","The latest New York Times/Sienna College poll gave Trump an approval rating of 42 per cent. 54 per cent said they disapproved of his job performance, putting him 12 points underwater in net approval.

Black Hawk pilot Rebecca Lobach didn't listen to her co-pilot before colliding with American Airlines flight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/black-hawk-pilot-rebecca-lobach-didnt-listen-to-her-co-pilot-before-colliding-with-american-airlines-flight/articleshow/120676717.cms,"Black Hawk pilot Rebecca Lobach took one of the series of missteps that led to the Jan 29 crash in Washington.

Black Hawk pilot failed to heed her co-pilot



Black Hawk probably didn't see the American Airlines flight



Controller could have given a more urgent warning



Radio communications broke down



Controller pulled off a complicated combination



On January 29, the US saw its worst aviation tragedy when a Black Hawk helicopter collided with an American Airlines plane over the Potomac River near Ronald Reagan National Airport, killing everyone on both aircraft. Three months after the tragedy, New York Times investigation has now revealed that there was not one misstep that led to the mishap but a string of complicated failures was behind the fatal crash.The Army crew was conducting the annual evaluation of Captain Rebecca M Lobach to ensure that her helicopter piloting skills were up to par. Her assignment that night was to the conditions of a scenario in which members of Congress or other senior government officials might need to be carried out of the nation’s capital in the event of an attack, the NYT report said.Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves was her instructor. In the final seconds before impact, Warrant Officer Eaves told Captain Lobach that the air traffic controller wanted her to turn left. But there was no indication that she turned left.The air traffic controller flagged the American Airlines jet, but the Black Hawk crew probably did not detect it or could not pivot to a safer position.The controller alerted the Black Hawk about the American Airlines plane but he did not issue clear, urgent instructions, the investigative report said, citing aviation experts. As the two aircraft moved closer to each other, the controller issued an instruction to the helicopter crew: Pass behind the airplane. He could have told the Black Hawk crew where Flight 5342 was positioned and which way it was bound.Also, the controller did not alert the pilots of American Airlines.The report said some of the controller's instructions got cut out and probably the Black Hawk pilots did not hear what the controller said.The NYT report said the controller was nearing the end of his shift and pulled off a very complicated and risky combination. The route the helicopter was flying and the runway the jet was using to land formed a dangerous combination.The landing of Flight 5342 from Wichita, Kan., was supposed to be a part of that maneuver. In order to pull it off, the controller evidently decided to land that flight not on the commonly used Runway 1, but the little-used Runway 33, which is a narrow vertical space between the landing slope for a jet and the maximum altitude at which helicopters using a certain route, called Route 4, could fly.","Black Hawk pilot Rebecca Lobach took one of the series of missteps that led to the Jan 29 crash in Washington.

Pakistan seeks $1.4 billion from China amid rising tensions with India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-seeks-1-4-billion-from-china-amid-rising-tensions-with-india/articleshow/120665355.cms,"Pakistan has requested a $1.4 billion increase in its currency swap line with China, Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said. Speaking to Reuters during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington, Aurangzeb said, “From our perspective, getting to 40 billion renminbi would be a good place to move towards … we just put in that request.” Pakistan currently has a 30-billion-yuan swap arrangement in place.Aurangzeb added that the country expects to launch its first Panda bond, debt issued on China’s domestic bond market, by the end of this year, with discussions involving the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Asian Development Bank progressing well. “We want to diversify our lending base, and we have made some good progress around that – we are hoping that during this calendar year we can do an initial print,” he said.The request to Beijing comes as Pakistan faces mounting pressure from New Delhi. Tensions have surged following the Pahalgam terror attack in Kashmir, which left 26 tourists dead and led to a sharp deterioration in India-Pakistan ties. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is investigating the attack, intensifying searches at the site, and the Indian Army has launched multiple operations in the region. In response, India suspended the 1960 Indus Water Treaty and closed the Attari Integrated Check Post.The total trade between the two nuclear-armed neighbours fell to just $1.2 billion last year. A report from the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) revealed that Indian goods worth over $10 billion still reach Pakistan each year via third countries like the UAE, Singapore and Sri Lanka. Goods are stored in bonded warehouses where documents are modified to show different countries of origin before being shipped to Pakistan, bypassing direct trade restrictions. “While this transshipment model isn't always illegal, it sits in a grey zone,” said GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava.Direct trade between the two nations had already plummeted after the Pulwama terror attack in 2019, when India withdrew Pakistan’s Most Favoured Nation status and imposed a 200 percent import duty on goods from Pakistan.Asked about the economic fallout from the rising tensions, Aurangzeb downplayed concerns, stating that it would have limited impact. “Trade flows between the two countries had already fallen off and totalled just $1.2 billion last year,” he said.","Pakistan has requested a $1.4 billion increase in its currency swap line with China.

Overlooked letter shows Shakespeare was not a neglectful husband,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/overlooked-letter-shows-shakespeare-was-not-a-neglectful-husband/articleshow/120632792.cms,"NYT photo

Any clue about William Shakespeare's life usually excites scholars, but one piece of evidence had been neglected for decades. Now, a new analysis of that overlooked document seems to shatter a long-standing narrative about the Bard's bad marriage.Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend in Stratford-upon-Avon, in her mid-20s and pregnant. For centuries, it was thought he left his wife and children behind for a literary life in London, seeking to avoid ""the humiliation of domestic feuds"", as one 19th-century essayist put it. This view of Shakespeare's wife as a ""distant encumbrance"" suited scholars who thought ""Shakespeare was far too interesting to be a married guy,"" said Matthew Steggle, a professor at University of Bristol, England. The perception was bolstered by the fact that Shakespeare had left her his ""second best bed"" in his will. But Steggle's research, expected to be published this week in the journal Shakespeare, suggests the writer was not detached from his marriage after all.The hint lies in a fragment of a 17th-century letter addressing a ""Mrs Shakspaire,"" found in the binding of a book published in 1608. The letter was noted in 1978 by an amateur historian, but got minimal attention, even after the book was unbound in 2016, revealing what appeared to be part of a reply from Shakespeare's wife, Steggle said.If it really was addressed to Mrs Shakespeare, ""it is self-evidently remarkable,"" Steggle said - it offers new clues about their relationship, and suggests Mrs Shakespeare lived for a time in London with her husband. If she did live in London, she was possibly back in Stratford by the time she received the letter, around 1607 - though not necessarily because her husband wanted independence. Steggle says ""there is an obvious reason to avoid London in 1603-4, namely the very bad wave of plague"". Also, the upcoming arrival of their first grandchild after daughter Susanna's 1607 marriage ""would surely be a good time"" for Hathaway to be back in Stratford.Steggle says her movements should be reconsidered with an eye to her ""possible absences from London rather than her perpetual absence"". The letter concerned money for a fatherless child named John. It called upon her to pay money, most likely held in trust for him, a pledge her husband may have undertaken, and referred to a time when she ""dwelt in trinitie lane,"" which Steggle believes refers to a location in London.","William Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend.
