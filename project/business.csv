Other arrests made

NEW DELHI: Pune juvenile court on Wednesday cancelled bail of the 17-year-old accused who rammed his Porsche into a motorcycle from behind, resulting in the death of 2 young techies in Pune.The Juvenile Justice Board has remanded the minor accused to a rehabilitation home/observation home till June 5.The decision comes amid a huge public outcry over the court's previous order granting the accused bail in 15 hours under the Juvenile Justice Act with lenient conditions, including 15 days of community service with the Yerwada traffic police, writing a 300-word reflective essay on the accident and its consequences, and undergoing psychiatric counselling.Besides that, the accused, who was allegedly under the influence of alcohol , was asked to seek a doctor’s help to quit drinking.Earlier in the day, a Pune court sent the father of the accused to 2-day police custody till May 24.The father, a prominent builder, is facing charges of giving his son his high-end car to drive despite knowing that the latter did not have a driving licence nor was he trained to drive the car and that his son consumed alcohol. The builder was detained from a lodge in Sambhajinagar, while his driver and associate were picked from a hotel.The builder attempted to outsmart the cops after fleeing the city. He sent one of his vehicles towards Mumbai and another to Goa. He borrowed a vehicle from an associate but it had a GPS fitted in it.The accident occurred around 2.30am on Sunday when the Porsche Taycan, driven by the 17-year-old at 160kmph speed at the time of the crash, rammed into a motorcycle from behind in Kalyaninagar. The collision claimed the lives of Anish Awadhia and Ashwini Kosta, both 24-year-old techies hailing from Madhya Pradesh.Before the accident, the teen along with his friends drank alcohol at two pubs in the city - Cosie and Blak Mariott. He spent Rs 48,000 in 90 minutes at Cosie which the teen and his friends visited at 10.40pm on Saturday evening. They left for the second pub, Blak Mariott, at 12.10am after Cosie stopped serving them.The police also arrested Naman Bhutada (25), the owner of the Cosie pub in Mundhwa, and Sachin Kaatkar (35), a staff member at the establishment. Additionally, Sandip Sangle (35), an assistant restaurant manager at the Blak Marriott pub, also located in Mundhwa, has been taken into custody. The minor driver had reportedly visited these establishments to party with his friends before the fateful accident.","Pune juvenile court on Wednesday cancelled bail of the 17-year-old accused who rammed his Porsche into a motorcycle from behind, resulting in the death of 2 young techies in Pune.

Adani Group said any suggestion that one of its companies supplied inferior coal is incorrect. ""Allegations (in FT report) are false and baseless,"" it said.NEW DELHI: The Adani Group on Wednesday said any suggestion that one of its companies supplied inferior coal to the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution company ( TANGEDCO ), as compared to the quality standards laid down in the tender and purchase order (PO), is incorrect and asserted that it operates a robust corporate governance framework and is strongly committed to following all laws and regulations in all jurisdictions.The company was responding to a report published in the Financial Times which alleged that the Adani Group passed off low-quality coal as far more expensive cleaner fuel in transactions with an Indian state power utility. The newspaper cited evidence it had seen and said it throws fresh light on allegations of a long-running coal scam .""Your allegations are false and baseless, and we strongly reject any suggestion that the Adani portfolio of companies did not act as per regulations,"" the Adani group said in a detailed rebuttal of the newspaper report.""The PO 89 of TANGEDCO was a fixed price contract, won through an open, competitive, global bidding process, wherein Adani Global Pte Ltd was contractually obliged to supply coal to TANGEDCO at a pre-determined price. So, the supply price was market-determined and TANGEDCO had contractually insulated itself from any kind of supply risk, including on price,"" the Adani Group said in a statement.""Any upside or downside due to price fluctuations was to be completely borne by the supplier, needless to say the risk of which was very high due to the volatility in coal prices,"" said the Adani Group statement.The FT report claimed that the documents secured by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting project (OCCRP) and reviewed by the newspaper added a ""potential environmental dimension"" to accusations of corruption associated with the Indian conglomerate.""They suggest that Adani may have fraudulently obtained bumper profits at the expense of air quality, since low-grade coal for power means burning more of the fuel,"" the FT report alleged.

There was a time when the IITs would see recruiters land up at their gates a day before the hiring season began, and the famed 'day zero' came into being.Far from that glorified time, the class of 2024 has had a rough start to their professional careers. Around 38% IITians across all 23 campuses are yet to be placed, shows responses to RTI applications filed by IIT Kanpur alumnus Dheeraj Singh.IIT Delhi has mailed its alumni seeking help to place the current batch or recommend graduates to firms looking to hire engineers. IIT-Bombay and Birla Institute of Technology and Science have also reached out to its alumni.As the placement session for the academic year 2023-24 at IIT-Delhi draws to a close, we find ourselves faced with a significant challenge. Despite our best efforts, approximately 400 students are yet to secure job placements. In light of this, we are reaching out to our esteemed alumni network , seeking your assistance in providing job opportunities for these graduating students, according to RTI responses .From offering students jobs in their organisations to providing referrals and recommendations to even extending internship opportunities, the appeal goes on to ask old students to support their juniors. ""On behalf of the Office ofCareer Services (OCS) at IIT-Delhi, we appeal to you to consider extending a helping hand to our students.

While placements are still on and will go on till June end, about 10% of the batch - or 250 candidates - who are participating in placements are yet to find a job. According to an RTI by Singh, last year, 329 candidates were not placed and 171 of them from the class of 2022 failed to find a job.V Ramgopal Rao, BITS group vice-chancellor, said, ""Everywhere, placements are 20% to 30% lower. If some institute is saying all students have been placed, the quality of jobs leaves much to be desired. This is the first year when ChatGPT and large language models have started showing their impact. If two people can do the work of three people, we are already 30% down in hiring.

bail plea

on ground of suppression of facts

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to entertain Jharkhand's former CM Hemant Soren 's petition challenging the validity of his arrest by ED in a money laundering case related to alleged illegal acquisition of 8.8 acres in Ranchi, thus scotching his hopes for interim bail to campaign in the polls.A vacation bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and S C Sharma critiqued Soren for suppressing from SC that the trial court had taken cognisance of the chargesheet against him and, also, that his bail petition had been dismissed.Soren 's lawyer Kapil Sibal was allowed to withdraw the plea on request.We expected some candour from the petitioner to inform SC that he had applied for bail and that it was dismissed. It was also not brought to our notice that the trial court has taken cognisance of the chargesheet. Petitioners must not come to SC suppressing facts,"" the bench said.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal took responsibility for the twin facts not being mentioned before the bench. ""Soren was in jail. The fault is mine and not that of Soren. I have never ever even attempted to suppress facts from the court,"" he said. The bench suggested that a senior advocate should not take the blame on behalf of the petitioner. As the bench kept reiterating its serious reservations on suppression of vital facts by Soren and said it would dismiss the petition on that ground alone, Sibal requested that the petitioner be allowed to withdraw the plea challenging his arrest. The court accepted the request and dismissed the petition as withdrawn.Prior to withdrawal of the petition, Sibal said Soren was seeking interim bail while challenging his ""illegal"" arrest on Jan 31.But the bench said once the trial court took cognisance of the chargesheet, the case took a different hue as the trial court had rendered a prima facie opinion that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the charges against the accused. This vital fact was not shared with SC when the petition challenging arrest was filed, it said.Sibal attempted to put the blame on Jharkhand HC. ""The petition challenging the arrest was filed on Feb 2 and order was reserved on Feb 28. For two months, HC judge kept the verdict reserved knowing that chargesheet would be filed within 60 days rendering the challenge infructuous. Can a judge's actions prejudice a person's fundamental right to liberty? I have been saying that Soren has been wrongly dealt with by HC.""Unconvinced, the bench proceeded to dismiss the petition. Sibal interjected and requested for withdrawal of the petition. The bench agreed. But it declined to entertain Sibal's request for a direction to HC to decide Soren's bail plea in a month and said, ""It is difficult for the SC to manage the business of high courts.""",Jharkhand's former CM Hemant Soren's petition challenging the validity of his arrest by ED in a money laundering case related to alleged illegal acquisition of 8.8 acres in Ranchi.

The voting percentage has not been as expected. Can BJP win more than 400 seats even if voting is less? Who are these voters who are not leaving their homes?

PM

Voting percentage increased in Kashmir. What is the message of increased voting in Kashmir?

What difference do you feel in the elections and campaign of 2024 as compared to 2014 and 2019?

What do you consider to be the biggest achievement of the last 10 years and how are you preparing yourself for the third term?

When our reporters travelled across the country, one thing that emerged was that people everywhere talked about employment and inflation. What will you do for the youth in the first 100 days after winning? Would you like to give any assurance to the youth on the employment front?

Foreign policy has been very important during both your tenures. At present, the world is going through a lot of ups and downs. The G7 summit is scheduled immediately after the election results. How do you see India’s role in the new situation?

BJP’s entire campaign is focused on you. Has this reduced the importance of MPs and reduced the incentive for them to cultivate their constituents because they can now hope to win only through Modi magic?

You got the women’s reservation bill passed. Will we see this implemented by the new govt?

The political situation in Maharashtra has become very complicated. Will NDA be able to repeat the record of the last two times?

BJP has made a lot of efforts in West Bengal. Last time, BJP was successful in winning 18 seats. How difficult is this state for you compared with others and what is your expectation this time?

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had to go to jail in the liquor scam case. He says ED has framed him and that no money has been recovered from him till now.

This time, Congress and AAP are contesting elections together in Delhi. Can this cause any problem for BJP in winning the seven seats thrice in a row? This time, you have changed six candidates.

Prime Minister, you are the MP from Kashi. You have promoted Kashi a lot in the last 10 years. Today, Kashi is becoming the most preferred tourism destination in the country. The infrastructure work done by you has also brought a lot of change in Banaras. How do you see the impact of this on the economy and employment situation of Banaras and Purvanchal?

The opposition says democracy is in danger and if BJP wins, we will remain a democracy only in form.

You look very fit. What’s the secret of your health, your routine from morning till night?

'Vote To Save Democracy': Cong Leader Digvijaya Singh Warns Of 'Change In Constitution'

PM Modi brushed aside the allegation that he was seeking a 'super majority' to change the Constitution as ""fresh falsehood"" being spread by opposition after ""failure"" of its campaign on the purchase of Rafale fighters five years ago.""Earlier, their trick used to work sometimes, but today, in the age of social media , their lies get exposed within minutes.They lied on Rafale, they lied on HAL, they were caught. India knows who wants to change the Constitution. Who had conspired to end democracy through Emergency?"" Modi said in an interview with Hindi daily Navbharat Times.Modi also rejected allegations levelled by Arvind Kejriwal and others that the Centre has been misusing central agencies, including ED, against opposition. Not a single such case has been proved to be based on false charges, he said, adding the Delhi CM has lost his credibility. ""After coming out on bail for a few days, he (Kejriwal) has been further exposed. He and his people (AAP netas) are making mistakes, and blaming BJP. But public knows the truth,"" he said.Describing the rise in voting percentage in Kashmir as the most gratifying part of the polls, he said, ""I am satisfied that steps we have taken for the better future of J&K are yielding positive results."": It is very important for any democracy that people participate actively in voting. This is a bigger issue than the victory or defeat of any party. In my rallies through the country, I am appealing to people to vote. I tell them to consider voting as an obligation and fulfil it. As for BJP’s prospects... after four phases of elections, we have achieved the majority mark. Now the fight is only for crossing the 400-mark. Experts can go on analysing, but if they take care to see BJP’s chemistry with voters, they will realise that the slogan of crossing 400 is going to become a reality.■ For me, the most gratifying part of the current polls is the rise in voting percentage in Kashmir. Pictures of people queuing up outside polling stations there are so energising. I am satisfied that the steps we have taken for the better future of Jammu & Kashmir are yielding positive results. After Srinagar, we have seen bumper voting in Baramulla also. Every Kashmiri is feeling relieved after seeing changes post-370 (abrogation). The people there have understood that they were being cheated all these years under the guise of Article 370. For decades, the people of Jammu & Kashmir were kept away from development. The people there were troubled by corruption but lacked options because of the control of dynastic parties. Today, people there are voting for development without any fear or pressure.■ When I went among the people in 2014, I got the opportunity to know their expectations. They wanted change, development. In 2019, I saw the glow of confidence in people’s eyes. That confidence came from the work of our govt in those five years. I realised that people’s aspirations have expanded in the period. They now have bigger dreams about their families, and also about the country. The last five years have been one of rapid growth and big decisions. It has affected the life of every person. Now, when I am campaigning in the 2024 elections, I see a determination in the eyes of people. This is the resolution of developed India. This is the resolution of corruption-free India. This is the resolve of a strong India; 140 crore Indians are confident that their dreams can be fulfilled only under the BJP govt, hence there is unprecedented enthusiasm among the public about the third innings of our govt.■ In the last 10 years, our govt has taken many major decisions related to economy, social justice, welfare of the poor and national interest. Our actions have impacted people of every class and every community. If you analyse different areas, you will come to know about our achievements and how people have been affected by them. I am very satisfied that we were able to bring 25 crore people out of poverty. We were able to provide houses, toilets, electricity, water, gas connections and free treatment facilities to crores of people. They had not even imagined these changes in their lives. We have given them the right to live with dignity and the courage to stand on their own feet, also the belief that their children will not have to go through what they suffered. We also made efforts to empower female members of the household. Women have become financially strong through schemes like Lakhpati Didi, Drone Didi.■ In the last 10 years, we have been successful in keeping inflation under control. During UPA’s time, inflation rate used to be in double digits. Today, there is a situation of war in different corners of the world. These circumstances have affected the country’s economy and inflation. We gave priority to the interests of the people and did not allow the price of petrol and diesel to go up. If the price of petrol and diesel had increased, everything would have become expensive.Today, poor families get free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh in the best hospitals. Due to Jan Aushadhi Kendras, there has been 70-80% relief in the cost of medicines. Be it knee surgery or heart operation, the cost of everything has reduced by more than half. Today, loan rates are the lowest in the country. If you want to buy a car or a house, then easy and cheap loan is available. Personal loan was never this easy in the country. Farmers are getting bags of urea and fertiliser at 10 times lower prices than the world’s price. Many new employment opportunities have been created in the last 10 years. Lakhs of youths have got govt jobs. New employment opportunities have been created in the private sector. According to EPFO, 6 crore new members have joined it in the last seven years. Periodic Labour Force Survey data shows that unemployment rate, which was 6% in 2017, has come down to 3%. The youth now have opportunities to progress in the space sector, drone sector, gaming sector also. The digital revolution in the country has also created opportunities for the youth. Today, data is so cheap in India and that is why the creator economy of the country is growing. Today, there are more than 1.25 lakh startups in the country, which are creating a large number of employment opportunities. We have prepared an action plan for the first 100 days of our govt, in which we have added 25 more days separately for the youth. We are considering the suggestions of youth coming from all over the country, and after the results, work on it will start rapidly.■ Perhaps this is the first election in which India’s foreign policy is being discussed so much. That is because India’s reputation has grown in the last 10 years. Every Indian feels proud when the country’s reputation rises. India became a strong voice of the Global South in the G20 summit, now India’s role in the G7 is going to be very important. Today, every country in the world knows that India has a strong govt.We have kept our national interest paramount in our foreign policy. Today, when we are at the trade agreement table, the other side instantly realises that it is having to deal with a new India. Initially, they were surprised but have now accepted the reality of new India, an India full of confidence. India has strongly told countries engaged in military confrontation that this is not the time for war. Today, the world believes that India’s progress is good for the entire world and humanity.■ This is the opposition’s propaganda. BJP works like a team. Every member of this team is working hard to win the elections. Every party worker is as important as the PM in the campaign. True, as PM, I definitely go to connect with the public, but people connect with us only through the MP candidate. I am going to the people with the national vision and am giving the guarantee of fulfilling it, while our MP candidate is giving the assurance of fulfilling local aspirations.■ This question has emerged from the disappointing experience of Congress rule, when laws were made but it took years to get notified. Nari Shakti Vandan Act has an important role in the roadmap we have prepared for the next five years. We are committed to giving rights to half the country’s population. A new era of women’s empowerment will begin with increasing participation of women in Parliament and legislative assemblies of the country.■ The situation in Maharashtra has, in fact, become simple. People have to choose between dynastic parties and a grand alliance dedicated to the development of the country. Shiv Sena, which is the real inheritor of Balasaheb Thackeray’s ideology, is with us. People are seeing that the fake Shiv Sena has abandoned its core ideas and joined hands with Congress. Similarly, NCP has associated itself with us for the development of Maharashtra and the country. Now, the NCP of Maha ‘Vinash’ Aghadi is only asking for votes to take his (Sharad Pawar) family forward. People are also seeing that the INDI coalition has already accepted defeat. Now, he (Pawar) is talking about merging with Congress to save his existence after the elections. Voting for such people is wasting your vote. This time, we are going to break our previous record in Maharashtra.■ Be it TMC, Congress or Left, all of them have committed the same sins in Bengal. People in Bengal have understood that these parties have only slogans and no vision for development. Once, people from other states used to come to Bengal for employment, today people from all over Bengal are forced to migrate. The public is also seeing that parties that are contesting against each other in Bengal are seen together in Delhi. There can be no bigger deception than this. This is the reason why INDI Alliance is not able to win the trust of the people. The people of Bengal have been tolerating corruption, violence, anarchy, mafia and appeasement for a long time. TMC’s identity has become that of a scam govt, which has crushed the dreams of the youth to fill its coffers. The situation there is that even after getting a govt job, the youth are not sure whether their job will remain or will be lost. People are completely disappointed with the current govt in Bengal. Now, the development model of BJP is in front of them. Wherever I went in Bengal, I saw unprecedented confidence in BJP among the people. Especially in Bengal, I saw that I was getting a lot of love from women. Whenever I meet women, they become emotional, I too am not able to control my emotions. We will win more seats than before in Bengal this time.■ Have you ever come across an accused who has acknowledged perpetrating a scam? Or one who says that police rightly arrested him? If the agencies framed him, why did he (Kejriwal) not get relief from the court? The opposition, which has accused ED and the agencies, has till date not been able to prove that even a single allegation against them was false. He came out on bail for a few days but has got further exposed. He and his people are making mistakes and are blaming BJP. But people know their reality. His words no longer have any credibility.■ INDI Alliance parties are fighting a losing battle in Delhi. They are facing an existential crisis. After the polls, there will be no such thing as INDI Alliance left. The people of Delhi had ousted Congress long ago, now they want to survive by joining hands with other parties. Did anyone ever think that the day would come for Congress, which ruled the country for so long, that members of its ‘first family’ would vote for some other candi date and not for their own party? The parties of INDI Alliance in Delhi are distinguished by two features: they are corrupt and lie shamelessly. They try to manipulate public sentiment and make false promises. People are very intelligent today, they will decide. BJP has fielded its candidates keeping in mind the interest of people. In BJP, no Lok Sabha seat is considered a leader’s property. The party takes decisions according to what is appropriate in the public interest. For us, politics is a medium of service. This is the reason why our workers do not get disappointed that their ticket has been cut, rather they engage in serving the public with full dedication.■ Kashi is a wonderful city. On one hand, it is the oldest city in the world. It has been revered in the Puranas. On the other hand, it is also the economic nucleus of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In the last 10 years, we have developed religious tourism in Kashi a lot. We focused on city streets, cleanliness, facilities in markets, train and bus arrangements. We created many facilities for passengers from the station to different places in the city. After all this, when we set out to promote Banaras, there was a strong desire among devotees across the country to see the new Kashi. Now, many times more tourists come here than earlier. This created new employment opportunities in the entire city. We have started bringing industries to Banaras. A new campus of TCS has been built, Banas Dairy has been built, Trade Facilitation Centre has been built, new machines are being given to weavers of Kashi, youth have got Mudra loans. This gave a new impetus to the economy not only of Banaras but also of many surrounding districts.■ Congress and its ecosystem have come out to contest elections on the basis of lies and rumours. Their trick would work earlier but today, in the age of social media, its lies get exposed within minutes. They lied on Rafale, they were caught. They lied on Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, they got caught. The public no longer takes them seriously. The country knows who wants to change the Constitution. Who had conspired to end the country’s democracy through Emergency? The Constitution was changed the maximum number of times during the tenure of Congress. They changed the original copy of the Constitution for appeasement. Congress curbed the freedom of expression through the first amendment. In 60 years, Congress repeatedly attacked the basic spirit of the Constitution and dismissed many state govts one after the other. Congress holds the record for imposing President’s rule the maximum number of times. They want to destroy the Constitution because it is an obstacle to their real intentions. You see, the framers of the Constitution had opposed reservation on the basis of religion. But Congress has repeatedly tried to bring it to please its vote bank. After several failed efforts, they implemented it at the cost of OBCs. The leaders of Congress and INDI Alliance shed tears for democracy, but reality is that they use all their strength to crush democracy and suppress the voice of the people.■ I believe that I have been greatly blessed by some divine power, which has made me a medium for public welfare. Over the years, my belief has strengthened that God has chosen me to fulfil a special responsibility. He is also giving me the strength to complete it. The feeling of serving people gives me energy.","PM Modi says he is satisfied that steps have been taken for the better future of J&K. He rejects allegations levelled by Arvind Kejriwal and others that the Centre has been misusing central agencies, including ED, against opposition. ""I am appealing to people to fulfil their obligation to vote,"" he says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110343316,imgsize-1135363,width-400,resizemode-4/110343316.jpg"

EC officials: Difference of only few lakhs between P1 & final figures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-officials-difference-of-only-few-lakhs-between-p1-final-figures/articleshow/110343246.cms,"NEW DELHI: Dismissing the noise over the gap in election day turnout numbers and the final figures released by it, Election Commission officials on Wednesday said any calculation of ""change"" in turnout has to be made on the difference between the numbers updated on the day after voting () and the final figures which are released a few days later, while pointing out that the gap between the updated numbers the day after polling and the final numbers is only a few lakhs.Congress has questioned the 1.07 crore increase in voting by citing the difference between the numbers updated on EC 's app on the day of polling and the final turnout data . Officials who refused to speak on record by saying that the matter was pending in Supreme Court, said it was wrong to take the numbers on polling day , as distinct from those made available the following day, as the basis, for the simple reason that details of voting from remote polling stations were rarely in on that day.Going by the updated turnout figures, both in absolute and percentage terms, figures were not very different from the ""final"" ones released by the commission, they said. For example, in the first phase, the overall voting percentage increased from 63.5% on polling day (April 19) to 66.1% the next day. The final voting was the same as the percentage.The trend was the same in the first three phases while in the fourth, the final voting rose marginally to 69.2% compared to the figure of 68.9%. In this phase, maximum increase was recorded in the updated data. Sources said this was because of high turnout later in the day as polling had to be extended in several polling stations.Officials cited data from 2019 to counter claims of a high level of revision. In all the phases in 2019, the gap between the number released at the evening press conference on polling day and the final numbers released by EC ranged between 1.5% and 3.4%.""All these years, turnout data has been updated on the second day after all polling parties provide the exact number of people who voted in each polling booth. After completing polling at booths, poll parties come to the returning officer concerned with Form 17C, which contains the exact number of votes cast. EVMs and Form 17C are kept in strong rooms. This is a physical activity,"" said an EC source.In the 2019 elections, the voting percentage was updated 5-6 days after the day of polling in every phase and there was also an increase.The source said in some cases, the process got completed by late afternoon the day after polling and by night, EC's voter turnout app reflects the latest poll percentage. ""There is no question of any change or increase in the total turnout at each polling station as the details are recorded in Form 17C and the polling agents get signed copies of this form,"" the official said.",Congress has questioned the 1.07 crore increase in voting by citing the difference between the numbers updated on EC's app on the day of polling and the final turnout data.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday said the 2016 surgical strikes and the 2019 Balakot airstrikes were a ""direct message"" against executing terror operations in India.In a veiled attack on Pakistan, the foreign minister said, "" Uri and Balakot were meant to demonstrate that no, life will not go on and that there will be a price and don't think because you've done something and run away to that side, that you are safe there.You will not be safe there. It will not be safe across the line of control nor across international borders. So there was a clear, direct message out there and I think the people to whom that message was intended to be sent, hopefully got it.""Drawing a comparison between India's response to the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack and response after the Uri and Pulwama attacks, Jaishankar said: ""I think nothing can tell you more clearly, more sharply, because, you know, at the end of the day, the armed forces are the same, the bureaucracy is the same, the intelligence is the same. So if you look at what are the structural inputs and responses of the system, it would be the same"".Jaishankar also spoke about India's bid for a permanent seat in the UNSC, stating that ""things are moving in a positive direction"".""My sense is things are moving in a positive direction. There will be people who will resist it. Because everybody competes, nobody wants anybody else to get ahead. But if you ask me a sense, which way is it moving, I think it is moving favourably, I think more and more countries recognise today what a strong case India has and more and more countries accept the UN itself needs to be reformed, there is no Africa, no Latin America there, very few developing countries out there, I think that also is a fact,"" he said.""So, I feel as part of a Viksit Bharat.. the Viksit Bharat will have many, many faces, and many many expressions, and UN Security Council will be one of them,"" he added.UNSC has 15 members.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals.

Kate Middleton portrait sparks controversy amid cancer battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/kate-middleton-portrait-sparks-controversy-amid-cancer-battle/articleshow/110347636.cms,"NEW DELHI: A newly unveiled portrait of Kate Middleton has stirred significant controversy , drawing sharp criticism from the public. The artwork, which was intended to honor the Duchess of Cambridge, has been met with widespread disapproval, with many describing it as ""just bad.""The portrait's release coincides with ongoing updates about Kate Middleton's battle with cancer, adding a layer of sensitivity to the public's reaction.Critics have not held back, with one particularly blunt comment summing up the general sentiment: ""It's just bad."" The artwork has faced a barrage of negative feedback, with many feeling that it fails to capture the duchess's likeness accurately.One particularly harsh critique described the portrait as ""dreadful,"" capturing the sentiment of many who felt that the artwork did not do justice to Kate Middleton's likeness.This incident follows a previous controversy involving a Mother's Day photo editing mishap, which had also sparked public outrage. The current criticism further compounds the scrutiny surrounding the portrayal of Kate Middleton in public media.Despite the negative reception, some have called for a more understanding approach, emphasizing the subjective nature of art and the challenges artists face in depicting well-known figures.

New York City is beginning to evict some people in migrant shelters under stricter rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-city-is-beginning-to-evict-some-people-in-migrant-shelters-under-stricter-rules/articleshow/110347128.cms,"NEW YORK: New York City stepped up its efforts to push migrants out of its overwhelmed shelters Wednesday as it began enforcing a new rule that limits some adult asylum-seekers to a month in the system before they have to find a bed on their own.Migrants without young children must now move out of the hotels, tent complexes and other shelter facilities run by the city and find other housing after 30 days - or 60 days for those aged 18-23 - unless they provide proof of ""extenuating circumstances"" and are granted an exemption.As of late Wednesday, 192 migrants had applied for an extension after hitting their limit, and 118 had been approved, Mayor Eric Adams' office said. Thousands more are expected to receive eviction notices in the coming months.Mamadou Diallo, a 39-year-old from Senegal, says he's not sure where he'll go when his time expires later this week at a shelter in the Bronx.He hopes to get an extension, noting that he just filed his asylum application and has been taking English classes but can't apply for a work permit under federal rules until about five months after applying for asylum.""I don't have anywhere to go,"" Diallo said Wednesday. ""I'm going to school. I'm looking for a job. I'm trying my best.""The new restrictions came after Adams' administration in March succeeded in altering the city's unique "" right to shelter "" rule requiring it to provide temporary housing for every homeless person who asks for it.Before the new rule came into effect, adult migrants without children were still limited to 30 days in a shelter, but they were able to immediately reapply for a new bed with no questions asked.The city also restricts migrant families with young children to 60-day stays, but they aren't impacted by the new rule and can still reapply without providing any justification.Still, an audit found that the rollout was ""haphazard,"" over the past six monthsImmigrant rights and homeless advocates say they're closely monitoring the eviction process, which impacts some 15,000 migrant adults. The city shelter system currently houses about 65,000 migrants, but many of those are families with kids.""Our concern is people will be denied for reasons that could be appealed or because of some error or because they didn't have all the documentation required,"" said David Giffen, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless. ""We're watching very carefully to see if that happens because nobody in need of shelter in New York City should ever be relegated to sleeping on the streets.""Adams, a Democrat, on Tuesday pushed back at critics who have called the city's increasingly restrictive migrant shelter rules inhumane and haphazardly rolled out, saying the city simply can't keep housing migrants indefinitely. New York City has provided temporary housing to nearly 200,000 migrants since the spring of 2022, with more than a thousand new arrivals coming to the city each week, he noted.""People said it's inhumane to put people out during the wintertime, so now they say it's inhumane to do it in the summertime,"" Adams said. ""There's no good time. There's no good time.""The move comes as Denver, another city that's seen an influx of migrants, embarks on an ambitious migrant support program that includes six-month apartment stays and intensive job preparation for those who can't yet legally work. Meanwhile Chicago has imposed 60-day shelter limits on adult migrants with no option for renewal, and Massachusetts has capped stays for families to nine months, starting in June.Adams had asked a court in October to suspend the ""right to shelter"" requirement entirely, but the move was opposed by immigrant rights and homeless advocacy groups. In March, they settled, with an agreement that set the new rules for migrants.The agreement still allows for city officials to grant extensions on shelter stays on a case-by-case basis.City officials say migrants need to show they're making ""significant efforts to resettle,"" such as applying for work authorization or asylum, or searching for a job or an apartment.Migrants can also get an extension if they can prove they have plans to move out of the city within 30 days, have an upcoming immigration-related hearing or have a serious medical procedure or are recovering from one.Migrants between the ages of 18 and 20 years old can also get extensions if they're enrolled full-time in high school.""While these changes will require some adaptation, we are confident that they will help migrants progress to the next stage of their journeys, reduce the significant strain on our shelter system and enable us to continue providing essential services to all New Yorkers,"" Camille Joseph Varlack, Adams' chief of staff, said Wednesday in an emailed statement.","Migrants without young children must now move out of the hotels, tent complexes and other shelter facilities run by the city.

The two leaders will meet again in the Oval Office on Thursday, followed by a joint news conference and a state dinner.Senior administration officials said Biden and Ruto would discuss a range of issues from trade to debt relief and the way forward for Haiti, Ukraine, Sudan and other areas during their meeting.On Wednesday, Biden said he and Ruto would launch a new era of technology cooperation between the two countries that would include work on cyber security, artificial intelligence and semiconductors. He did not mention the security designation.The US will also announce $250 million in new investments through the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), expanding the US financing agency's portfolio in Kenya to over $1 billion, DFC said.Both countries share a commitment to ensuring technology is developed and deployed in a manner that advances transparency, accountability, and human rights, a US official said.Kenya, like the United States, has become ""an engine for innovation"", the official said, citing its $1 billion ""Silicon Savannah"" technology hub that is home to more than 200 startups spanning a range of sectors, including clean energy, microelectronics, financial technology, and e-commerce.Businesses that took part included Alphabet; Baylis Emerging Markets, a private equity firm specializing in African markets; BasiGo, a Kenyan electric bus company; Teneo, a global CEO consulting and advisory firm, and Gearbox Software, which is an American video game development company.Washington also plans a new semiconductor partnership with Kenya, and is working with Congress to make it the first country in Africa to benefit from funding through the US CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, an administration official said.Biden's designation of Kenya as a major non-NATO ally comes as it is preparing to send forces to Haiti as part of a U.N.-led force deploying to address the security crisis in the Caribbean.The designation is granted by the United States to close, non-NATO allies that have strategic working relationships with the US military.The White House had no immediate comment.Biden in March designated Qatar as a major non-NATO ally of the US, fulfilling the promise he had made to Qatar earlier in the year.Gyude Moore, head of the Africa Initiative at the Center for Global Development, said Kenya had proven to be a dependable and reliable partner for the US at a time when South Africa was pursuing its own more independent foreign policy.Cameron Hudson, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the move would formalize a shift that has seen Kenya ""move more squarely into a US orbit"" in recent years, including greater cooperation on Somalia.""It's very significant.

The survey is a highly regarded source of estimates of tobacco, alcohol and drug use in the United States.In 2022, an estimated 17.7 million people used marijuana daily or near-daily compared to 14.7 million daily or near-daily drinkers, according to the study. From 1992 to 2022, the per capita rate of reporting daily or near-daily marijuana use increased 15-fold.The trend reflects changes in public policy. Most states now allow medical or recreational marijuana, though it remains illegal at the federal level. In November, Florida voters will decide on a constitutional amendment allowing recreational cannabis, and the federal government is moving to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.Research shows that high-frequency users are more likely to become addicted to marijuana, said Dr. David A. Gorelick, a psychiatry professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study.The number daily users suggests that more people are at risk for developing problematic cannabis use or addiction, Gorelick said.""High frequency use also increases the risk of developing cannabis-associated psychosis,"" a severe condition where a person loses touch with reality, he said.","In 2022, an estimated 17.7 million people used marijuana daily or near-daily.

The child was brought before the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, where his legal representative asserted that the judge dismissed the case after receiving an affidavit.Officials from WAPDA and PESCO expressed uncertainty regarding the child's involvement in the alleged offense.This incident follows a significant revelation last month, where power theft within Power Distribution Companies (DISCOs) reportedly caused a loss of PKR 438 billion to the national treasury. Sources indicated that these losses were a considerable portion of the total annual billing of PKR 723 billion.The power division identified the poorest performing DISCOs, highlighting companies in Hyderabad, Sukkur, Peshawar, Quetta, and Tribal areas for their records. On April 7, the Punjab energy department raised concerns about power distribution companies overcharging government institutions, which it labeled a burden on the provincial exchequer.The department noted that Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO), Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) were overcharging government departments.The department reported that there are over 102,000 electric connections across provincial departments, with a significant discrepancy between actual consumption and billed amounts. For the financial year 2022-23, the provincial departments consumed electricity worth over PKR 1.91 billion but were billed PKR 76 billion.In response to this issue, the federal government approved the deployment of Federal Investigation Officers (FIA) to electricity distribution companies (DISCOs) to curb power theft and enhance revenue recovery. This measure was in line with demands from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as reported by ARY News.","A 3-year-old toddler was booked for electricity theft in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.
