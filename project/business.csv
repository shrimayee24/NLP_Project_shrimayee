"Isro docks satellites, India takes first step towards entering elite club of nations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-docks-satellites-india-takes-first-step-towards-entering-elite-club-of-nations/articleshow/117282977.cms,"Poll What Do You Think About ISRO's First Successful Satellite Docking? A Step Towards Becoming a Global Space Leader A Remarkable Achievement for India's Space Program

BENGALURU: In a milestone for India’s space capabilities, Isro completed its first-ever satellite docking manoeuvre early Thursday (January 16), marking a crucial step toward multiple future missions — including Chandrayaan-4 and the country’s own space station — in the pipeline.Multiple sources confirmed that the docking attempt was a success. No official announcement about the same was done at the time of writing this report.With this, India has taken the first step towards joining an elite club of nations — the US, Russia and China — that boast of such technology. Isro will need several more docking tests before claiming mastery over the technology.The Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX), launched on December 30, saw two satellites that were launched separately unite at an orbital altitude of approximately 475km, with the final commands executed from Isro Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (Istrac) in Bengaluru.“We didn’t completely automate everything. Since the launch there have been five to six stages, and at each stage, we were monitoring from the ground and giving a go-ahead before proceeding to the next,” M Sankaran, director URSC, had told TOI explaining the process.Isro employed a petal-based docking system, aligned with international standards including the International Docking System Standard (IDSS).The space agency had taken a cautious approach to the entire operation, including ground simulations based on an abort scenario that on January 6 identified the need for further validation. This crucial input saw Isro postpone the docking procedure from January 7 to January 9, only to postpone it again.By Jan 11, the two satellites achieved a distance of 230m from the distance of 1.5km. “Arrested at Inter Satellite Distance (ISD) of 230 m, all sensors are being evaluated. Spacecraft’s health is normal,” Isro had said.A day before that Isro had said spacecraft were at a distance of 1.5 km and on hold mode. “Further drift to 500 m is planned to be achieved by tomorrow (January 11) morning.” Isro had said. On January 9, the space agency had put the satellites on a slow drift course after it was forced to put off the docking on the day.After the launch on December 30, Isro has been preparing for the docking, which requires multiple steps/stages, each of which was monitored from the ground and given a go-ahead before proceeding to the next.However, it has had to postpone its docking attempt multiple times. On January 6, a day before the first docking attempt was scheduled, Isro had found that the docking process required further validation through ground simulations based on an abort scenario it identified on the day. And the docking was rescheduled for January 9.And, on January 8, Isro said: “While making a maneuver to reach 225m between satellites the drift was found to be more than expected, post non-visibility period. The planned docking for tomorrow (January 9) is postponed. Satellites are safe.” The space agency had initiated the drift on the chaser spacecraft — the two satellites are designated chaser and target — late on January 8.On January 9, a day after the drift between satellites caused Isro to postpone SpaDeX for the second time, the space agency managed to put the spacecraft in a slow drift course. “...The drift has been arrested and spacecraft put in a slow drift course to move closer to each other. By tomorrow (January 10), it is expected to reach initialisation conditions,” Isro said Thursday.And on January 12, it carried out a trial to reach up to 15m and further to 3m and then the satellites were moved to a safe distance.Docking in space is a complex process and so far, only three other countries have mastered it.","Multiple sources confirmed that the docking attempt was a success.

Das ka dum: A man of The Times,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/das-ka-dum-a-man-of-the-times-bhaskar-das/articleshow/117282233.cms,"His ever-changing hairstyles and bold, unconventional fashion choices are not the only things that made Bhaskar Das memorable. The colourful marketing maverick , whose BDisms are legendary in ad and media circles, passed into a higher realm Wednesday morning (at age 72), surrounded at home by his loved ones, which is how he wanted it to be.BD, as he was fondly called by many (and Bhaskarda by some), joined Bennett Coleman (BCCL) as a management trainee, and after more than three decades in frontline revenue roles, retired as President-Response.In the two and a half years since he was diagnosed with lymphoma, even as his tall and lean frame grew frailer by the day, he never once lost his joie de vivre or sense of humour. A week ago, when an old colleague went to visit him at Breach Candy hospital and announced himself at the door, Bhaskar’s nano-second response was, “I have cancer, I don’t have amnesia.”Nor did he lose his life-long hunger for learning. He gave his admission interview for his third PhD the very day he began chemotherapy. He was forever young, forever curious.For a number of years, he doubled up as Brand Director for ET. It was a role that required him to delicately and strategically balance the demands of editorial with his primary responsibility as advertising and sales head. He did it with a combination of intellect and intuition. He was always appreciative of good journalism, read the paper end to end, and would often ecstatically call or message in the morning about a great headline or a well-written story. That made it difficult for editors to say no to him when he would “request with folded hands” for an “innovative ad” (read odd-sized ad) in the paper! Their first reaction would almost always be “no”, but then he would coax and cajole, and more often than not, manage to wear down their defences.Those who worked with him recall how BD backed innovative ideas. Among the many examples they recount is how he stood by the team that worked on India’s first in-train magazine, Rajdhani Times, even when most dismissed it as a futile endeavour. He set up the Grey Cell and Red Cell divisions, recognising that experiential solutions and IPs would be a focus area for brands. He kept his door open to everyone, turning his office into a hub of ideas and energy.His bite-sized nuggets of wisdom — “You can’t fight a tsunami with an umbrella” — became part of lore. He always asked the team to think “future-backward,” which meant viewing the present from a future perspective and planning accordingly.After retiring from The Times of India , he went on to serve in top-level positions at a number of large media organisations.He faced the end of this phase of his journey with equanimity and a lightness of being. But not before he had given his feisty wife Shoma detailed instructions on which songs were to be sung and what food was to be served to celebrate his life.He would revel in telling the world that his surname of ‘Das’ was a perfect fit for him because it meant ‘servant’. But to the many who worked with him and whom he would fire up with his infectious enthusiasm, he was ‘Bossman’.","BD, as he was fondly called by many (and Bhaskarda by some), joined Bennett Coleman as a management trainee.

"Fog havoc in Delhi, Grap-4 back as air turns severe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fog-havoc-in-delhi-grap-4-back-as-air-turns-severe/articleshow/117280394.cms,"Overcast skies pull max temp down sharply

NEW DELHI: The capital experienced near-zero visibility conditions till close to noon on Wednesday, the season's most delayed lifting of dense fog that hit normal life and wreaked havoc on air, rail and road traffic in the region.The foggy and humid conditions led to a sharp spike in air pollution, which crossed the 'severe' threshold by late evening, prompting the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to impose curbs under Grap-4, the highest pollution control measures that have been invoked after a gap of 22 days.This brings back the ban on the plying of BS III petrol and BS IV diesel vehicles in Delhi and its neighbouring cities, and stops all construction activities, including linear public projects. It also mandates schools to operate in hybrid mode, giving the option of online classes to students.Visibility dipped to zero from 8.30am to 11.30am, improving gradually in the subsequent hours.Fog is expected to continue in the region, with the met department issuing a ‘yellow’ (be aware) alert for Thursday to Saturday for moderate to dense fog. Some areas received light rain in the evening.R K Jenamani, senior IMD scientist, said visibility was in the range of 100-150 metres (dense fog) since 5.30am on Wednesday. “Dense fog intensified late morning on Wednesday with general visibility reducing to zero from 8.30am at both Safdarjung and IGI Airport. visibility dropped due to calm wind conditions and a stable surface atmospheric boundary layer. Easterly winds brought moisture which intensified the foggy conditions. Zero visibility with very dense fog conditions persisted at both Safdarjung and IGI Airport till 11.30 am,” said Jenamani.This was the first time this season that dense fog had extended beyond 9.30am in the city, he said. By 12.30pm, visibility improved to 250-400 metres. Because of its persistence till late morning, Wednesday’s fog spell had a major impact on road, rail and air traffic. However, the most intense dense fog in terms of duration this season was recorded on Jan 4-5, which lasted for nearly nine hours from 11.30pm to 8.30am, according to IMD’s data.Overcast skies during the day brought down the maximum temperature from 21.2 degrees Celsius on Tuesday to 18.1 degrees C, two notches below normal. The minimum temperature dipped to six degrees C, one degree below normal, compared to 8.9 degrees C a day earlier. Met department’s data shows that Palam, Pusa and Najafgarh recorded 0.5 mm rainfall each from 5.30pm to 8.30pm.“There are chances of very light rain on Wednesday night and Thursday morning under the influence of a western disturbance. Another spell of very light to light rain is expected on Jan 21 night,” said a Met official. The fog spell is likely to continue.","Foggy and humid conditions led to a sharp spike in air pollution, which crossed the'severe' threshold by late evening.

Over to Trump administration as India readies Pannun probe report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-to-trump-administration-as-india-readies-pannun-probe-report/articleshow/117274536.cms,"Gurpatwant Singh Pannun (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The timing of the report submitted by the high-powered committee looking into the Pannun murder plot on US soil is significant, coming as it does days before the swearing-in of president-elect Donald Trump.As far as India is concerned, the recommendation for expeditious legal action against Vikash Yadav , the government official who allegedly masterminded the murder-for-hire plot , should put a lid on the case, or at the very least bring to an end the diplomatic row that threatened to rock the relationship because of its increasing salience at the top levels of the Biden administration .The timing also means that the outgoing administration will have little or practically no time to sit in judgment on the findings of the probe carried out by the Indian committee. That job will be now be handled by the incoming administration which, given its past record, is expected to be more sensitive to India’s security concerns, especially those related to Khalistan separatists ’ anti-India activities.To be sure, and as PM Narendra Modi himself acknowledged in a meeting with outgoing US NSA Jake Sullivan this month, there was significant progress in ties in the past 4 years in key areas like technology, defence, AI, space, semiconductors and civil nuclear energy. However, in pursuing the Pannun case, it also drew a red line saying murder-for-hire was unacceptable irrespective of whether it came from a friend or foe, and seeking criminal accountability at the highest level.Whether that accountability has been established is now for the Trump administration to look into. Given what is at stake - a murder plot against an American national even if an India-designated terrorist - it’s unlikely the new administration will come in the way of prosecutors pursuing the case, but India will hope it won’t get under Trump the top billing it got under the Biden administration.Incoming US NSA Michael Waltz, who met foreign minister S Jaishankar last month, was Wednesday reported to have described the partnership with India as critical for the future.With Yadav, who was initially identified as CC-1 but later named by US authorities, facing criminal charges in the same case here, it’s unlikely the US will press for his extradition, although the final call on that issue will be taken by the American prosecutors. While Canada certainly doesn’t see similar murder-for-hire plots on its soil as ‘lone wolf’ operations, or what India seems to be suggesting through its report in the Pannun case, it’s not clear yet where the bucks stops as far as the US probe into the Pannun plot is concerned. Yadav’s indictment by the Department of Justice though had clearly stated that when he carried out the plot, he was employed with the Indian government’s cabinet secretariat, which looks after RAW, and which is under the PMO.According to diplomatic sources, some of the claims made by Canadian authorities about the involvement of higher-ups may not be informed by shared intelligence with the Americans. However, the US has ruled out the possibility of more information coming out through law enforcement agencies about the plot while the case is heard in court.The Indian committee also recommended functional improvements in systems to prevent such actions, something which the Biden administration had sought. Almost as a parting gift from the Biden administration, Sullivan during his visit this month announced delisting of Indian nuclear entities to promote civil nuclear cooperation with India and resilient clean energy supply chains. By completing its probe before Trump takes over, India can say it didn’t allow calls by the Biden administration for action in the case to go unanswered.",The report submitted by the high-powered committee looking into the Pannun murder plot on US soil is significant. The recommendation for expeditious legal action against Vikash Yadav should put a lid on the case. The outgoing administration will have little or practically no time to sit in judgment on the findings of the probe carried out by the Indian committee.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117274528,imgsize-817453,width-400,resizemode-4/117274528.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Expanding the 'Fast Track Immigration-Trusted Traveller Program' (FTI-TTP), which enables faster immigration for pre-verified flyers through automated e-gates based on biometric authentication , home minister Amit Shah will launch the service Thursday at airports in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Cochin, and Ahmedabad.The program is already running successfully at Indira Gandhi International airport here since June 2024.An official had earlier said FTI-TTP has enabled 60% faster immigration clearance for those enrolled for it. ""Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the 'Fast Track Immigration-Trusted Traveller Program' is a significant initiative under the 'Viksit Bharat'@2047 vision. Its objective is to provide world-class immigration facilities to travellers, making international travel seamless and secure,"" the ministry said. Both Indian citizens and OCI cardholders can avail of the facility free of cost. Shah will inaugurate the FTI-TTP facility at the new airports from Ahmedabad, taking the total number of airports covered so far to eight. The plan is to expand the program to cover 21 airports in the country.FTI-TTP has been implemented through online portal: https://ftittp.mha.gov.in. To enroll, applicants need to complete online registration by filling in their details and uploading the required documents on the portal. The biometric data of registered applicants will be captured either at Foreigners Regional Registration Office or while passing through the airport. Travellers need to scan their airline-issued boarding pass at the e-gate, followed by scanning their passport. At the arrival and departure points, the passenger's biometrics will be authenticated at e-gates. Once authentication is successful, the e-gate will open, and immigration clearance will be deemed granted.","Home Minister Amit Shah will inaugurate the expansion of the 'Fast Track Immigration-Trusted Traveller Program' to seven more airports on Thursday.

India 2nd to US in 'future of work' skills: QS survey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-2nd-to-us-in-future-of-work-skills-qs-survey/articleshow/117277248.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nearly a decade of effort under India's skilling mission is showing results, positioning the country as one of the most prepared job markets for future in-demand skills. The inaugural QS World Future Skills Index ranks India 27th overall, with placements in key parameters: 37th in Skills Fit, 26th in Academic Readiness, and 40th in Economic Transformation . The country ranks ranks second in the Future of Work category, trailing only the US.This index evaluated over 190 countries, over 280 million job postings, more than five million employers' skills demand, over 5,000 universities, and 17.5 million research papers, with India showing particular strength in integrating AI into its workforce. The QS analysis underscores India's readiness to adopt AI, digital, and green technologies, placing it ahead of many countries. The World Economic Forum forecasts a 60% increase in AI skills and a 35% rise in digital skills by 2030, alongside the creation of 24 million green jobs, emphasising the need for workforce adaptability.Job market maturity is often indicated by job listings in cutting-edge fields. In India, the high number of postings for AI, digital, and green skills reflects a business landscape ready for innovation. With a 59% active AI deployment rate among companies, India stands as a global leader in adopting new technologies, aligning with its 99.1 score in the Future of Work indicator.The report says, ""Despite global challenges, including a decline in venture capital (VC) funding, India remains the second-largest destination for VC in the Asia Pacific, reinforcing its robust investment ecosystem essential for innovation and future-ready job creation. The QS report also highlights the critical need for enhancements in India's higher education system, particularly in equipping graduates with the skills most demanded by employers.""Key recommendations for India include increasing tertiary education supply, adopting a modularised approach to higher education, fostering entrepreneurial mindsets, and focusing on green skills integration. Strengthening industry-academia collaboration and boosting research and development investment are pivotal to sustaining long-term growth and competitiveness.Matteo Quacquarelli, vice president, strategy and analytics at QS, said, ""India's exceptional GDP growth, developing economy, and youth population position it uniquely on the global stage. However, to sustain this growth, it is crucial to equip the workforce with relevant skills through comprehensive higher education reforms.""The report says as AI reshapes industries globally, India's proactive alignment of educational curricula with industry needs ensures it remains at the forefront of economic transformation.With sectors like renewable energy and healthcare experiencing growth, the focus on emerging technologies and sustainability is vital for India's economic resilience and workforce evolution.Quacquarelli added that between 2025 and 2030, India's economy is expected to grow at an average of 6.5% annually, putting the country ahead of many competitor economies. ""But as the economy continues to evolve, students, graduates, and workers need support to keep pace with changing skill requirements. The 2020 National Education Policy emphasised creating an adult education curriculum framework, and it's important India's higher education is fully leveraged to develop future-needed skills and competencies.""","The inaugural QS World Future Skills Index ranks India 27th overall.

"In last moment U-turn, Karnataka puts off tabling 'caste census'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-last-moment-u-turn-karnataka-puts-off-tabling-caste-census/articleshow/117276949.cms,"BENGALURU: In another U-turn, Karnataka's government has decided to postpone a cabinet discussion on the contentious Karnataka Socio-Economic and Education Survey report, commonly known as the caste census, by another week.Chief minister Siddaramaiah told reporters Wednesday in New Delhi: ""We were supposed to table the report on Thursday. However, we decided to table the report at the next cabinet meeting."" He did not give a reason for the delay, triggering speculation over the sudden decision.The announcement came hours after state home minister G Parameshwara said in Bengaluru that the report was in a sealed envelope - suggesting its contents were unknown - and that it would be opened during Thursday's meeting. ""Govt spent over Rs 160 crore on the census so it is our duty to reveal this information to the public. However, implementation is left to govt,"" said Parameshwara.Sources say the decision to postpone tabling the report was, perhaps, influenced by Congress' high command amid pressure from influential Lingayat and Vokkaliga functionaries in the party. Representatives of the two politically dominant communities have expressed concerns over the potential implications of the report, which they believe undermines their demographic strength.Siddaramaiah, who was in the capital for the inauguration of Congress' new office, dismissed such speculation. ""Some have opposed the report without knowing its contents,"" he said. ""The data is not yet in the public domain. Opposition based on assumption is unnecessary.""On Sunday, deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar, a Vokkaliga face of the party, had assured the community that no injustice would be done, leading to the postponement of a meeting by the Vokkaligara Sangha, which sought to pressure govt to reject the report.The survey, commissioned in 2015 during Siddaramaiah's previous tenure, was completed in 2016 but remained in limbo under successive govts. In 2020, the BJP govt appointed Jayaprakash Hegde as chairman of the Backward Classes Commission and he submitted a final report on Feb 29 last year.Alleged leaks from the report suggest that the numbers of Lingayats and Vokkaligas have been lowered while those of other communities have been inflated. Since these figures shape reservation policies and resource allocation, it has fuelled much discontent.While Dalit and OBC groups are demanding the report's release and implementation, Lingayat and Vokkaliga functionaries, including Congress MLA Shamanur Shivashankarappa, have labelled it ""unscientific"" and have called for a fresh survey.Union minister and JD(S) state chief HD Kumaraswamy has accused Siddaramaiah of using the census to ""degrade"" politically dominant communities. ""This is not just about two communities. Siddaramaiah must explain what he did for marginalised communities during his tenure,"" Kumaraswamy said while urging govt to focus on identifying poor beneficiaries of welfare schemes rather than caste-based enumeration.","Karnataka's government has decided to postpone a cabinet discussion on the contentious Karnataka Socio-Economic and Education Survey report.

NEW DELHI: Government has earmarked 1.5 acres at Rashtriya Smriti complex in the national capital for Manmohan Singh's memorial, to be built adjacent to the site carved out for former President Pranab Mukherjee's samadhi.The ministry of housing and urban affairs has officially informed the family of the late prime minister about the decision and requested them to register a trust - a mandatory requirement for allocation of public land - so that procedural formalities can be completed.Earlier this month, govt officials visited Rashtriya Smriti after the Centre announced a memorial for Singh.Singh's family members have been requested to inspect the site; they are yet to, sources said. Since the family is in mourning, members have not taken a decision on the govt's offer, they added.This is likely to take time. The family will be discussing what kind of a memorial they want to construct, and then will intimate to the govt,"" said one of them.Rashtriya Smriti was developed along the Yamuna bank as a common site for last rites and memorials of Presidents, Vice-Presidents, Prime Ministers and former Presidents, ex-VPs and former PMs. At present, there are memorials of seven leaders, including former PMs Atal Bihari Vajpayee, P V Narasimha Rao, Chandra Sekhar and I K Gujral, at the complex.

Pannun plot: Government panel for 'action' against 'individual',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pannun-plot-government-panel-for-action-against-individual/articleshow/117277751.cms,"Delhi’s stand on Pannun contrasts with its response to Canada’s Nijjar move

NEW DELHI: A high-powered panel set up by the Centre in 2023 to examine US authorities' claim regarding the role of former govt of India official Vikash Yadav in the foiled plot to assassinate US-based Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun has recommended ""legal action against an individual, whose earlier criminal links and antecedents came to notice during the inquiry"".Though the committee, in its report submitted after probing leads provided by the US and its own investigations, has refrained from identifying the ""individual"" against whom legal action is sought to be completed ""expeditiously"", the reference is seen to be of Yadav.An indictment by a US court earlier described Yadav as an official of RAW, India's external intelligence agency, and charged him with conspiring with co-accused Nikhil Gupta, who was later arrested in Prague and extradited to the US, to commit ""murder-for-hire"" and launder money.The panel, after a probe that saw Indian and US sides exchange visits, examine officials from agencies and scrutinise documents, has suggested functional improvements in systems and procedures and new steps to boost India's response capacity, ensure control and coordinated action in dealing with similar matters.To that extent, the committee — formed after the US flagged activities of some organised criminal groups, terrorist organisations and drug peddlers etc “who undermine the security interest of both India and the US” — adopted a reconciliatory tone on what initially appeared to be an irritant to bilateral ties, with US officials protesting against “acts of violence or other efforts to retaliate against those residing in the US for exercising their constitutionally protected rights”.It will be interesting to see if the promised action, though a result of coordination between Indian and US authorities, satisfies the Americans who had insisted on accountability being fixed for the botched up plot to assassinate Pannun. Indian authorities here would also be waiting to see if the pressure is going to ease under the Trump administration set to be inaugurated on Jan 20.New Delhi’s stance contrasts strikingly from its response to Canada’s unsubstantiated accusation about the involvement of its agencies in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardip Singh Nijjar in Canada. The two cases, however, stand on different footing.Unlike the US which backed its case against Yadav with evidence, the Trudeau administration failed to back up its sensational allegation against India.Yadav was arrested by Delhi Police in Dec 2023, though in a totally different case of extortion and kidnapping. He was subsequently granted interim bail in March 2024, followed by regular bail a month later. The case is currently in trial.The ministry of external affairs has already said that Yadav, who had served in CRPF in the past, is no longer in govt service. Yadav was charged by the US authorities in 2023 with conspiracy to kill Pannun, an American citizen and activist-leader of banned outfit Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), along with drug dealer and criminal associate Nikhil Gupta. Gupta, who is currently in US custody, was charged with negotiating the ‘hit job’ payment on Yadav’s behest with a criminal associate, who in reality was a confidential source working for the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). A part-payment of $15,000 was made to the undercover DEA agent posing as a ‘hitman’. Yadav was further charged with providing the ‘hitman’ details of Pannun address, phone number and day-to-day activities.","A panel set up by the Centre in 2023 to examine US authorities' claim regarding the role of former govt of India official Vikash Yadav in foiled plot.

Government plans annual and life-time toll passes for pvt cars plying on NHs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-plans-annual-and-life-time-toll-passes-for-pvt-cars-plying-on-nhs/articleshow/117276085.cms,"NEW DELHI: The highways ministry is working on a plan to issue annual and ‘life-time’ passes for private cars to allow them unlimited travel across the NH network by making a one time lump sum payment for tolls, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday. At present, while private cars constitute about 60% of the traffic on NHs, the share of toll revenue from these vehicles is barely 20-26%.Speaking at a workshop on ‘Barrierless Tolling in India’, Gadkari said, “We get less revenue from private vehicles. Nearly 74% of toll revenue comes from commercial vehicles. So, now we are considering the introduction of a scheme of yearly passes so that they don’t face any problem. We will have no loss, but people will get huge relief.”TOI has learnt that a detailed plan is in the final stages and the ministry will soon take a call on the cost of the annual and life-time’ pass. “Commuters will have the option to go for this. The contours of how many years will be considered as ‘life-time’ pass is under deliberation,” said a source. There have been a few rounds of meetings to decide the course of action in the ministry in recent weeks.Sources said the move has been initiated considering car users are more vocal while the major chunk of the revenue comes from heavy and commercial vehicles. They added that a mechanism is being worked out on how the govt will deal with the private toll operators if they raise claims of high number of pass users on stretches under them.Pointing to how tolling every stretch of highway for optimum collection is becoming an issue among commuters and the need to avoid people going against this, Gadkari said there is need to accelerate barrier free tolling to ensure people “pay for kms travelled”. He added that the govt will roll out a barrier-less global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based toll collection system on NHs. “This system will be better than the current toll collection system,” he added.The minister urged the industry players to ensure that people get the best service and there is no leakage of revenue at any cost. “We will not spare anyone and will take strictest action against deficiencies,” he added.A thought paper prepared by Primus Partners and Think Infra, which was released by Gadkari, claimed that with GNSS-based tolling the traffic flow will improve significantly, eliminating delays and reducing travel time by 20–30% and saving 8–10 minutes per toll point. It estimated that the environmental benefits will include a reduction of 50 lakh tonne of carbon emissions annually and fuel cost savings of approximately Rs 12,000 crore per year.","At present, while private cars constitute about 60% of the traffic on NHs, the share of toll revenue from these vehicles is barely 20-26%.

Rahul calls Bhagwat's statement on Independence 'treason'

NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday attacked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his statement that his party was now battling not only the RSS and BJP but also the Indian State , alleging that leader of opposition’s remarks are a part of billionaire philanthropist George Soros ’s agenda.BJP chief JP Nadda accused Rahul Gandhi and his network of having close ties with urban Naxals and the deep state, claiming they aim to tarnish India's reputation.Responding to Rahul Gandhi's statement, Nadda said in a post on X, ""I 'compliment' Rahul Gandhi for saying clearly what the nation knows- that he is fighting the Indian state! It is not a secret that Gandhi and his ecosystem have close links with Urban Naxals and the Deep State who want to defame, demean and discredit India. His repeated actions have also strengthened this belief. Everything he has done or said has been in the direction of breaking India and dividing our society.""Sharing a video clip of Rahul Gandhi’s speech, BJP IT department head Amit Malviya said, “Rahul Gandhi has now declared an open war against the Indian State itself. This is straight out of George Soros’s playbook.”Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman also targeted Rahul Gandhi over his comments, saying, ""The LoP, who was sworn in by taking oath on the Constitution, is now saying, “We are now fighting the BJP, the RSS and the Indian State itself."" So, what for are you carrying a copy of the constitution in your hand?""Addressing Congress leaders during the inauguration of the party’s new headquarters at Kotla Road, New Delhi, Rahul said, “Do not think we are fighting a fair fight. There is no fairness in this. If you believe that we are fighting a political organisation called the BJP or the RSS, you have not understood what is going on. The BJP and the RSS have captured every single institution of our country. We are now fighting the BJP, the RSS, and the Indian state itself.”During his address, Rahul also expressed concerns over alleged irregularities in the Maharashtra elections. He pointed to a sudden rise of nearly one crore voters between the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha polls, calling it “problematic.”“I clearly stated that something went wrong in the Maharashtra elections. We are uncomfortable with the way the Election Commission operates,” the Congress leader said. He accused the Election Commission of withholding crucial information, particularly the voters’ list with names and addresses, which he said was critical for ensuring transparency.“Why would the Election Commission refuse to make the voters’ list transparent? What purpose does it serve by not providing this information? It is their sacred responsibility to explain why this has happened,” Rahul said.Rahul also targeted RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in his speech, who recently claimed that India achieved “true independence” after the construction of the Ram temple. Rahul described Bhagwat’s statement as “treason” and an insult to the country’s independence movement.“Mohan Bhagwat’s assertion about India not gaining independence in 1947 disrespects all Indians. To say this publicly is treason, as it suggests the Constitution and the fight against British colonialism were invalid,” Rahul said. He further remarked that such statements should warrant legal action in any other democratic country.Rahul added, “The Congress Party has worked with the Indian people to build the success of this country, and it has done so on the foundation of the Constitution. It is about time we stop listening to this nonsense and hold these individuals accountable for their words.”","BJP chief JP Nadda accused Rahul Gandhi and his network of having close ties with urban Naxals and the deep state.

The commissioning of the indigenous vessels highlighted India's growing military manufacturing capabilities.The move is seen as a strategic response to China's expanding influence in the Indian Ocean region and Pakistan's naval expansion plans, which include Chinese assistance to build a 50-vessel fleet.""India is now becoming a major maritime power... (and) the commissioning of three frontline naval combatants will strengthen our efforts to become a global leader and augment our quest for self-reliance,"" PM Modi said at the commissioning ceremony INS Nilgiri, INS Surat, and INS Vaghsheer.""We have taken a big step towards getting the Navy ready for this century,"" he added.This commissioning of these vessels holds major importance for the Indian Navy, considering the traditionally slow pace of domestic shipbuilding, especially crucial now as China continues its rapid naval expansion.India's naval expansion in the past ten years has seen the addition of 33 warships, while China has reportedly inducted 148 vessels during the same period.Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said that these additions will strengthen the naval forces' operational capabilities in protecting national maritime interests. He also confirmed that 62 warships and a submarine are currently under construction.What are the newly inducted vessels: DetailsThe INS Nilgiri is a stealth-capable vessel, which leads Project 17A's seven-frigate fleet, and is a major advancement from the existing Shivalik-class vessels.Each vessel in this series, designed by the Navy's Warship Design Bureau, costs approximately Rs 4,000 crore. These ships, featuring enhanced attack and stealth capabilities, are under construction at dockyards in Mumbai and Kolkata.Captain Nitin Kapoor, commanding the Nilgiri, explained that the vessel's superior stealth characteristics result from its innovative deck design. He said that conventional elements like anchors are now housed in a concealed 'mooring deck' to minimise radar detection.INS Surat is a guided missile destroyer weighing around 8,000 tons and is also the final vessel of the Visakhapatnam class.It has integrated subsystems from Russian, Israeli and Ukrainian warships, while also being India's first warship with artificial intelligence capabilities.The vessel, costing Rs 8,950 crore, completes the quartet of Project 15B ships.Its predecessors - INS Visakhapatnam, Mormugao, and Imphal - were commissioned in November 2021, December 2022, and December 2023, respectively.The armament includes BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles for surface-to-surface engagement, Barak-8 medium-range surface-to-air missiles, alongside various mounted artillery systems.INS Vagsheer is a submarine having advanced stealth capabilities, including sophisticated acoustic absorption technology and an innovative air-independent propulsion system.This vessel represents the final addition to the six new-generation, diesel-electric Scorpene-class submarines. With capabilities to launch torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, it can engage targets both in air and sea domains.These latest submarines are equipped for anti-surface and anti-submarine operations, intelligence gathering, mine deployment, and surveillance activities, according to official sources.

Paradise to peril

Coastal crisis deepens

Beachcombing was synonymous with Sujith's childhood in the sun-kissed shores of Shankumugham in Thiruvananthapuram. The beach was a magnet for family gatherings for shindigs on a sprawling stretch of ochre sand. The Indian Coffee House was an added bonus.The lapping of waves against Kerala 's sandy shores once promised timeless beauty, often the backdrop of postcards and a favoured retreat for travellers. Fast forward to 2025, and the state's idyllic beaches are under siege, with Shankumugham shrinking to a mere patch in 30 years since Sujith's playtime days.Today, these shores tell a tale of relentless erosion, rising sea levels, the ravages of sand mining, and communities struggling to hold onto their seafront homes. Over 55% of Kerala's 590km coastline is now ""vulnerable to erosion"".Two major studies in recent years, one by the National Centre for Coastal Research and another by the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), have painted a stark picture of Kerala's coastal future.According to INCOIS, more than 300km of the state's coastline fall into high and medium vulnerability categories, with some areas experiencing erosion at rates as high as six metres a year. This rapid erosion threatens not only the natural landscape but the livelihoods and homes of more than 9.3 million people spread across nine coastal districts.In regions like Kannur, Kochi, Alappuzha, and Kasaragod, the encroaching sea is a daily reminder of vulnerability. Beaches in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Malappuram, and parts of Thrissur have already vanished or are in the process of disappearing.This accelerating loss is exacerbated by the warming Arabian Sea, which has led to an increase in cyclonic events and sea surges, particularly from May to Aug, with a peak in June and July.The human cost of this environmental crisis is immense. Many coastal communities have been displaced, their homes swallowed by the sea, leaving behind a trail of economic and emotional distress.For as long as anyone can remember, fishing communities along Alappuzha's coast have lived by the saying ""Kadalamma chatikkilla"" - the sea mother won't deceive. But as the shoreline erodes, that ancient faith is faltering. Sand mining, the silent thief, has stripped the beaches, forcing many to abandon their ancestral homes. Over 600 houses have crumbled into the sea's maw, and poverty grips the fisherfolk tighter each day.""I know no life but fishing,"" said Kalesh, a fisherman from near Thottappally harbour, watching the sea that once nurtured his community now gnaw at it. His parents live next door in a house built after the 2004 tsunami swept away their old one, but even this home bears the scars of erosion.""The catch has dwindled,"" Kalesh's mother Sura said. ""And there's no beach left to haul our boat ashore."" Their blue boat rests awkwardly in their yard, a silent testament to the changing tides.K C Sreekumar from Alappad recalled a time when the coastal stretch from Azheekkal to Vellanathuruth spanned 89sq km in 1955. By 2004, it had shrunk to a mere 7sq km. The once-thriving Alappad market, where small ships anchored, is now a shadow of its former self, as the sea continues its relentless advance.Many families have been forced to relocate, some never returning to their original homes. Others, constrained by financial limitations or fear of starting anew elsewhere, have chosen to stay, clinging to what remains of their lives along the coast.Businesses dependent on tourism are struggling to stay afloat. Aneesh, who runs Jeevan Beach Resort in Kovalam, said: ""Earlier, the beach had a width of 30m. Now, it is only 10m and hasn't been restored fully for the past two years. It affected the inflow of tourists, especially foreigners. Now, they come and check out the very next day. Earlier, they used to stay here for three months. Kovalam has lost its glory.""The waves have ""swallowed the walkway"" and tourists are vanishing, leaving local business owners like Senthil K, Jose Franklyn and Biju to struggle with plummeting sales. ""My sales have dropped by 70%,"" souvenir shop owner Senthil said. The once ""vibrant spot"" is now deserted, prompting desperate calls for urgent govt action to ""save the beach and our businesses"".Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS) recently highlighted the scale of the crisis. From 2012 to 2021, the state experienced 223 sea surge events, with Alappuzha facing the highest number at 105, followed by Ernakulam (64) and Thrissur (54).Central Kerala, the hub of marine trade and tourism, is particularly vulnerable, experiencing an average of 12 hazard events for every 10km. Areas such as Eriyad, Azhikode, Chellanam, Ambalappuzha, Purakkad, Kuzhupilly, and Vadanapilly are now categorised as high-hazard zones due to a combination of sea surge inundation, sea-level rise, and severe erosion.""South and central Kerala are more susceptible because of their sandy coasts, unlike the rocky shores in the north,"" said Girish Gopinath, head of climate variability and aquatic ecosystems at KUFOS.The primary reasons cited for these changes are inadequate scientific planning of coastal infrastructure and the effects of climate change.More than 50% of Kerala's coastline is lined with artificial structures such as groynes, various types of seawalls and fishing harbours, in addition to ports. Groynes typically consist of wooden or concrete barriers, built perpendicular to a shoreline to prevent erosion, trap sand, and protect beaches from the impact of waves and tides.However, such structures have proved counter-productive, particularly in the south, where sediments are often washed away by littoral currents that flow parallel to a shoreline. According to Gopinath, this structural interference with natural sediment flows has intensified erosion, leaving areas like Cherthala and Ponnani exposed to the sea's relentless encroachment.""There is a phenomenon where seawater overtops into the shore, bringing with it large amounts of sediment. Unfortunately, due to choked and encroached canals, there is no way for the water and mud to flow back, exacerbating the problem,"" he said.Kerala University geology professor E Shaji pointed to the acute shortage of sediment supply from rivers, exacerbated by dredging, sand mining and sediment trapping by dams, as a major contributor to the problem. ""It would take at least five years to revive a beach,"" he said.As Kerala battles against nature and neglect, experts agree that an aggressive coastal management plan is critical. Without swift and coordinated action, the state's once-pristine beaches could be lost to history.Senior scientist K K Ramachandran emphasised the need for precise and up-to-date data to guide coastal development and conservation, ensuring that interventions are based on accurate tracking of erosion and accretion. ""Only a handful of projects use the latest data. We require a year's worth of data before proceeding with building any structures,"" said consultant at National Centre for Earth Science Studies.(Inputs from M K Sunil Kumar, T C Sreemol, Jaikrishnan Nair, Krishnachand K)","Erosion threatens livelihoods and homes of more than 9.3m across 9 Kerala coastal dists.

The rules were changed ""cleverly"", he added.The SC bench also raised the question whether disclosing information booth wise would not reveal the voting pattern. Responding to the query, Singhvi and senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was also present, said Form 17C, which records voter turnout in every polling station of a constituency, is also shared with political parties. Sibal said that he also contested elections and had personal experience of getting information under Form 17C.After a brief hearing, the SC issued notice and posted the case for hearing to week commencing March 17.Ramesh, in his petition said, ""Every citizen has the fundamental right to know and receive information under Article 19 (1) (a) of Constitution. The information related to the integrity of the electoral process, which allows the public to examine the processes employed in the elections also falls under the right. However, the amendment now attempts to stifle this right and prevent the general public, including the voters, from securing or accessing all such electoral data.""""The flow of information relating to the election, especially the electoral records, only allows the voters to know the consequence of their votes. Free and fair elections are recognised to be a part of the basic structure of our Constitution. Any efforts to impede the flow of electoral data would cast doubts on the transparency and accountability in the electoral process,"" the petition added.The petition further said, ""In fact, over the past few elections, concerns have been raised on the integrity as well as the sanctity of the electoral process. In such a scenario, the commission and the electoral data within its control, should be made more, not less, accessible.""The central govt amended Rule 93(2)(a) of the Conduct of Election Rules, (Production and Inspection of Election Papers) to restrict public access to certain electronic documents allegedly to prevent the ""misuse"" of electronic election records.Before the amendment, the Rule said: ""All other papers relating to the election shall be open to public inspection"". The amended provision now says: ""All other papers as specified in these rules relating to the election shall be open to public inspection"".Seeking quashing of the amendment, Ramesh said that the poll panel cannot unilaterally suggest an amendment without public consultation and debate as it impinges citizens' rights.He said that the amendment is against transparent election process.",The Supreme Court issued notice to the Centre and the Election Commission in response to a petition by senior Congress functionary Jairam Ramesh.

The invitation has also given rise to speculation about Pawar's political strategy as his party faces challenges after a poor showing in the last year Maharashtra polls.Modi has been invited for the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan , the organising committee of which is headed by Pawar. The event is held under the banner of the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Mahamandal.In his invitation to the Prime Minister, Pawar said this is the first time that the sammelan is being held in Delhi (from Feb 21-23) and recalled that the event's 37th edition was inaugurated by former PM Jawaharlal Nehru.Pawar highlighted the historical significance of the sammelan, dating back to 1878 when it was first held as the 'Granthakar Sammelan' by Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade in Pune. The event has seen participation of prominent figures like Lokmanya Tilak, Namdar Gokhale, V D Savarkar and Kakasaheb Gadgil.His letter to Modi emphasised the appropriateness of the PM inaugurating the event, given the recent recognition of Marathi as a classical language. ""Recently, during your tenure, the historical decision to accord Marathi language the status of classical language was taken. On this backdrop, it would be apt that this year, this impressive confluence of Marathi language and culture is inaugurated at your hands,"" Pawar wrote.NCP-SP ally Shiv Sena (UBT), however, offered a critical perspective, emphasising that classical language status resulted from collective efforts. ""Every political leader and CM in the last 30-35 years worked to get classical language status for Marathi . It is a great honour. It is due to collective contribution and not because of a single party or any leader,"" Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said.Last year, after the Centre's granted Marathi classical language status, Pawar had said , ""Five languages have been given the status of elite languages, and Marathi is one of them. This is very important for the Marathi language and other languages which have got the status of elite language.

NEW DELHI: The home ministry has granted permission to ED to prosecute former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) for alleged money laundering connected to the liquor scam case .A special PMLA court in Delhi had paused framing of charges against Kejriwal after he moved Delhi HC against the trial court taking cognisance of the chargesheet in the absence of specific sanction for prosecution under PMLA. CBI, which has filed a chargesheet against Kejriwal under the Prevention of Corruption Act, had got the requisite sanction in Aug last year.Kejriwal and AAP have been accused of receiving bribes from the ' South Group ', a cartel that controlled sale and distribution of liquor in the national capital and allegedly benefitted from the excise policy framed by the Delhi govt for 2021-22.The AAP chief had, citing a Supreme Court order of Nov 6, contended before the HC that sanction secured by CBI was not a green light for ED to prosecute him, and the agency needed a separate go-ahead to put him on trial under PMLA.In its Nov order, the apex court had said ED needed specific sanction from the competent authority for prosecution of accused under PMLA, leading other PMLA accused to seek quashing of chargesheets against them.Sources said ED has sought permission ""without prejudice"" in all its money laundering cases against public servants as mandated by the SC judgment, which asked the agency to seek sanction from competent authority under Section 197(1) of CrPC. Two other requests - to prosecute former finance minister P Chidambaram and Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren - are being processed by the ministry.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

China plans to blow Starlink satellites in orbit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/whale-strategy-china-plans-to-blow-elon-musk-starlink-satellites-in-a-taiwan-war/articleshow/117241111.cms,"Starlink’s dominance in space has sparked concerns among global powers.

Why it matters

Starlink’s decentralized satellite constellation has proven critical for battlefield communications, enabling high-speed data transfer and resilient coordination. This makes it a target in any potential conflict, particularly in scenarios involving Taiwan.

Starlink has redefined the role of space-based communication in modern warfare. By providing real-time coordination and connectivity, the network has offered militaries unprecedented strategic advantages, as seen during Ukraine’s defense against Russia.

Starlink’s dominance in satellite internet technology, fueled by SpaceX’s reusable rocket launches, has drawn both admiration and scrutiny. Its ability to provide global connectivity, including in remote and conflict-affected areas, has made it indispensable.

China’s strategy to counteract Starlink underscores the growing importance of space superiority in geopolitical conflicts, including a potential Taiwan Strait crisis.

If successful, China’s plan could disrupt communications for adversaries relying on Starlink, tilting the balance in their favor during military engagements. This approach also highlights how advancements in AI and space technology are shaping the future of warfare.

Critics warn that over-reliance on Elon Musk ’s centralized control poses risks, particularly given his unpredictable decisions and business ties to China.

’s centralized control poses risks, particularly given his unpredictable decisions and business ties to China. As a result, Taiwan and the European Union are pursuing independent satellite programs to reduce dependence on Starlink. The EU has allocated $2.6 billion for its own constellation, emphasizing the need for technological sovereignty.

The big picture

Zoom in

The researchers developed a binary AI algorithm inspired by whales’ hunting behavior, which channels prey into a confined area for efficient capture. Similarly, the algorithm enables Chinese satellites to coordinate maneuvers and optimize energy use, tracking Starlink units with precision. This approach reduces the computational complexity of targeting a vast constellation and allows for rapid action planning—completed in under two minutes, according to the researchers,the SCMP report said.

Directed-energy weapons : China is exploring various tools for satellite disruption, including high-power microwave weapons like the Relativistic Klystron Amplifier (RKA) and solid-state lasers. While these technologies are promising, they face significant challenges, such as energy demands and overheating. Other advanced systems, such as X-ray lasers inspired by the US’s Strategic Defense Initiative, are also under consideration.

Starlink’s military edge

Between the lines

The Taiwan context

Taiwan, inspired by Ukraine’s effective use of Starlink, has embarked on developing its own LEO satellite network to bolster communication resilience. The Taiwanese Space Agency announced the project in December 2022, aiming to ensure continuity in the face of attacks on its undersea cables, which form the backbone of its external communications.

Taiwan’s reliance on submarine cables—15 of which connect it to global digital networks—poses a critical vulnerability. These cables carry over 99% of international data, but their location in an earthquake-prone region and proximity to Chinese waters heighten the risk of accidental or deliberate damage. Recent incidents involving Chinese vessels severing cables near Taiwan’s shores have raised alarms about potential digital blockades during a conflict.

Taiwan’s satellite ambitions face significant hurdles. The lack of indigenous launch capabilities forces reliance on foreign partners, delaying progress until at least 2028. Furthermore, the country’s limited expertise in space-based communications and struggles to retain talent in its burgeoning space sector add to the difficulties.

What’s next

Chinese researchers have developed a strategy to disrupt Elon Musk-owned SpaceX 's Starlink satellite network in wartime, using AI-powered simulations inspired by the hunting techniques of whales. The approach, reported by the South China Morning Post (SCMP), could allow China to neutralize the network’s military advantages, which have been demonstrated in conflicts like Ukraine.As per the SCMP report, the Chinese research team, led by Wu Yunhua of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, simulated an operation in which 99 satellites could effectively target 1,400 Starlink satellites within 12 hours. The study, published in the Chinese academic journal Systems Engineering and Electronics, details how these satellites could track and potentially disable Starlink using directed-energy weapons like lasers and microwaves.Starlink’s decentralized design, which includes thousands of interconnected satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), makes targeting individual units inefficient. Instead, the Chinese researchers propose a coordinated effort to disable large sections of the network using a combination of AI algorithms and advanced weaponry.As per a New York Times report, Starlink, a SpaceX initiative, boasts over 6,700 satellites and plans to expand into tens of thousands, accounting for 53% of all active satellites and providing high-speed internet globally. Its services have proved essential in conflict zones, such as Ukraine, where over 42,000 Starlink terminals aid military and civilian communication.Starlink’s strategic significance is growing, valued at nearly $140 billion, and serves regions without traditional internet access, including areas affected by war and natural disasters. Musk's reusable rockets allow weekly satellite launches, giving SpaceX an edge in deploying a low-Earth orbit constellation. Starlink's affordable hardware and services attract diverse users, including militaries, businesses, and NGOs. Despite the technology’s benefits, Musk's centralized control and unpredictable decisions, like restricting Starlink in Crimea, have raised global concerns about over-dependence on one individual.China’s push to develop anti-satellite capabilities reflects broader geopolitical concerns about space security. The Chinese government and military have heavily funded this research, with institutions like the Harbin Institute of Technology contributing to the effort. Notably, both Harbin and Nanjing University are under US sanctions for their involvement in developing military technologies.The potential implications extend beyond Starlink. China is also building its own LEO satellite constellations, which it views as essential for communication resilience. However, this comes with risks, as any physical attack on satellites could generate debris, threatening the safety of all space assets, including the International Space Station.The evolving space race underscores the critical need for robust satellite defenses. China’s advancements in counter-satellite technologies challenge the assumption of Starlink’s invulnerability, potentially forcing the US and its allies to reassess their space security strategies.For Taiwan, developing a sovereign satellite network remains a strategic priority but will require overcoming significant challenges. As tensions in the Taiwan Strait persist, the focus on communication resilience and space-based infrastructure will only intensify.(With inputs from agencies)","Chinese researchers have developed a strategy to disrupt Elon Musk-owned SpaceX's Starlink satellite network in wartime.

IRCC Canada Work Permit: Canada limits family open work permits to enhance temporary resident program quality,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-limits-family-open-work-permits-to-enhance-temporary-resident-program-quality/articleshow/117261904.cms,"Representative image

Key Changes:

Eligibility for

Spouses of International Students

Eligibility for spouses of foreign workers

Impact on existing permits

Exceptions

Canada's Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship is introducing new measures said to enhance the integrity of its temporary resident programs while aligning them with the country's economic and labor market priorities. In a notice released Tuesday, the Canadian government announced changes to its Family open work permits (FWOPs), effective January 21.The FWOPS enabled family members of foreign workers or international students to seek employment with any organisation in Canada. They can work for any employer across the country without restrictions, if they fulfilled certain terms and conditions.Starting January 21, only spouses of international students enrolled in specific programs will be eligible for family open work permits (OWPs). These include students in master’s programs lasting 16 months or longer, doctoral programs, and select professional or eligible programs.Similarly, spouses of foreign workers will only be eligible for an OWP if the worker is employed in TEER 0 or 1 occupations, or in certain TEER 2 or 3 occupations in sectors facing labor shortages or aligned with government priorities. These sectors include natural and applied sciences, construction, healthcare, education, and more. The full list of eligible occupations will be made available on January 21, 2025, said the government in its notice. Additionally, the foreign worker must have at least 16 months remaining on their work permit when their spouse applies for an OWP. Dependent children of foreign workers will no longer be eligible for family OWPs.OWPs approved under the previous measures will remain valid until their expiration date. In situations where students or workers require more time to complete their programs, or where family members have received a shorter work permit than the principal applicant, in-Canada family members (including spouses and dependent children) can apply to renew their work permits. However, the renewal application must meet the same criteria as the original work permit, and the requested duration must match that of the principal applicant’s study or work permit.Spouses of workers covered under free-trade agreements, as well as those transitioning to permanent residency, will not be impacted by the new changes. Family members who no longer qualify for a family OWP can apply for any other type of work permit they may be eligible for under Canada’s broader work permit programs.","The Canadian government announced changes to its Family open work permits (FWOPs), effective January 21.

A former Alaska Airlines flight attendant, Nelle Diala , lost her job due to a viral TikTok video in which she was seen twerking in her uniform. Diala had been employed by the airline for just over six months before being terminated for violating the company's social media guidelines.The 20-second dance video was filmed early in the morning while Diala was waiting for two hours for the captain to arrive and celebrating the end of her new hire probationary period, according to the New York Post. She was reportedly doing a victory dance as part of the celebration in the video. The original TikTok caption read, ""Ghetto Till I Die, Don't Let the Uniform Fool You."" Some viewers called for her dismissal, finding her behavior inappropriate for someone in an airline uniform.Unfortunately, Diala's excitement was short-lived as Alaska Airlines terminated her employment just six months into her contract. The flight attendant, who feels she did nothing wrong, is upset by the decision.Diala later reposted the video with new commentary, saying, ""Can't even be yourself anymore without the world being so sensitive. What's wrong with a little twerk before work?"" She used the hashtag #discriminationisreal and claims she was fired without a formal opportunity to present her side of the story.“I never thought a single moment would cost me everything,” said Diala, as quoted by View From The Wing. “Losing my job was devastating.”Diala expressed her passion for her job as a flight attendant, which helped fund her lingerie and dessert business. She is now seeking $12,000 in GoFundMe donations while searching for new employment, according to a report by View From The Wing. By Wednesday morning, the crowdfunding campaign had raised $182 of its $12,000 goal.Although Diala acknowledges that posting the video was a lapse in judgment, she maintains that she did not intend any harm and did not mention her employer by name in the clip. She was surprised by the swift termination and still hopes to pursue a career in aviation.""I've always been careful about what I post, and I never thought this video would cost me my career,"" Diala said, as quoted by View From The Wing.In the meantime, she plans to focus more on her lingerie and dessert ventures.","Former Alaska Airlines flight attendant, Nelle Diala, lost her job due to a viral TikTok video in which she was seen twerking in her uniform.

Republicans currently hold the majority in both the House and Senate.Tariffs, with potential levies of 25% on goods from allies like Canada and Mexico and 60% on goods from China, are a key part of Trump's economic agenda. Trump asserted earlier this month that the nation's substantial prosperity during the Second Industrial Revolution was solely attributed to tariffs. He emphasised that implementing tariffs could eliminate national debt and restore America's financial prosperity.However. economists have expressed skepticism about the tariffs, stating that the costs will be passed on to consumers and considering them an inefficient way for governments to raise money.Democratic politicians opposed the External Revenue Service proposal. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, leading Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said, ""No amount of silly rebranding will hide the fact that Trump is planning a multi-trillion-dollar tax hike on American families and small businesses to pay for another round of tax handouts to the rich.""Trump, who openly talked about reducing the size of government, plans to establish a new agency to take on tasks already managed by existing bodies, such as the commerce department and customs and border protection, which oversee duties and revenue collection from other nations.The president-elect has selected two prominent business leaders to spearhead his department of government efficiency (DOGE), a nongovernmental task force dedicated to identifying ways to dismiss federal employees, eliminate programs, and streamline federal regulations.

Russell Wilson: Playing for Legacy



Who said that in the NFL one only shines at the stadium? A few of the clever boys have shown the world that hard work doesn't stop with retirement. From going into real estate, franchises to even Hollywood, they took millions and made them billions. They taught us never to be completely satisfied with the present moment, but rather be striving for much more. To know who joined the list from touchdowns to tycoon territory, let's learn about the amazing stories of these NFL legends-turned-moguls.Roger Staubach didn't retire; he redefined it. After his playing days dominated the field for the Dallas Cowboys , Staubach transitioned into real estate, establishing The Staubach Company. His 2008 sale of the company for $613 million netted him $600 million. Include smart investments and endorsements, and Staubach stands as proof of post-NFL brilliance.From scoring touchdowns to owning franchises, Jerry Richardson played it smart. Once a halfback for the Baltimore Colts, he later founded the Carolina Panthers. But his fortune doesn't all come from football. Richardson's savvy with fast food franchises from Hardee's and prime real estate ventures took his fortune up a notch of staggering $2 billion. That is one winning play!Tom Brady's career is iconic, but off-field moves are no less impressive. He has raked in more than $300 million in salary, diversified through endorsement deals with Under Armour and Aston Martin, and added his lifestyle brand, TB12 Inc., and Hollywood ventures to his $250 million net worth. Brady is a football legend and a brand in himself.Aaron Rodgers definitely knows how to throw both the football and some money at right opportunities. Apart from his salary, the Packers legend has collected wealth through proper investments. In fact, among his investments in the NBA is the Milwaukee Bucks, and on top of it, he negotiated deals with some brands like Adidas and State Farm. He has seen a net value of $200 million.Russell Wilson didn't just break records; he built a legacy. With massive contracts from the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos, Wilson's $165 million fortune also benefits from endorsement deals with Nike and Amazon. Partnering with his wife, Ciara, he co-founded the Why Not You Foundation, proving that success is about giving back, too.These NFL icons show that success isn’t limited to game day. By leveraging their fame, making smart investments, and diversifying their ventures, they’ve created fortunes that will outlast their legacies. From real estate empires to philanthropic endeavors, they remind us that the end of a football career can be the start of something even bigger.Also read - NFL Owners vs. Players: Who Has the Bigger Bank Account?","Roger Staubach, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson are some of the NFL legends-turned-moguls.
