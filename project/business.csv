"India remains cornerstone of UN peacekeeping, its women peacekeepers indispensable: UN peacekeeping chief",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-remains-cornerstone-of-un-peacekeeping-its-women-peacekeepers-indispensable-un-peacekeeping-chief/articleshow/118495803.cms,".

India remains a cornerstone of UN peacekeeping and its women peacekeepers have demonstrated that missions with greater female representation improve operational outcomes and contribute to lasting peace, the United Nations peacekeeping chief has said.UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix will visit New Delhi this week to attend the conference 'Enhancing the Role of Women in Peacekeeping: A Global South Experience' being organised by India on February 24-25.""India remains a cornerstone of UN peacekeeping"" and ""Indian women peacekeepers are redefining peacekeeping itself,"" Lacroix told PTI in an exclusive interview here.Noting that it's a ""privilege"" to attend the conference in India, Lacroix said the gathering would bring together women officials from about 50 countries in the Global South to discuss the evolving challenges in peacekeeping and the critical role women play in advancing peace and security.""More women in peacekeeping means a more effective peacekeeping. India has long been a leader in advancing women, peace and security in peacekeeping missions -not only as a top troop and police contributor but also as a pioneer in advancing gender parity, its leadership in training and capacity building and its commitment to increasing women's participation in missions,"" he said in the written interview ahead of the conference.He said the presence of Indian women peacekeepers ""proves that missions with greater women representation build stronger relationships with communities, improve operational outcomes, and contribute to lasting peace.""Moving forward, creating enabling environments, addressing gender barriers, ensuring the mental well-being of peacekeepers, strengthening strategic communication, and countering misinformation must remain priorities. Women in peacekeeping is not just about fairness-it is a strategic necessity for mission success,"" he said.Lacroix said ""India's women peacekeepers have proven to be indispensable in UN peacekeeping, forging trust between our uniformed personnel and local communities in some of the world's most challenging conflict zones.""Their presence contributes to the success of peacekeeping efforts. Through community engagement, they build crucial connections with local women, build trust, contribute to early warning and protection efforts, improve humanitarian outreach and act as role models for women and girls in the communities they serve,"" he said.In Abyei, Indian women peacekeepers have adapted patrol routes and provided targeted support to marginalised groups, ensuring safer environments for women and children.Their ability to navigate cultural sensitivities and build genuine relationships enhances both mission success and community healing, he said.Beyond their on-the-ground contributions, Indian women peacekeepers are ""pioneers"" in gender-inclusive peacekeeping.""Their deployment across various missions highlights how diverse teams lead to stronger, more effective operations. Their courage and commitment inspire not only their fellow peacekeepers but also the local populations they serve,"" the UN peacekeeping chief said.Lacroix noted that India ranks among the top contributors to UN peacekeeping missions with 5,384 personnel, including 153 women, across 10 missions as of September 2024.India deployed the first all-female Formed Police Unit (FPU) to Liberia in 2007. Today, 20.45% of its deployed military observers and staff officers are women. Additionally, India's Engagement Platoons in the United Nations Interim Force for Abyei ( UNISFA ) and UN Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) ""exemplify"" the impact of women in peacekeeping.He noted that Deputy Commander of the Female Engagement Team at UNISFA Captain Seema Gowdar's team in Abyei has strengthened civilian protection and community trust.Another ""prime example"" of women leadership in peacekeeping is Major Radhika Sen, whose ""outstanding work"" in MONUSCO earned her the 2023 UN Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award.""Her dedication exemplifies how gender-inclusive leadership strengthens peacekeeping and sets the stage for future generations of women in uniform,"" he said.Beyond its deployments, India leads in training through the Centre for UN Peacekeeping (CUNPK) in Delhi, which sets ""global standards"" for pre-deployment and specialized courses. India actively supports efforts to counter misinformation and hate speech, collaborating with the UN to refine policies, command structures, and training.""India's impact goes beyond personnel-it is shaping training, leadership, inclusion, accountability, and strategic communications. As peacekeeping evolves, India's contributions remain essential to mission success, civilian protection, and lasting peace,"" he said.Lacroix said that in 2007, when India deployed the first all-female FPU to Liberia, it set a ""global precedent"" and today the country continues this legacy.He said that the conference, which is being organised by the Ministry of External Aﬀairs in partnership with the Ministry of Defence and CUNPK, serves as a platform to reinforce that commitment while fostering collaboration, peer support, and professional development among women peacekeepers.It also has a special resonance for UN Peacekeeping as it will be an opportunity to reflect on the challenges peacekeeping faces and how best to address them at the peacekeeping Ministerial level meeting in Berlin in May.Against the backdrop of increased attacks on UN peacekeepers who are working in increasingly hostile environments, Lacroix underscored that peacekeeper safety is a shared responsibility.""Troop- and police-contributing countries must hold attackers accountable and strengthen multilateral efforts to protect personnel.""""As conflicts grow more complex, attacks on peacekeepers have increased, making decisive action essential to protect those who serve global peace and security,"" he said.Furthermore, he said that investing in advanced technology and training is key to adapting to modern threats.""AI-driven systems, data analytics, and cyber tools can enhance intelligence gathering, improve mission performance, and strengthen protection in hostile environments.""He however stressed that safety is not just about equipment but relies on coordination and trust. ""Stronger intelligence-sharing and deeper engagement with local communities can provide early warnings and reduce risks,"" he said.He added that women peacekeepers play a vital role in this, fostering trust and gathering critical insights that enhance mission security.""Increasing their leadership and operational roles will further strengthen peacekeeping. By breaking barriers, building partnerships, and equipping peacekeepers with the right tools and support, we can create forces that not only protect but lead the way to a safer, more just world. Their safety is not just about preserving lives-it upholds the very principles of peace and security,"" he said.The UN peacekeeping chief called on UN Member States to increase efforts to nominate women candidates for senior uniformed leadership positions, especially in the military.Currently, of the 11 peacekeeping operations, only one is led by a uniformed woman: Major General Anita Asmah of Ghana recently deployed as Head of Mission and Force Commander of the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF).""We need more trailblazing uniformed women like her and we need women nominated at all roles, including in operations and leadership, where they are currently underrepresented.""","UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix will visit New Delhi this week. He will attend the conference 'Enhancing the Role of Women in Peacekeeping: A Global South Experience' being organised by India. India has long been a leader in advancing women, peace and security in peacekeeping missions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118495849,imgsize-39362,width-400,resizemode-4/118495849.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The US President Donald Trump has once again raised concerns over alleged USAID's $18 million funding allocation for elections in India, questioning the rationale behind spending substantial amounts abroad instead of focusing on American voter participation.Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Trump suggested reverting to paper ballots and proposed seeking India's assistance with electoral processes.""18 million dollars for helping India with its elections. Why the hell? Why don't we just go to old paper ballots, and let them help us with their elections, right? Voter ID. Wouldn't that be nice? We're giving money to India for elections. They don't need money,"" US president said.""They take advantage of us pretty good. One of the highest tariffed nations in the world. We try and sell something. They have a 200 per cent tariff.

You have a little firm, you get 10,000 here, 10,000 there, and then we get 29 million from the United States government. There are two people working in that firm. Two people. I think they're very happy, they're very rich. They'll be on the cover of a very good business magazine pretty soon for being great,"" he added.Trump also called the alleged funding a ""kickback scheme"", noting the lack of transparency in its implementation.On Saturday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed concern over allegations that the $21 million USAID funding for ""voter turnout"" in India.Also Read: 'It's worrisome, if there's something to it, then country should know': Jaishankar on Trump's $21 million fund for 'voter turnout in India' ""Some information has been put out there by the Trump administration people, and obviously, that is concerning...

Ensure timely completion of works: Verma

NEW DELHI: Newly sworn-in Delhi ministers spent the day on Saturday doing a reality check on the ground by carrying surprise inspections and asking officials to fast-track projects that have been delayed or are stuck.PWD minister Parvesh Verma undertook an extensive review of projects in and around Mathura Road and Ring Road, zeroing in on the work on Barapullah flyover's extension, which has got inordinately delayed.""I was told that no minister had visited the project for a decade and no one even cared to get it completed even as the city is grappling with traffic jams,"" he said, adding that all this only made the city air more polluted.""If you delay a project, it also leads to cost escalation. The AAP govt didn't care about these things. I have asked for details of whatever clearances they need, and I will personally ensure that there are no further hindrances,"" he said. ""The road will be opened to the public in the next 12 months. Money is not an issue.""Explaining what plagues Delhi roads, Verma said these were repeatedly dug up by various agencies for laying underground cables or for other work. ""This is not the way to operate. We will have a nodal agency that will ensure all underground work is completed before a road is constructed so that the taxpayers' money is not wasted,"" Verma said. He emphasised the need for better coordination to prevent wastage of funds.Verma also reviewed the progress in construction of the Bhairon Marg underpass, part of the Pragati Maidan tunnel, and the Sarai Kale Khan stretch. He directed officials to ensure timely completion of all work. Emphasising the importance of quality construction, he said, ""We should build a road that lasts for 10-15 years. Though the official lifespan is five years, the quality should be such that it remains in good condition for at least 10-15 years.""He also inspected the Moolchand underpass, which has in the past witnessed severe waterlogging. To address this long-standing issue, he reviewed the upgradation of facilities with Japanese pumps being installed to make the drainage more effective.""I have directed officials to take all necessary measures before the rainy season to ensure that water does not accumulate. Proper drainage systems should be created and maintained, and pumps should be installed in time,"" he said.Verma said these efforts were in line with PM Modi's vision of a cleaner, greener and more developed Delhi. ""We are committed to transforming Delhi into a world-class city with better roads, effective drainage systems and overall beautification,"" he added.Education minister Ashish Sood visited Janakpuri and expressed his dismay over the accumulation of garbage. ""It has been lying scattered over a 1km stretch over the past two and a half years. This is unacceptable. People are hassled about AAP councillors. We are committed to cleaning this up,"" he said.Health minister Pankaj Kumar Singh visited Rao Tula Ram Memorial Hospital in Jaffarpur Kalan along with BJP MP Kamaljeet Sehrawat. ""The conditions here are quite bad. There is a lack of doctors. A building that should have been made before 2020 is incomplete. We have decided with Sehrawat that in 3 months, we will transform this hospital,"" he said. ""We will come back here after three months to show you how well this hospital is functioning.""On the mohalla clinics, he said: ""There are many clinics that do not have doctors or medicines. They were leased out by MLAs in the name of clinics. If these complaints are true, the matter will be investigated,"" he said.","PWD minister Parvesh Verma undertook an extensive review of projects in and around Mathura Road and Ring Road.

and lockdown

Spl post created: Ex-guv of RBI Shaktikanta Das 2nd principal secy to PM

NEW DELHI: Former RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has been appointed as principal secretary-2 to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , a post that has been created for the first time. The notification was made on Saturday by the appointments committee of the cabinet.The appointment of Das, a 1980 batch IAS officer of Tamil Nadu cadre, would be co-terminus with the term of the PM. PK Mishra, a 1972 batch Gujarat cadre IAS officer, will continue as the current principal secretary to the PM.Mishra, who worked with Modi during his stint as Gujarat CM, was appointed to the post in Sept 2019 and was initially additional principal secretary. Former cabinet secretary PK Sinha also served as additional principal secretary for a short while. The PMO also had two advisers in Amit Khare and Tarun Kapoor, both retired secretaries.Shaktikanta Das, who was the 25th RBI governor, completed a six-year term in Dec after being given the job at a critical time. His predecessor Urjit Patel resigned abruptly after the relationship between the central bank and the govt soured over a raft of issues, including reducing rates to revive growth.A former economic affairs secretary, Das took on the task of repairing the relationship between the central bank and the finance ministry, and unleashed a number of measures which helped both monetary and fiscal policy to work seamlessly and ushered in stability in the delicate relationship.He improved the communication with the markets and helped open the central bank to the wider world with key officials interacting and communicating with all stakeholders, including the media.During his long innings as a civil servant, Das handled many challenges deftly, earning the trust of his bosses.Perhaps the toughest assignment for this soft-spoken bureaucrat was during the 2016 demonetisation drive. Das emerged as the face of the entire exercise and worked tirelessly with his team to ensure order and calm in the markets.He also worked to make sure that the impact of the disruption was minimised and the transition was smooth. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Das used his more than 40 years of experience as a civil servant to ensure that the markets functioned smoothly.Since the national lockdown was announced in late March 2020, a team of more than 200 personnel from RBI and services providers were holed up in four locations to ensure that the financial markets and the system across the country provided uninterrupted services.An alumnus of St Stephen's College in the capital with a master's degree in history, Das has held important positions in the central and state governments in finance, taxation, industries, infrastructure and other sectors.He was also member of the 15th Finance Commission and served as India's sherpa to G20 .","Former RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has been appointed as principal secretary-2 to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

NEW DELHI: In the midst of its escalating political standoff with Tamil Nadu govt over National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Centre has made it clear that it is firmly committed to implementing the three-language policy at school level. Centre is steadfast in its stance and will not succumb to Tamil Nadu's ""blackmailing"" tactics, govt sources said.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a letter to Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Friday, criticised the state's opposition to NE, calling it ""highly inappropriate"" and a ""narrow-minded approach"". Pradhan sought to allay concerns raised by Tamil Nadu govt, saying, ""Let me unequivocally state that there is no question of imposing any language on any state or community.""NE advocates a flexible three-language formula, emphasising multilingual education, while allowing states to choose their own languages within the framework. However, Tamil Nadu govt has consistently opposed the policy, arguing that it undermines the state's long-standing two-language formula and poses a potential threat to linguistic identity.Despite the state's reservations, Union govt remains firm on implementing NE nationwide. Centre maintains that the policy is designed to enhance educational outcomes and foster multilingual proficiency without infringing upon regional linguistic preferences. Pradhan underscored this in his letter, stating, ""NE upholds the principle of linguistic freedom and ensures that students continue to learn in the language of their choice.""""Apart from BJP-governed states there are multiple non-BJP states which are implementing this language policy. In fact, states like Assam and Odisha, among others, have been following a three-language formula till Class VIII which predates BJP govts there,"" said a senior govt official.The three-language policy, which has been a part of India's education framework since 1968, has been a major point of contention for long. Pradhan argued that its lack of proper implementation over the decades has led to a decline in the systematic teaching of Indian languages and an over-reliance on foreign languages. ""NE seeks to correct this historical oversight by ensuring that every Indian language, including Tamil, receives its rightful place in education while maintaining the flexibility for states to design their own language policies,"" he wrote.Pradhan cautioned that Tamil Nadu's continued opposition to NE could deprive its students, teachers, and educational institutions of the immense opportunities the policy offers.","National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 advocates a flexible three-language formula, emphasising multilingual education.

NEW DELHI: As many as 84 batches of certain drugs, including some of the commonly prescribed steroids and cholesterol lowering drugs , have been found to be 'not-of-standard quality' in the latest round of inspections carried out by the drug control authorities across the country. The CDSCO, the apex body responsible for approval of new drugs and clinical trials, has issued an alert regarding this. The CDSCO issues alerts about non-standard quality drugs being sold in the market monthly.According to its latest data, for Dec 2024, they found 84 batches of drugs manufactured by various firms to be of not-of-standard quality.This includes some of the drugs prescribed for common conditions such as acidity, high levels of cholesterol, diabetes and bacterial infections among others.Identification of drug samples as NSQ is done based on failure of the drug sample in one or the other specified quality parameters. The failure is specific to the drug products of the batch tested by the govt, officials said. ""This action of identifying NSQ and spurious medicines is taken on a regular basis in collaboration with state regulators to ensure that these drugs are identified and removed from the market,"" she added.Recently, the CDSCO introduced new guidelines for the inspections. It stated all drug inspectors should collect at least 10 samples in a month; nine samples of drugs and one sample of cosmetics/medical d evice.Also, new guidelines said, the drug inspectors must plan the sampling in such a way that samples are forwarded to the laboratory on the same day of sampling.In case of rural location or distant location to office, sample shall be forwarded to laboratory by next day and not later than that, according to the guidelines.","The CDSCO issues alerts about non-standard quality drugs being sold in the market monthly.

NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar alleged that illegal immigrants are influencing India’s electoral process and also stressed the need for public awareness on the issue.Speaking at the 65th convocation of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University on Saturday, he questioned when India would begin deporting illegal immigrants, an action which the US has already taken recently.""Crores of people who have no right to live in India are living here...They are making their livelihood here. They are making demands on our resources. On our education, health sector, housing sector. Now things have gone further. They are intervening in our electoral process,"" Dhankhar said.He urged citizens to create an atmosphere where every Indian is aware of this challenge.Without naming the US directly, the vice president referred to the recent deportation of Indian nationals who had entered the country illegally.""A question should occur to every Indian -- when would we start doing this?"" he asked, adding that the youth should act as a powerful pressure group and question the public representatives and government on their jobs.“Nationalism is our religion and topmost priority,” he said.Touching the issue of religious conversions, Dhankar said that an individual is entitled to follow any religion, however, conversions are happening through temptations. He claimed that such changes in demographics could threaten national stability, citing examples of majority communities being ""finished off"" in certain countries.In a possible reference to allegations of USAID funding efforts to increase voter turnout in India, Dhankhar warned of attempts to manipulate the country’s democratic process. He called for a ""deep, thorough, micro-level investigation"" into these claims.Addressing India's development goals, Dhankhar acknowledged the challenges ahead but remained optimistic. ""We will have to increase our per capita income eight-fold, and therefore all of us must move fast and with commitment. That commitment requires we should believe in our nation.” He further added that commitment to nationalism is non-negotiable as it is directly connected to freedom.Commenting on India’s growth over the last one decade, he said that the country has witnessed ""exponential economic rise, phenomenal infrastructural upsurge, deep digitization and technology penetration,"" adding that no other nation has seen such growth during this period.""This nation is therefore full of hope and possibility. This nation is no longer a nation with potential, but (it is a nation) on rise which is unstoppable.”He said that people have toilets, gas connection, internet connections, road connectivity with infrastructure connectivity is making life easier.“If you have an idea, the government policies will handhold you,"" Dhankhar said.He also praised the rise of start-ups in tier 2 and 3 cities, highlighting that they are emerging from ordinary families rather than traditional business backgrounds. The vice president further stated that social transformation would come through social harmony. ""Social harmony will shape our unity in diversity. We must foster it at all costs,"" he emphasised.Mentioning the renaming of Aurangabad to Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, saying it was a step towards restoring India's ""long-overdue glory.""",Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar spoke at the 65th convocation of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University.

HYDERABAD: Eight people were trapped inside when a portion of the tunnel roof at Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) collapsed on Saturday morning near Domalpenta in Telangana's Nagarku-nool district.Sources said 60 workers were on site when the roof suddenly caved in by about 200 metres inside the tunnel, which has a depth of 500 ft. While 52 of them managed to come out to safety, with some of them taken to hospital with injuries, eight workers remained trapped deep inside the tunnel.These included Jaiprakash Associates Limited project engineer Manoj Kumar and field engineer Sri Niwas, both from Uttar Pradesh, four labourers from Jharkhand - Sandeep Sahu, Jataks, Santosh Sahu and Anuj Sahu - and two machine operators of Robbins India Company - Sunny Singh from J&K and Gurpreet Singh from Punjab.According to sources, no communication had been established with the trapped people till reports last came in.

The SLBC tunnel is about 44 km long from the Srisailam dam's left bank.The accident occurred about 13 km from the mouth of the tunnel. An earth fracture on the side of the tunnel wall caused the water and mud to gush in, forcing the workers to scramble to safety.Jaiprakash Associates and Robbins India, responsible for tunnel boring, said the accident took place within 30 minutes of taking up the work at 8 am. Those positioned near the tunnel boring machine managed to escape, while workers in the front section of the tunnel got trapped, representatives of the companies said.

DGCA slaps notice on Air India after it sold broken seat to Chouhan

NEW DELHI: Union agriculture minister and ex-MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan found himself facing an uncomfortable journey Saturday when he was allotted a broken seat on an Air India flight from Bhopal to Delhi. His experience reignited concerns about Air India's service standards, while the airline attempts to improve its operations under Tata Group 's ownership.Expressing his frustration on X, he wrote: ""Today, (Feb 22) I had to come from Bhopal to Delhi... I had booked a ticket on Air India flight number AI 436. I was allotted seat number 8C. I went and sat on the seat, the seat was broken and sunken in. Sitting was uncomfortable."" Chouhan was allotted the seat despite the crew informing the management about the unserviceable seat & requesting it not be sold. ""Is this not cheating passengers?"" he asked.Shivraj Singh Chouhan was allotted a broken seat on an Air India flight. The aircraft in question was an Airbus A321 (VT-RTB), just a year old. This raises questions about Air India's maintenance of even its newest fleet.Chouhan further said: ""I had the belief that after coming under Tata management, Air India's service must have improved, but this turned out to be my illusion. After charging passengers the full amount, seating them on a bad and uncomfortable seat is unethical. Is this not cheating the passengers?""Co-passengers offered him their seats, he said. ""But why should I trouble another for my comfort? So, I decided to complete my journey in the same seat...,"" he posted.The incident prompted Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu to step in: ""We spoke to Air India and instructed them to take necessary action. From our side, DGCA will also be looking into details of matter promptly. And I have personally spoken to Shivraj ji also."" DGCA has now sought a report from Air India regarding the issue. This comes after a 2022 directive from the regulator that instructed the airline not to sell unserviceable seats, following complaints from business-class passengers who were downgraded to economy due to unusable seats.Air India responded to Chouhan's post, apologising for the inconvenience. Later, an airline spokesperson issued an official statement: ""This does not reflect the standard of service we strive to provide to our guests, and we are conducting a thorough investigation into the matter to ensure that such incidents are not repeated.""Supply chain constraints have delayed the repair of Air India's older aircraft, with the airline stating that its entire narrow-body fleet, like the one Chouhan flew on, is expected to be revamped this year. However, the overhaul of its aging wide-body Boeing 777 and 787 aircraft will take an additional two years.","Shivraj Singh Chouhan was allotted a broken seat on an Air India flight.

I have been commissioned into the 18th battalion, the Jammu and Kashmir rifles, where you have a Masjid, Gurdwara, Durga Mata, and Mahakal, all under one roof.""General Dwivedi recounted how his subedar major, a Maulvi, would perform Durga Mata Puja without any issues, demonstrating the regiment's spirit of mutual respect. When asked about his own spiritual journey, general Dwivedi said after taking over, he first sought blessings from his unit, Bhakti Dhaam, where he received blessings from his Maulvi, Pandit, and Granthi.""My subedar major, who may be a Maulvi, is able to do Durga Mata Puja, which is not an issue at all. Now, if you see, have I visited any Mashoor (famous) place, Golden Temple or Mahakaal or Vaishno Devi, in the initial stages? No. The first thing I went to was to my unit, Bhakti Dham. And once I got the blessings there from my Maulvi, my Pandit, my Granthi, thereafter I started going to all the places,"" said the Army chief.General Dwivedi recalled how his father would tell him stories of freedom fighters and World War II heroes, inspiring him to join the army.In a candid revelation, Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi shared the story of how his childhood experiences shaped his decision to join the Indian Army.One particular memory that stood out was when his uncle would bring home copies with photographs of soldiers.

As he grew older, he began to explore various career options, considering medicine and engineering, just like his brothers.However, the allure of the Army ultimately won him over. General Dwivedi recalled how he initially wanted to become an intelligence officer, but after gaining more exposure, he decided to join the Army first and then explore opportunities in intelligence.""I remember my uncle when he used to ask him, So the copy which he used to bring used to have a soldier's photo. Okay. My father used to always give me the story of freedom fighters or the story of World War II, where we won Vera, who escaped as a pilot. I remember. So all these stories I used to keep reading. And my one brother was a doctor. So I said, no, this is closed. My second brother was an engineer. I said, this is closed. Okay. So third was the army, which was there. I wanted to become an intelligence officer if I can say that. But when I went to school and saw everything, then I said, okay, let me join the Army first, thereafter look at intelligence,"" the Army chief said.He also shared his experience of flying the LCA with air marshal AP Singh during Aero India 2025, praising Singh's leadership and straightforward qualities.

He shared that it was simply fate that led him to join the Army.""See, when we were in school, we used to look at all three services. We used to love all three, if I can say that. It just so happened that I came into the army. Let me tell you about AP first. As far as AP is concerned, from NDA days, he is a gold torch. And he is, everybody has a natural liking towards him. He is a man who can collect people together. He is a natural leader. And he takes ownership of a crowd. But he is a very straightforward man. So, I say in the lighter moment, he should have been in the infantry,"" said the Army chief.The Army chief highlighted Air Marshal Singh's ability to bring people together, his natural leadership skills, and his willingness to take ownership of responsibilities. General Dwivedi jokingly added that Air Marshal Singh's straightforward nature and team-bonding skills would have made him an excellent fit for the infantry.""He's so straightforward. And such a team-bonding man, he should have been infantry,"" he added.This lighthearted exchange reflects the camaraderie and mutual respect between General Dwivedi and Air Marshal Singh, underscoring the strong bonds formed during their early days at the NDA.The Army chief’s remarks provide insight into his personal life and military journey, emphasising the significance of respecting all religions and the principles of teamwork and leadership.As the 30th Chief of the Army Staff, he brings extensive experience, having held key positions such as Northern Army Commander and Director General of Infantry.","Indian Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi recently opened up about his multi- religious upbringing and illustrious military career.

"“Sasta Prime” Indian YouTubers Fukra Insaan and Triggered Insaan launch Fokus, and the internet is calling it a ripoff of WWE superstar Logan Paul's brand",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/sasta-prime-indian-youtubers-fukra-insaan-and-triggered-insaan-launch-fokus-and-the-internet-is-calling-it-a-ripoff-of-wwe-superstar-logan-pauls-brand/articleshow/118483949.cms,"Image via Logan Paul and Triggered Insaan

“Inko dekh ke kisi Logan walo ka Prime drink yaad aaya 😂,”

“It looks like Prime’s third copy (not that Prime is good or something). They will def use Ruchika for promoting this chapri brand and getting views. Sasta Prime 😭.”

Fokus hit the market in February 2025, and yes, it’s significantly cheaper than Prime

“It’s like Prime... but for people who think 500 bucks is too much for a drink.”

Fans are already calling Fokus a copy of Prime, but will it actually sell?

Fukra Insaan (Abhishek Malhan) and Triggered Insaan (Nischay Malhan) just entered the hydration drink market, but instead of praise, they’re getting roasted. Their new drink, Fokus, looks eerily similar to Prime, the hydration brand by KSI and Logan Paul . The colors, the branding, even the bottle design—it’s all too familiar.Social media caught on immediately. One Reddit user didn’t hold back:basically calling Fokus a knockoff. Another user added,People aren’t mad. They’re just having fun with how obvious the similarities are. Fokus seems to be banking on the same influencer-heavy marketing strategy that made Prime popular, except at a much lower price point.Having hit the market in February 2025, Fokus is being marketed as an affordable hydration drink, available in flavors like Mango Pineapple, Kiwi Lemon, and Watermelon Strawberry. The drink contains coconut water, taurine, and ginseng extract, ingredients meant to provide hydration and energy.And the price? A three-pack costs Rs. 450. That’s way cheaper than Prime, which is ridiculously overpriced in India. One Redditor put it best:Fokus is clearly aiming at the younger crowd, the same people who built Fukra Insaan and Triggered Insaan’s careers. The two YouTubers have been posting behind-the-scenes content about the drink’s development, with their managers Mayank Mishra (Fukra Insaan’s manager) and Ankit Madaan (Triggered Insaan’s manager) handling the business side of things.The internet can’t unsee the similarities. From the branding to the influencer-driven promotions, Fokus is walking the same path that made Prime a global hit. But while people love making fun of the “Sasta Prime” branding, they’re still paying attention.Fokus launches across India in February 2025. Whether it thrives or just remains an inside joke on Reddit depends on how people actually like the drink. For updates, fans can follow their official Instagram handle @letsfokus.","Fukra Insaan and Triggered Insaan have launched a hydration drink called Fokus.

At the time, 60 workers were on-site, and while 52 managed to escape, some with injuries, eight remain trapped.The trapped workers include Jaiprakash Associates Limited project engineer Manoj Kumar and field engineer Sri Niwas (both from Uttar Pradesh), four labourers from Jharkhand—Sandeep Sahu, Jataks, Santosh Sahu, and Anuj Sahu—and two machine operators from Robbins India Company, Sunny Singh (Jammu & Kashmir) and Gurpreet Singh (Punjab).Sukhendu Datta, NDRF deputy commander said, ""Yesterday at around 10pm, we went inside the tunnel to analyse the situation. Out of the 13 km distance inside the tunnel, we covered 11 km on this locomotive and the remaining 2 km, we covered on the conveyor belt. When we reached the end of the TMV (Tunnel Boring Machine), we tried to establish contact with the trapped workers by calling out their names, but we could not find anything.""Further he stated, ''There is a 200-metre patch filled with debris. Until this debris is cleaned, we will not be able to find out the exact location of the trapped workers and rescue them. Water is filled in the patch between 11-13 km of the tunnel, and until water is removed, debris cleaning work will not start. Our first team reached here around 7pm yesterday.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

The Vatican proceeded with Holy Year celebrations without the Pope's presence on Saturday.While the Pope reportedly had a good night's rest, doctors have highlighted sepsis as a primary concern, which could develop as a pneumonia complication. As of Friday, there were no signs of sepsis, and Francis was responding positively to his prescribed medications.Dr Luigi Carbone, the Pope's personal physician, emphasised the delicate nature of the situation. Francis was admitted to Gemelli hospital on February 14 following a deteriorating case of bronchitis. The medical team diagnosed a complex respiratory infection involving viral, bacterial and fungal elements, along with bilateral pneumonia.The treatment plan includes complete rest, cortisone, antibiotics and supplemental oxygen as needed. Before hospitalisation, Francis received care from a cardiologist and infectious disease specialist, alongside his personal medical team.Dr Sergio Alfieri from Gemelli hospital explained that the primary concern is the potential spread of respiratory pathogens to the bloodstream, causing sepsis. He acknowledged the serious nature of this risk, particularly given the Pope's age and respiratory issues, stating, ""He knows he's in danger, and he told us to relay that.""","The Pope Francis is in a critical state, experiencing a severe asthmatic respiratory crisis.

"Delta Air Lines Crash Lawsuit: 'Drenched with jet fuel': Delta faces lawsuits as passengers reject $30,000 offer after Toronto Crash",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/drenched-with-jet-fuel-delta-faces-lawsuits-as-passengers-reject-30000-offer-after-toronto-crash/articleshow/118493592.cms,"Delta Air Lines sued by passengers

'Drenched with jet fuel'

Delta defends its pilots

Delta Air Lines is facing multiple lawsuits following last week's crash landing in Toronto, despite offering $30,000 to each passenger aboard the ill-fated flight.The legal battle has only just begun, with more lawsuits expected in the coming months, reports CBS News.The flight was operated by Delta’s subsidiary Endeavor Air and was carrying 76 passengers when it flipped over on landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport. Delta’s compensation offer would total around $2.3 million if accepted by all but some passengers argue that it is not enough.A Texas man who filed one of the lawsuits claims he suffered ""severe emotional distress and mental anguish"" after being ""suspended upside down"" and ""drenched with jet fuel."" He is also seeking damages for ""significant injuries to his head, neck, back, knees and face.""A second lawsuit, filed on behalf of a woman from Minneapolis, alleges she is dealing with ""extreme bodily and mental injuries."" The suit further accuses the flight crew of failing to follow ""the most fundamental procedures for a landing approach.""Under the Montreal Convention, an international treaty governing airline liability, passengers injured on international flights can claim up to $200,000 in compensation. However, if negligence is proven, the amount could be even higher. The treaty gives passengers two years to file lawsuits.With 21 people taken to hospital following the crash, more legal claims are expected. All those injured have since been discharged, Delta CEO Ed Bastian confirmed.Amid speculation about the pilots’ credentials, Delta released a statement affirming their qualifications. The airline stated that both pilots are certified by the federal aviation administration (FAA). The captain has experience in ""pilot training and flight safety capacities,"" while the first officer, hired by Endeavor last year, holds ""the highest-level pilot certification in the US.""Delta also assured passengers that the $30,000 offer had ""no strings attached and does not affect rights.""The national transportation safety board (NTSB) and the FAA are assisting Canadian authorities in determining what went wrong. The aircraft was removed from the runway on Thursday, but the cause of the crash remains under investigation.","Delta Air Lines is facing multiple lawsuits following last week's crash landing in Toronto, despite offering $30,000 to each passenger.

Hard to keep track of Trump’s verbiage, gaslighting, much less refute or challenge

: US President Donald Trump, he of torrential verbiage, weighed in for the third straight day on Friday on the $21m purportedly allocated by USAID to increase voter turnout in India.In an the off-the-cuff remark at a meeting with US governors, Trump said, ""$21 million going to my friend Prime Minister Modi in India for voter turnout...""He did not elaborate on his statement or offer any evidence.Trump had previously suggested that the Biden administration, during whose time the money was purportedly assigned, was ""trying to get somebody else elected"" and the current Indian govt should be informed about this, implying Democrats in US were backing Congress. He followed it up a day later by saying the money did not go to India and instead was 'kickback' for US officials.The random, imprecise remarks are typical of a President, who by the assessment of many psychologists, including his own niece Mary Trump, is an unrelenting narcissist fond of listening to his voice. Trump has been on a verbal tear from the time he assumed office.The sheer volume of verbiage US President Donald Trump dispenses, laced with hyperbole, exaggeration, and outright falsehoods, is hard to keep track of, much less refute or challenge. During his Feb 13 engagement with Modi, he was on TV for almost three hours, including two media engagements with the Indian PM.During his engagement with Modi, Trump inflated India's trade surplus with the US by more than double, putting it at $100 billion, when it is closer to $45 billion.Such gaslighting has also led to fake AI generated speeches and quotes attributed to Trump that feed into the outrage industry on social media.Over the weekend, one AI generated video showed Trump disparaging Indians, their accents, and general lack of hygiene and cleanliness in India.","US President Donald Trump weighed in for the third straight day on Friday on the $21m purportedly allocated by USAID to increase voter turnout in India.
