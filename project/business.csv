US report names RAW man involved in alleged plot to take out Pannun,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-report-names-raw-man-involved-in-alleged-plot-to-take-out-pannun/articleshow/109708372.cms,"US Pannun plot probe involves CIA, FBI, others

A report in Washington Post, a US newspaper, has claimed that a Research and Analysis Wing officer, Vikram Yadav , instructed a hired hit team to kill US-based Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun .According to the report, “US intelligence agencies have assessed that the operation targeting Pannun was approved by the RAW chief at the time, Samant Goel .” It adds that Yadav was transferred back to CRPF after the Pannun plot unravelled last year.There was no response by the Indian govt to the assertions made in the report till late Monday night.US authorities had last year indicted an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, for the plot, alleging that he was acting at the behest of an Indian official they referred to in the indictment as CC-1.Gupta is currently in a jail in Prague, where he was detained last year by Czech and US agencies. While India had formed a high-level committee in Nov to probe the information shared by the US about the role of the Indian official, saying it had a bearing on India’s security too, the govt has so far not revealed any of its findings.RAW officer Vikram Yadav, who was on deputation from CRPF, allegedly forwarded details of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, including his address in New York, said a Washington Post report, citing sources and a US indictment. The official is now back with the central paramilitary force.Given his background, Yadav “lacked training and skills” needed for an operation that meant going up against sophisticated US counter-intelligence capabilities, the Post said. According to the report, senior officials at the US justice department and FBI had pushed to prosecute Yadav, a step that would have implicated RAW in a murder-for-hire conspiracy. “But while a US indictment unsealed in November contained the bombshell allegation that the plot was directed by an Indian official, it referred to Yadav as only an unnamed co-conspirator, CC-1, and made no mention of the Indian spy agency,” it said.“Higher-ranking RAW officials have also been implicated, according to current and former Western security officials, as part of a sprawling investigation by the CIA, FBI and other agencies that has mapped potential links to Modi’s inner circle,” the report said.","US authorities had last year indicted an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, for the plot, alleging that he was acting at the behest of an Indian official.

India fumes at Trudeau taking part in pro-Khalistan event,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-fumes-at-trudeau-taking-part-in-pro-khalistan-event/articleshow/109708322.cms,"Trudeau seen smiling at pro-Khalistan rally

NEW DELHI: Ministry of external affairs summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner on Monday and strongly protested the unabashed chanting of separatist pro-Khalistan slogans at an event addressed by Canadian PM Justin Trudeau .Trudeau addressing a ‘ Khalsa Day ’ gathering in Toronto, which flaunted ‘Modi wanted’ banners, has left the Indian intelligence establishment alarmed, sources said.The banners were allegedly put up by secessionist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which has called for the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June last year to be avenged, and has incited violence against Indian diplomats in Canada .Addressing the event, Trudeau vowed to protect the rights and freedoms of Sikhs. India has in the past blamed Trudeau’s “vote-bank politics” for Canada’s reluctance to rein in pro-Khalistan leaders who continue to target Indian interests in the country.A huge banner at the event identified PM Narendra Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar as “Nijjar’s killers”.Trudeau pushed bilateral ties into a downward spiral by saying Canadian law enforcement had uncovered a “plot” by India to eliminate Nijjar, wanted for terrorist crimes and who has been blamed for the killing of a Sikh for taking control of a rich gurdwara.Trudeau, who also raised his allegation with Modi, is yet to back the claim he made in public that Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Security Intelligence Agency had got evidence of India’s hand in Nijjar’s killing and had identified those who pulled the trigger.Also, while he said that he had got the evidence from a fellow member of Five Eyes Alliance, an Anglosphere intelligence group comprising US, UK, New Zealand and Australia, other members of the grouping have not allowed the episode to cast a shadow on their ties with New Delhi.The latest incident triggered an angry protest from MEA which conveyed govt’s “deep concern and strong protest” as disturbing actions were being allowed to continue unchecked at the event.The govt said the unchecked separatist activity once again illustrated the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism and violence. “Their continued expressions not only impact India-Canada relations but also encourage a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,” it added.During Trudeau’s address, pro-Khalistan Sikhs demanded the prosecution of Indian high commissioner Sanjay Verma for “orchestrating the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar”. In a video released by SFJ, Trudeau was seen smiling at the chants of “Khalistan zindabad”.SFJ chief Pannun said, “Trudeau’s address is reassuring that pro-Khalistan Sikhs’ right to campaign for liberation of Punjab from Indian occupation was protected under Canadian Charter of Rights and the liberal govt will always stand with Canadian Sikhs.”","The banners were allegedly put up by secessionist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which has called for the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June last year to be avenged.

"Amid Singapore & Hong Kong row, FSSAI focus shifts to spices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-singapore-hong-kong-row-fssai-focus-shifts-to-spices/articleshow/109707478.cms,"NEW DELHI: Food Safety Standards Authority of India has decided to step up surveillance this year of spices and culinary herbs, fruits and vegetables, salmonella in fish products and fortified rice amid heightened scrutiny of Indian masala brands such as MDH and Everest.The samples will be collected from mandis, malls and mom-and-pop stores across the country as the regulator seeks to enforce better compliance of standards.Some of the product categories have been under watch over the past few years too with spices becoming a major focus area this year in the wake of developments in Singapore and Hong Kong after alleged detection of carcinogenic pesticide ethylene oxide (EtO) in some samples. EtO is used by the spice industry to reduce microbial contamination, such as that of E coli and Salmonella.Another report by Public Eye, a Swiss body, and International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) claimed Nestle India was adding sugar and honey to infant milk and cereal products sold in countries like India.Of the samples tested by FSSAI between 2020-21 and 2022-23, nearly one out of four food samples was found non-confirming. Officials, however, clarified not all samples found to be non-conforming are unsafe. “A sample can be declared non-conforming for various reasons. This includes misbranding where a product and its content aren’t described properly, below the standard product and when products are considered unsafe to consume. Maximum defaulters fall in the first and second category,” a senior FSSAI official said.Over the years the number of samples picked up has increased from a little under 1.1 lakh in 2020-21 to 4.5 lakh in 2023-24.According to FSSAI Act, if samples are found sub-standard and misbranded, maximum penalty can be levied up to Rs 5 lakh for sub-standard food, up to Rs 3 lakh for misbranded food and up to Rs 10 lakh for misleading advertisements. “If samples are found unsafe, food businesses can be prosecuted under Section 59 of FSS Act, 2006 where a three-month jail term with penalty up to Rs 3 lakh can be levied where failure does not result in injury,” the official explained.","The samples will be collected from mandis, malls and mom-and-pop stores across the country.

We are strong not in spite of our differences, but because of our differences; but even as we look at these differences, we have to remember, and get reminded on days such as this, and every day, that Sikh values are Canadian values.""Thousands of Sikhs flocked to downtown Toronto on Khalsa day for one of the biggest yearly gatherings in the city.Trudeau's remarks come at a time when the diplomatic relations between India and Canada are going through a difficult phase after the death of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar sparked a row between India and Canada.","Government of India’s deep concern and strong protest was conveyed at such disturbing actions being allowed to continue unchecked at the event.

However, assuaging the state government's fear that the entire cabinet may be arrested over the case, the SC stayed a part of the HC's order that had asked the CBI to probe all officials involved in the recruitment of the teachers.The SC expressed serious concern about agency which conducted the recruitment test, destruction of OMR answer sheets, erasing of software about results and inclusion of people who were not part of the selection panel. ""You have to satisfy us how the high court went wrong,"" the CJI said.SC posted the next hearing for May 6.In an order passed last week, the Calcutta high court nullified the appointment of all the 25,753 teachers empanelled in 2016 for various categories of jobs at secondary and higher secondary schools in the state.A division bench of Justices Debangsu Basak and Shabbar Rashidi of the high court ordered that the candidates selected will have to return the entire salary drawn by them, along with an annualised interest of 12 per cent, within the next four weeks.Besides directing the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) to start the recruitment process afresh, it also directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to carry on with its investigation into the matter.Taking cognisance of the state cabinet's decision for the creation of super-numeric posts, the Calcutta high court said that the CBI, if necessary, can question the masterminds behind the creation of the seats in excess of the vacant posts. These super-numeric posts, which have remained under the cloud since the beginning, are perceived to provide room for ineligible candidates recruited illegally.","The Supreme Court on Monday refused to stay the Calcutta high court's order terminating the appointment of 25,000 teachers recruited ""illegally"" in West Bengal.

NEW DELHI: Baba Ramdev crossed a red line when he claimed he could cure Covid-19 , said Indian Medical Association (IMA) president Dr R V Asokan. Criticizing yoga guru, the IMA chief also said Ramdev maligned modern medicine by calling it a ""stupid and bankrupt science"".Dr Asokan highlighted the potential consequences of such statements, particularly their adverse impact on public trust and healthcare practices.""He crossed a red line. We have been tolerating mediocracy in this country for too long. Our profession also has been tolerating this and we never wanted to prove anything to anyone. He crossed a line when he advertised about Coronil (a Patanjali tablet) and said WHO has approved it which was a wrong statement,"" Dr Asokan was quoted as saying.Dr Asokan addressed the issue amidst ongoing legal proceedings involving Ramdev and his multibillion-dollar consumer goods empire Patanjali Ayurved . This also comes a day before the top court is scheduled to hear the matter next.Dr Asokan said Ramdev went against the medical profession by saying ""modern medicine is a stupid and bankrupt science"".""He went against the national interest when the government was driving the vaccination programme. He said 20,000 doctors died after taking two doses of the Covid vaccine. And he was having such a high profile that you know people believed what he said. That was the unfortunate part of it,"" he said.TheSupreme Court 's recent rebuke of Ramdev and Patanjali Ayurved over misleading advertisements prompted IMA's response. The court's observations raised concerns about the integrity of the Covid-19 vaccination drive and modern medical practices, prompting IMA to file a plea alleging a smear campaign against these initiatives.Dr Asokan emphasized the importance of ethical medical practices and expressed dismay over the Supreme Court's comments, which he deemed as undermining the profession's integrity.Dr Asokan said IMA is not against traditional systems of medicine. ""We have lived with all these decades. We respect each other. But somehow some sections of the society thought we are anti-traditional systems and, as for the public apology, it was to the Supreme Court. And it's more about the contempt of the court than the substance of the thing.""""I think the court has not said its final verdict. We need to wait.

"3,143 new objects added in space in 2023; Isro avoided 23 collisions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3143-new-objects-added-in-space-in-2023-isro-avoided-23-collisions/articleshow/109692913.cms,"BENGALURU: Isro 's annual Indian Space Situational Assessment Report (ISSAR) for 2023, released Monday, shows continued growth of the space object population, with 3,143 new objects added in 2023 from 212 launches and on-orbit breakup events globally, compared to 2,533 objects from 179 launches in 2022.This increasing congestion poses risks to operational satellites from potential collisions with debris.For India, the year saw the successful launch of seven Isro missions, placing five Indian satellites, 46 foreign satellites, and eight rocket bodies into orbit.However, the country also had to carry out a record number of collision avoidance maneuvers (CAMs) for its operational satellites due to close approaches by other space objects.""An increasing trend in CAMs per year is observed, which can be correlated with the growing congestion in outer space,"" the ISSAR report states, noting that 3,033 close approach alerts within 1 km were detected for Isro satellites in 2023.While no actual collisions occurred, the report emphasises the need for responsible behaviour and co-ordination among space operators to mitigate risks. Launch timings for some Isro missions had to be adjusted based on collision avoidance analyses to avoid potential close encounters.According to the report, 21 Indian satellites reentered Earth's atmosphere by the end of 2023, with eight satellites undergoing reentry in the year 2023 alone. Among these, the Megha-Tropiques-1 satellite underwent a meticulously planned and highly challenging controlled reentry.The report revealed that a total of 82 rocket bodies from Indian launches had been placed in orbit until the end of 2023. One notable incident occurred in 2001 when the upper stage of the PSLV-C3 rocket accidentally broke up, generating 371 pieces of debris. While most of these fragments have reentered the atmosphere, 52 PSLV-C3 debris remained in orbit until the end of 2023.Of the intact Indian upper stages, 35 rocket bodies had reentered the Earth's atmosphere by the end of 2023, with five such reentries occurring in 2023 alone.The report stated that Isro received more than 1.3 lakh close approach alerts from the United States Space Command (USSPACECOM). These alerts were re-assessed using more accurate orbital data of Indian operational satellites.""A total of 3,033 alerts were detected for close approaches within a distance of 1 kilometer, and around 2,700 close approaches were observed with other operational satellites within a 5-kilometer range,"" the report said.In certain instances, coordination was carried out with international agencies such as SpaceX and EUMETSAT to address potential close approaches. However, none of the close approaches were deemed critical enough to warrant a CAM.During 2023, Isro conducted a total of 23 CAMs to protect its space assets, marking an increase from 21 CAMs in 2022 and 19 in 2021.No concerning close approaches were detected for Chandrayaan-3 throughout its mission phases or for Aditya-L1 during its Earth-bound phase.""Operating in an environment inhabited by a growing population of active satellites requires Space Traffic Management,"" the report states, calling for the development of a universally accepted framework and the adoption of best practices for long-term sustainability of space activities.As the space sector continues to expand with more players and ambitious ventures like mega-constellations and space tourism, innovative solutions such as active debris removal and on-orbit servicing will be crucial to ensuring safe and sustainable operations in the increasingly crowded space environment.","Isro's annual Indian Space Situational Assessment Report (ISSAR) for 2023 shows continued growth of the space object population. 3,143 new objects added in 2023 from 212 launches and on-orbit breakup events globally, compared to 2,533 objects from 179 launches in 2022.

""I do not think they are solutions by any stretch of imagination. These are actually dangerous problems disguised as solutions.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday discussed the changing perception of India on the global stage.Speaking at an event in Delhi's Kirori Mal College, Jaishankar emphasized that India's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the success of the Chandrayaan-3 mission have had a significant impact on the way Indians are perceived abroad.Jaishankar noted that the world closely follows the decisions made in India, as it is the largest country and the fifth-largest economy.The minister highlighted that India's technological achievements, particularly the Chandrayaan-3 mission and Covid management, have been among the most impactful things done by the country in the past decade.""We are the largest country in the world. We are the fifth largest economy, soon we'll be the third. How we do at home is watched by everybody abroad. What decisions we make at home, is also very keenly followed by the world. So, if we are now in the coming weeks going to decide our future in whatever way we wish, it's not just a conversation amongst ourselves. It's a conversation or a discussion in which the other six billion people are also tuned in. These are all actually aspects of why Bharat matters,"" he said.Jaishankar also spoke about India's efforts to secure its citizens abroad during emergencies, such as Operation Ganga, which brought back Indian students from Ukraine. He emphasized that the Indian passport is now looked at with greater respect, as it shows that the government stands behind the person carrying that passport.The minister suggested that the ""real value of the passport"" should be determined by who will come to a person's aid when they are in trouble.Jaishankar said, ""The second is the manner in which we secure our citizens of India. Believe me, that has got everybody's attention in the world. You know, a lot of us rightly are very proud of how - I'll give you an example of how we got our students out of Ukraine in Operation Ganga. As I said, rightly so. But I also want you to know that there were many countries who actually told their students and their citizens, saying, sorry guys, there's nothing I can do. You now have to figure out your own way out.""""And these were not developing countries. They were even developed countries,who actually told their people, you are on your own. So, this change which has come about, that any Indian travelling anywhere has that sense, that look, you know, sometimes people talk about, you know, there's something called a passport index. And the passport index basically is based on how many places you don't need a visa for,"" he added.The minister also noted that people abroad are fascinated by India's domestic achievements, such as the ration card system, election system, and infrastructure progress.""The third is our performance at home. And I often share with my own colleagues in the cabinet and in the parliament that they think that when the foreign minister goes out of India, all the time we discuss foreign policy makes sense.""""But in reality, actually people abroad are enormously fascinated by what we are doing at home in the rest of our lives. They want to know how does your ration system work? How does your election system work? You know, how are you getting your gas cylinder? How are you getting your electricity connection? Why is it that it has changed because they have read all these stories,"" he added.", External affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke at an event in Delhi's Kirori Mal College.

Supreme Court agrees to consider plea seeking declaration Sharia won’t apply to ex-Muslims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-agrees-to-consider-plea-seeking-declaration-sharia-wont-apply-to-ex-muslims/articleshow/109697864.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday issued notice while hearing a writ petition seeking a declaration that a person who was born a Muslim, but ceased to be a believer, would not be governed by the Shariat law . After thorough discussions, the bench, led by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud along with Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, issued notices on the petition, considering it an ""important issue.""The bench highlighted that the Indian Succession Act prohibits individuals born into the Muslim faith from availing themselves of secular law, even if they formally declare under Section 3 of the Shariat Law that they no longer wish to follow Islamic law.Moreover, the bench asked the Attorney General for India to appoint a law officer who can provide assistance to the Court on this matter. The next hearing for this case is scheduled for the second week of July 2024.The writ petition has been lodged by Safiya PM, a woman from Kerala who serves as the general secretary of an association representing ex-Muslims in the region. In her plea, Safiya advocates for a declaration asserting that individuals who choose not to be bound by Muslim Personal Law should have the option to be governed by the secular laws of the nation, specifically the Indian Succession Act of 1925, in matters of both intestate and testamentary succession.You don’t necessarily need to seek that declaration. Because Section 3 of the Shariat Act says that unless you make a declaration, you will not be governed by the provisions of the personal law in the matter of wills, adoptions, and legacies. So if you don’t make a declaration, your father doesn’t make a declaration, they are not governed by the personal law,” the CJI said.However, later on, the bench, including Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, concurred with Safiya's counsel, Advocate Prashant Padmanabhan. ""There seems to be an issue here. Without a declaration, there remains a gap as the secular law does not automatically apply. Initially, we were unsure about the nature of this petition. However, now that we've delved into it, it appears to raise a significant point. We will proceed by issuing a notice,"" remarked CJI Chandrachud.The plea cited the Supreme Court's Sabarimala judgment, asserting that the fundamental Right to Religion under Article 25 of the Constitution of India must include the freedom to believe or not to believe. It argued, ""For this Right to have significance, individuals who choose to leave their faith should not face any disability or disqualification in matters of inheritance or other significant civil rights.""The plea highlighted that the petitioner, ""a woman born into a Muslim family with a non-practicing Muslim father who has not formally renounced the religion, is encountering a unique challenge in safeguarding her fundamental civil rights."" It further stated that Safiya ""desires a declaration that she shall not be subject to Muslim Personal Law for any matters outlined in section 2 or 3 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937. However, there is no provision either in the Act or its accompanying rules through which she can obtain such a certificate."" The plea argued that this represents a clear gap in the statute which could be addressed through judicial interpretation.""At present, even if the petitioner were to officially acquire a no-religion, no-caste certificate from any authority, she would still not be governed by the secular laws of the country, specifically the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Thus, the petitioner's fundamental rights under Article 25 are rendered futile due to the lack of such protection from the State,"" it added.","The writ petition has been lodged by Safiya PM, a woman from Kerala who serves as the general secretary of an association representing ex-Muslims in the region. In her plea, Safiya advocates for a declaration asserting that individuals who choose not to be bound by Muslim Personal Law should have the option to be governed by the secular laws.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109697916,imgsize-146044,width-400,resizemode-4/109697916.jpg"
‘India does not become an electoral autocracy if Yuvraj cannot get power’: PM Modi to TOI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-does-not-become-an-electoral-autocracy-if-yuvraj-cannot-get-power/articleshow/109674796.cms,"In an exclusive interview with Diwakar, Akhilesh Singh and Sidhartha, PM Narendra Modi took time off from his hyperkinetic electoral campaign to speak on a range of hot-button topics. Talking after the second round of polls, a confident PM said

NDA

was well on course to cross the 400+ target, with

reaching the 370 mark — the goal his party set keeping in mind the emotions linked to the abrogation of Article 370.

What is India's Modi vote share and meet the 'human deepfakes' of this election

TOI: What is your assessment after two rounds of polling? Are you still hopeful of crossing the 400 mark?

PM Modi

:

One of the main reasons we want to win 400 seats is to protect the rights of SCs, STs and OBCs in our country. We want a thumping majority so that the evil designs of the opposition to take away their reservation and rights, and give it to their vote bank are foiled. PM Modi on need for 400 seats

But the opposition says you are aiming for a super majority because you want to change the Constitution?

When you set 370 seats as the target for BJP and 400 for NDA, did you do so because you were concerned that complacency may set in among party cadres and even voters? You seem to have enlisted voters, setting a target for them as much as for yourself. But the optimistic ‘Abki Baar 400 Paar’ pitch and target of 370 seats for BJP also carries the risk of generating cadre complacency. Did you ever think that it might harm the party?

For me, guarantee is far more than a word. It is a very sacred expression. It is linked to my hard work and my credibility. It is anoutcome of my entire life in public service. PM Modi on Modi ki Gurantee

Rahul Gandhi

has said that it is too hubristic and BJP is headed for the ‘India Shining’ moment of 2004 when it had crashed to a shock defeat. Your comments? Unlike in 2004, when BJP pushed away allies, the party has this time enlisted new ones

The results from the South will see multiple myths broken this time. Our mind-share has already increased and you will seethat our vote share and seat share will also increase in a huge way. PM Modi on South India

How do you assess your prospects in south India? You have made a big push in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

Last time, BJP swept Karnataka but it suffered a big setback in the assembly polls. The talk is that your tally from the state will shrink. What is your assessment?

Congress’s guarantees played a big role in its victory in the assembly polls in Karnataka and Telangana. Do you think ‘Modi ki guarantee’ can trump them?

If we really want to ensure people’s growth, we just need to remove their barriers and empower them. This unleashes their entrepreneurial potential as we have seen in our country; even in tier-2, tier-3 cities which are giving rise to a lot of startups and sports stars. These reasons are why wealth redistribution, wealth tax, etc, are never successful because they never remove poverty, they just distribute it so that everyone is equally poor. PM Modi on equitable growth

Congress has accused BJP of attempting communal polarisation in Karnataka and elsewhere while BJP has charged it with appeasement. How is this playing out?

Ram Mandir is an emotive issue for the people of our country. It is a civilisational struggle of 500 years which has been resolved and prayers of generations of Indians have been answered. PM Modi on Ram Mandir

Is one nation, one poll going to be on the top of your ‘to do’ list in the third term? What about UCC? Will the Centre be an enabler or leave it to states?

We should not consider this sinister plan of Congress an idle threat — the threat is very real and stands to hurt our nation irreversibly. This is a clear example of Maoist thinking and ideology. It is saddening to see Congress and its Yuvraj carrying forward such Maoist vision which is a recipe for disaster. Our constitution protects the property of all minorities. This means that when Congress talks of redistribution, it cannot touch the properties of minorities, it cannot consider waqf properties for redistribution but it will eye the properties of all other communities. This will sow complete and irreversible communal disharmony. PM Modi on wealth redistribution

Your opponents in Karnataka and elsewhere have raised the issue of a NorthSouth divide, claiming the Centre discriminates against southern states. Do you see merit in it or is it driven by their need to fund their guarantees?

What is your worry about the current pitch for redistribution of assets? You have said the govt should not be expropriating wealth and assets of people and that a plan to do that is a reflection of the Maoist vision which has caused havoc in so many countries. Do you see this as a real threat?

Uniform Civil Code is one of the core agendas of our party. Already, BJP govts in the states are mulling over its implementation. Uttarakhand has become the first state to implement UCC. It is clear that separate laws for communities are detrimental to the healthof society. We cannot be a nation, where one community is progressing with the support of the constitutional norms, while the other community is stuck in a time warp due to appeasement. We will do everything in our capacity to make Uniform Civil Code a reality in India. PM Modi on UCC

As the size of the Indian economy grows, there are discussions about equity and inequality. You don’t seem to see wealth tax and inheritance tax as solutions.

Because the opposition is not able to get power, they start defaming India on the world stage. They spread canards about ourpeople, our democracy and our institutions. India does not become an electoral autocracy if the Yuvraj cannot automatically get power. PM Modi on Autocracy

Barring Ram Mandir, there has been no emotive issue in play this time around. You seem to be optimistic that people will consider improvements in their lives and prospects and give you a ‘positive’ vote. Cases relating to Kashi and Mathura temples are in court. Rather than wait for a lengthy legal process, can these issues be sorted out by discussions between religious leaders of both communities?

Improvement of living standards is an emotive issue which is resonating strongly in this election. A large number of people of this country are seeing for the first time that they can have a better future and achieve their dreams, which is an emotive issue for them. PM Modi on other emotive issues

In 2019, welfare schemes ranging from Ujjwala to PM Awas Yojana had reached people for the first time on a big scale. Voters endorsed the schemes and voted for BJP. This time, the schemes are not so new or unique. Will delivery of schemes still be a factor that will influence voter choice the same way?

SC has given a good closure to the issue, highlighting the importance of EVMs. Oppn always wants to drag the nation towards the era of booth capturing, which is possible only through paper ballots. PM Modi on allegations around EVMs

Sections of the opposition like INDIA consistently raised questions over the credibility of EVMs. They had alleged tampering in 2014 and, again, in 2019...

Opposition often alleges that there is threat to democracy and also that the country is moving towards being an ‘electoral autocracy’. The charge has found takers in many foreign capitals. Do you see it as a challenge?

The govt has been accused of misusing investigating agencies, particularly ED and CBI, to harass political opponents. It has also been alleged that ‘tainted’ politicians turn clean as soon as they join BJP.

One nation, one poll is going to ensure that as a nation our time, effort and resources get invested more productively towards nation-building. PM Modi on One Nation One Poll

In Delhi, we have a situation of a sitting CM being in jail. Although the law is silent on this, it is against convention. Do you see this becoming a precedent?

NDA-appointed governors have been at loggerheads with some opposition-governed state govts which have accused Raj Bhavans of interfering in their work. How would you respond to these allegations?

In the last 10 years, we have built a solid foundation for the nation’s growth to take flight. That is why I say that what you have seen till now is only a trailer. There is a lot that I want to do. PM Modi on last 10 years.

You have attempted to expand the concept of employment beyond govt jobs to selfemployment. Do you see your attempt succeeding in view of the entrenched bias for govt jobs?

Your vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’ in 2047 is still 23 years away from becoming a reality. By the time it is realised, you will be close to 95 years. Still, to your supporters and many others, you are central to that vision.

You have been credited with raising India’s global stature with a more assertive and ambitious foreign policy. Tell us about your experience of having steered India in a conflict-ridden world in which the pursuit of our national interests seemed, at least to some of our partners in the West, to be at odds with the rules of the international order?

I will not comment much as the cases are sub judice. But we are committed to develop our cultural heritage. Our manifesto speaks about the aim to boost cultural tourism across the country and develop temple spaces & cultural spaces of all religions in India as world-classdestinations for pilgrimage and tourism. The massive development taking place in our temple towns will not onlyhelp the pilgrims but also the local economy. PM Modi on Kashi and Mathura temple demand

If your assessment is proven right, you will equal Pandit Nehru’s record of scoring three straight wins. Your views on this rare feat also in view of the contrasting backgrounds you both came from.

I have done more than 70 rallies and roadshows so far, after the announcement of polls. Everywhere I have gone, I have seen an unprecedented display of love, affection and support. It is this support of the people that gives us confidence that we are on track to cross the 400 mark. The people have seen what we can deliver and we believe that the people want a better tomorrow, and they know that a vote for BJP means a vote towards development.The opposition is down and out after two phases of polling. In the first phase, it was out and after the second phase, it is out. For us, one of the main reasons we want to win 400 seats is to protect the rights of SCs, STs and OBCs in our country. We want a thumping majority so that the evil designs of the opposition to take away their reservation and rights, and give them to their vote bank are foiled.It is ironic that people who have changed the Constitution the maximum number of times are saying that we will change the Constitution. But before asking such a question, you should analyse my track record. You should study my work and actions right from the time I became CM and see if you find any such thing done by me. It is unfair to me if someone makes an allegation and you take that allegation on face value and start asking me questions on it.The party’s slogans reflect the sentiments of the people. It is the collective voice of the citizens who recognise our efforts and want to see even further change. But the genesis of this ‘Abki Baar, 400 Paar’ slogan is very interesting and emotional. Article 370 has been a very emotional issue for us, our karyakartas and the people of India. People have waited for generations for this to happen. Abrogation of Article 370 has been a driving force for our karyakartas for decades. When people saw that our govt did this, it made them very emotional and the feeling among people was that we should give 370 seats to the party which abrogated Article 370. And hence, the slogan, ‘Abki Baar, 400 Paar’ for the NDA emanated from among the people. It was an organic and a never-seen-before phenomenon where people are themselves setting a target for our victoryAs a karyakarta myself, I can attest that no complacency sets in within BJP. All top leaders of our party are constantly in the field, among the people. Our karyakartas are putting in huge efforts. In fact, in several places, you would find only BJP karyakartas at the booths. We are also seeing a large number of people who are passionate about the country taking time out to volunteer for BJP in cities as well as villages. This kind of support from society is helping us immensely. A new phenomenon that is being seen is the beneficiaries not only voting for us in large numbers, but also motivating others in their circle to do the same.The Congress party’s Yuvraj should be the last person to be talking about hubris. But it is true that now the Congress party is dependent only on shocks and surprises. Their only hope is that there will be some miracle to make them win the elections. Even their most veteran and important leaders have given up and conceded the elections. Each election is based on contemporary issues and, so, comparing them is not correct. In 2024, not only have we got new allies but we have unprecedented support of the people, which gives us the confidence of a spectacular win.The prospects are very good. It is not I who made a big push, it is, in fact, the other way round. The people of south India have made a big push to create space for BJP. Wherever you go in the South, the acceptance and affection shown by the people has been unprecedented. People in south India have seen govts of only Congress or regional parties. They have seen how these parties have perpetuated only corruption, nepotism, misgovernance, divisiveness, vote-bank politics and a very regressive approach to governance. People have also seen their hate for Indian culture and heritage. As a result of these reasons, people are fed up of Congress and regional parties.On the other hand, people have seen our governance at the Centre and have also seen the impact of our welfare schemes reaching them. They see a ray of hope in BJP and are seeing BJP as a credible alternative. BJP was the single largest party in south India in 2019 and this time it will be the single largest party by a huge margin. The results from the South will see multiple myths broken this time. Our mind-share has already increased and you will see that our vote share and seat share will also increase in a huge way.We have been hearing this talk in every election. People who are talking about our tally shrinking have shrunk to 50-odd seats themselves. People of Karnataka and BJP have a special relationship. The support for BJP saw a massive increase in 2019 and this time, our 10-year record of delivering strong economic growth, strong national security and strong welfare programmes will ensure NDA will win all 28 seats in Karnataka. NDA has been further strengthened by the addition of JD(S).Congress leaders are busy fighting to become CM while the state is suffering. The Congress govt has deceived the people of the state through faulty and half-baked implementation of their promises. People of Karnataka are fed up with the increasing lawlessness in the state and with the halt in progress of important infrastructure projects. They are fed up with the increasingly long power cuts and lack of water. People of Karnataka are repenting their vote to Congress in the state election. They will once again place their trust in the proven Modi guarantee.For me, guarantee is far more than a word. It is a very sacred expression for me. It is linked to my hard work and my credibility. It is an outcome of my entire life in public service. When I speak about guarantee, it pushes me to work even harder for the people. When I attach such importance to my guarantees, naturally people also realise it. People see that whatever guarantee Modi gives, he fulfils it, no matter what the circumstances. From providing tap water connections to rations, from building houses for the poor to expressways, Modi is delivering on the guarantees made to people. There are no ifs and buts to Modi’s guarantees. For the Congress party, their promises are just a way to fool people to gain their votes. They have neither credibility nor the intention to fulfil their promises. They had given many guarantees since Independence. Look at what happened to the biggest guarantee given by their tallest leader: the one of removal of poverty in 1971. Successive Congress PMs had spoken about removing poverty but nothing happened for decades. The poor were living without basic necessities like a house, toilet, water connection. Corruption continued unabated. Countries which became independent around the same time as India marched way ahead of us in terms of their economies. India was considered as one of the ‘Fragile Five’ nations before we came to power. So, for the people, there is no comparison between Modi’s guarantees and Congress’s broken promises.Media should look at actions and not allegations. Look at what all has happened in Karnataka. Bomb blasts, brutal murder of a daughter, attack on people doing bhajan-kirtan... During bomb blasts, the state govt tried its best to mislead people. In the murder of the daughter, the media is showing how the father is going around asking for justice. He is from the Congress party, but still he is not getting justice. If this is not appeasement, what is it? It is not polarisation to show that Congress has violated the Constitution and enacted laws providing reservation on the basis of religion. Our Constitution clearly prohibits reservations based on religion but the Congress govt in Karnataka reversed the law passed by BJP to provide reservation to OBCs and gave it to Muslims, classifying all Muslims as OBC. Even the National Commission for Backward Classes, a constitutional body, criticised this as against principles of ‘social justice’.The Congress govt in Telangana has recently said that it will replicate this move. This proves that Congress wants to reduce the reservation provided to SCs, STs and OBCs across the country and give it to minorities. What else can one expect from a party whose prime minister said that minorities have the first right on resources of this country?For the longest time, govts have been driven by electoral considerations rather than national considerations. Every year, there would be some or other election taking place and the priority would always be to win the next election, even if it meant trading off the long-term interests of the people of India. It is a matter of concern for us. One nation, one poll is going to ensure that as a nation, our time, effort and resources get invested more productively towards nation-building. A high-level committee, under the chairmanship of former President Ram Nath Kovind, has already submitted a report to President (Droupadi Murmu) prepared after extensive consultations with stakeholders and experts and research on implementing one nation, one poll. In our third term, one will see concrete steps being taken on the matter.Uniform Civil Code, too, is one of the core agendas of our party. Already, BJP govts in states are mulling over its implementation. Uttarakhand has become the first state to implement UCC. It is clear that separate laws for communities are detrimental to the health of society. We cannot be a nation where one community is progressing with the support of constitutional norms while the another community is stuck in a time warp due to appeasement. We will do everything in our capacity to make Uniform Civil Code a reality in India.Raising the false bogey of discrimination is their way of diverting and distracting from their corruption and misgovernance. People of Karnataka proudly sing Jaya Bharata Jananiya Tanujate, Jaya he Karnataka Maate (Victory to you Mother Karnataka, the daughter of Mother India). Does Congress really think its move to further divide India will be accepted by the immensely patriotic people of Karnataka? Every patriotic Indian will reject this artificial and false divide that Congress is trying to create. Congress, in partnership with the Left, has left Kerala nearly bankrupt and is now seeking to do the same in Karnataka and Telangana. It has just been one year since Congress came to power in Karnataka and they have already done serious damage to its thriving economy. Debt incurred by the state govt has massively increased and their empty promises have not resulted in providing welfare to people. In fact, their misgovernance has spooked investors and led to flight of capital from Karnataka. There has been a 46% reduction in FDI and 80% reduction in funds for startups compared to last year in the state.We should not consider this sinister plan of the Congress party like an idle threat, the threat is very real and stands to hurt our nation irreversibly. This is a clear example of Maoist thinking and ideology. It is saddening to see the Congress party and its Yuvraj carrying forward such Maoist vision which is a recipe for disaster. You would have seen the Yuvraj saying that we will do an X-ray. This X-ray is nothing but raiding every home. They will raid farmers to see how much land they possess. They will raid the common man to see how much wealth he/she has earned through hard work. They will raid the ornaments of our women. Our Constitution protects the property of all minorities. This means that when Congress talks of redistribution, it cannot touch the properties of minorities, it cannot consider waqf properties for redistribution but it will eye the properties of other communities. This will sow complete and irreversible communal disharmony.This is something we have to be very careful about, we cannot let anyone harm the country and its people, whatever reasons they may have. Our nation, the welfare of each and every one of our citizens is our first and foremost priority. Our govt doesn’t design policies to benefit a majority, we do not make policies that will benefit minorities; we make policies that benefit our nation and its 140 crore citizens without discrimination.I do not think they are solutions by any stretch of imagination. These are actually dangerous problems disguised as solutions. Would you work day and night if the govt will take away your money in the name of redistribution? Today, we are empowering 3 crore women to become Lakhpati Didis. Such policies will ensure that women don’t become Lakhpatis and their aspirations don’t progress. If someone has taken a Mudra loan and is progressing, his growth will be stunted. Our street vendors who are now growing due to our policies will also not be able to grow. Today, we are the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world. Such policies will kill the startup revolution by our youth. This policy is a way to please their vote bank.If we really want to ensure people’s growth, we just need to remove barriers and empower them. This unleashes their entrepreneurial potential as we have seen in our country; even in tier 2 and 3 cities, which are giving rise to a lot of startups and sports stars. These reasons are why wealth redistribution, wealth tax etc have never been successful: they never removed poverty, they just distributed it so that everyone is equally poor. The poor remain stricken with poverty, wealth creation stops and poverty becomes uniform. These policies sow discord and block every road to equity, they create hatred and destabilise the economic as well as social fabric of a nation.Yes, Ram Mandir is an emotive issue for the people of our country. It is a civilisational struggle of 500 years which has been resolved and the prayers of generations of Indians have been answered. But you are wrong in saying there is no other emotive issue. A ‘mahila’ getting a tap water connection, LPG connection, toilet and becoming a Lakhpati Didi and having the power to dream of a better future is an emotive moment for her and her entire family. For a youth who wants to start his own business and provide for his family and has aspirations to further expand his operations, getting a collateral-free Mudra loan is also a big emotive moment. A ‘kisan’ getting his ‘samman’, a father being able to provide the best treatment to his child due to Ayushman Bharat Yojana, a street vendor opening a second cart due to PM-SVANidhi and transacting entirely on UPI: all these mark emotive moments for the entire country. Improvement of living standards is an emotive issue which is resonating strongly in this election. For a large number of people of this country, they are seeing for the first time that they can have a better future and achieve their dreams, which is an emotive issue for them.As far as Kashi and Mathura are concerned, I will not comment much as the cases are sub judice. But we are committed to developing our cultural heritage. Our manifesto speaks about the aim to boost cultural tourism across the country and develop temple spaces and cultural spaces of all religions in India as world-class destinations for pilgrimage and tourism. The massive development taking place in our temple towns will not only help the pilgrims but also the local economy.If you look at our manifesto this time closely, you will observe that we have not only expanded our schemes but have also reinvented them as per the current aspirations of the poor. Take Mudra Yojana for example. We brought around an entrepreneurship revolution through this scheme and now we will double the loan amount to match the aspirations and requirements of our entrepreneurs. Take electricity for example. We ensured electricity reaches more than 3 crore households and 18,000 villages for the first time. Now we have come up with the PM Suryaghar Muft Bijli Yojana to ensure that people get free electricity. Take startups for example. We brought proactive policies and ensured that startups get all support. Now we want to make India a startup hub.So, you can see that there is continuity because we don’t want to change our direction when we are successful. But we are reimagining the scale and scope of schemes. The poor who are exiting poverty should not lapse into poverty again. The progress achieved should continue. This approach will ensure that people’s aspirations are also fulfilled and also help achieve a Viksit Bharat. Our manifesto has only things which are achievable. We don’t believe in making false and unrealistic promises that cannot be delivered.I think our Supreme Court has given a good closure to this issue. The Supreme Court judgment speaks in detail about the importance of EVMs and the transparency they bring. The opposition always wants to drag the nation towards the era of booth capturing, which is only possible through paper ballots. I don’t think the members of INDI Alliance have ever been bothered about logic and reason when it comes to EVMs. For them, EVMs have always been the convenient scapegoat after defeat. Let us see if it will be any different this time.This is an example of the scorched earth policy that our opposition is following. Because the opposition is not able to get power, they start defaming India on the world stage. They spread canards about our people, our democracy and our institutions. India does not become an electoral autocracy if the Yuvraj cannot automatically get power. Just because he has to fight elections and the people of India are not impressed by him doesn’t make India less democratic. I don’t think there are many takers for such charges in foreign capitals. They often are more in sync with reality than the ‘certificate shops’ in their countries. When I engage with world leaders, I see genuine admiration for our democratic process and our institutions. When they deep dive into the scale and speed of our electoral process, they are awed by our efficiency.It is my request to the media to first do research on these allegations. Instead of introspecting why its functionaries are leaving in hordes, Congress is making such excuses. There are many politicians with no ED or CBI cases against them who have left Congress and joined us. The fact is that just a small fraction of the agencies’ cases is related to political figures. Of the corruption cases probed by the ED, only 3% involve politicians. The remaining 97% are linked to officials and criminals. Action is being taken against them too. Over the last 11 years, out of 10,622 preliminary inquiries and regular cases being investigated by the CBI, only about 1-1.5% of the total cases involved politicians. This debunks the claim of a politically-motivated modus operandi. Another interesting fact is that before 2014, the ED attached assets worth only Rs 5,000 crore, whereas in the last 10 years that amount has increased to more than Rs 1 lakh crore.Most importantly, no ongoing investigation has been closed simply because the person involved has joined a particular party. Corruption is a serious problem, and we’re dealing with it seriously. We have come a long way in our battle against corruption in the last 10 years and are now at an inflection point. Investigations by our central agencies also extend to high-profile bureaucrats, resulting in the identification and attachment of proceeds worth over Rs 16,000 crore. These numbers show the agencies’ commitment to being fair and effective in tackling economic offences.I think it is the media’s responsibility to show the people the full perspective on this issue, how people of Delhi are suffering, and what the courts have said about the case. I am optimistic that this will not become a precedent. I feel other politicians won’t be so lacking in morals and will not go to this extent.Congress party, which converted Raj Bhavans into Congress Bhavans, has no right to speak about the sanctity of the governor’s post. Before I took on the role of prime minister, I was chief minister of a state for more than a decade. In those years, I worked under Congress governors. I respected them and they respected me, despite our differences, and this was the case for many years. Perhaps for the first time since India’s Independence, we’re seeing this level of unprecedented attacks on our governors in various states. We must understand that the governor acts as a bridge between the Union and state govt, bringing in much-needed balance in administration to an otherwise diverse and vast nation. It is very unfortunate that in certain states, we are hearing about workers of political parties stopping the governor’s convoy, and in some states, even throwing petrol bombs at the Raj Bhavan. This kind of behaviour is alarming and unacceptable. When such incidents happen, they raise serious concerns about the overall law and order situation in the state. It indicates a breakdown of authority and respect for the rule of law.As far as Raj Bhavan’s interference in state affairs goes, we need to take a look at history. Which party and people in power misused Article 356 the most to paralyse state machineries that they disagreed with? Which prime minister used Article 356 fifty times to topple elected govts led by opposition parties? And this begs the question: How many elected state govts have been toppled unethically since 2014? None. Instead, there has been a rise in cooperative federalism, with efforts to foster better relations between the Centre and states. The governor represents the constitutional authority of the state, and their position should be respected by all parties, regardless of political differences.Our efforts have been to expand the spectrum of opportunities for the youth, be it public sector, private sector or entrepreneurship. Our 10 years will be remembered for creating the maximum number of opportunities across all three segments. Rather than argue that one kind of job is better or another, we have focused on improving the overall pool of opportunities available for the youth. The results are visible. The annual Periodic Labour Force Survey data shows us that between 2017 and 2023, the labour force participation rate has increased from 49.8% to 57.9%. The unemployment rate has gone down from 6% to 3.2%. Between 2017 and 2024, over 7 crore new EPFO subscribers have been added. Over 8 crore new businesses have been started with Mudra alone and each business has supported 1-2 people. This means more than 15 crore opportunities have been created. Now add to this Startup India, Stand-up India loans and SVANidhi loans, the entrepreneurial sector itself has completely transformed. We have opened several new avenues for the youth. Space sector, which was not even thought about some years ago, is flourishing today.Our gig economy is thriving and employs lakhs of people, with over 20% engaged in highly skilled jobs. Our digital economy is also growing exponentially with over 6 crore jobs generated till 2019; a number that may double in the next few years. A recent report has said that in the past decade, the real estate sector has seen the creation of over 3 crore new jobs. I regularly attend Rozgar Melas which is the largest-ever drive to give govt jobs where we have given recruitment letters to lakhs of youth.India becoming Viksit Bharat is not Modi’s vision. It is the vision and will of 140 crore Indians that when the nation celebrates the 100th year of Independence, it should be a developed nation. I find myself extremely fortunate that I have been an instrument to realise the dreams and aspirations of my countrymen. The speed and scale of our work reflects our eagerness to take the nation to new heights. Our model of saturation shows our commitment to open the doors of prosperity for every family. Our push towards technology and newer opportunities is ensuring that our yuva shakti reaches its full potential. Our borders today are more secure than ever, our nari shakti is the one leading social change, our infrastructure is acquiring global standards and our economy is turning more and more aatmanirbhar. In the last 10 years, we have built a solid foundation for the nation’s growth to take flight. That is why I say that what you have seen till now is only a trailer. There is a lot that I want to do. Let me assure you, Modi is blessed by 140 crore Indians. He will not stop till the dream of Viksit Bharat is achieved.Shouldn’t the goal of our foreign policy be to advance our national interest? Our approach to foreign policy is ‘nation first’. And when we talk about our rise through a ‘nation first’ approach, it doesn’t threaten the world. The world feels the rise of India is good for the world. The world only respects those who stand for themselves. No one respects those who cannot even stand for their national interest. So when we conducted our foreign policy as per our national interest, initially it would have come as a surprise to many. For example, when we went into trade deal discussions looking at our interests in mind, our partners and even the media were surprised to see us doing so. Our partners have realised that it is normal for nations to stand for their national interest. Doing so, in fact, increased their respect for India. They came to terms with a new reality where India is very cognisant of what is good for its people and what is not. Today, the world respects India for being able to ensure that fuel and energy prices for its citizens stayed in control despite the global conflicts.Whenever I meet world leaders, I see that their interest and attraction for India is increasing. They see the situation in their countries and compare it with how India is a nation brimming with optimism and opportunities. I see genuine respect for India and Indians. Yes, the world is today filled with conflicts and chaos, but there are islands of calm and growth like India. India’s role is more important in the world than ever before.To be honest, I do not know about these records. It is your work to analyse such trends. I just keep doing my work. But since you have asked this question, I would urge you to do an analysis of this. You could look at the political landscape at that time, the opposition parties and their leaders. You could look at the level of awareness among people for their rights as well as their education levels. You can look at the media presence. An analysis should be done comparing how the country progressed in Nehru ji’s 10 years versus our 10 years. We are at a very important juncture as the country is preparing a roadmap for the next 25 years and it would enlighten the public.","PM Narendra Modi took time off from his hyperkinetic electoral campaign to speak on a range of hot-button topics.

Can Succession Act be applied to ‘non-believer Muslims’? SC to examine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-succession-act-be-applied-to-non-believer-muslims-sc-to-examine/articleshow/109704852.cms,"Tough for even a non-believer Muslim to come under ISA

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine a contentious issue — why provisions of the secular Indian Succession Act (ISA) do not apply to a non-believer Muslim who wants to divide his property equitably among his children by discarding Muslim Personal (Shariat) Application Act’s succession provision that privileges sons.As a Muslim woman narrated the pitiable state she and her father, both non-believers in Islam, found themselves in regarding the division of property, a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud changed tack from “we can’t give a declaration that a non-believer Muslim would be governed by ISA” and said the petition had raised an important issue for adjudication by the SC.“How can a secular law not apply to Muslims?” the bench asked and posted the matter for further hearing in the second week of July. The bench issued notice to the Union govt and requested attorney general R Venkataramani to depute a law officer to assist the court.The woman said she had a brother who was afflicted with Down Syndrome and she and her father, a widower, took care of him. She said as per Shariat, daughter gets just half the share of what sons are entitled to as successors of their father, which in this case meant the son would receive two-thirds of her father’s property and she would get one-third.Her counsel Prashant Padmanabhan argued that if “something happened to the son”, then his share would not go to her or her daughter, but to some relative of her father. “There is no authority where my father can go and say that he is a non-believer Muslim and that he would like to give effect to anequitable succession through the secular ISA,” he said.After reading Section 3 of the Shariat law, the bench said if the father does not make a declaration that he is a Muslim, he could escape the rigours of Muslim personal law. But the CJI-led bench then looked at Section 58 of the ISA, which provides that “testamentary succession (wills) to the property of any Muhammadan” will not be covered by this legislation.",Supreme Court to examine why provisions of the secular Indian Succession Act (ISA) do not apply to a non-believer Muslim who wants to divide his property equitably among his children.

Amendments to tighten law on misleading drug ads stalled since 2020,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amendments-to-tighten-law-on-misleading-drug-ads-stalled-since-2020/articleshow/109704805.cms,"While the Supreme Court has taken a serious view of misleading ads , amendments to strengthen the Drug and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 have been in limbo with the Union health ministry since February 2020. In response to an RTI application seeking the status of the amendment, the ministry responded last month that the matter was still “pending”.The committee that drafted the amendment bill had recommended the DMR(OA) (Amendment) Bill 2020 “in order to giving the sharper teeth (sic) and to keep pace with the changing time and technology”.The main changes proposed were to enhance punishment and to increase the number of conditions for which ads for drugs claiming to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent would be prohibited from 54 to 78. The penalty was to increase from “imprisonment which may extend to six months or with fine, or with both” for first conviction to “imprisonment which may extend to two years and fine up to ten lakh rupees”. For subsequent convictions, penalty under DMRA is “imprisonment which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both”. The amendment proposed to increase it to imprisonment up to five years and fine up to fifty lakh rupees.The health ministry had constituted the committee through an order dated December 10, 2019. It included representatives from Ayush ministry , consumer affairs department, information and broadcasting ministry and a few state drug controllers. The draft amendment bill was made public for comments on February 3, 2020, just when Covid struck.All comments received were compiled by the CDSCO (Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation) and sent it to the ministry by the end of June 2020. A draft cabinet note was put up before the health minister in November 2020 and a slide presentation on the draft was made by the CDSCO on the request of the ministry. The next month, it was suggested that the draft be circulated among all states as they would be the ones to implement it. The file circulated some more till Covid put a stop to it.It was next picked up in September 2022 when it was decided that a meeting ought to be held with the drug controller general of India on the matter. From the RTI reply recently, it appears that there has been no progress after that.The DMRA amendment was initiated on the recommendation of a Parliamentary standing committee, whose report tabled in March 2018 stated that “it is the need of the hour to strictly monitor and regulate the misleading advertisements for promoting the sale of AYUSH medicine”.Unlike the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, DMRA brings within its ambit medicines of all systems including Ayurvedic drugs. This is why many of the complaints against Patanjali’s drugs were filed under DMRA as they claimed to cure/treat diseases listed under the DMRA. “Despite the parliament committee’s recommendation to enact a strong law to prevent misleading and illegal ads, it is clear from the file noting that I obtained through RTI, that there is no file movement since 2022. I complained to the Prime Minister’s office and even after direction from the PMO, they are sitting on it,” said Dr Babu, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist, who has filed several complaints against Patanjali ads for violating DMRA.","Amendments to strengthen the Drug and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 have been in limbo with the Union health ministry since February 2020.

SC recalls order allowing MTP of 31-week pregnancy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-recalls-order-allowing-mtp-of-31-week-pregnancy/articleshow/109704570.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a rare instance, Supreme Court on Monday recalled its April 22 order, passed in exercise of its omnibus powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to do complete justice, allowing termination of a 14-year-old girl’s 31-week pregnancy caused by alleged sexual assault.A bench headed by CJI D Y Chandrachud, on a petition filed by the minor’s mother, had asked the dean of Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital and Medical College, Sion, to carry out the MTP after it perused a medical board’s report suggesting that though termination of an advanced pregnancy was risky, carrying on with the pregnancy to its full term may have a deleterious impact on the minor’s mental and physical health.After the court passed the order setting the stage for MTP, the girl’s mother vacillated between termination of a fully grown foetus or allowing her minor daughter to deliver a baby which would be put up for adoption. She wanted assurance that MTP would not harm her daughter in any manner. But doctors explained the complications involved in terminating an advanced pregnancy.Finding the petitioner indecisive, the doctors wrote back to the SC and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, specifically requested by the SC to assist in the matter by consulting everyone involved, explained the difficult situation faced by the doctors in terminating a pregnancy which had advanced to 32 weeks.Recognising the dilemma, the bench decided to have a video conference with the girl’s parents, doctors tasked with doing the MTP, counsel for the mother and Bhati. After a detailed discussion that lasted over an hour, the bench agreed with the parents on taking the pregnancy to its full term.It recalled its April 22 order and ordered that Maharashtra govt would support the girl and her family in carrying on with the pregnancy to its full term and render all healthcare assistance to her. The CJI-led bench also ordered that if at any later stage, after the minor gave birth, the family wanted to give up the baby for adoption, the state govt would facilitate the process.Interestingly, Bombay high court had rejected the girl’s mother’s plea for MTP, citing the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act provision that fixed 24 weeks as the outer limit for pregnancy termination.SC had ordered a fresh examination of the girl by a medical board on the ground that the medical report relied upon by the HC did not consider “impact of pregnancy on physical and emotional well-being of the minor”.","The Supreme Court on Monday recalled its April 22 order allowing termination of a 14-year-old girl’s 31-week pregnancy caused by alleged sexual assault.

If necessary, CBI will undertake custodial interrogation of such persons involved” — would lead to arrest of all ministers as the cabinet had approved the note on creation of supernumerary posts on humanitarian grounds for waitlisted candidates.“During elections, CBI will register FIRs and the entire cabinet will go to jail,” Dwivedi said. The bench saw merit in this argument and stayed this particular HC direction while posting the matter for further hearing on May 6. However, SC did not interfere with the other 13 directions to CBI.Dwivedi, appearing for the state govt, said CBI found 8,000-odd recruitments to be irregular and asked how HC could cancel the recruitment of 25,000-odd teachers on this basis. The bench said, “The whole process is replete with irregularities.”CJI Chandrachud added, “Look at the process by which the whole recruitment was done. Originally, NYSA (an agency) was appointed (for scanning and evaluating OMR answer sheets). Then Data Scantach comes in and the staff selection commission says it does not know how the second agency came in. OMR sheets are destroyed by SSC. The mirror images (of OMR sheets) are not there on the server any more. People who are not on the panel are recruited. This is a complete fraud. Why were supernumerary posts created even after irregularities were found in the recruitment? Ultimately, HC direction to CBI is to probe further.”","Supreme Court did not stay Calcutta HC decision to junk appointment of over 25,000 teachers in West Bengal.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Mutual Fund KYC issues: What problems are MF investors facing with new rules and how they can check their KYC status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/mutual-fund-kyc-issues-what-problems-are-mf-investors-facing-with-new-rules-and-how-they-can-check-their-kyc-status/articleshow/109691202.cms,"How To Check Mutual Fund KYC Status

1) KYC Validated:

2) KYC Registered:

3) KYC On Hold:

Mutual Fund KYC issues : Since April, several mutual fund investors have had their folios frozen due to non-compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) norms. The Securities and Exchange Board of India instructed KYC registration agencies ( KRAs ) to verify mutual fund unitholders' KYC information based on PAN, name, address, mobile number, and email IDs.The goal was to match and validate investors' records with official databases such as the Income Tax (IT) database and Aadhaar card.However, it was discovered that the records of many investors, particularly old-timers who completed KYC using documents other than PAN or Aadhaar, could not be validated. As a result, these investors have been requested to redo their KYC.Although redoing the KYC process appears to be straightforward, investors, distributors, and investment advisors have reported delays in updating the required documents at the KRAs' end, even after submitting them. According to an ET report by Prashant Mahesh, the AMC may reject your application for fresh investments unless the KYC is approved. This situation has caused inconvenience and frustration for affected mutual fund unitholders who are trying to comply with the renewed KYC requirements.To check your Mutual Fund (MF) Know Your Customer (KYC) status, visit www.cvlkra.com and select the KYC inquiry option. The website will provide you with one of three possible results:If you receive this status, you are fully compliant and can proceed with your investments. According to data from KRA agencies, approximately 73% of investors belong to this category.This status indicates that the KYC documents submitted by the investor cannot be directly verified based on the provided documentation. However, aspects such as email and mobile number have been validated, allowing you to continue investing in MFs where you already have investments. If you wish to open a new folio with a different fund house, you will need to submit a fresh set of KYC documents. Around 15% of investors fall into this category.There is a benefit for those holding mutual fund units in demat form here. They can continue to transact with any AMC. However, they cannot open an account with another intermediary.This status applies to cases where PAN-Aadhaar seeding has not been completed, email and mobile validation has failed, or the KYC was done without an officially valid document like a bank statement or utility bill. In this situation, the investor must complete 'PAN-Aadhaar Seeding' in their Income Tax records to make the PAN operational and redo the KYC process. After completing this step, the investor should share their updated email and mobile number with the fund house and submit a modification request to the KRA, who will then update the status. Currently, 12% of investors fall under this category.While KYC can be completed using officially valid documents such as a passport, driving license, or voter ID, but distributors believe that Aadhaar should be the primary document for KYC. The challenge arises when KRAs are unable to cross-verify data in a passport, preventing the KYC status from moving to validated. Other details like PAN can be verified through the Income Tax portal, while mobile numbers and emails can be authenticated through OTPs.NRIs face the maximum problem as they are not mandated to have an Aadhaar card, while many do not have an Indian mobile number where OTP comes for authentication. This situation leads to NRI investors without Aadhaar having their KYC status in the 'Registered' category, which is unlikely to change. Distributors have advised NRIs to complete their KYC every time they invest in a new fund house. However, there is uncertainty regarding whether AMCs will accept investments in new folios without a ""KYC Validated"" status.","Since April, several mutual fund investors have had their folios frozen due to non-compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) norms.

The poll reveals that Trump retains the support of 49% of registered voters in a direct matchup, unchanged from January, while Biden’s support has slightly dipped to 43% from 45%.Reflecting on their first terms, 55% of Americans now view Trump’s presidency as successful, a significant shift from January 2021, when the same percentage labeled it a failure shortly after the January 6 Capitol attack. In contrast, 61% of respondents consider Biden’s current term a failure, worsening from 57% in January 2022, the CNN report said.The poll underscores a strong partisan divide: 92% of Republicans view Trump's presidency favorably, compared to only 73% of Democrats who feel the same about Biden’s term. Among independents, 51% favor Trump’s term over 37% who approve of Biden’s efforts.Economic concerns dominate voter priorities, with 65% of registered voters citing the economy as extremely important in their decision-making—significantly higher than in the past two presidential elections. These economically concerned voters overwhelmingly favor Trump over Biden, 62% to 30%.A broad majority, 70%, view US economic conditions negatively. Interestingly, 41% of those who rate the economy poorly believe a change in political leadership would be more influential than economic policies like inflation control.On individual issues, Biden struggles with low approval ratings across the board, especially regarding his handling of the economy (34% approval) and inflation (29% approval). His policies on healthcare and student loans fare slightly better but still fall short of majority approval.The poll also highlights a national frustration with the available presidential candidates, with 53% of voters dissatisfied with their choices. Negative views of both Biden and Trump persist, with 58% holding an unfavorable opinion of Biden and 55% of Trump.Adding complexity to the electoral landscape, when independent candidates like Robert F Kennedy Jr, Cornel West, and Jill Stein are considered, Trump’s lead adjusts to 42%, followed by Biden at 33% and Kennedy capturing 16%.The survey, conducted from April 18-23 among 1,212 adults, includes 967 registered voters and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points for the registered voter sample.","In latest CNN poll conducted by SSRS, Donald Trump maintains a consistent advantage over President Joe Biden as both the presidential campaign and Trump's criminal trial progress.

"Dar's surprise elevation as deputy PM 'pre-planned', a move to 'compensate' Nawaz Sharif",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/dars-surprise-elevation-as-deputy-pm-pre-planned-a-move-to-compensate-nawaz-sharif/articleshow/109689461.cms,"NEW DELHI: The surprise elevation of Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar - a close confidant of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif - as the deputy prime minister was in reality ""pre-planned' and is reportedly a move to ""compensate' the PML-N supremo for the loss of the finance portfolio, it emerged on Monday. At the age of 73, Dar, a chartered accountant and experienced politician from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, was named deputy prime minister by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday, with the appointment taking immediate effect and until further notice.Shehbaz Sharif and Dar are currently in Saudi Arabia for the World Economic Forum's (WEF) special meeting.According to the Dawn newspaper, Dar's new appointment ""took many by surprise, but drew hardly any criticism from its allies'.Dar being ""awarded' the ""rarely filled' slot of deputy prime minister has raised many questions, the report said.The main talking point is that PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif wants to have his ""confidant' in a key position in the federal cabinet to ""compensate him for the loss of the finance portfolio', it said.The report mentioned that the action was also viewed in connection with Nawaz Sharif assuming leadership of the ruling PML-N party as its president, a position he had been deprived of after being convicted in the Panama Papers case.Dar is seen as having a close relationship with Nawaz Sharif because of the family connection through marriage, as his son is married to the elder Sharif's daughter.An insider claimed that the move to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister was ""pre-planned', the report said. During the formation of the coalition government, it was agreed that Dar would serve as the Deputy Prime Minister.However, based on a report from Geo News, the decision to appoint a four-time finance minister as the foreign minister indicates an increased focus on economics in the country's diplomacy as the financially struggling nation aims to obtain another deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and strengthen external financing from foreign capitals.Dar was the finance minister from 1998 to 1999 and then again from March to May 2008. He once more headed the finance ministry from 2013 to 2017 and later from 2022 to 2023. He additionally worked as the minister for industry and investment from February 1997 to July 1997, and also in commerce from December 1997 to October 1999.According to the report from Dawn, during Nawaz Sharif's tenure as the prime minister, Dar served as the de facto deputy prime minister, leading numerous government and parliamentary committees in the capacity of chairperson. Even though the Constitution does not include a provision for a deputy prime minister, Dar is the second legislator to assume this role.Chaudhry Parvez Elahi served as Deputy Prime Minister when the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was in power from June 25, 2012, to June 29, 2013. During that period, his responsibilities were largely symbolic, and he was given recognition by then-President Asif Ali Zardari for his support of the government led by the PPP.Elahi is currently serving as the president of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party led by the jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, and he is in prison due to corruption allegations.Interestingly, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the main ally of the PML-N-led government, did not raise any objection to Dar's new appointment. The PPP Information Secretary, Faisal Karim Kundi, stated that his party had no objections to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister. ""It is the PM's prerogative to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister,"" he said, adding that the move was not meant as a ""message' to anyone.Meanwhile, Khan's PTI on Monday reacted strongly to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister, saying ""Sharifs are distributing key national posts within the family'.""The Sharif family is distributing important national posts among themselves,"" Special Assistant to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister For Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif said.The PTI leader criticized the federal government for appointing individuals to high-ranking positions instead of addressing the problems faced by the people as the Constitution does not provide for the position of deputy PM.Reacting to Dar's appointment, Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob termed the PM Shehbaz Sharif-led government's move ""an extra-constitutional step that carries no substantial value'.""This just indicates intra-party tensions and competition for influence. It is not an admirable step because, at this serious juncture of our national life and the lowest point of our economic condition, we should be focusing on substantive issues rather than taking trivial and inconsequential decisions,"" The News reported quoting Mehboob.(With inputs from agencies)","Ishaq Dar, 73, was named deputy prime minister by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday.

Pakistan: PM Shehbaz Sharif raises wheat procurement target amid farmer protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-pm-shehbaz-sharif-raises-wheat-procurement-target-amid-farmer-protests/articleshow/109664872.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has finally responded to farmer protests in his country over delays in the grain's buying process by ordering an increase in the wheat procurement target from USD 1.4 million tonnes to USD 1.8 million tonnes, Dawn reported.Further, Sharif has instructed the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited (Passco), Pakistan's national grain procurement and storage agency, to expedite the buying process to assist growers.According to Dawn, these directives were issued by the Prime Minister before his departure for Saudi Arabia to attend the World Economic Forum meeting, as per a statement from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).The official press release stated that decision ""a big relief"" for farmers, adding that it was taken following complaints from wheat growers.""The prime minister has taken the initiative keeping in view the problems confronting the growers regarding the sale of wheat,"" it said.In addition to raising the wheat procurement target, Sharif instructed Passco to prioritize transparency and facilitate growers, as per Dawn.A bumper crop output has been projected for this season and wheat threshing has already begun in most parts of Punjab, the largest wheat-producing province in the county.However, farmers raised complaints against the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited that it was not purchasing wheat and flour mills were ""exploiting them"" by offering rates lower than the government-mandated support price for their crops.The Sindh and Balochistan governments have established the support price at (Pakistcurrency) PKR 4,000 per 40kg, while the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab governments have set it at PKR 3,900 per 40kg.Farmers expressed frustration as their production costs have doubled over the past year, yet they are compelled to sell their produce at last year's rates or even lower.This contentious issue has sparked heated debates in both the National and Punjab Assemblies this week.The National Assembly was told that official procurement has slowed as the caretaker government imported wheat despite having a bumper crop.National Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer admitted the decision was ""wrong"", and the prime minister has already ordered an inquiry into it.He added that the ministry would write letters to provincial governments to procure maximum wheat from the farmers.Opposition member Sheikh Waqas Akram warned the government that farmers would be on the streets soon and ""the rulers would not be able to face the brunt"".The farmers have staged protests in several areas and demanded the government increase the support price.Addressing a press conference earlier this month, the Kisan Board Pakistan president, Sardar Zafar Hussain, urged the government to procure at least five million tonnes of wheat in the current season and raise the support to PKR 5,000 per 40kg.He alleged that the government was ""deliberately delaying"" the procurement campaign because of which the prices in the open market were declining.",Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered an increase in the wheat procurement target from USD 1.4 million tonnes to $1.8 million tonnes. Sharif has instructed the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited (Passco) to expedite the buying process to assist growers.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109664907,imgsize-1081385,width-400,resizemode-4/109664907.jpg"
Foreign talent to make up for unskilled bureaucrats in Pakistan: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/foreign-talent-to-make-up-for-unskilled-bureaucrats-in-pakistan-report/articleshow/109661493.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan 's Cabinet has relaxed rules to hire foreign consultancy firms to make up for 'unskilled' bureaucrats and speed up official efforts to bring investment for various projects in the cash-strapped country from the Gulf and other nations, according to a media report. The decision was taken to support the Special Investment Facilitation Council ( SIFC ), the top civil-military body created last year to bring investment into the country.According to The Express Tribune, the Cabinet relaxed the public procurement legal framework to hire foreign consultancy firms to strengthen the SIFC to prepare various projects before offering them to foreign investors.""The foreign consultancy firms will be hired for five years as a replacement for Pakistani bureaucrats who are found lacking in project planning and execution, according to government sources,"" the paper reported.However, the decision will reflect poorly on the working of the bureaucracy, which could not provide quality assistance to the SIFC.The Cabinet has approved a summary through circulation on the advice of the SIFC, which recommended granting exemption due to the poor capacity of Pakistan's federal bureaucracy, confirmed a senior government official on Saturday.In case of circulation, the summary is approved without discussion in the regular cabinet meeting.The sources said that due to an incapacitated bureaucracy, Pakistan was struggling to prepare projects for investment by Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Kuwait.The development came a week after Pakistan offered highly lucrative returns to Saudi Arabia for getting a USD 5 billion investment.The government was jubilant over its presentation to the Saudi delegation, which appreciated Islamabad's preparedness compared to the past.However, the bureaucracy is not trained in certain skills and compared to the Pakistani delegation the Saudi Arabian delegation was far better prepared.One of the reasons for the lack of effective and efficient bureaucracy is that generalists are appointed as the secretaries of the economic ministries.These bureaucrats, mostly Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) officers, get expertise on the job and then they are moved to any other ministry.A federal secretary can at any time be appointed as secretary of finance, secretary of power, secretary of planning, secretary of the board of investment and secretary of petroleum without a requisite set of expertise.","The decision was taken to support the Special Investment Facilitation Council ( SIFC ), the top civil-military body created last year to bring investment into the country.

MANILA: South and Southeast Asia braced for more extreme heat on Sunday as authorities across the region issued health warnings and residents fled to parks and air-conditioned malls for relief.A wave of exceptionally hot weather has blasted the region over the past week, sending the mercury as high as 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) and forcing thousands of schools to tell students to stay home.The Philippines announced on Sunday the suspension of in-person classes at all public schools for two days after a record-shattering day of heat in the capital Manila.In Thailand, where at least 30 people have died of heatstroke so far this year, the meteorological department warned of ""severe conditions"" after temperatures in a northern province exceeded 44.1C (111.4F) on Saturday.And in Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam, India and Bangladesh, forecasters warned that temperatures could exceed 40C in the coming days as people endured searing heat and stifling humidity.""I dare not go out in the daytime. I am worried we would get heatstroke,"" said a 39-year-old cashier in Myanmar's Yangon who gave her name as San Yin.She said she has been going to a park with her husband and four-year-old son at night to escape the heat of their fourth-floor apartment.""This is the only spot we can stay to avoid the heat in our neighbourhood,"" she said.Global temperatures hit record highs last year, and the United Nations weather and climate agency said Tuesday that Asia was warming at a particularly rapid pace.Extensive scientific research has found climate change is causing heat waves to become longer, more frequent and more intense.Myanmar has recorded temperatures that are 3-4C higher than the April average, its weather monitor said last week.And on Sunday, the national forecaster predicted temperatures in the central city of Mandalay could rise to 43C.The ministry of water and meteorology in Cambodia warned that temperatures could also hit 43C in some parts of the country in the week ahead, while the health ministry advised people to monitor their health ""during hot weather related to climate change"".Temperatures in Vietnam were also forecast to remain high during a five-day national holiday, with forecasts as high as 41C in the north.Forecasters there said it would remain intensely hot until the end of April, with cooler conditions expected in May.India's weather department said Saturday that severe heatwave conditions would continue through the weekend in several states, with temperatures soaring to 44C in some locations.""I have never experienced this heat before,"" Ananth Nadiger, a 37-year-old advertising professional, told AFP from Bengaluru.""It's very unpleasant and it takes the energy out of you.""The world's biggest democracy is in the middle of a six-week general election that saw millions of voters queue up in searing temperatures on Friday.India's election commission said it had formed a task force to review the impact of heatwaves and humidity before each round of voting.And in Bangladesh, millions of students returned to schools that had been closed due to extreme temperatures, even though its weather bureau said Sunday the heatwave would continue for at least the next three days.""I went to the school with my 13-year-old daughter. She was happy her school was open. But I was tense,"" said Lucky Begum, whose daughter is enrolled at a state-run school in Dhaka.""The heat is too much,"" she told AFP. ""She already got heat rashes from sweating. I hope she does not get sick.""The suspension of in-person classes in the Philippines came after Manila witnessed its highest temperature ever recorded, with jeepney drivers also planning a nationwide strike on Monday and Tuesday.The temperature in the capital hit a record 38.8C (101.8F) on Saturday, with the heat index reaching 45C, data from the state weather forecaster showed.The heat index measures what a temperature feels like, taking into account humidity.Many schools in the Philippines have no air-conditioning, leaving students to swelter in crowded, poorly ventilated classrooms.The hot weather persisted on Sunday, with many flocking to air-conditioned shopping malls and swimming pools for relief.""This is the hottest I've ever experienced here,"" said Nancy Bautista, 65, whose resort in Cavite province near Manila was fully booked.""Many of our guests are friends and families. They swim in the pool to fight the heat.""March, April and May are typically the hottest and driest months of the year in the region but this year's conditions have been exacerbated by the El Nino weather phenomenon.""All places in the country, not necessarily just Metro Manila, are expected to have hotter temperatures until the second week of May,"" Glaiza Escullar of the state weather forecaster told AFP.Camiling municipality in Tarlac province, north of Manila, recorded a temperature of 40.3C (104.5F) on Saturday -- the highest in the Philippines this year.As the mercury rose, Gerise Reyes, 31, planned to take her two-year-old daughter to a shopping mall near Manila.""It's hot here at home. This is the hottest I've ever experienced, especially between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm,"" she said.""We need a free aircon to cut our electricity bill.""","South and Southeast Asia braced for more extreme heat on Sunday as authorities issue health warnings.

To address the basic needs of the Afghan population, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has requested a budget of USD 3.6 billion, according to Khaama Press.Last month also, the WFP had raised concerns about a significant increase in malnutrition cases, especially among women and children stating that 1.2 million women were reportedly dealing with malnutrition.According to reports from the World Food Programme, a concerning 1.2 million women are currently facing malnutrition throughout the nation. The organization highlights the worsening malnutrition crisis among children in Afghanistan through a touching video on social media.Earlier this month, the UNHCR has described the situation of human rights, specifically focusing on the rights of women and girls, as well as religious and ethnic minorities in Afghanistan, as very ""grave"" and pushed for immediate requirement for humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people to stay alive.Compounding the humanitarian crisis, reports have emerged of forced deportations of Afghan refugees from neighboring countries, including Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey. Upon their return, these refugees encounter numerous challenges, such as a lack of access to essential resources like clean water, shelter, employment opportunities, and healthcare.The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan has significantly deteriorated since August 2021.Many individuals are worried about the limitations on freedoms and human rights violations, particularly towards women, as the Taliban takes back control.The Taliban's policies, which include forbidding women from entering the workforce and from attending school, have exacerbated the already severe humanitarian situations in the nation. As a result of their exclusion from public life, these women's well-being and the general stability of Afghan society have been greatly affected.The United Nations labelled the country as a ""graveyard of girls' hopes"", as per a TOLOnews report.Another contributing factor the humanitarian problem in Afghanistan is said to be the ineffective strategies of the current government in addressing the well-being of the Afghan population.(With inputs from agencies)","The World Food Programme has been providing food and cash assistance to six million people in Afghanistan every month.

BANGKOK: Stretching their fingertips to the reddening sky, hundreds of yoga devotees rolled out their mats on the runway of Bangkok 's main airport Saturday, practising their downward dog as early morning flights rumbled overhead.The unusual event on the airport's third runway -- which is still under construction -- saw the workout paired with beverages as participants were offered coconuts, iced teas and water to incorporate into their routines.Some 500 yoga-goers and camera-ready influencers began arriving at 5:00 am, making their way in the dark to their mats on the runaway.As the sun rose, yoga instructors guided the group through two workouts, cheerily enthusiastic despite the pollution, industrial setting, and occasional flight roar.""Today is going to be very special,"" an instructor blared, before urging participants to ""put your coconut in the air!""""Feel like a beautiful bird,"" she said, as a plane rumbled along the concrete and lifted into the air behind the participants.While many present were influencers -- and perhaps more focused on getting the perfect shot than the perfect lunge -- most seemed to have come for a laugh.""This was something fun, this was a nice event,"" said lawyer Rugeradh Tungsupakul, attending with a friend.""Right now, because of our jobs, we are too busy to go to a yoga studio,"" she told AFP.Although Rugeradh was worried about pollution -- a perennial issue in smoggy Bangkok, which regularly ranks among the world's most polluted cities -- she said they had checked the air quality before arriving.""Right now, it's not too bad,"" she explained.Although there were a few men scattered in the crowd, the workout was dominated by women.Most were clad in the ubiquitous yoga uniform of black leggings and cropped white t-shirts -- in this instance emblazoned with the word ""BREW"" for Brew Yoga which organized the event.""This is a very special event for me,"" said instructor Pavadee Komchokpaisan, 30, adding it was the first time yoga had been done on the runway.""We have so many people come here to just join the yoga class, and take a picture on a runway,"" she told AFP, praising Bangkok's yoga community.One of those receiving instruction was Precious, who has lived in Bangkok for the past four years, and said she was invited thanks to her Instagram-famous cat Ernest.""He's been to Switzerland, Botswana, South Africa, so obviously this seemed kind of appropriate,"" she told AFP.She figured she was unlikely to ever be asked to do yoga on an airport runway again.""Why not?!"" she asked.","Hundreds of yoga devotees do yoga on runway of Bangkok's main airport.

NEW DELHI: Sri Lanka will transfer the management of its $209 million Chinese-built airport to two Indian and Russian companies, as stated by a cabinet statement on Friday, in an effort to decrease losses from its state enterprises. Since its inauguration in 2013, Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, which was financed by China EXIM Bank, has been a subject of controversy because of its low flight numbers, environmentally sensitive location, and ongoing financial losses.The management of the airport will be transferred to Shaurya Aeronautics (Private) Limited from India and Airports of Regions Management Company from Russia for a period of 30 years as per a statement from the cabinet, without disclosing the value of the deal.Sri Lanka is in discussions with China EXIM Bank to reorganize the airport loan, which is a portion of the $4.2 billion borrowed for various infrastructure projects. The airport was constructed while former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was in office, and he aligned the country more closely with China.","Sri Lanka will transfer the management of its $209 million Chinese-built airport to two Indian and Russian companies.

AstraZeneca in court papers says Covid vaccine can have rare side effect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/astrazeneca-in-court-papers-says-covid-vaccine-can-have-rare-side-effect/articleshow/109703906.cms,"LONDON: AstraZeneca has said in court documents that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare side effect , the UK’s Daily Telegraph newspaper reported.The statement by the pharmaceutical giant comes as it is being sued for over £100 million (a little over Rs 1,000 crore) in class action over claims its vaccine caused death and serious injury in 51 cases, according to court documents seen by the Daily Telegraph.AstraZeneca is contesting the claims but has accepted, in a legal document submitted to the high court in February, that its Covid vaccine “can, in very rare cases, cause thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome”, which causes people to have blood clots and a low blood platelet count.In India, the vaccine was sold under the brand name Covishield manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune. When contacted, SII declined comment.One of the claimants is Jamie Scott, a father of two, who was left with a permanent brain injury after developing a blood clot and a bleed on the brain that prevented him from working after he received the AstraZeneca vaccine in April 2021.The product information relating to the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine was updated in April 2021, with the approval of the UK regulator MHRA, to include the possibility that the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is capable, in very rare cases, of being a trigger for thrombosis withthrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).AstraZeneca points out this update was well documented and publicly available, the UK newspaper reported.The vaccine, developed with Oxford University, is no longer used in UK.Lawyers representing families suing the drugs company argue that the vaccine was not as safe as individuals were entitled to expect. They are suing the firm under the Consumer Protection Act of 1987, arguing the maximum £12,000 (more than Rs 12 lakh) payout they could get from the UK-govt-run vaccine compensation scheme is inadequate.Figures obtained by the Daily Telegraph under a Freedom of Information request show that out of 163 payouts made by the UK govt scheme by Feb this year, at least 158 went to those who had taken the AstraZeneca jab.An AstraZeneca spokesperson told TOI: “From the body of evidence in clinical trials and real-world data, the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine has continuously been shown to have an acceptable safety profile and regulators around the world consistently state that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extremely rare potential side effects.”","AstraZeneca has said in court documents that its Covid vaccine can cause a rare side effect.
