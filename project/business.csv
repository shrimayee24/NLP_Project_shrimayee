NEW DELHI: Govt officials told an all-party meeting Thursday that they did not expect terrorists to strike Pahalgam since there was no precedent, and added that the failure to anticipate the deviation from the pattern on Tuesday was a “lapse”.“IB (Intelligence Bureau) and home ministry officials briefed floor leaders about the incident...” parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told reporters after the meeting. “The opposition has given full support to govt to take any action,” leader of opposition in LS Rahul Gandhi said.Terrorists had never attacked tourists visiting Pahalgam and Anantnag, as it has a direct bearing on livelihoods. The attack was unexpected. We were not anticipating it,” sources quoted the officials as telling representatives of political parties. Representatives of opposition parties, including Rahul Gandhi, raised the issue of alleged security lapse at the meeting.Defence minister Rajnath Singh , home minister Amit Shah, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and external affairs minister SJaishankar were also present.Rijiju said all parties agreed that India should fight against terrorism unitedly, and backed measures the govt has taken against Pakistan, including those it might resort to in the future.“India has taken strong action against terrorism in the past and will continue to do so. This has been discussed in all-party meeting on behalf of govt. All parties said that they are with govt in this fight against terrorism. The meeting ended on a positive note,” he said.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge raised the absence of PM Narendra Modi, who had gone to Bihar, and said ideally, he should have chaired the meeting.The defence minister briefed participants about the attack and the decisions taken by the Cabinet Committee on Security. “This incident is very sad, due to which everyone in the country is worried. Keeping this in mind, the Indian govt has also expressed its intention to take more stringent action today,” Rijiju quoted Singh as telling the meeting. Singh also outlined govt’s “zero tolerance” policy against terrorism.Shah and Jaishankar called on President Droupadi Murmu and they are said to have briefed her about the emerging situation.","Terrorists had never attacked tourists visiting Pahalgam and Anantnag, sources quoted officials as telling representatives of political parties.

NEW DELHI: Indian Navy 's guided missile destroyer INS Surat on Thursday completed a successful test of a medium-range surface-to-air missile with an approximate range of 70 km. Meanwhile, Indian Air Force (IAF) executed ' Exercise Aakraman ', a comprehensive operational drill across the central sector, featuring its premier fighter aircraft, including the Rafale jets.The timing of IAF and navy drills is significant as it comes two days after a deadly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam that claimed the lives of 26 people.Following the incident, there has been an increase in tensions between India and Pakistan with the former suspending the Indus treaty. Pakistan responded with retaliatory measures by susending the 1972 Simla Agreement.""The Indian Navy's latest indigenous guided missile destroyer INS Surat has successfully carried out a precision cooperative engagement of a sea-skimming target, marking a significant milestone in strengthening the Navy's defence capabilities ,"" the Navy said. ""This achievement demonstrates India's growing prowess in indigenous warship design, development, and operations, and underscores the nation's commitment to self-reliance in defence manufacturing,"" it said.The Navy indicated that this achievement reflects its dedication to protecting national maritime interests whilst supporting Aatmanirbhar Bharat.IAF's 'Exercise Aakraman' included a comprehensive operational drill across the central sector, featuring its premier fighter aircraft, including the Rafale jets.The exercise incorporated intensive ground strike operations practice across varied terrain, including plains and mountainous areas. The IAF's capabilities have been enhanced with modern armaments including meteor air-to-air missiles and advanced strike systems like Rampage and Rocks, strengthening its regional military position.The IAF maintains two Rafale squadrons based at Ambala, Haryana and Hashimara, West Bengal. These advanced aircraft are central to the current exercise, which emphasises sophisticated mission scenarios.Earlier during the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that 'India will identify, track, and punish every terrorist and their backers' and will 'pursue them to the ends of the Earth' to punish them 'beyond their imagination.'","Indian Navy completed a successful test of a medium-range surface-to-air missile with an approximate range of 70 km.

"Pak says diverting Indus water 'act of war', suspends Simla pact",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pak-says-diverting-indus-water-act-of-war-suspends-simla-pact/articleshow/120600607.cms,"Unilateral, unjust & motivated: Pak on India's moves



ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: Pakistan unleashed a barrage of counter-retaliatory measures against India Thursday, declaring any move to disrupt water flows under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) an act of war, suspending the 1972 Simla Agreement , and severing all trade, travel and diplomatic ties - including closure of airspace for Indian flights.Pakistan said it will respond to any attempt to divert water with ""full force across the complete spectrum of national power"".This is serious escalation coming from a country that has long maintained red lines about use of its nuclear arsenal, one of which has been the economic strangling of Pakistan. The chief of the strategic plans division of Pakistan army had in 2002 told a European agency that economic strangling included a naval blockade and ""the stopping of the waters of the Indus river"". While there was no official response from Indian authorities to Pakistan's threat, government sources said Pakistan should first unleash ""full force"" against cross-border terrorism .Pakistan maintains the IWT co-signed by the World Bank doesn't allow either country to unilaterally suspend the agreement. As the lower riparian state, Pakistan has concerns about the flow of water from the river system in India but its threat to use full force is likely to exacerbate the already tense situation between the nuclear-armed neighbours.The drastic steps, announced after an emergency National Security Committee (NSC) meeting chaired by Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, are in response to India's actions following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam. NSC declared India's IWT suspension ""illegal,"" emphasising the 1960 treaty's inviolability as a World Bank-brokered pact governing six Indus Basin rivers critical for Pakistan's 240 million people. ""Any attempt to stop or divert water flows will be an act of war,"" NSC warned, signalling zero tolerance for disruptions to Pakistan's agricultural lifeline.India, attributing the Pahalgam attack to Pakistan-based terror group The Resistance Front, a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy, suspended the IWT, closed the Wagah-Attari border, revoked Saarc visa exemptions for Pakistanis, expelled Pakistani military advisers, and slashed Pakistan's High Commission staff in New Delhi to 30. Pakistan, denying involvement and condemning the attack, mirrored and escalated these measures, framing India's moves as ""unilateral, unjust and politically motivated.""Pakistan closed the Wagah border to all Indian transit, effective immediately, with an April 30 deadline for valid crossings, mirroring India's Attari-Wagah closure. All trade with India, including via third countries, was suspended, devastating cross-border commerce.Airspace was barred to Indian-owned or operated airlines. Saarc visa exemptions for Indians were revoked, except for Sikh pilgrims, with Indian nationals given 48 hours to leave. Indian defence advisers were declared persona non grata, ordered out by April 30, and their posts annulled. The Indian High Commission in Islamabad was capped at 30 staff, matching India's restrictions.The IWT's suspension is the crisis's most alarming flashpoint. Resilient through three wars, the treaty ensures equitable water sharing, with India controlling three eastern rivers and Pakistan the western three. India's move, experts say, risks catastrophic consequences for Pakistan's agriculture-dependent economy. Pakistan's ""act of war"" rhetoric, while partly posturing, reflects the issue's existential stakes.The collapse of the Simla Agreement and diplomatic channels heightens LoC tensions, where skirmishes could spiral without communication. Mutual airspace and trade bans exacerbate economic strain, particularly for traders reliant on Wagah. The crisis also undermines regional cooperation, with Saarc's already fragile framework further eroded by visa restrictions.","Pakistan declares any move to disrupt water flows under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) is an act of war.

Massive anti-Naxal op targets 'core' stronghold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/massive-anti-naxal-op-targets-core-stronghold/articleshow/120600281.cms,"In a first, IAF choppers deployed to airdrop forces deep into forested areas

NEW DELHI: In what could be a decisive battle against Left-wing extremism ahead of the March 2026 deadline to eliminate the scourge, nearly 5,000 security personnel are closing in on the 'core' area of CPI (Maoist) spanning the tri-junction of Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Maharashtra, having ""surrounded"" 300 Naxalites, including top leaders belonging to the dreaded People's Liberation Guerrilla Army and Battalion No. 1.Sources in Chhattisgarh govt said the ""largest ever"" anti-Naxal operation along the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border has been on since Wednesday, with five Naxalites killed so far, three bodies recovered, and several Naxal hideouts busted.The ""decisive"" joint operation is being undertaken by multiple elite units.These include CRPF and its elite CoBRA battalion, Chhattisgarh's District Reserve Guard (DRG), Special Task Force (STF), Bastar Fighters, Maharashtra's C-60 Commandos, and Andhra Pradesh's Greyhounds, based on intelligence inputs pointing to the presence of several top commanders - including Hidma, responsible for several big Naxal attacks in the Abujmarh region; Deva; and Damodar - in the area along with over 150 hardcore Naxals from the PLGA and Battalion No. 1. Senior officers, including CRPF DG G P Singh, are at the site to oversee the operation.For the first time, Indian Air Force helicopters have been deployed to strategically air-drop forces deep into forested areas, marking a significant shift in counter-insurgency tactics. ""The primary objective is to capture or neutralise top Naxal functionaries such as Hidma, responsible for several deadly Maoist attacks in Abujmarh rgion; Deva, and Damodar,"" said a senior police officer.Hidma is regarded as the mastermind behind Naxal operations in South Bastar and is wanted for multiple deadly attacks. Deva, another senior commander, is also a key figure in Naxal hierarchy. Reports suggest Damodar and other top insurgents may also be present in the region. Capturing or eliminating these leaders is seen as crucial to dismantling the Naxal command structure.A CRPF source said the joint operation to crush the last Maoist bastion is carefully timed ahead of start of monsoon season, when the deep forests usually become inaccessible. ""This will ensure Maoists are eliminated well within the March 2026 deadline,"" said an officer.The joint operation focuses on freeing the dense forest regions of Venkatapuram mandal's Veerabhadram, Tadapala, Nichhenna, Wajedu mandal, and Morumuru from the hold of Naxals. Thanks to sustained counter-Naxal operations over the past few years, forces like CRPF, in coordination with the state police concerned, have been moving deeper into what were once 'core' Naxal areas and setting up forward operating bases.The officer shared that over 5,000 security personnel are involved in the extensive operation, ""which has reportedly surrounded over 300 Naxalites"". Intermittent exchange of fire continues, and forces are working on encircling the remaining Left-wing extremists. ""Intelligence suggests that senior Naxal commanders from Battalion No. 1 have been surrounded, raising hopes of major breakthroughs,"" said a senior officer of the Chhattisgarh police.Security forces have cordoned off the entire area and are advancing deeper into the jungle to exert pressure on Naxals, said an officer.","Nearly 5,000 security personnel are closing in on the 'core' area of CPI (Maoist) spanning the tri-junction of Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Maharashtra.

JAISALMER: Radha Bheel, a 27-year-old Pakistani national living near Jaisalmer, is faced with the prospect of being separated from her toddler son just days after their emotional reunion. And the cause of her despair is India's decision to revoke Pakistani visas with immediate effect in response to the Pahalgam terror attack, with all Pakistani nationals ordered to return to their country by April 27.Radha's plight is shared by many Pakistani Hindu families in Rajasthan who are on short term visas (STVs). In Jaisalmer alone, a pall of gloom has descended over 1,200 Pakistani citizens on STVs.As for those on long term visas (LTVs), ASP (CID) Narpat Singh, who's also the Foreign Regional Registration Officer (FRRO), said his office is awaiting orders from home ministry and assured that long-term visa holders need not be concerned for now.Radha, her husband Raju Ram (30), and their two daughters, aged 8 and 7, arrived in India on an LTV in Feb 2023. However, the couple's son, Ghanshyam, who was then less than two months old, was denied a visa, as were Raju Ram's parents. It took two years for Ghanshyam and his grandparents to finally arrive in India on an STV on April 6.""I waited for two years to hold my baby but will have to bear parting with him once again,"" she told TOI, tears streaming down her face.In Jaisalmer, Dilip Singh Sodha, a refugee who fled Pakistan to escape religious persecution, said, ""You may as well shoot us here.

Kash Patel under scrutiny for taking FBI jets to NHL games



Is the FBI's air travel policy overdue for an update?



Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel has come under scrutiny for his frequent use of government planes for travel that seems to mix official business with personal interests—such as high-profile sporting events and excursions to his girlfriend's hometown. Since becoming FBI Director on February 21, Patel, 45, has accumulated a travel schedule that includes Nashville and Long Island, raising questions about the intersection of professional duty and personal convenience.Kashyap Pramod ""Kash"" Patel made at least three round-trip flights from Washington to Nashville, Tennessee, on Department of Justice-owned Gulfstream jets, The New York Times reported. Nashville is home to 26-year-old country singer Alexis Wilkins, Kash Patel's reported girlfriend. He also flew to Long Island on a DOJ Boeing 757 on April 6—to watch Washington Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin score NHL history.While it's true that FBI directors must travel on government planes because of secure communication requirements, the timing and nature of several of Kash Patel's trips are raising questions as to whether tax dollars are being spent wisely. While Patel did meet with local FBI personnel, Tennessee legislators, and law enforcement officials during the trip, the reason for the other two trips is unknown.Meanwhile, flight logs show a DOJ-owned 757 flying to New York on the same day that Alex Ovechkin broke Wayne Gretzky’s all-time goal-scoring record on April 6—just two days after tying the record in Washington, D.C., another game Patel reportedly attended. Both events were high-profile NHL matchups, and while there’s no confirmation that Patel’s presence was for official reasons, the correlation has sparked concerns.Government employees who use federal planes are expected to pay the government back at the rate of a commercial ticket, which is much lower than flying in a private plane. Critics say this difference opens up a loophole that enables a level of luxury travel at little personal cost.Kash Patel has stood out from his predecessors at the FBI by being bold and visible as a public figure. He has proactively shared news of FBI operations and victories, breaking from the historically behind-the-scenes tradition of his predecessors. From tactical vest photo opportunities to social media cameos, Patel has gone full-on public.Patel has been the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation since 2025. From February to April 2025, he also held the position of acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. After graduating from Pace University School of Law, Patel attended the University of Richmond to study history and criminal justice. Patel is the first individual of Indian heritage to hold the position of director at the FBI.Although Patel is not necessarily in breach of the current travel policy, the perception of his travels and the blurring of personal pleasure and official obligation will lead to additional examination of executive travel procedures. The FBI has just solicited proposals for a second jet to assist ‘required-use executive travel’, indicating present demand outstrips fleet size.Also read: 2025 NHL Playoffs: Winnipeg Jets ticket guide, full schedule, and key matchups for Stanley Cup run With Kash Patel still redefining the FBI Director position with his high-profile style and ambitious foreign travel schedule, there is growing pressure to be more open about how government resources are being expended—particularly in an era of heightened public concern regarding ethical governance.","FBI Director Kash Patel has come under scrutiny for his frequent use of government planes for travel that seems to mix official business with personal interests.

Is it targeting H-1Bs amid crackdown on immigrants?



In a fresh trouble for H-1B applicants, federal immigrant authorities are asking for home addresses and biometrics for H-1B and employment-based immigrant petitions, which immigrant lawyers think is highly unusual, as biometrics are not generally required. Immigrant authorities are issuing Requests for Evidence (RFE) for this data.A Request for Evidence is a formal notice issued by the USCIS when additional documents are required for evaluating a petition. It can not be seen as a denial but a standard part of the process if there is any gap in the applications. According to USCIS guidelines, an RFE should clearly outline which eligibility criteria have not been met, explain why existing materials are insufficient, and suggest what additional evidence could help meet the requirements.These requests are quite common if there is a missing documentation, inconsistencies in project details or a lack of supporting evidence.Immigration law firm Goel & Anderson's Vic Goel told Forbes this is highly unusual because biometrics are not typically required for these case types.""The RFEs also fail to explain the nature of the adverse information, leaving employers and attorneys in the dark. It appears that DHS [Department of Homeland Security] may be using AI tools to flag individuals based on undisclosed data, possibly from social media or other government databases.""""We have encountered potentially adverse information related to the beneficiary. To continue processing your application or petition, we required an updated address for the beneficiary so that we may collect biometric data,"" a USCIS adjudicator wrote in a Request for Evidence, according to Forbes.The ""adverse information"" part goes along with the crackdown on immigrants by the Trump administration. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently said making America safe means revoking visas when threats arise. ""US visa holders should know in no uncertain terms that the US government’s rigorous security vetting does not end once a visa is granted,"" Rubio said.","USCIS is seeking home address and biometrics as additional data from H-1B applicants, if there is any 'adverse information' about the applicant.

Bill Gates $16 million gift to his daughter that went against Melinda Gates' middle class upbringing for kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-16-million-gift-to-his-daughter-that-went-against-melinda-gates-middle-class-upbringing-for-kids/articleshow/120573825.cms,"In a stunning display of parental generosity, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates reportedly purchased a $15.82 million horse farm in North Salem, Westchester, for his daughter Jennifer Gates as a graduation gift. The lavish 124-acre estate, complete with top-tier equestrian facilities, was acquired in 2018 following Jennifer’s graduation from Stanford University , according to the New York Post and The Journal News.The off-market deal, brokered by Muffin Dowdle of Ginnel Real Estate, was finalized through Robert Buote, trustee of Wellington Trust—a vehicle previously used for Gates family property purchases in Florida. The estate, formerly owned by Duncan Dayton, a real estate developer and heir to the Dayton-Hudson Corporation (now Target), boasts sprawling grounds and a rich history tied to one of America’s retail dynasties.Jennifer, who moved to New York to pursue further studies at New York University, is an avid equestrian with ambitions in competitive horse riding. The North Salem property is tailored to support her passion, featuring state-of-the-art stables and training facilities. This gift complements another significant purchase by Bill Gates: a $38 million equestrian estate in Wellington, Florida, a celebrity enclave frequented by the likes of Michael Bloomberg and Bruce Springsteen. The Florida property includes a luxurious home and expansive grounds ideal for equestrian pursuits.However, the extravagant gift has raised eyebrows, given Melinda Gates ’ public statements about raising their three children—Jennifer, Rory, and Phoebe—with modesty and financial discipline. In a 2024 interview with The New York Times, Melinda described their household as “very middle-class,” emphasizing that money was never a defining factor in their upbringing. “We absolutely did not just buy them things,” she said, noting that the Gates children received allowances but were taught to save and avoid excessive spending. Reflecting on her time at Duke University, Melinda added, “I vowed that if I ever had resources, those were not the kind of children I wanted to raise.”The North Salem purchase, while a grand gesture, underscores the Gates family’s support for Jennifer’s equestrian dreams. Yet, it contrasts with Melinda’s narrative of frugality, sparking discussion about the balance between wealth and values in one of the world’s most prominent families.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates reportedly purchased a $15.82 million horse farm in North Salem, Westchester, for his daughter Jennifer Gates as a graduation gift.

Pahalgam attack: What Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu said

The Pahalgam terror attack

The Phalagam attack: Measures taken by Indian government

Suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty: India has put the 1960 treaty in abeyance, signaling a strong diplomatic stance against Pakistan until it takes credible steps to curb cross-border terrorism. Closure of the Attari-Wagah Border: The integrated check post at the Attari-Wagah border has been shut down, halting cross-border movement. Those already in India with valid documents can return by May 1, 2025. Visa restrictions: The SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme for Pakistani nationals has been suspended. Previously issued visas under this scheme have been canceled, and Pakistani nationals in India under this scheme have been given 48 hours to leave2. Reduction in diplomatic ties: India has declared Pakistani military, naval, and air advisors in New Delhi as persona non grata, giving them a week to leave. Similarly, India will withdraw its own advisors from Islamabad, reducing the strength of both high commissions from 55 to 30. Heightened security measures: The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has directed security agencies to remain on high alert and take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents.

Following the tragic Pahalgam terror attack , which claimed 26 lives, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared poignant reflections on the legacy of Partition as a reminder of the stakes for India. Reacting to a viral post by entrepreneur Prakash Dadlani, Vembu highlighted the enduring trauma of displacement and communal violence, drawing parallels between historical events and present-day security challenges.Vembu’s remarks emphasised the importance of safeguarding India’s unity and resilience. “These terrorist attacks are a reminder of what is at stake for us,” he wrote, recalling stories from Sindhi Hindus, Bengali friends, and Kashmiri Pandits who experienced displacement and violence.“I have met many Sindhi Hindus living in the US who told me the same thing Prakash-ji says below about his family's experience of partition. I have heard the same thing from Bengali friends. We have the experience of Kashmiri pandits in living memory. All this should give us the resolve to make sure it never happens in our nation again. These terrorist attacks are a reminder of what is at stake for us,” Vembu posted on X.The Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, 2025, stands as one of the deadliest assaults in Jammu and Kashmir in recent years, claiming 28 lives and leaving over 20 injured. The tragedy unfolded in the serene Baisaran Valley, a popular tourist destination, where militants targeted visitors based on their faith, forcing them to recite religious verses before opening fire. The Resistance Front (TRF), a Lashkar-e-Taiba affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack, which has drawn widespread condemnation from global leaders and civil society. This horrific incident underscores the ongoing security challenges in the region.In response to the tragic Pahalgam terror attack, the Indian government has taken decisive actions to address security concerns and hold those responsible accountable.

"Who Is Ndax, and Why has NHL partnered with “Crypto Giant” during Stanley Cup?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/who-is-ndax-and-why-has-nhl-partnered-with-crypto-giant-during-stanley-cup/articleshow/120588987.cms,"NHL teams up with Ndax for a crypto-powered playoffs (Image via: Getty Images)

Crypto and Hockey: An unlikely pairing?



The trust factor: Is Ndax ready for prime time?



Chasing the Gen Z audience or chasing the hype?



When the NHL announced its first-ever crypto partnership , naming Ndax the Official Crypto Trading Platform Partner during the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs , it left fans and critics alike wondering who exactly is Ndax, and why now?The partnership, while groundbreaking, has sparked a whirlwind of debate in the hockey community and beyond. Ndax, one of Canada’s largest crypto trading platforms, is stepping into the national spotlight at a time when crypto still polarizes public opinion. And the NHL, a legacy sports league rooted in tradition, is taking a bold leap into the volatile world of digital finance .Let’s be clear that this isn’t just a logo-on-the-ice kind of deal. The Ndax brand will be front and center during all Canadian broadcasts of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, embedded in camera-visible in-ice placements and the NHL’s digitally enhanced dasherboards. Beyond the optics, Ndax is launching ""Ndax ICE,"" a campaign offering fans a shot at crypto credits and tickets to the Stanley Cup Final. In short, the NHL is going all-in on this partnership. But should they be?Unlike household names like Coinbase or Kraken, Ndax is relatively unknown to the average sports fan. Founded in Calgary, Ndax (short for National Digital Asset Exchange ) has quietly grown into a regulatory-compliant, high-volume exchange with $17.5 billion in lifetime trading and $1 billion in assets under custody. Yet, critics argue that visibility doesn’t equal credibility, especially when dealing with an industry still recovering from high-profile collapses like FTX.For the NHL, a league that prides itself on its heritage and integrity, this move feels both ambitious and risky. Crypto, while promising innovation and financial freedom, remains a contentious space filled with regulatory gray areas, price volatility, and consumer skepticism. Is this a forward-thinking leap into the future or a gamble during the most prestigious event in hockey?From the league’s perspective, the move may be a calculated play to connect with younger, digitally-savvy fans. Crypto aligns with the fast-paced, tech-centric world that Gen Z and Millennials inhabit. But critics warn that this strategy might alienate traditional fans who view crypto as speculative, unstable, or even predatory.The NHL’s partnership with Ndax could be a game-changing alliance or a cautionary tale in the making. It’s a bold, polarizing move that positions hockey at the crossroads of tradition and tech disruption. Whether fans embrace it or push back, one thing is certain: the league’s playoff spotlight just got a lot more controversial.Also Read: Chris Drury’s new contract- Did Rangers play it smart or stuck in gamble they might regret? As the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs get underway, will the NHL make a visionary move by aligning itself with the fast-growing world of crypto, or is it stepping into risky territory at the worst possible time? With Ndax now etched into the ice and beamed onto screens across Canada, fans are left to wonder whether this partnership is a bold step toward the future or the kind of gamble that could leave the league out in the cold.","Ndax is one of Canada’s largest crypto trading platforms.

San Francisco Moves Toward Recovery First Drug Policy Amid Heated Debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/san-francisco-inches-closer-to-adopting-drug-policy-with-abstinence-as-its-primary-goal/articleshow/120604315.cms,"FILE - Supervisor Matt Dorsey is shown during a San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting in San Francisco, Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2024. (Credits: AP)

SAN FRANCISCO: Reeling from drug overdose deaths and scenes of people smoking fentanyl on sidewalks, San Francisco moved closer Thursday to adopting a ""recovery first"" drug policy that sets abstinence from illicit drugs as its primary goal, a proposal that has prompted heated debate in the city that pioneered harm reduction.Opponents of Supervisor Matt Dorsey's proposal say its emphasis on stopping drug use alienates those who are not ready to quit, while proponents say the city has been far too permissive and making drug use safer does not help break the cycle of addiction.Dorsey, himself recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, amended the proposal in his public safety committee to clarify that distributing safer-use paraphernalia and linking people to social services regardless of whether they are using remain critical to the city's response.But more than an hour of public comment with cheers and boos from both sides underscored just how touchy the issue remains.""No one dies from harm reduction,"" Patt Denning said. ""People die from conventional abstinence-based treatments because they're either left out or kicked out if they don't comply with abstinence.""Brendan Harris, who said he has been clean for six years, countered that harm reduction tactics cannot go on forever and people need a firm if compassionate push into treatment.""We can't just keep enabling drugs over and over again,"" he said.In recent years San Francisco's public health department advised people who use drugs to do so with friends to try to prevent overdose deaths. Critics said that sent the wrong message.Mayor Daniel Lurie, who took office in January, has vowed to solve the city's fentanyl crisis . Last year more than 600 people died from accidental overdoses.He ordered city-funded nonprofits to offer treatment or counseling options before giving out certain paraphernalia such as foil and pipes, and they will no longer be allowed to distribute those items in parks and on sidewalks.As amended, Dorsey's proposal states that the ""long-term remission of substance use disorders for individuals, with the help of fully supported and staffed evidence-based recovery and behavioral health services, shall be the primary goal.""It also defines recovery as ""the process by which an individual suffering from substance use disorder strives to make positive changes that become part of a voluntarily adopted healthy lifestyle.""Dorsey said aspiring to live a healthy life free from illicit drug use should not be a controversial goal, and abstention can mean receiving methadone as part of a medication assisted treatment program. San Francisco offers an array of services to help people addicted to drugs, but many residents only see the free foil and pipes, he said.""We're losing the battle on harm reduction when people think that's all we're doing,"" he said after the hearing.The San Francisco Marin Medical Society, which represents more than 3,500 physicians, proposed the amendments.The full Board of Supervisors votes on the proposal next month. It is expected to pass, with seven of the 11 members sponsoring or cosponsoring.","San Francisco moves closer to adopting a ""recovery first"" drug policy that sets abstinence from illicit drugs as its primary goal.

Varanasi's new Cricket stadium to pay homage to Shiva,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/varanasis-new-cricket-stadium-to-pay-homage-to-shiva/articleshow/120604087.cms,"Soon in Varanasi: Cricket stadium with Shiva stamp

VARANASI: If Varanasi — founded, according to legend, by Lord Shiva himself — is the religious and spiritual capital of India with its 23,000 temples, 84 ghats and a culture steeped in aeons of tradition, it’s soon to get a shrine to the country’s ‘other’ big religion: cricket. And, what’s more, it’ll bear the stamp of Shiva when it’s completed in April next year.Promising to blend sport and faith, the ultra-modern, 30,000-seater Varanasi International Cricket Stadium is coming up at a cost of Rs 452 crore at Gajari village in Raja Talab tehsil, 22km from the storied ghats of the temple town.The stadium’s architecture includes a crescent-shaped canopy that represents the moon on Shiva’s head, a media centre in the shape of a pellet drum (‘damru’), trident-shaped floodlights, seating arrangement inspired by the steps of Kashi’s ghats, and an outer facade adorned with ‘bael patra’ motifs.“From its Shiva-inspired architecture to solar-powered design, the stadium represents the future of cricket venues in India — sustain-able, inclusive, and rooted in heritage,” said BCCI vice president Rajeev Shukla. PM Narendra Modi , the local MP, laid the foundation stone for the stadium in Sept 2023. Construction — L&T is building the stadium — is expected to be completed within the April 2026 deadline and the talk is that it could host a few IPL matches as early as next season.The main arena will have nine pitches — four of red soil, three black soil and a couple of mixed wickets. Different kinds of pitches is something of a novelty and has been previously adopted only by the Ekana Stadium and Narendra Modi Stadium. The stadium blocks will also have space for dormitories to house 100 trainees of a proposed academy.UPCA is also setting up solar panels, a water recycling system and an EV recharging facility at the stadium. “We are probably the first to install EV recharging stations,” an official said. The stadium also features a “high-end drainage system” with officials saying it should not take ground staff more than 30 minutes after a downpour to make the ground fit for play.","The 30,000-seater Varanasi International Cricket Stadium is coming up at a cost of Rs 452 crore at Gajari village in Raja Talab tehsil, 22km from the storied ghats of the temple town.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Harvard in talks to sell $ 1billion in private equity holdings amid President Donald Trump's threats: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-in-talks-to-sell-1billion-in-private-equity-holdings-amid-president-donald-trumps-threats-report/articleshow/120601205.cms,"Harvard University and Donald Trump

Harvard University 's endowment is currently negotiating the sale of private equity fund interests valued at approximately $1 billion, according to Bloomberg.The divestment initiative commenced last year, independent of Donald Trump's funding reduction threats, confirmed the anonymous source with direct knowledge of the situation.The institution's investment arm, Harvard Management Company , which oversees the nation's largest university endowment, has engaged Jefferies Financial Group to facilitate the sale to Lexington Partners , as initially reported by Bloomberg News.The proposed transaction details remain subject to finalisation and potential adjustments, the report indicates.Requests for comment from Jefferies and Lexington Partners remained unanswered.Investors are increasingly pursuing private credit divestments to secure liquidity amidst market instability resulting from Trump's reciprocal trade policies.Harvard's $53 billion endowment has a significant 40% allocation in private equity investments, as revealed in their annual report for the period ending June. The university, alongside other academic institutions, is experiencing challenges due to investment firms' struggles in divesting companies and returning capital to their limited partners.The situation has created liquidity constraints for endowments, pensions and family offices, compelling them to depend on their public market portfolios for immediate cash requirements or consider secondary market transactions.This development follows Harvard's recent announcement to secure $750 million in Wall Street financing as a precautionary measure.Trump has indicated potential federal funding cuts to universities regarding pro-Palestinian demonstrations against Israel's military actions in Gaza, alongside concerns about climate initiatives, transgender policies, and diversity programmes.University stakeholders, including students and faculty, have urged institutional leadership to maintain independence from administrative pressures.Yale University disclosed on Tuesday its intention to explore private equity fund sales, with Evercore providing advisory services.","Harvard's $53 billion endowment has a significant 40% allocation in private equity investments, as revealed in their annual report for the period ending June.

Musk’s Tesla gets lift as Trump cuts red tape on self-driving car rules to counter China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musks-tesla-gets-lift-as-trump-cuts-red-tape-on-self-driving-car-rules-to-counter-china/articleshow/120600066.cms,"AP file photo

The Trump administration is rolling back regulatory hurdles for self-driving cars to give US automakers , includint Tesla , a competitive edge in the global race for vehicle automation. The US department of transportation announced on Thursday that carmakers can now apply for exemptions from certain federal safety rules, provided the self-driving vehicles are used for research, demonstrations, or other non-commercial purposes.Transportation secretary Sean Duffy framed the decision as a strategic move. “We’re in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn’t be higher,” he said in a statement. “Our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard.” At present, the self-driving industry in the US is navigating a patchwork of state-level regulations, which has long been a concern for manufacturers.The new rule also addresses crash reporting, a topic Tesla CEO Elon Musk has openly criticised. Currently, Tesla is responsible for reporting a large number of self-driving crashes due to its leadership in partial automation. Musk had earlier called the system unfair and too burdensome. Under the revised policy, the federal government will keep crash reporting requirements in place but will remove what it calls ""unnecessary and duplicative"" processes.This policy shift came just a day after Musk told investors that Tesla's self-driving taxi service will begin operating in Austin this June. Although it's still unclear how the relaxed rules will directly benefit Tesla, the move signals a broader attempt by the Trump administration to support American tech firms amid increasing pressure from Chinese companies like BYD.Safety advocates had warned that the Trump administration might eliminate crash reporting altogether, but Thursday's announcement confirmed it will remain — though in a simpler form.","The US department of transportation announced on Thursday that carmakers can now apply for exemptions from certain federal safety rules.

LONDON: More than 110 wildfires have raged in the UK since the start of the year, according to satellite data released Monday, making it one of the worst years on record.At least 111 fires have torched an area of nearly 24,500 hectares (94 square miles) across the country since January 1, according to data Monday from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).The number of wildfires and area affected by them is higher than average for this time of the year, and higher than the same period in 2024.Only 2019 was worse in terms of the area burned (28,700 hectares) and 2022 for the number of fires (151) for the same period, according to the Press Association news agency.Last week, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said fire and rescue services had already responded to 380 wildfires so far this year in England and Wales -- more than double the same period in 2022.The EFFIS data is based on satellite readings and only maps fires that are 30 hectares or larger -- accounting for the difference with records from the local authority.In comparison, the NFCC measures wildfires with an area of at least one hectare.""A particularly dry March, followed by warmer-than-average temperatures in April, has seen a number of significant wildfires across the UK over the last fortnight,"" the NFCC said in a statement.The UK and Ireland had a ""drier than average"" March, according to Europe's Copernicus climate monitor. Last month was also the hottest March ever recorded in Europe by a significant margin.""With the increase in extreme weather events, we know that fire and rescue services are stretched as they seek to keep their communities safe,"" said NFCC chair Phil Garrigan.The Met Office said the fires are due to dry and breezy conditions in spring which came after a damp winter, meaning there was ""fuel"" for the blazes because of plant growth.Firefighters in Northern Ireland have been battling dozens of blazes in the last week, with many residents having to evacuate homes and a weather warning for wildfires.The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) said it attended 296 wildfires between April 3-10, many of which were thought to be started deliberately.An ""extreme"" wildfire warning was issued for Scotland on Friday and Saturday, after multiple blazes broke out the previous week.According to Michael Humphreys from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS), wetter weather last year meant fewer blazes in 2024.","More than 110 wildfires have raged in the UK since the start of the year.

'Misplaced and without jurisdiction': Arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari rejects ED's plea to declare him a 'fugitive',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/misplaced-and-without-jurisdiction-arms-dealer-sanjay-bhandari-rejects-eds-plea-to-declare-him-a-fugitive/articleshow/120454377.cms,"Sanjay Bhandari

Arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari has strongly opposed the Enforcement Directorate 's (ED) plea to declare him a ""fugitive"" in connection with a black money case , telling a Delhi court on April 19 that his stay in the United Kingdom was legal. This follows a ruling from the London high court that denied his extradition to India. Bhandari, who has been living in the UK since fleeing India in 2016, claimed that the ED’s application was ""vague, misplaced and without jurisdiction"" and did not meet the requirements under the Fugitive Offenders Act.In February, the high court of justice in London allowed Bhandari to appeal his extradition, citing concerns about his safety in Tihar jail. The court found that he would be at ""real risk"" of extortion, threats, and ""actual violence"" from other prisoners and officials in the Indian prison system. Furthermore, the court ruled that Bhandari’s extradition would violate his human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically Article 3, which relates to protection from inhuman or degrading treatment. Earlier this month, the UK High Court also dismissed the Indian government’s appeal to challenge the decision in Britain’s Supreme Court.Bhandari’s lawyer, senior advocate Maninder Singh, argued that his client’s presence in the UK could not be deemed illegal, as he had a legal right to reside there. Singh emphasised that the Indian government was bound by the UK court’s decision, and declaring Bhandari a ""fugitive"" in this context would be legally incorrect.Singh further pointed out that the ED’s application failed to provide an assessment by the income tax department regarding the value of the black money case. As per the Fugitive Offenders Act, a person can only be declared a fugitive if the value involved exceeds Rs 100 crore. Singh argued that the ED had misled the court by suggesting that the case exceeded this threshold, as the income tax department had previously submitted that the amount was below Rs 100 crore. Additionally, Bhandari was discharged from non-bailable warrants after the UK High Court’s ruling, and no fresh warrants were pending against him, Singh stated.This legal battle comes amid Bhandari’s involvement in other high-profile cases, including an ongoing money laundering probe linked to Robert Vadra, the brother-in-law of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Bhandari has also been mentioned in relation to the ongoing investigations into fugitive Mehul Choksi, who recently cited the same UK court ruling in his own extradition case.","Sanjay Bhandari has strongly opposed the Enforcement Directorate's plea to declare him a ""fugitive"" in connection with a black money case.

BERLIN: The German government forecast Thursday that the country's economy, Europe's biggest, will stagnate this year as US President Donald Trump's tariffs and trade threats weigh on its performance following months of political uncertainty.Outgoing Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the government cut its 2025 outlook to zero from the modest growth of 0.3% it predicted at the end of January. For next year, it is forecasting growth of 1%, slightly lower than the 1.1% it predicted three months ago.""There is above all one reason for this, namely Donald Trump's trade policy and the effects of the trade policy on Germany,"" Habeck told reporters in Berlin. He noted that Germany also hasn't had a government with a parliamentary majority to set policy since early November, and the new government isn't yet in place after an election in February.Germany hasn't seen significant economic growth in five years. The country for years expanded exports and dominated world trade in engineered products like industrial machinery and luxury cars.But it's suffered from increasing competition from Chinese companies, along with many other factors, and the economy contracted in each of the last two years.Trump's tariffs have added a further risk to German exports. Last year, the United States was Germany's biggest single trading partner for the first time since 2015, displacing China from the top spot as exports to the Asian power declined.The German parliament plans to meet on May 6 to elect Friedrich Merz as the country's next leader, if all the parties in his proposed government approve a coalition agreement reached earlier this month.Last month already, the prospective partners pushed plans through parliament to enable higher defence spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt and to set up a huge infrastructure fund that's aimed at boosting the economy.","Germany hasn't seen significant economic growth in five years.

UAE offers free-of-charge portable desalination plants to cover arid Cyprus' summer water needs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/uae-offers-free-of-charge-portable-desalination-plants-to-cover-arid-cyprus-summer-water-needs/articleshow/120574884.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)

Poll Do you support the UAE's decision to provide desalination plants to Cyprus free of charge? No, Cyprus should manage its own resources. Yes, it's a great gesture of support.

NICOSIA: Cyprus will receive free-of-charge portable desalination plants from the United Arab Emirates to cover the tourism-reliant island nation's water needs this summer as reservoir deposits are nearly depleted, officials said Thursday.Agriculture and environment minister Maria Panayiotou told the state broadcaster that the UAE agreed to provide Cyprus, at no cost, an undetermined number of desalination plants that will produce a combined 15,000 cubic meters (530,000 cubic feet) of potable water daily.Panayiotou didn't disclose exactly when the units will arrive and become operational, but she said UAE authorities are aware the need is immediate as the summer tourism season kicks into high gear and water needs reach their peak.She said the deal is the result of secret negotiations over the last few months to cover Cyprus water needs that became acute when a fire knocked out one of its five static desalination plants, resulting in cuts to agricultural water supply. Each onshore unit produces 235,000 cubic meters (8.3 million cubic feet) of fresh water daily.The plant won't be back in operation until August and the portable units from the UAE will cover that lost water capacity, said Panayiotou. Technical staff are still trying to work out exactly where the portable units will be placed to maximize their utility, Panayiotou said. She didn't say when those units will be returned to the UAE.Apart from its own desalination plants, Cyprus continues to rely on an extensive reservoir network with a total capacity of 330 million cubic meters. Water levels across the 108 reservoirs - the most relative to population than any other European country - are less than a quarter of their capacity following the second-driest winter in a decade. Reservoirs were at 47.2 per cent capacity in 2024, official figures show.Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides disclosed the UAE deal during an interview with local TV station ANT1, hailing the agreement as the result of Cyprus' expanded diplomatic outreach and the friendly relations it has developed particularly with the Emirates and other countries in the region.Panayiotou said irrespective of the UAE assistance, the government's medium- and long-term planning to permanently alleviate the island's water shortages is moving ahead.The planning includes the procurement of four additional mobile desalination plants expected to begin operating in late autumn, each capable of producing 30,000 cubic meters (1 million cubic feet) of drinkable water daily.Another two static desalination plants will be built over the long term, each with a 140,000 cubic meter (5 million cubic feet) daily output. Panayiotou unveiled last month a government plan to subsidize construction of private desalination plants at hotels. Tourism accounts for 13.5 per cent of Cyprus' gross domestic product. Tourist arrivals last year exceeded 4 million people, setting a new record.","UAE agreed to provide Cyprus, at no cost, an undetermined number of desalination plants.

BEIJING: China and Kenya agreed on Thursday to boost ties to a new level and oppose trade barriers, following talks between President Xi Jinping and his Kenyan counterpart William Ruto in Beijing.Relations between Beijing and Nairobi will be upgraded to a ""China-Kenya community with a shared future for the new era"", Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported after the two leaders met during Ruto's state visit.Africa is vital to China's Belt and Road overseas infrastructure project, launched in 2013, with Kenya as a key partner.China is the East African nation's biggest bilateral lender, with Nairobi receiving loans from Beijing to finance projects like a $5 billion railway connecting the capital with the port city of Mombasa.In a joint statement Thursday, the two countries pledged to reject ""hegemonism, power politics and all forms of unilateralism and protectionism"".They also said they oppose ""unilateral sanctions, decoupling, tariff barriers and technology blockade"", while expressing support for the World Trade Organization.Despite a ""turbulent international situation"", the countries will work together to build ""all-weather"" China-Africa relations, Xi told Ruto during their meeting.China is locked in an escalating tit-for-tat trade battle with the United States, triggered by President Donald Trump's levies on Chinese goods. The tariff blitz has rattled markets and raised fears of a global recession.On Thursday, Ruto hailed Kenya and China's ""strategic partnership"" for delivering ""practical, tangible, impactful and sustainable win-win situations"".The countries signed 20 documents, including agreements on science and technology, vocational education, water resources and the Belt and Road Initiative .While the BRI has provided countries like Kenya with much-needed infrastructure funding, critics say it has burdened governments with debt.In 2023, when Kenya owed Beijing more than $8 billion, Ruto asked China for a $1 billion loan and the restructuring of existing debt to complete stalled construction projects.The Kenyan president visited China in September for a gathering of African leaders, where Beijing pledged more than $50 billion in financing for Africa over three years, including $141 million in military assistance to the continent.Xi and Ruto on Thursday also agreed to enhance security exchanges with greater cooperation in personnel training, the defence industry, counterterrorism, and joint exercises and training.","China and Kenya agree to boost ties to a new level and oppose trade barriers.

China launches 3 astronauts to replace crew on Chinese space station,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-launches-3-astronauts-to-replace-crew-on-chinese-space-station/articleshow/120581168.cms,"Astronaut greeting before launch (AP)

JIUQUAN: China has launched three astronauts into space to replace the crew on the Chinese Tiangong space station , marking a further step in the country's ambitions for a crewed mission to the Moon and explore Mars.The Shenzhou 20 spaceship took off as planned atop China's workhorse Long March 2F rocket at 5:17 p.m. local time (0917 GMT). It will reach the Tiangong about 6.5 hours later.The rocket lifted off from the launch center in Jiuquan, on the edge of the Gobi Desert in northwestern China. The spaceship will remain in space before returning the current crew.The Tiangong, or ""Heavenly Palace,"" space station has made China a major contender in space, especially since it was entirely Chinese-built after the country was excluded from the International Space Station over US national security concerns. China's space program is controlled by the People's Liberation Army, the military branch of the ruling Communist Party.The addition of mechanical arms to the three-module station has also raised concerns from some that China could use them to disable satellites or other space vehicles during a crisis.Since first launching a man into space in 2003, becoming only the third country to do so, China's space program has advanced at a steady pace. The space agency has also landed an explorer on Mars and a rover on the less-explored far side of the Moon, and aims to put a person on the Moon before 2030.The Shenzhou, or ""Celestial Vessel,"" 20 mission will be commanded by Chen Dong, who is making his third flight. He will be accompanied by fighter pilot Chen Zhongrui and engineer Wang Jie, both making their maiden voyages, according to the China Manned Space Agency. Unlike previous crews, Shenzhou 20 is entirely male.They will replace three astronauts currently on the Chinese space station . Like those before them, they will stay on board for roughly six months.The space ship is due to be launched into space atop China's workhorse Long March 2F rocket at 5:17 p.m. local time (0917 GMT) and reach the Tiangong about 6.5 hours later.The three-person crew was sent in October last year and they have been in space for 175 days. They are due to return on April 29 after a brief overlap with their replacements. The Tiangong, fully assembled in October 2022, can accommodate up to six people at a time.While in space, the astronauts will conduct experiments in medical science and new technologies and perform space walks to carry out maintenance and install new equipment, the Manned Space Agency said.","The Shenzhou 20 spaceship took off as planned atop China's workhorse Long March 2F rocket.
