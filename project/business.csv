CJI recalls HC judge who'd do everything except decide cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-recalls-hc-judge-whod-do-everything-except-decide-cases/articleshow/123842098.cms,"NEW DELHI: The ten-day long educative debate before a five-judge Supreme Court bench on the Presidential Reference seeking the apex court's opinion on the judiciary's power to fix timelines for the President and governors as well as grant 'deemed assent' to pending bills was a serious affair but was not shorn of humour.When a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar broke for a discussion, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was going full steam, said, ""I wish I had taken some classes on lip reading. When judges discuss something among themselves when we are arguing, we become apprehensive.""CJI Gavai said, ""We were not discussing something that was argued during the last three weeks. It is not like a colleague of ours in Bombay HC, who used to draw sketches during long arguments. He used to paint and do carpentry and what not, except deciding cases.""When Mehta was jumping from paragraph to paragraph of his rejoinder and skipping many in between while speed-reading with explanations to meet the deadline for concluding his arguments, the CJI said, ""I became an SC judge in 2019. Even after six years, I am unable to keep pace with Delhi lawyers, who read the first sentence and then the tenth one before moving on to some other sentence.""""Four of us on the bench, except for Justice Narasimha, find it difficult to match the speed of SC lawyers. Sometimes we feel lost. We will read the entire written submissions which run into more than 5,000 pages including the annexures,"" he said.Justice Narasimha, who was practising in SC prior to his elevation as a judge, said, ""This is a message for the next generation lawyers, who should not adopt this practice of skip reading.""The AG cited a Greek mythological concept - Procrustean Bed - to persuade SC not to create space for states to seek amendment of the Constitution, the sole prerogative of Parliament, through judicial verdicts.Procrustes was a Greek mythological giant who tied travellers to an iron bed. If their legs protruded out, he used to cut them to fit them to the size of the bed. If it fell short, he used to stretch them. The terminology Procrustean Bed is used to explain a phenomenon when a provision is moulded as per the demand of a situation.Mehta said if timelines are fixed for governors, who are there to protect the Constitution and prevent unconstitutional acts of govt, it would result in self-destruction and counterproductive. Governors exercise the discretion of withholding assent only in rare situations and history tells us that more than 94% of bills were assented to and the assent was withheld only to 20 out of over 17,000 bills in the last 55 years.","Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, ""I wish I had taken some classes on lip reading"" Chief Justice B R Gavai: ""I became an SC judge in 2019.

New Delhi: Launching the 'fast track immigration-trusted traveller programme' (FTI-TTP), which enables faster immigration of pre-verified flyers through automated e-gates, at five more international airports in the country, home minister Amit Shah on Thursday suggested that its coverage be maximised by enabling resident Indians and Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) to sign up for FTI-TTP at the state of issuing of passports or OCI cards itself.With the inclusion of Lucknow, Amritsar, Thiruvananthapuram, Tiruchirappalli and Kozhikode international airports, the number of airports covered under the programme has risen to 13.First launched at the Delhi international airport in June 2022, the programme added seven more airports - covering Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and Ahmedabad - in Jan this year. Shah said the facility will be available at the upcoming Navi Mumbai and Jewar airports as well.Addressing the FTI-TTP inauguration event at the five airports through video-conference, the home minister said around 3 lakh persons had registered under the programme and over 2.6 lakh travellers, both inbound and outbound, had availed of it, enabling them to clear immigration in 30 seconds, with no long queues or manual checks.""The next phase of the effort to enhance passenger convenience by integrating PM Narendra Modi's vision of 'speed, scale, and scope' into the FTI-TTP is starting from today,"" he said, adding the programme also introduces foreign travellers to the positive changes taking place in India.Drawing attention to the 60% increase in international passenger traffic over the past 11 years of the Modi govt - from 5 crore in 2014 to 8.1 crore in 2024 - the home minister said the figure of 2.6 lakh who have availed of the FTI-TTP facility is too small, leaving tremendous scope to maximise its coverage.Shah said everyone who has availed of the programme has voiced appreciation.

"Govt bulldozing bills, says Congress, but is mum on JPC participation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-bulldozing-bills-says-congress-but-is-mum-on-jpc-participation/articleshow/123841802.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chiming with the arguments of Trinamool Congress and others for boycott of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on the bill on dismissal of jailed ministers and chief ministers, Congress accused the governing BJP of using parliamentary committees to bulldoze legislations without giving any space to arguments of opposition parties. It lamented that govt is ""having its way and say both"", which is not acceptable in a democracy like India.Congress breaking of silence on the JPC after the boycott announced by TMC, Samajwadi Party, Sena UBT and AAP suggests that the largest INDIA bloc player may be veering towards the view of its allies, even as it has not announced a decision on whether it will participate in the crucial panel. Amid uncertainty, Parliament has not notified the committee despite a passage of nearly 20 days.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal told TOI, ""In a parliamentary democracy, opposition can also put forward its views in committees. But look at the way waqf bill was passed in the JPC. In these committees, opposition parties are not being allowed to raise issues. It may be an extreme characterisation by me. But the fact is that the govt side is bulldozing bills. In a healthy democracy, it is not so.""The argument echoes the TMC-led 'boycott bloc', which recently announced it will not join the JPC because such panels have become a BJP ""stunt"" to use its majority to force bills.Congress has not yet given its view on the JPC, even though there has been an internal opinion that the party should join the panel.Buttressing his charge against BJP, Venugopal said the Modi govt did not allow a discussion on special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar in the recent Monsoon session of Parliament, despite over 240 MPs demanding it.""Even the 130th constitutional amendment bill presented by the home minister was passed amid din. Do you expect this in a democracy like India? Regrettably, it is not the old era where Parliament discussed all the issues. However, we feel there should be a consensus among all opposition parties on the JPC. We will discuss it with INDIA bloc members and appropriate decisions will be taken,"" he said.It is to be seen if TMC, SP, Sena UBT and AAP can be persuaded to rescind their decision to boycott. Else, it may mean that Congress would also join them. DMK, NCP, CPM are said to be waiting for Congress to take a call. TMC started the push for boycott after the bill was tabled in Lok Sabha, but Congress and some allies were confident that their view of joining the panel would prevail. But since then, the 'boycott bloc' has grown. This seems to have nudged Congress too.","Congress accuses the governing BJP of using parliamentary committees to bulldoze legislations.

ICSSR's research call on family system echoes Sangh concern,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/icssrs-research-call-on-family-system-echoes-sangh-concern/articleshow/123841616.cms,"NEW DELHI: At a time when India's family structures are facing pressure from urbanisation, migration and changing lifestyles, the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) has called for major research on 'kutumb vyavastha' - the traditional Indian family system, in an initiative which reflects Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh 's concern about the protection of traditional family values.Under the scheme ""Family and Family System in India"" which it will launch on Friday, 150 projects will be granted financial support of a maximum of Rs 30 lakh each, with a total allocated budget of Rs 11.25 crore.The move comes as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) prepares to mark its centenary in 2025-26 by giving a fillip to its 'Panch Parivartan' agenda, which highlights five areas of change: family values, social harmony, eco-friendly living, self-reliance and civic duties. ""The joint family system (kutumb vyavastha) is not just a living arrangement. It is an ecosystem of emotional bonds, economic support, intergenerational care and value transmission,"" said Dhananjay Singh, member secretary, ICSSR.He added that the family has always been ""the first physical and psychological space of socialisation, ethical experience and community interdependence"".The ICSSR has invited studies from sociology, anthropology, law, psychology and culture scholars for the purpose.Researchers are expected to look at 19 themes, such as 'Kutumb Prabodhan' (family awakening), the role of women in keeping cultural values alive, inter-generational value transmission, and the strain on caregiving in today's fast-paced, globalised and highly competitive world. Topics such as technology's effect on families, the balance between nuclear and joint households, migration-linked disruptions, generational conflicts, rising concerns around loneliness and social isolation, ageing populations and mental health challenges will also be part of the wide-ranging agenda.By stressing the family as the first space for ethical learning and community bonding, the initiative ties in with RSS's view that ""harmonious families create harmonious communities"".For the Sangh, its centenary is not just a symbolic milestone but a chance to spread this idea widely as part of its larger social outreach.Singh said that while modern work culture and urban life have weakened some traditions, Indian families remain ""deeply rooted in emotions, care, devotion and sacrifice"". The ICSSR, he said, aims to generate studies that both capture these changes and revive indigenous knowledge, making family systems central to India's social and cultural future. The scale of funding - higher than in many recent ICSSR thematic calls - signals that family and community studies are now being treated as a national research priority.","Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) has called for major research on 'kutumb vyavastha' - the traditional Indian family system. 150 projects will be granted financial support of a maximum of Rs 30 lakh each, with a total allocated budget of Rs 11.25 crore.

Nepal In Flames: PM KP Oli Resigns, Flees In Army Chopper As Gen Z Protesters Burn Down Parliament

Poll Do you think young leaders like Balen Shah can bring positive change in Nepal? Yes, he can make a difference No, experience matters more

Balen's message for Nepali youth





With Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli stepping down amid the deadly student-led “GenZ protests,” attention has shifted to Kathmandu’s young mayor, Balendra Shah, as online campaigns promote him as the Himalayan nation’s next leader.Popularly known as “Balen,” the 35-year-old is a rapper-turned-politician who has served as Kathmandu’s 15th mayor since May 2022. He won as an independent candidate, becoming the first to hold the post without party backing.An engineer by training, Balen holds a degree in civil engineering and has an India connection - he pursued structural engineering at Visvesvaraya Technological University in Karnataka. Before entering politics, he was active in Nepal’s underground hip-hop scene, using his music to highlight corruption and inequality.In June 2023, he drew national attention by banning the screening of Indian films in Kathmandu over a dialogue in the movie Adipurush.In a Facebook post, Shah on Tuesday appealed to protesters to exercise restraint, noting that their demand for the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and other ministers has already been met.He cautioned against further damage to public and private property, saying, “The loss of the country’s wealth is, in reality, a loss of our own property. It is now essential that we all act with restraint.”Shah’s appeal comes as nationwide “GenZ” protests intensify, with young demonstrators demanding accountability over corruption, restrictions on freedoms and police violence. A security forces crackdown has left at least 19 dead and more than 500 injured in clashes around the Federal Parliament and other parts of Kathmandu over the past two days.","Balendra Shah, 35, is a rapper-turned-politician who has served as Kathmandu’s 15th mayor since May 2022.

Shashi Tharoor post

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday expressed concern over the victory of the Jamaat-e-Islami’s student wing in the Dhaka University (DU) student union polls, questioning whether India may soon have to deal with a Jamaat-led government in Bangladesh.“This may have registered as barely a blip on most Indian minds, but it is a worrying portent of things to come,” the former diplomat wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of a news report on the win.Tharoor noted that voters were increasingly turning to the Jamaat-e-Islami not out of religious zeal but because they saw the party as untainted by the corruption and misgovernance associated with the two traditional rivals — the now-banned Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). “How will this play out in the February 2026 general elections? Will New Delhi be dealing with a Jamaat majority next door?” he asked.According to Bangladeshi news outlet Prothom Alo, candidates backed by Islami Chhatra Shibir, contesting under the banner of the Oikkoboddho Shikkharthi Jote (United Students’ Alliance), won nine of the 15 key posts, including vice president (VP), general secretary (GS) and assistant general secretary (AGS).For the VP post, Abu Shadik Kayem secured 14,042 votes, defeating his closest rival — BNP student wing leader Abidul Islam Khan — who polled 5,708 votes.The report noted that during the Awami League’s 15-year rule, Shibir could not operate openly on the Dhaka University campus, with its suspected activists often facing assaults in residential halls.But following the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina-led government in August 2024 after a student-led movement, the Shibir resurfaced publicly.

His remarks assume significance, especially as developing countries are gearing up to fight for more predictable climate finance for the global south when they assemble in Brazil for COP30 in Nov.At last year’s COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, developed countries had agreed to mobilise merely $300 billion annually by 2035, far short of the $1.3-trillion target set by developing countries for implementation of their climate action pledges.Yadav, in his speech, said India will require more than $10 trillion by 2070 to meet its net-zero target and called for global financial systems to unlock private capital, noting that public money cannot and would not be sufficient to address the scale of the problem at hand.Referring to the RBI’s estimates in 2023, he said India will spend about $1.05 trillion by 2030 to adapt industries to climate norms.Calling ‘green finance’ the backbone of resilient and competitive economies, he said, “Green financing is not simply about mobilising money for environmental projects. It is about restructuring the flow of capital so that every investment in infrastructure, industry, transport, or agriculture contributes to sustainability rather than undermining it.”",India said financial support of $300 billion annually to the global south by 2035 is ‘insufficient’ Developed countries have the ‘moral responsibility’ to support developing countries.

We also know that the PM is very worried about the so-called hydrogen bomb which Mr Gandhi has spoken about. ..You should be worried, you have every reason to be worried but do not make the issue of the security of the LoP, especially a person who has lost two family members, a political issue. Do not politicise this issue. You should not have leaked the contents of this letter, a sensitive matter like security of Mr Gandhi in public...""He further criticised the BJP’s response, saying, ""Is this a threat? Are they trying to threaten Mr Gandhi? This particular comment by the BJP, it is a political party and it is not the Govt speaking right now which is making this obnoxious comment.This should be treated by the Govt of India as a threat to Rahul Gandhi.""The CRPF in its communication said Rahul Gandhi, despite enjoying Z+ security cover with an Advance Security Liaison team, had on multiple occasions skipped mandatory protective measures. It warned that such lapses weaken the effectiveness of VVIP security.According to officials, the letter cited Rahul Gandhi’s foreign trips to Italy, Vietnam, Dubai, Qatar, London and Malaysia, noting that he often travels abroad for personal and political reasons without following required procedures. Under the “Yellow Book” protocol, high-security protectees must inform their security wing in advance about all movements, including international tours, to allow adequate arrangements.The force conveyed that Rahul Gandhi’s repeated lapses posed “serious concerns” for his safety and urged him to comply with guidelines in the future.","CRPF wrote to Rahul Gandhi highlighting repeated violations of security protocols during his foreign trips.

NEW DELHI: Barely weeks after govt increased renewal charges of older vehicles, the road transport ministry has proposed a steep hike in fitness test fee of private vehicles over 20 years and higher for medium and heavy commercial vehicles which are more than 15 years old.While owners of 20-year-old cars would have to cough up Rs 2,600 for the test, for trucks and buses, it would cost Rs 25,000.TOI has learnt that the intent behind this move is to disincentivise people to hold on to their old vehicles. Sources said the govt is also considering having proper fitness tests for private vehicles once they attain 15 years. Currently, RTOs give fitness certificates by just taking a look at the condition of private vehicles rather than putting them through tests.Sources said the ministry is looking into the option of whether mandatory automated technical tests should be rolled out in a staggered manner, such as starting with cars.As per the draft norm published by the ministry, there is a proposal to introduce separate fee slabs for commercial vehicles that are over 10, 13, 15 and 20 years. At present, the testing fee for commercial vehicles above 20 years is the same as that for 15-year-old vehicles.It has proposed to double the testing fee for certification of fitness for vehicles that are more than 20 years old.Under the Motor Vehicle Rules, fitness test for commercial vehicles is mandatory every two years up to eight years and annually thereafter. In case of private vehicles this test is required at the time of registration renewal, which is after 15 years, and then every five years. ""We have been urging the govt to change this regime, and fitness test for private vehicles should also be made mandatory after 10 years. Whether it's a private or commercial vehicle, fitness must be the priority. Any unfit vehicle is a risk for all road users,"" said Anil Chhikara, the former deputy transport commissioner of Delhi.","The intent behind this move is to disincentivise people to hold on to their old vehicles.

Gadkari said that at present, an average of 16,830 vehicles are being scrapped monthly, and the private sector has invested Rs 2,700 crore towards this effort.""The steel scrap that we import is 60 lakh tonnes.

Infosys Ltd on Thursday announced a Rs 18,000 crore share buyback programme, signalling confidence in its long-term cash flows and growth prospects even as the IT services major faces muted revenue growth this fiscal.The company said it will repurchase around 10 crore shares at Rs 1,800 apiece, a 19% premium over the stock’s Thursday closing price of Rs 1,509.70 on the NSE. The buyback will account for 2.41% of Infosys’ equity, according to an ET report. The buyback, to be carried out through the tender offer route, will cover all eligible shareholders on a proportionate basis as on the record date.This is the fifth such exercise for Infosys, surpassing its earlier buybacks of Rs 13,000 crore in 2017, Rs 8,260 crore in 2019, Rs 9,200 crore in 2021 and Rs 9,300 crore in 2023. “The current buyback is the biggest-ever for the company,” Infosys said in a filing.Analysts said the move is expected to strengthen key financial metrics such as earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE), while offering shareholders tax-efficient returns compared to dividends. They added that the programme will also help the company optimise its capital structure by deploying excess cash reserves.Shares of Infosys ended 1.3% lower at Rs 1,512 apiece on the NSE on Thursday as investors booked profits ahead of the board announcement. The stock has shed nearly 20% so far this year, pressured by weak discretionary spending, AI-led disruption in business models and a cautious global demand environment.Brokerages have flagged that unresolved tariff issues and geopolitical uncertainties are prompting clients to delay deal signings and cut back on discretionary IT spending.

Who is Larry Ellison: Richest man in the world with more than $393 billion net worth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-larry-ellison-richest-man-in-the-world-with-more-than-393-billion-net-worth/articleshow/123813856.cms,"Larry Ellison and the rise of Oracle in the AI cloud boom

Life and legacy of Larry Ellison

Family and personal interests





“When people start telling you that you’re crazy, you just might be on to the most important innovation in your life,” Larry Ellison said in 2016. Fast forward to 2025, he is at the most important position in the billionaires’ world—the richest man on Earth with a staggering net worth of $393 billion. The 81-year-old Oracle cofounder dethroned Elon Musk after Oracle’s stock soared on the back of massive AI-driven cloud contracts, propelling his wealth by an unprecedented $101 billion overnight. As of September 10, 2025, Ellison’s fortune stands at an astonishing $393 billion, placing him at the top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Larry Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977, then known as Software Development Laboratories. The company quickly rose to prominence with Oracle Version 2 (1979), the first commercially available SQL-based relational database management system (RDBMS). This innovation secured Oracle’s leadership in enterprise database technology through the 1980s and 1990s.Under Ellison’s leadership, Oracle became the world’s largest database management company by 1987 and went public in 1986. The company expanded aggressively, acquiring PeopleSoft in 2005, Sun Microsystems in 2010, and NetSuite in 2016, moves that cemented Oracle’s presence in enterprise applications, hardware, and cloud infrastructure.Ellison’s vision transformed Oracle from a startup into a $40 billion-plus software powerhouse.In the 2020s, Oracle pivoted strongly into artificial intelligence and cloud services, becoming a key provider for AI companies hungry for computing power. As CTO and executive chairman, Ellison drove the development of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), purpose-built for AI workloads with custom networking and chips. In 2025, Oracle unveiled its $500 billion Stargate initiative to build global AI infrastructure and industry-specific platforms, making it a central force in AI inference, a multi-trillion-dollar emerging market.The launch of Oracle’s AI Database, integrating enterprise data with models like ChatGPT, reinforced its dominance. By unifying hardware, software, and cloud services under one roof, Oracle reduced latency and costs, setting itself apart from rivals. These innovations have powered Oracle’s stock to double in 2025, sending Ellison’s fortune soaring.Ellison’s net worth of $393 billion pushed him past Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose wealth fell to $385 billion as Tesla’s shares slid 13% this year and its U.S. market share dropped to its lowest since 2017. Ellison also overtook Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who previously held the second-richest spot. Musk, who first claimed the title in 2021 before losing it to Jeff Bezos and Bernard Arnault, reclaimed the crown in 2024 and held it for nearly 300 days. Ellison’s ascent marks the first time he has reached the very top, reshaping the billionaire rivalry in Silicon Valley.Beyond Oracle, Ellison has built a diverse portfolio. In August 2025, he acquired nearly 50% of Paramount Skydance, the $28 billion media giant formed through the merger of Paramount and his son David’s Skydance. He also served on Tesla’s board from 2018 to 2022 and was a significant shareholder during his tenure. These ventures highlight Ellison’s strategy of combining core technology investments with cultural influence, extending his impact beyond the enterprise software world.Born in 1944, Ellison dropped out of both the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago before beginning his career building databases for the CIA. He went on to lead Oracle for 37 years as CEO before stepping down in 2014 to become executive chairman and CTO. Known for his bold personality and risk-taking approach, Ellison has left an indelible mark on the software and cloud industry. In 2012, he bought nearly the entire Hawaiian island of Lanai for $300 million, later moving there permanently in 2020. His career reflects both persistence and a willingness to defy convention.Ellison has four children, two of whom—Megan and David—are influential Hollywood producers. Megan Ellison financed critically acclaimed films like Zero Dark Thirty and American Hustle, while David produced mainstream blockbusters such as The Terminator and Mission: Impossible. Outside business, Ellison is a passionate sailor and maintains a relatively private lifestyle despite his immense fortune. His limited philanthropy score contrasts with his reputation as one of Silicon Valley’s most daring entrepreneurs.With Oracle’s AI-powered rise and his net worth surpassing $393 billion, Ellison has proven that vision and persistence can outlast rivals. Today, at 81, he is not only the richest man alive but also one of the most influential figures shaping the future of technology. His journey from a college dropout to the world’s richest man embodies the spirit of relentless innovation. Ellison’s story serves as a reminder that bold risks, when paired with vision, can rewrite history.","Ellison dethroned Elon Musk after Oracle’s stock soared on the back of massive AI-driven cloud contracts.

Stuck in 1791: An Amendment Out of Time



“Worth It”: Guns and the MAGA Mindset



Haunted by Gun Deaths Like No Other Country



Hard Truths and Simple Answers



worth it.





W.B. Yeats’ grave has a unique epitaph:They are the last three lines from his poem “Under Ben Bulben”, written in 1938, the year before his death. The call-to-action, as product managers call it, is to be detached from life and death, to reject romantic memorialisation, to treat mortality with stoic acknowledgement. And yet it is almost impossible to do that when death comes knocking in America, where the gun barrel is always closer than the grave.Take Charlie Kirk, perhaps the politest Republican to stalk college campuses, who once argued that “some deaths were acceptable” to preserve the American Second Amendment, which reads:Kirk had said in 2018: “You will never live in a society with an armed citizenry and no gun deaths. That is nonsense. But I think it’s worth it.”Little did Kirk know that his own death would also become “some of the gun deaths” in service of the Second Amendment.America’s First Amendment —— is perhaps the most democratic statement ever made, a self-fulfilling prophecy that helped make America the land of the free and the brave.Yet its Second Amendment is so anachronistic that one wonders how it continues to exist.America’s surreal relationship with firearms has always bordered on parody. In an SNL skit, actor Walton Goggins plays a denim-clad, shades-wearing time-traveller named Matt who lectures the Founding Fathers that the amendment should guarantee “having guns.” It doesn’t sound right, so he refines it into “the right to bear arms.”And then there was the viral 2019 tweet: “How do I kill 30–50 feral hogs that run into my yard within 3–5 minutes while my small kids play?”It was written earnestly by a rural American but became an instant meme, shorthand for the absurd extremes of US. gun logic. Twitter laughed, but feral hogs are real – they destroy crops, spread disease, and cost billions in damage. Rural gun owners argued they needed semi-automatics for protection; urban liberals mocked the imagery of toddlers being menaced by a porcine horde. America, in other words, can turn existential fear into a punchline but refuses to confront why civilians can so easily access weapons of war.And presiding over it all is the NRA, the single most effective hostage-taker in Washington. It has ensured that even after massacres of children, the political system moves no further than “thoughts and prayers.” Money, fear, and lobbying have kept lawmakers paralysed. Even Hollywood, that citadel of self-proclaimed wokeness, has never gone after guns. Studios that will erase cigarettes, edit jokes, or insert rainbow flags will still churn out John Wick and Extraction, where firearms are fetishised like religious relics. America lectures itself about everything but the weapon in its hand.America’s relationship with guns is exceptional partly because of an eighteenth-century relic: the Second Amendment. Ratified in 1791, in an era of single-shot muskets and citizen militias, it made sense for a fledgling republic wary of standing armies. But today, it has become painfully anachronistic.The Founding Fathers never imagined high-capacity rifles capable of unleashing dozens of bullets in under a minute. A soldier with a flintlock musket in Washington’s army could fire perhaps four inaccurate shots per minute. A lone gunman today can slaughter fifty in ten minutes. The technological leap is staggering – and lethal.Yet Americans remain fiercely attached to this relic, unwilling even to debate reinterpretation. Much like the presidency has swollen into the monarchy the Founders feared, the Second Amendment has metastasised into something beyond recognition. The result is paralysis. After each fresh tragedy – a school shooting, a concert massacre, an assassination – outrage surges, vigils are held, politicians mumble platitudes, and then nothing. Other nations faced with massacres have acted decisively: Britain after Dunblane, Australia after Port Arthur, New Zealand after Christchurch. America clings to 1791 like scripture, as though muskets were still the pinnacle of warfare.For conservatives, guns are not tools but totems. They are framed as God-given rights, safeguards against tyranny, a talisman from 1776. Kirk’s words distilled the creed perfectly: freedom isn’t free, and blood is the price. In their worldview, the Second Amendment guarantees every other right – a cosmic insurance policy against state overreach.The irony is impossible to miss. Kirk’s own life was taken by a bullet at one of his campus events, while he was answering a question on gun violence. In that instant, the abstract “cost” became brutally personal. He believed armed citizens made for a safer society; yet all his politeness, all his rhetoric, all the armed security nearby could not save him from a single determined shooter.The toll of this paralysis is staggering. In 2023, 46,728 people in the US died from gun-related injuries — the highest total in decades. Of those deaths, about 58% were suicides (roughly 27,300 people), while homicides accounted for about 38% (nearly 17,900).Firearms have now become the leading cause of death for American children and teens, surpassing car crashes and cancer. In 2023, the firearm death rate among children and adolescents was about 3.5 per 100,000, a sharp increase from earlier years. From 2019 to 2023, deaths in this age group rose by roughly 46%, driven largely by assaults.Mass shootings are routine.The US regularly records more shootings than days in the year. Columbine, Sandy Hook, Orlando, Las Vegas, Parkland, Buffalo, Uvalde – each once a national wound, now just another tally. American schoolchildren grow up with “active shooter” drills as a normal part of education, rehearsing how to hide in closets and smear blood on themselves to play dead. In most countries, such trauma would define a generation. In America, it defines Tuesdays.Political violence has blurred into the mix. Kirk’s assassination was indiscriminate – an extremist act without neat partisan boundaries. Once violence is unleashed, it devours both sides. Conservatives who dismissed gun violence as someone else’s problem now face the truth: bullets do not check political leanings.Yeats implored us to “pass by” life’s sorrows with a cold, distant eye. America probably will, because nothing seems to move the needle on guns.Charlie Kirk’s death, and the irony of his own words, ought to demand reckoning. Other nations have shown that fewer guns mean fewer deaths. It is not complicated. But America insists on dressing simplicity in the costume of freedom.Kirk once said gun deaths were “worth it.” Perhaps, like Yeats’ epitaph, those words will follow him. Yeats asked us to cast a cold eye on life and death. America prays, drowning in grief after every incident, but refuses to accept the simple truth: fewer guns will mean fewer deaths. That arithmetic is too much for a nation addicted to tragedy. Kirk had once argued that American campuses were no longer safe for people who held non-liberal views. He was right, when it came to debate. But it was the nation’s obstinacy that ultimately took a bright young man’s life. And in any sane nation, that shouldn’t be","America’s surreal relationship with firearms has always bordered on parody. America lectures itself about everything but the weapon in its hand. Money, fear, and lobbying have kept lawmakers paralysed. America, in other words, can turn existential fear into a punchline but refuses to confront why civilians can so easily access weapons of war.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123833660,imgsize-133774,width-400,resizemode-4/worth-it.jpg"

Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, has officially overtaken Tesla CEO Elon Musk to become the world’s richest man in 2025. Ellison’s net worth soared by an extraordinary $101 billion in a single day, marking the largest one-day wealth increase ever recorded in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His massive fortune now stands at $393 billion, officially surpassing Elon Musk. This dramatic shift was fueled by Oracle’s record-breaking earnings report, which sent the company’s stock price soaring to unprecedented heights. For Musk, the sharp decline in Tesla’s share value has abruptly ended his nearly year-long reign at the very top. The development underscores the powerful link between corporate performance, global stock markets, investor confidence, and the dynamic reshuffling of international billionaire wealth rankings.For the first time in his long career, Larry Ellison has claimed the top position on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. At 81 years old, Ellison’s rise highlights his enduring influence in the tech world and the extraordinary growth of Oracle Corporation. His fortune has now reached $393 billion, surpassing Elon Musk, who had dominated global wealth rankings since 2024.The driving force behind Ellison’s climb was Oracle’s blockbuster earnings report.The company delivered higher-than-expected quarterly results, a surge in bookings, and an ambitious outlook for future growth in cloud services. This fueled a 41% single-day stock rally, the largest in Oracle’s history. Since Ellison holds most of his wealth in Oracle shares, the stock surge translated into an unprecedented $101 billion personal gain.Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s net worth has slipped due to Tesla’s challenges. Shares of the electric vehicle giant are down 13% in 2025, dragging his fortune to $385 billion and ending his nearly year-long reign at the top. Despite the setback, Musk remains a strong contender, with Tesla’s board proposing a performance-based compensation plan that could make him the world’s first trillionaire if he meets aggressive milestones.Ellison’s ascent also underscores Oracle’s growing presence in the cloud computing market, where it is increasingly challenging industry leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. With Ellison serving as chairman and chief technology officer, the company’s bold expansion into cloud infrastructure has redefined its role in global tech and cemented his position as the wealthiest man alive.Larry Ellison is one of the most influential figures in the technology industry, best known as the co-founder, Executive Chairman, and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Oracle Corporation. Oracle, a global leader in enterprise software and cloud computing, was founded in the late 1970s when Ellison and his team pioneered relational database systems that would eventually dominate the market.For nearly four decades, Ellison served as Oracle’s Chief Executive Officer, shaping its rise from a small start-up into one of the world’s most powerful software companies. He stepped down as CEO in 2014 after 37 years at the helm, but unlike many founders who move aside, Ellison retained direct involvement in the company’s innovation strategy. In his role as Executive Chairman and CTO, he continues to steer Oracle’s research, product development, and long-term direction.Ellison also remains the company’s largest shareholder, owning about 41% of Oracle’s outstanding shares, a stake that forms the backbone of his immense personal fortune. This deep tie between his wealth and Oracle’s performance has made his financial trajectory closely mirror the company’s growth.According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Ellison’s fortune now stands at an extraordinary $393 billion as of September 10, 2025. This figure reflects the dramatic one-day surge fueled by Oracle’s earnings report and positions him ahead of Musk, whose net worth is currently estimated at $385 billion.The $101 billion leap was not only historic but also symbolic, highlighting how shifts in the technology sector—particularly the cloud computing race—are reshaping the global wealth rankings. Ellison’s rise to the top underscores both the resilience of Oracle under his leadership and his continued relevance as a driving force in Silicon Valley even at the age of 81.","Ellison’s net worth soared by an extraordinary $101 billion in a single day, marking the largest one-day wealth increase ever recorded in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

China rare earth curbs: Indian automakers strained as magnet exports yet to resume; festive season output fears grow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/china-rare-earth-curbs-indian-automakers-strained-as-magnet-exports-yet-to-resume-festive-season-output-fears-grow/articleshow/123842139.cms,"AI image





More than two weeks after Beijing announced easing restrictions on rare earth exports, supplies of critical magnets from China are yet to resume, leaving Indian automakers and component suppliers struggling to manage the shortfall on a day-to-day basis.Industry executives expressed concern that while high-level talks are underway between the two countries, the situation on the ground remains unchanged, reported ET.“There is an intent, but there has been no change on the ground and magnet supply has not resumed,” Shenu Agarwal, MD & CEO of Ashok Leyland , was quoted as saying by ET on the sidelines of the annual convention of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.A senior executive at a leading global component supplier confirmed that shipments remain stalled, though approvals may come within a month. TVS Motor Co. is also under strain, with director and CEO K N Radhakrishnan saying, “We are managing the magnet shortage on a day-to-day basis, which means it is challenging.”Magnets made with rare earth elements are essential for electric motors used in passenger cars, two-wheelers, and commercial vehicles. The disruption has raised fears of potential production bottlenecks during the festive season demand upcycle.However, leading carmakers including Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Mahindra & Mahindra have not faced disruptions so far, as per ET. Mahindra, for instance, has enough stock to last until the December quarter, while others are exploring ways to tweak magnet composition.Industry observers caution that the episode highlights India’s heavy reliance on Chinese supplies. Globally, Beijing accounts for over 80% of rare earth magnet exports.As per news agency PTI, the ministry of mines has been working on measures to ensure supply chain resilience for critical minerals. India has entered into bilateral agreements with resource-rich countries such as Australia, Argentina, Zambia, and Peru, while Khanij Bidesh India Limited (KABIL) is tasked with acquiring overseas mineral assets of strategic importance.Despite these efforts, industry executives privately admit that building reliable non-Chinese supply chains will take years.For now, automakers are in wait-and-watch mode, stretching existing inventories to keep production lines running. “So far production has not been disrupted. But unless supplies resume soon, it will remain a balancing act,” a senior industry executive said, as per ET.","Beijing announced easing restrictions on rare earth exports two weeks ago.

Market watch: Asian stocks rally on Fed cut hopes; oil prices dip on demand concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-watch-asian-stocks-rally-on-fed-cut-hopes-oil-prices-dip-on-demand-concerns/articleshow/123842554.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)





Asian stock markets climbed strongly on Friday, extending a rally that has lifted Wall Street to fresh records, as investors grew confident the US Federal Reserve will deliver an interest rate cut next week.At the same time, oil prices slipped amid signs of softer demand and rising global supply.The buoyant mood in equities has been fuelled by recent US inflation and employment figures, which investors say have cleared the path for the central bank to ease policy.According to news agency AFP, jobless claims in the United States hit a four-year high last week, while August payrolls data showed just 22,000 jobs were added. Revised numbers also indicated employment growth in the year through March was more than 900,000 lower than earlier estimated.Inflation, meanwhile, held steady at around 3 per cent. Prices in August rose slightly faster than in July but were broadly in line with expectations, easing fears that US President Donald Trump’s tariffs would trigger a sharp spike.Taylor Nugent, senior economist for markets at National Australia Bank, was quoted as saying by AFP, “Inflation is not getting closer to the Fed’s target, but… as labour market concerns grow more pressing, fears (that) price pressures will be persistent fade.There is nothing to stand in the way of Fed cuts this year.”Traders are now almost certain the Fed will reduce borrowing costs by 25 basis points, though some speculate on a larger move. As per AFP, Chris Weston of Pepperstone said, “The base case is a 25-basis-point cut backed by a commitment to ease further in the meetings ahead,” while cautioning that a 50-point reduction remains unlikely.Reflecting the optimism, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index surged about 1.5 per cent, powered by nearly seven per cent gains in Alibaba after the e-commerce giant boosted its AI investment plans and pledged more spending on its core business.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.7 per cent to 44,694.65, while markets in Seoul, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Taipei and Manila also advanced, AFP noted.In contrast, oil prices edged lower, extending heavy losses from the previous session. Brent crude fell 30 cents, or 0.45 per cent, to $66.07 a barrel, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate slipped 31 cents, or 0.5 per cent, to $62.06, news agency Reuters reported.Both contracts had already shed between 1.7 and 2 per cent on Thursday.The downturn followed the International Energy Agency’s projection that global supply will grow faster than expected this year, owing to planned output hikes by OPEC and its allies. OPEC, however, left its 2025 and 2026 demand forecasts unchanged, citing resilient economic growth.As per Reuters, Saudi Arabia’s exports to China are set to climb to 1.65 million barrels per day in October, up sharply from September’s 1.43 million bpd, as Riyadh seeks to regain market share.Meanwhile, Russia plans to scale back ESPO Blend shipments from Kozmino port next month.Analysts said the mix of Fed-driven optimism and energy-market caution highlights the balancing act facing investors heading into the central bank’s policy meeting next week.","Asian stock markets climbed strongly on Friday, extending a rally that has lifted Wall Street to fresh records.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in green on Friday on the back of firm global cues. While Nifty50 was above 25,050, BSE Sensex was up almost 200 points. At 9:17 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,067.55, up 62 points or 0.25%. BSE Sensex was at 81,732.91, up 184 points or 0.23%.Market experts predict this steady market rise will continue, backed by the government's GST initiatives, potential US Fed rate cuts, and positive developments in US-India trade discussions.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “Globally stock markets are resilient, drawing strength from the new records being set by the mother market US. The US market is bullish on expectations of rate cut from the Fed on September 17th. A 25 bp rate cut by the Fed is the near consensus now, but experts differ on the number of rate cuts after the September cut. Rising inflation in the US, which has come at 2.9% yoy in August, is likely to get worse from the tariff pass through which has started happening. Rising jobless claims at 263000 is a clear indication of a weakening labour market.”“In contrast, the macro picture in India is robust. Financial stability as reflected in FD and CAD numbers, GDP growth prospects remaining strong and falling inflation are positive indicators. After September 22nd the sharp rise in demand for consumer durables, particularly automobiles, will dominate economic and business news. This, in turn, will provide the positive sentimental support to the market. The joker in the pack will be the Trump tariffs. So, watch out for developments on that front.""Major US indices achieved record closings on Thursday, bolstered by Tesla and Micron Technology gains. US inflation and employment data strengthened expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts this month. August saw US consumer prices exceed predictions, with annual inflation reaching its highest in seven months.Asian markets joined worldwide equity gains following moderate US inflation figures and reduced employment numbers, supporting Federal Reserve rate cut prospects next week.Gold prices increased on Friday, progressing towards their fourth straight weekly gain, as concerns about a declining US employment market overshadowed inflation worries before an anticipated Federal Reserve rate reduction next week.Oil prices declined slightly on Friday following significant drops in the previous session, due to worries about potential US demand reduction and general oversupply, despite concerns regarding supply disruptions from Middle East conflicts and the Ukraine war.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 3,472 crore net on Thursday, whilst domestic institutional investors made net purchases of Rs 4,046 crore.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex opened in green on Friday on back of firm global cues.

India-US trade deal





The Donald Trump administration wants to ‘pull India’ to its side, away from China, according to Sergio Gor, nominee as the next US Ambassador to India. In a Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Gor said that India and the US are on track to resolve trade related disputes.""... While we (India-US) might have our moment of hiccups right now, we are on the track of resolving that. Our relationship with the Indian government and the Indian people extends many more decades, and it's a much warmer relationship than they have with the Chinese,” he said.“Chinese expansionism is not just on the border with India, it's all over the area... We will make it a top priority that India is pulled into our side and away from them.” he added.Also Read | ’Not far apart on tariff deal’: Trump’s India ambassador nominee says issues to be resolved ‘in weeks’; calls India a strategic partner On the issue of India’s procurement of Russia’s crude oil, Gor said, ""... President Trump has made it crystal clear that India must stop buying Russian oil... India has been on our side on various issues within BRICS. Several countries within BRICS have pushed for years to move away from the US Dollar. India has been the stopgap for that. India is much more willing and open to engage with us than with those other nations in BRICS.Gor’s remarks come at a time when Trump and PM Modi have signalled willingness to sort out the trade deal related issues at the earliest. Trump has imposed a total of 50% tariff on India - 25% reciprocal tariffs and 25% additional tariffs for India’s crude oil trade with Russia.Talking about the India-US trade deal discussions he said, “In the ongoing trade talks, we want the Indian market to open for our crude oil, petroleum products, and LNG... India's middle class is larger than the entire US...""Sergio also said, “Our President has a deep friendship with Prime Minister Modi, which is unique. If you've noticed, when he goes after other nations, he tends to go after their leaders for putting us in that position and for the United States imposing those tariffs. When the President has been critical of India, he goes out of his way to compliment Modi. They have an incredible relationship.”Also Read | ‘We are going to sort out with India’: US commerce secretary confident of trade deal; wants a stop on Russian oil purchase Sergio Gor said, ""India is a strategic partner whose trajectory will shape the region and beyond...

India is one of the most important relationships our nation has in the world... If confirmed, I will prioritise deepening defence and security cooperation with India. .. I will also work towards President Trump's ambitious goal dubbed 'Mission 500' to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030...

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
