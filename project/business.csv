"In first Cabinet meet, aid to build 3 crore houses for poor approved",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-first-cabinet-meet-aid-to-build-3-crore-houses-for-poor/articleshow/110884358.cms,"More financial aid likely for rural housing

NEW DELHI: The govt, in its first Cabinet meeting chaired by PM Modi on Monday, approved the proposal to provide financial assistance to construct three crore rural and urban houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). The plan would entail an investment of around Rs 5 lakh crore, sources said.TOI has learned that under the urban component of PMAY, govt will provide Rs 2 lakh to each beneficiary household for constructing dwelling units or as interest subsidy. Interestingly, the govt's proposal to expand the scheme comes a few years after the housing and urban affairs ministry had brought down the original target from 1.2 crore to approximately 1.1 crore.According to the plan for rural areas, each beneficiary will receive a higher financial assistance from govt, sources said. Currently, such households receive up to Rs 1.2 lakh in the plains and Rs 1.3 lakh in hilly states, difficult areas, and tribal and backward districts.""A boost for 'Ease of Living' and dignity for crores of Indians! The Cabinet has decided to further expand the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and construct 3 crore additional rural and urban houses. This decision underscores the government's commitment to addressing the housing needs of our nation and ensuring that every citizen leads a better quality of life. The expansion of PMAY also highlights our government's commitment to inclusive growth and social welfare,"" Modi tweeted on Monday evening.In his last Independence Day speech, Modi had announced the roll out of a scheme that will benefit families that live in cities but are living in rented houses, slums, chawls and unauthorised colonies. He had said that if such people want to build their own houses, the govt will assist them with relief in interest rates and loans from banks.Even in his election campaign, PM had announced his govt's plan to move ahead with expanding the scheme, something that was also part of BJP's election manifesto.The Centre has been implementing PMAY since 2015-16 and so far 4.2 crore houses have been completed. PMAY is a flagship scheme of the Modi govt and meant to be part of the initiative for housing for all. In the past PMAY has been dovetailed with other central and state govt programmes to provide basic amenities such as household toilets, LPG connection, electricity connection, functional household tap connection as part of the ""ease of living"" drive.After taking office in 2014, the Modi govt had announced the setting up a special investigation team on black money to clean up the economy. On the first day of the second term, the Modi govt had extended PM-Kisan to all 14.5 crore farmers and also introduced a pension scheme for farmers, small traders and self-employed.","The govt approved the proposal to provide financial assistance to construct three crore rural and urban houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) The plan would entail an investment of around Rs 5 lakh crore, sources said.

"Cabinet Committee on Security unchanged; Gadkari, Goyal, Vaishnaw, Pradhan retain key portfolios",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-committee-on-security-unchanged-gadkari-goyal-vaishnaw-pradhan-retain-key-portfolios/articleshow/110884313.cms,"Ram Mohan Naidu gets civil aviation, Scindia will handle communication

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi has retained his core team, leaving the Cabinet Committee on Security , comprising the ministries of home, defence, finance and external affairs, unchanged, while entrusting Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Manohar Lal with crucial portfolios .As reported first by TOI in its Sunday edition, the allies settled for mid-tier ministries , in a clear indication that coalition constraints may not come in the way of the govt's functioning. Crucial ministries such as road transport & highways, education, commerce & industry and petroleum remain in the same hands. TDP got civil aviation, the same portfolio it had held when it was part of the govt in Modi's first term.J P Nadda, who returned to govt after serving as BJP president, made a comeback to the health ministry, with added responsibility of chemicals and fertilisers, while Jual Oram also got back into the familiar territory of tribal affairs, when portfolios were announced Monday.Changes in CCS portfolios had always looked unlikely because of the PM's high level of satisfaction with their performance in the previous term.Chouhan, the former Madhya Pradesh CM, who is widely credited for the impressive farm growth in the state on his watch, will need to repeat the performance at the national level at a time when farmers have become too dependent on wheat and paddy, thanks to minimum support price.Besides grappling with incentivising diversification and increasing farmers' incomes, Chouhan's challenge will also include ensuring greater investment by the private sector, something that has been missing for years.Along with agriculture, Chouhan will also hold charge of the rural development ministry which implements MGNREGA and a massive roads programme - both top priorities for the PM - in what is going to also test his delivery skills at the Centre. The twin tasks are important, in any case, but the timing, with reports suggesting that farm and rural distress contributed to BJP's below par performance, invests them with greater urgency.The crucial responsibilities also mark the full rehabilitation of Chouhan, who appeared to be on the margins after being dropped as MP CM late last year.Former Haryana CM Manohar Lal has two meaty portfolios in power and urban development, both crucial at a time when PM Modi is keen to give a push to low-cost urban housing, redevelop the govt complex in central Delhi and ensure balanced urbanisation across the country. While the power sector has stabilised, carrying forward the reforms, especially getting power distribution companies back on their financial feet through steps like smart metering, balancing coal-based plants with the need to diversify to ""cleaner sources"" without causing disruptions, will be crucial. The expectation, quite clearly, seems to be that the former CM with the ""no-nonsense"" style of functioning may be able to drive matters.A sense of urgency explains the choice C R Patil, a BJP veteran from Gujarat known for his low profile but effective style of campaigning, for the Jal Shakti ministry where he will be required to get into ""mission mode"" to ensure delivery of tap water in households across the country, a flagship scheme of the Modi govt. Jal Shakti ministry also handles river interlinking, an ambitious scheme that the Centre is keen on.Modi has sought to balance the portfolios. For instance, he has handed communications to Jyotiraditya Scindia, and allotted civil aviation, another high-profile ministry, to TDP's K Ram Mohan Naidu, the youngest cabinet minister.Ashwini Vaishnaw, who handled communications, retains railways and electronics & IT, and has now been tasked with information and broadcasting which was under Anurag Thakur.Contrary to speculation that BJP would have to cede important portfolios due to lack of numbers, key allies appear to have settled for relatively low-profile assignments. JD(U) veteran Rajiv Ranjan Singh 'Lalan' got panchayati raj besides fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying. LJP-RV's Chirag Paswan got food processing ministry, something which should give him immense satisfaction, if only because the charge was with his estranged uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras. Another ally, former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, has been appointed MSME minister while former Karnataka CM and JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy was assigned heavy industries and steel.","PM Narendra Modi has retained his core team, leaving the Cabinet Committee on Security unchanged.

Together, we will achieve the target of ' Nation First ' with the intention of Viksit Bharat 2047.

Mumbai Airport: Close call at Mumbai Airport: Air India and IndiGo state they followed ATC instructions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/close-call-at-mumbai-airport-air-india-and-indigo-state-they-followed-atc-instructions/articleshow/110855218.cms,"MUMBAI: Following the close call at Mumbai runway on Saturday wherein two planes breached the safety margin distance, both airlines said they were given clearance by ATC. “The Air India aircraft was cleared by air traffic control (ATC) to enter the runway and subsequently cleared for take-off. It continued with the take-off movement in accordance with laid down procedures,” said Air India in a statement. An IndiGo spokesperson said the IndiGo flight from Indore was given landing clearance by ATC. “The pilot in command continued the approach and landing and followed ATC instructions,” IndiGo said.Though both airlines said their commanders merely followed instructions given by the tower controller, pilots and controllers TOI spoke to highlighted the role played by the pilots and the system that forces them to operate in a constrained space in heavy traffic.“The domino was triggered by the Air India aircraft,” said air safety expert Capt Amit Singh, based on data gathered from Flightradar24. Given the heavy air traffic that operates out of the lone operational runway of Mumbai airport , aircraft land or take off in a tight, choreographic sequence. The series of events that led to the incident occurred in the 90 seconds after an Iraqi Airways flight took off and the Air India aircraft entered the runway for take-off. “The Air India aircraft was slow to take-off after it received the line-up clearance, assuming they received immediate take-off clearance,” he said. They should have informed the ATC, who would have cancelled their take-off clearance.According to Mumbai airport Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), “when an aircraft is issued with a take-off clearance after lining up on the runway it shall commence take-off immediately. If the controller observes a delay in aircraft commencing take off, the take-off clearance will be cancelled and the aircraft shall be instructed to vacate the runway immediately at the nearest taxiway.”The Air India aircraft had not lifted off when the IndiGo aircraft crossed the beginning of the runway (runway threshold with piano key markings is further down the line). AIP also provides operational rules for landings. “Aircraft shall not land on an occupied runway even if landing clearance is received,” says the AIP, listing a commander’s responsibility. “Pilot should not hesitate to ask ATC about traffic (aircraft) on the runway. If pilots perceive at any point that it is not safe to continue approach, they must initiate go around,” it adds.Capt Singh said: “The question is the degree of responsibility on each of them, the controller and the two pilots, and most importantly, the runway infrastructure constraints at the airport, which puts controllers and pilots in such situations.”","Both airlines said they were given clearance by ATC.

NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi was, on Sunday, sworn in as prime minister for the third time, equalling Jawaharlal Nehru ’s record of three straight terms in the top office. With 72 members including him, Modi’s latest team is bigger than the previous two, and, contrary to speculation, he had little difficulty in putting together the council of ministers despite leading a coalition govt. TDP and JD (U), in particular, chose not to haggle, as was generally expected after voters denied BJP an absolute majority.Key messages from Modi’s first coalition government :Short of a majority, needing allies , Modi chose to signal the new govt is still his govt, not one created by bargain-hunting allies. Not just the top cabinet jobs — home, ﬁnance, defence, foreign affairs — BJP will likely retain most heavyweight ministries.One reason TDP and JDU didn’t push a hard bargain was that Naidu and Nitish decided ﬁghts with BJP over ministries weren’t worth it if in return they can extract more govt cash for their states, even if Bihar, Andhra don’t get special category status.At least to begin with, allies going along with BJP’s dominance of key jobs means the govt can function without too many disruptions and policy reversals typical of other coalition regimes.Of course, PMO will call the shots. But the inclusion of six former chief ministers will bring administrative and policymaking experience to the council of ministers, especially since several of them have helmed big, complicated states.Three states —Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand — face polls this year. Ministers from Haryana signal BJP intends to stay with the same social engineering formula that helped it build a non-Jat coalition. That Praful Patel’s comments on not taking up a ministerial post were made in the presence of BJP netas reﬂects NDA’s keenness to keep the Maharashtra alliance intact. And picks from Jharkhand point to BJP’s strategy of shoring up non-tribal groups.Modi’s third govt will begin with not a single Muslim minister. This may change later. But as of now, a council of ministers without any Muslims may be read by some in the context of the community’s near-total support for the opposition in the elections.That Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani were both among invitees shows Modi isn’t keeping these billionaires away just because the opposition made ‘crony capitalism’ a big campaign theme. And the sizeable presence of Hindu civil society groups means concessions, if any, on BJP’s core Hindutva agenda will be minor.","With 72 members including him, Modi’s latest team is bigger than the previous two.

Modi 3.0 must bite the bullet to make military future-ready,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-3-0-must-bite-the-bullet-to-make-military-future-ready/articleshow/110883617.cms,"NEW DELHI: An aggressive China, along with its expanding military collusiveness with Pakistan in the maritime domain after the land borders , will remain the foremost security threat confronting the Indian defence establishment for the foreseeable future.The new government should bite the bullet on several fronts to ensure India’s nuclear deterrence capabilities as well as conventional war-fighting machinery can meet this challenge with an integrated future-ready military within budgetary constraints in the years ahead, several experts and officials told TOI.The systemic reforms needed range from a time-bound rollout of the long-pending tri-Service theatre commands and formulation of a hard-nosed national security strategy to building a much stronger defence-industrial base backed by higher investment in R&D, overhaul of DRDO and defence PSUs, and greater private sector collaboration.For credible deterrence, India requires a more robust nuclear triad – the ability to launch nukes from the land, air and sea. Ballistic missiles, including the over 5,000-km range Agni-5, for instance, need to be inducted in greater numbers.India also needs to bolster its weak underwater leg by inducting more and bigger nuclear-powered submarines armed with long-range nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (SSBNs in naval parlance). At present, there is only the 6,000-tonne INS Arihant armed with the 750-km range K-15 missiles. Two similar-sized SSBNs, of course, are to be commissioned in the coming months.Concurrently, the government should also kick off the long-pending projects to build six nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) and a third aircraft carrier since they will take over a decade to roll out. “It cannot be an either-or debate,” a top officer said.The political leadership must also “own and push” the three proposed theatre commands, two for the land borders with China and Pakistan, and a maritime one for the Indian Ocean region. “Genuine integration among the Army, Navy and IAF, instead of piecemeal steps, is indispensable,” said an official.A greater thrust, of course, is needed in building military capabilities in space, cyberspace, disruptive technologies and other such arenas. With conflicts like the ongoing Russia-Ukraine one also underscoring the sheer operational utility of long-range precision-strike vectors, the proposed Integrated Rocket Force should also figure high in the plans.Over the last decade, the NDA govt has rightly pursued the `Make in India’ policy as a strategic imperative. But the country is still far away from manufacturing fifth-generation fighter aircraft, advanced submarines, jet engines and the like. The armed forces continue to grapple with critical operational gaps, ranging from fighters and helicopters to air defence weapons, anti-tank guided missiles and night-fighting capabilities.Consequently, a concerted push is required to design, develop and manufacture advanced weapon systems and platforms indigenously through a new defence production policy that will eventually help India get rid of its strategically-vulnerable position of being the world’s largest arms importer.“The `strategic partnership (SP)’ policy, for one, needs to be scrapped,” a senior official said. Not a single project has till now taken off under the floundering SP policy, which was promulgated in May 2017 to boost indigenous production through tie-ups with foreign armament majors.Connected to all this is also the major structural revamp of DRDO proposed by the Prof K VijayRaghavan-led expert committee. “DRDO should only concentrate on fundamental and applied R&D, leaving systems integration and product management to other agencies and the private sector,” he added.Finally, the tweaking of the short-term recruitment of soldiers under the Agnipath scheme is also necessary, with the retention of Agniveers being increased to around 50% from the present 25% after their four-year service.The new government, of course, is expected to fast-track the $3.9 billion acquisition of 31 armed MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones from the US and the $6 billion one for 26 Rafale-M fighters from France, as also the projects to manufacture three additional French Scorpene submarines at Mazagon Docks and the American GE-414 jet engines by Hindustan Aeronautics.","India needs a more robust nuclear triad – the ability to launch nukes from the land, air and sea.

He participated in Modi’s swearing-in on Sunday and met President Murmu on Monday in which he expressed gratitude for India’s continuous assistance to the Maldives.“He conveyed that he looks forward to further strengthening existing relations,” said his office.Controversy had started when three brash deputy ministers used offensive language against PM Modi’s posts on a social media platform about his trip to Lakshadweep, celebrating the natural beauty of the islands and its potential attractions for the Indian tourist.

House painters’ sons clear JEE(A) with flying colours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/house-painters-sons-clear-jeea-with-flying-colours/articleshow/110883997.cms,"TOI,

AGRA: When cousins Shivam and Abhishek cracked the JEE Advanced examination by achieving 2989 and 2372 ranks respectively, it was their fathers -- who are siblings and work as painters and earn about Rs 600 a day each -- whose joy knew no bounds as they had every single day dreamt of sending their sons to IITs.It was a tale of aspirations and dreams come true for the family in a single day. Over two years back, the painter brothers were working in a private school when someone told them that there was an examination to get admission in IITs. The two painters then decided to get their children admitted in this school and attend coaching classes for IIT entrance exam.Originally from Jhansi district, Rajendra Kumar and Vijendra Kumar moved out 15 years ago in search of work. They landed in Agra with virtually nothing and had even seen days when they had nothing for their next meal. Initial struggles notwithstanding, through their hard work and dedication, they established themselves as painters -- working in offices, homes and shops.Speaking toRajendra said, “My brother and I started working as daily wagers when we were teenagers. Now, I manage to earn Rs 600 a day, and so does my brother. We live in a rented house. After my son and nephew get into IITs, we hope to see better days in future.”Rajendra said he failed in class 10, and his younger brother studied up to class 8. Rajendra has four children -- three daughters and a son. His daughters are pursuing higher education in various fields such as MSc in horticulture, MCA and BBA respectively. Abhishek is the youngest, and he secured 2372 rank in JEE Advanced. Vijendra Kumar's elder son is studying BBA, while his younger son Shivam achieved 2989 rank in JEE Advanced.Both Abhishek and Shivam aspire to pursue BTech in computer science from IIT.Abhishek and Shivam said it was their fathers who made them aware of the JEE examination two years ago. Their dads came to know about it while doing paint work at a private school.Inspired by their fathers’ desire to see their sons become successful, the cousins agreed to prepare for IIT entrance exam. The two children got enrolled in this school, and began taking coaching classes alongside their school studies.The cousins said their motto is 'discipline, dedication and determination.' They study together, dedicating an additional 6-7 hours of studies at home after their eight-hour coaching sessions. They solve difficult problems together.When asked how social media has influenced them, they said it was 'a recipe for failure' and hence stayed away from it.Shivam and Abhishek excelled in class 12 boards as well. Shivam scored 86% in class 12 and 84% in class 10 board exam from Agra. Abhishek completed his education up to class 10 in Jhansi, securing 87% in class 10. He scored 89% in class 12 board exams.Abhishek and Shivam together said, “We used to study together and motivate each other. Despite financial constraints, our parents supported us; they would always keep a tab on how we progressed and boosted our confidence. We never counted the study hours, but prioritised completing assignments and targets set for the day. We focused on doing a lot of revision and solving mock questions papers. We dedicate our success to our fathers, who encouraged us to dream big. We assure that their hard work will not go in vain.”","Shivam and Abhishek cracked the JEE Advanced examination by achieving 2989 and 2372 ranks respectively.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Baltimore Port shipping channel reopens 11 weeks after bridge collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baltimore-port-shipping-channel-reopens-11-weeks-after-bridge-collapse/articleshow/110887855.cms,"Explosive charges are detonated to bring down collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge resting on container ship Dali (AP file photo)

NEW DELHI: Baltimore's main shipping channel has reopened to its original depth and width following the March 26 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge . The reopening follows an extensive cleanup effort , during which crews removed an estimated 50,000 tons of steel and concrete from the Patapsco River.

The US Army Corps of Engineers certified the riverbed as safe for transit on Monday, confirming that the Fort McHenry Federal Channel has been restored to its original dimensions of 700 feet wide and 50 feet deep. This allows for two-way traffic and removes the additional safety requirements that had been in place due to the temporarily reduced channel width.

The channel had been obstructed by the wreckage of the bridge, which collapsed after a container ship, the Dali , lost power and crashed into one of bridge's supporting columns. The incident resulted in the deaths of six members of a roadwork crew, all of whom were Latino immigrants working an overnight shift to fill potholes on the bridge.

The operation involved more than 1,500 individual responders and 500 specialists from around the world, utilizing a fleet of boats. The effort included 56 federal, state, and local agencies. Surveying and removal of steel at and below the 50-foot mud-line will continue to ensure future dredging operations are not impacted, with wreckage transported to Sparrows Point for further processing.

In April, the FBI opened a criminal investigation into the collapse. The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the Dali had lost electrical power several times before the crash, including experiencing a blackout during in-port maintenance and shortly before the collision. Maryland estimates it will cost $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion to rebuild the bridge, with completion anticipated by fall 2028.

Trump was interviewed by a New York City probation officer to prepare a report for Judge Juan M Merchan ahead of Trump's July 11 sentencing in his hush money criminal case .This report will assist the judge in determining Trump's punishment following his May 30 felony conviction for falsifying business records related to a potential sex scandal. The judge has a range of options for punishment, from probation and community service to up to four years in prison.Trump, who did not testify during his trial, attended the probation interview via video conference from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. His lawyer, Todd Blanche, was present during the interview. This arrangement has led to complaints of special treatment, but city officials maintain that it is not unusual.Typically, convicted individuals in New York must meet probation officials in person for their presentence interviews and are not allowed to have their lawyers present. However, after Blanche's objections, Judge Merchan allowed him to attend Trump's interview.Public defenders in the city have criticized the special arrangements made for Trump and have called for equal treatment for all convicted individuals. They argued that all defendants should be allowed counsel during their probation interviews, not just those with significant financial resources.Presentence reports include a defendant’s personal history, criminal record, employment details, and any family obligations. These reports, prepared by probation officers, social workers, or psychologists, also offer defendants a chance to explain why they believe they deserve a lighter sentence.Trump's conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records stems from efforts to conceal a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels alleged she had a sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.Trump, who is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, plans to appeal his conviction but must wait until after sentencing.

'Millionaire investment banker assaults woman at Brooklyn pride event',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/millionaire-investment-banker-assaults-woman-at-brooklyn-pride-event/articleshow/110881630.cms,"People attend the Brooklyn Pride Parade in Brooklyn, New York (Pic credit: AFP)

NEW DELHI: A disturbing incident occurred during Brooklyn Pride in Park Slope on Saturday night, when millionaire investment banker Jonathan Kaye allegedly assaulted a woman on the street. The shocking act was captured on video, showing Kaye delivering a forceful overhand right punch to the woman's face, sending her crashing to the pavement.

The video, which has garnered nearly 5 million views on social media , shows the woman covering her injured face as she crumpled to the ground. Nearby, another presumably injured person lay on the pavement. The crowd of partygoers reacted in horror to the violent scene.

Social media users quickly identified the assailant as Jonathan Kaye, a managing director at Moelis & Co., a New York-based investment bank. ""We have become aware that one of our employees was involved in a serious incident in Brooklyn on June 8. We take this matter very seriously and are conducting an investigation,"" a spokesperson for Moelis & Co. stated. However, the company did not confirm whether Kaye was the employee in question or if he faced any disciplinary action.

Kaye, who oversees the Global Business Services franchise at Moelis & Co, declined to comment when contacted by The Post. The NYPD has yet to release any information regarding the assault .

The video does not reveal the moments leading up to the incident, but it does show the assailant, believed to be Kaye, walking away with a jacket streaked with liquid. ""She f–king threw s–t all over me,"" Kaye can be heard saying in the footage. Onlookers condemned the attacker, calling him an “asshole” and a “horrible person.”

Reports indicate that the woman suffered a broken nose and another person had their arm injured. The alleged attacker, Kaye, resides in a luxurious four-bedroom townhouse in Park Slope valued at over $4 million, just three blocks away from Ginger’s Bar, one of Brooklyn's last remaining lesbian bars.

The assault took place as thousands gathered in Park Slope to celebrate the 28th annual Brooklyn Pride Multicultural Festival, a day-long event featuring a 5K run and a parade along Fifth Avenue.","A disturbing incident occurred during Brooklyn Pride in Park Slope on Saturday night.

Gen Z is turning away from military service in record numbers; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gen-z-is-turning-away-from-military-service-in-record-numbers-heres-why/articleshow/110863816.cms,"Enter the 'anxious generation'

Waning national pride

The moral imperative

So how do we boost recruitment?

Only 80% of the 69,000 personnel needed to meet future challenges have signed up. The government recently announced recruitment will be opened up to some foreign citizens to try to fill this gap.Not only is the Australian military failing to achieve planned growth, it is actually shrinking, as defence chief general Angus Campbell told a Senate inquiry in February.There are two fundamental reasons for the current recruitment impasse.One is economic - low unemployment and a perception of better opportunities, work conditions and future prospects in the private sector.The other reason is cultural: a declining willingness of Gen Z to identify with - and fight to defend - their nation.Either way, the key to the recruitment crisis lies in understanding the motivations of this generation, the main pool of potential recruits today.We recently interviewed 19 serving Australian soldiers from a range of demographics (two were Gen Z) and across military branches in a study funded by the Australian Defence ForceWe wanted to find out what makes Gen Z recruits tick, and what the force might do to persuade more of them to serve their country.Researchers study every new generation as a guide to the future, from the baby boomers to Generation X (like the authors of this article), and millennials.None is more distinctive than generation Z, or Zoomers - people born roughly between 1997 and 2008.They are the first generation to grow up with smartphones and social media. In his current bestseller, The Anxious Generation, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt outlines the cataclysmal effect: he claims a large increase in depression and anxiety in young people is the direct effect of unsupervised social media use during adolescence.Zoomers' mental health is a barrier to service, as US Marine Corps Lieutenant Matthew Weiss spells out in his book on Gen Z military recruitment.A military career can be detrimental to psychological wellbeing, as Australia's Royal Commission into Veteran Suicide has demonstrated. The force's rigorous mental health entry standards may have reinforced this perception.The soldiers we spoke to said mental health is an issue for recruitment. On one hand, they agreed that service is mentally challenging, and that younger soldiers are more psychologically vulnerable. On the other hand, interviewees said the force's mental health support has been improving. This is a step in the right direction - it may well be that media coverage of veterans' mental health issues worries Zoomers considering enlistment.Weiss argues private sector jobs (and money) afford much more online currency than military service . The respondents in our interviews agreed younger recruits were very savvy about pay and conditions.But there may be another motivator: as shadow defence minister Andrew Hastie recently told the ABC: ""People who join the defence force don't just do it for economic reasons, they do it because they love their country.""This means if love of country falls from generation to generation, military recruitment falls too. Weiss suggests in the United States, low patriotism partly explains Gen Z's reluctance to enlist.Our interviewees said traditional nationalism played only a modest role for enlisting for young people. They thought a lesser sense of obligation and service is one reason.Another is the fact that the black-and-white picture of ""my country right or wrong"" has been muddied following media coverage of alleged Australian war crimes in Afghanistan.The evidence confirms waning national pride among young Australians. We analysed publicly available data from the World Values Survey, a wide-ranging poll of people's values around the globe conducted since 1981.It shows in 1981, 70.3% of Australians were ""very proud"" of their nationality. This fell to 60.8 per cent in 2018, the first year to feature Gen Z members in the survey.That year, only 41.6% of twentysomethings (including some millennials) were very proud Australians - the lowest proportion of any Australian age group in any year since the survey began.All else being equal, older adults tend to be more nationalistic, as surveys in different periods and countries show. But the nationalism gap between old and young has opened up further with Gen Z.According to the survey data, in 1981, 69% of Australians in their twenties were willing to fight for their country. This was a slightly greater proportion than the 65% of over-70s. By 2018, this was reversed, with only 44% of Australians in their twenties willing to fight, compared with 59% of over-70s.Our interviewees suggested that if nationalist values motivate Zoomers, this is only in terms of ""doing the right thing"". This offers an alternative opportunity for recruiters: the changing role of the military towards peacekeeping and disaster relief makes defence attractive to those with humanitarian values.Zoomers fall into this category. Research shows, and our interviewees agreed, that Gen Z care about the environment, diversity, equity and inclusion.This is reflected by their attitudes to work. Zoomers want a calling and not just a career (let alone merely a job). According to our interviewees, young recruits place greater importance on the intrinsic aspects of work, like learning skills, experiencing adventure and challenges.Our own and other research suggests Gen Z is strongly motivated by things that support their own growth and wellbeing, both materially and spiritually, rather than service toward others. Researchers label these ""pro-self"" motivations.Zoomers may be hard to recruit, especially given the increasing war for talent, but they have a great deal to offer the military. They may be the most success-orientated among recent generations. They have an unprecedented ability to handle digital technologies that are becoming increasingly important in the military.The inaugural National Defence Strategy unveiled in April has conceded ""the need for a fundamental transformation of defence's recruitment and retention system"".Many of the proposals to raise military recruitment in Australia are general.The government recently raised pay and bonuses in the defence force, for example. Other measures include making the recruitment process easier, making military service an opt-out system, reducing medical requirements, or increasing the maximum recruitment age and galvanising junior military leaders to change outdated traditions that harm recruitment.Our research suggests building a force that appeals to Gen Z's social values and intrinsic motivations is the way forward. Recruitment strategies need to be tailored.","Only 80% of the 69,000 personnel needed to meet future challenges have signed up.

Pakistan installs social media firewall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-installs-social-media-firewall/articleshow/110883200.cms,"Government sources said the firewall would apply to all popular platforms (AP photo)

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has started installing a nationwide firewall system to regulate social media platforms and stop the spread of undesirable content. Government sources said the firewall would apply to all popular platforms like Facebook, YouTube and X.

The firewall, a senior official said, seeks to identify sources of propaganda material, examine data from various internet protocol addresses and limit the content’s visibility. One of the system’s primary functions is keyword filtering, which identifies and hides offensive content .

Additionally, protocols are being developed to oversee Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which many have employed to evade limitations placed on X, formerly Twitter. Initial restrictions on VPNs drew criticism from the corporate sector, which led the govt to temporarily suspend its implementation.

The X blockade has brought its usage in Pakistan to almost half, from 4.5 million to 2.4 million users. It seems the management of X is gradually adhering to govt directives to block accounts that disseminate fake news, allow conversations on sensitive subjects or circulate contentious ideas.

In April, the home ministry had provided the Islamabad high court a detailed report outlining the rationale for X’s prohibition. The report brought attention to X’s non-registration and its disregard for Pakistani legal requirements.

The report claimed that X’s refusal to comply with Pakistani regulations was the reason for its blocking. It argued that the action did not infringe on fundamental rights.

Pakistan and IMF disagree over new income tax rates that will burden salaried class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-and-imf-disagree-over-new-income-tax-rates-that-will-burden-salaried-class/articleshow/110836835.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons and the imposition of a standard 18 per cent sales tax on agriculture and health sector goods, according to a media report on Sunday.On Friday, Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) authorities discussed the outstanding issues related to taxation and the energy sector.Citing sources, the Express Tribune newspaper reported that both sides could not resolve their differences on the income tax threshold, the merger of salaried and non-salaried rates and the maximum income tax rate for individuals.Discussions are revolving around whether to charge a new backbreaking 45 per cent income tax from salaried and non-salaried individuals on a monthly income of just over Pakistani Rs 4,67,000, sources said.At present, the maximum rate of 35 per cent applies to a monthly income of over Pakistani Rs 5,00,000.However, both sides have converged on the issue of increasing the income tax burden on exporters in the next budget who paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 86 billion this year, which is 280 per cent less than the taxes paid by the salaried people.Pakistan also showed a willingness to tax pensions beyond a certain income threshold.In the latest talks, the international money lender insisted on merging the slabs related to salaried, non-salaried and other incomes.On the government's proposal of increasing the annual threshold of taxable income to Pakistani Rs 9,00,000, the IMF is asking for the maximum income tax rate to be increased from 35 per cent to 45 per cent.However, the government is unwilling to increase the maximum rate for salaried individuals to 45 per cent but showed flexibility to keep the taxable income threshold at the current Pakistani Rs 6,00,000.It is also asking to keep the salaried and non-salaried slabs separate but is willing to increase the highest tax rate for non-salaried persons to 45 per cent, said the sources.The non-salaried business individuals pay tax after excluding expenses while the salaried persons pay tax on their gross income without excluding the expenses.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is until now unwilling to increase the burden on the salaried class .According to a proposal, if the taxable income threshold is increased to Pakistani Rs 900,000 per annum, the income tax rate can be up to 7.5 per cent on a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 100,000. The current rate is 2.5 per cent for this category.For the next slab, if the monthly income is up to Pakistani Rs 133,000, the under-discussion tax rate is 20 per cent. The current rate is 12.5 per cent, that too for up to a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 200,000.The IMF wants a higher rate at the lower income level. This slab will directly hit Pakistan's middle-income group.At present, on an income of over Pakistani Rs 500,000, a 35 per cent tax rate is charged. The salaried class has until now paid Pakistani Rs 325 billion in income tax in 11 months, which is expected to rise to around Pakistani Rs 360 billion at the end of the current fiscal year.If the revised income tax rates are accepted, the tax contribution of the salaried class will jump to Pakistani Rs 540 billion in the next fiscal year, said the sources. To absorb this increase in the tax rates, even a 30 per cent pay hike will not be sufficient.Sources said that the IMF had asked Pakistan to share alternative proposals, in case it was unwilling to increase the tax burden on the salaried class. Another round of discussions is expected soon.Sources said that an understanding had been reached between Pakistan and the IMF on changing the tax regime for the richest exporters.As against the existing one per cent final income tax on exporters, it has been proposed that from the next fiscal year, the one per cent rate should be treated as a minimum, according to government sources.Pakistan's taxation system promotes inequality and puts a higher burden on people who have little capacity to bear it. The IMF has asked Pakistan to end all special tax regimes, like the low-income tax on gains made by investing in the stock market and bank deposits.The global lender has recommended treating these gains as part of normal income. The IMF is pushing Pakistan to increase the burden on the salaried class until the country recovers higher taxes from the non-salaried business individuals.During the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the exporters paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 85.5 billion in taxes, which was Pakistani Rs 241 billion, or 280 per cent, less than the amount paid by the salaried class.During July-May FY24, the salaried class paid Pakistani Rs 326 billion in taxes, higher by 40 per cent, or Pakistani Rs 93 billion, compared to the same period last year.The record Pakistani Rs 326 billion in tax payments by the salaried class is also 223 per cent more than the combined tax paid by the rich exporters and influential retailers.Sources said that there was also no consensus on slapping the standard 18 per cent sales tax on fertiliser, pesticides and seeds – the crucial inputs for the agriculture sector.The government was also unwilling to impose an 18 per cent sales tax on medicines, solar panels and medical and surgical equipment. In case, the 18 per cent tax is imposed on medicines, there will be an additional collection of Pakistani Rs 130 billion in the next fiscal year.Similarly, taxing the medical and health-related supplies will generate another Pakistani Rs 100 billion, according to the paper.Pakistan urgently needs a new loan from the IMF to keep the fear of default at bay. The government is eager to ink the agreement before the end of June when the fiscal year ends.","Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons. The IMF is asking for the maximum income tax rate to be increased from 35 per cent to 45 per cent. However, the government is unwilling to increase the maximum rate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110839031,imgsize-60334,width-400,resizemode-4/110839031.jpg"

However, after 10 days, the child developed bilateral lower limb weakness, which progressively worsened and eventually affected the upper limbs, as reported by Dawn.He was subsequently admitted to the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) in Karachi, where he was diagnosed with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). Despite medical efforts, the child succumbed to the illness on May 22.Samples collected from three contacts of the victim revealed the presence of the wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in one of the siblings and a cousin residing in the same household. Importantly, there was no history of recent travel to other districts prior to the onset of paralysis, indicating local transmission.Investigations are underway to determine whether the case resulted from vaccine refusal, although records indicate that the child had received five doses of vaccine during supplementary immunisation activities.Malik Mukhtar Bharath, the prime minister's coordinator on national health services, emphasised that until Pakistan achieves polio eradication, children remain vulnerable to this debilitating disease.Muhammad Anwarul Haq, coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, highlighted the ongoing efforts to investigate the source of the virus and identify gaps in vaccination coverage .

Nepal Parliament approves ratification for framework agreement related to International Solar Alliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-parliament-approves-ratification-for-framework-agreement-related-to-international-solar-alliance/articleshow/110819158.cms,"File Photo (Picture Credit: ANI)

KATHMANDU: Nepal's House of Representatives has passed a proposal seeking ratification of a framework agreement related to the membership of the International Solar Alliance that will help the Himalayan nation increase usage of solar power in its effort to combat the impact due to changing climate. The House of Representatives (HoR), or the Lower House on Thursday endorsed the proposal tabled by minister for energy, water resources and irrigation, Shakti Bahadur Basnet through a majority vote.

The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was conceived as a joint effort by India and France to mobilise efforts against climate change through the deployment of solar energy solutions and announced on the sidelines of the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Paris in 2015.

With the amendment of its Framework Agreement in 2020, all member states of the United Nations are eligible to join the ISA. At present, 119 countries, including Nepal, are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement, of which 98 countries have submitted the necessary instruments of ratification to become full members of the ISA.

Responding to queries raised by lawmakers from various political parties, Basnet said that the agreement was tabled in keeping with the national interest of the country as clean energy is essential for minimising the impacts of climate change.

""The installation of solar energy will be important for Nepal's development,"" he pointed out and informed the House that the government has already moved the process for the generation of 1,000 MW through solar power in the next couple of years.

A competitive bidding for Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) has already started for the same and bidding for PPA of 800 MW has already opened, he added.

Rajendra Khatrichhetri, a lawmaker belonging to opposition Nepali Congress, welcomed the government's move as he said, ""This is a good proposal as it will provide cheap and affordable energy to the general public and also helps to minimise the impacts of climate change.""

LONDON: Global payments processors visa and mastercard must face a new set of lawsuits over fees charged to retailers , after a London tribunal ruled on Friday that collective cases brought on behalf of merchants can proceed.

The two firms already face a long list of lawsuits in London over multilateral interchange fees, which retailers pay when consumers use a card to shop.

Visa and Mastercard are each being sued by hundreds of claimants at London's competition appeal tribunal , which is managing the various cases together.

Special purpose vehicle commercial and interregional card claims brought another set of lawsuits against visa and mastercard in 2022, seeking damages on behalf of merchants who were allegedly overcharged.

The tribunal initially refused to certify its cases under the United Kingdom 's collective proceedings' regime, which is similar to class actions in the United States.

However, the tribunal ruled on Friday that the cases would be certified, subject to any representations by other parties who might have an interest in the cases.

Leicester's Diwali festival under threat as council can't afford the costs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/leicesters-diwali-festival-under-threat-as-council-cant-afford-the-costs/articleshow/110776008.cms,"LONDON: Leicester’s Diwali celebrations — considered to be the largest outside India — could get cancelled as the city council which funds them can no longer afford the massive costs .

The two-day event, which consists of a spectacular switch-on of 6,000 LED lights shaped as diyas, on the Golden Mile and stage performances, fair rides and fireworks two weeks before Diwali, and then another event, including live music and a lantern procession on Diwali Day, costs Leicester city council £250,000 (Rs 2.6 crore).

Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby now says the £250,000 price tag is “unsustainable”. This has triggered Conservative Leicester East candidate Shivani Raja and former MP Keith Vaz to start petitions to the council calling for the celebrations, which attract over 40,000 people and benefit local businesses, to be saved.

A city council spokesperson said: “We recently met with members of the Leicester Hindu Festival Council and local ward councillors to advise them that funding for all of the council’s festivals and events is under review, owing to huge pressures on the council’s finances. Having announced last Sep that funding two events for Diwali was no longer sustainable, we’re now reviewing whether we can support even one event – which would cost £130k — without significant funding from elsewhere. It’s important to emphasise that no decisions have yet been made, but we wanted to be open with our partners while there’s still time to explore possible sources of alternative funding.”

Labour candidate for Leicester East Rajesh Agrawal said the issue was getting raised on the doorsteps during canvassing.“The council is under huge financial pressure ,” he said, “and the future of these celebrations is uncertain. We need more sources of funding. Having been deputy mayor of London, I know how important such events are to promote a city. I am determined to save them.”
