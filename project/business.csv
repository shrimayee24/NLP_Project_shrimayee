NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will arrive in Jeddah today for a two-day official visit to Saudi Arabia, marking his first-ever visit to the Kingdom’s commercial capital. Invited by Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman, this trip will be PM Modi’s third to the Kingdom after earlier visits in 2016 and 2019. It comes as part of the ongoing high-level diplomatic engagements between the two nations, following the Crown Prince’s own state visit to New Delhi for the G20 Summit in September 2023.PM Modi and the Crown Prince will co-chair the second meeting of the India-Saudi Arabia Strategic Partnership Council during the visit. According to Indian Ambassador Suhel Ajaz Khan, a large number of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) are expected to be signed, with key discussions centred on strengthening economic ties, bolstering defence cooperation and addressing regional political challenges.During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Jeddah, India and Saudi Arabia are set to sign at least six MoUs on Tuesday, with talks ongoing to finalize more. Key agreements are expected in space, energy, health, science, culture, and advanced technology, news agency PTI reported quoting sources. PM Modi will also discuss the Hajj quota for Indian pilgrims with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Sources said over a dozen MoUs are under discussion, with efforts underway to conclude additional deals in trade, investment, and defence.""Jeddah is a very, very significant city in terms of connectivity between India and Saudi Arabia because for centuries, Jeddah was the port for the trade between the two countries, and it is also a gateway to Mecca. So anyone who is coming for Umrah and Hajj lands up in Jeddah and then goes to Mecca,"" Indian ambassador to Saudi Arabia Suhel Ajaz Khan told PTI ahead of the prime minister's visit.""Hajj is a very important activity and the Government of India gives it a lot of importance. Ministry of Minority Affairs has been arranging this activity... There are various issues discussed in the bilateral talks. There has always been a great coordination between the Saudi government and India on Hajj,"" the ambassador said.India’s Haj quota for 2025 has increased to 175,025 from 136,020 in 2014, with arrangements in place for 122,518 pilgrims. However, around 42,000 Indians may miss the pilgrimage this year due to delays by Combined Haj Group Operators in finalizing contracts.Ambassador Khan highlighted that around 2.7 million Indians reside in Saudi Arabia, significantly contributing to the Kingdom’s development while maintaining close cultural and familial ties with India.On the defence front, the visit is expected to provide further momentum to an already robust partnership. India and Saudi Arabia signed a bilateral defence cooperation MoU in 2014, and have since conducted joint naval and land exercises.Plans are underway for another round of naval drills soon, as per Khan.Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri noted that regional and international issues such as the situation in West Asia, the Israel-Palestine conflict, and maritime security concerns related to Houthi attacks will also be discussed.Bilateral trade between the two nations currently stands at around $43 billion, and PM Modi’s visit is seen as a key step in not only boosting economic ties but also strengthening India’s engagement with the broader Gulf and Islamic world.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi will arrive in Jeddah today for a two-day official visit to Saudi Arabia.

The missed visit



Canonisations that inspired a nation



A papacy marked by both unity and discord



NEW DELHI: Pope Francis and India shared a deep yet distant relationship of spiritual milestones, gestures of recognition of cardinals, and an unfulfilled dream—a papal visit that never came to pass.The visit that was most likely to be held this year- the Jubilee Year - could not materialize as the Pope passed away on Easter Monday at the age of 88.His departure attracted condolence from leaders across political ideologies with Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalling his meeting him. ""I fondly recall my meetings with him and was greatly inspired by his commitment to inclusive and all-round development. His affection for the people of India will always be cherished. May his soul find eternal peace in God’s embrace,"" he said.Despite his long-standing desire to visit India, Pope Francis never made the journey. Hopes were high that his visit would align with PM Modi’s trip to the Vatican, but the plan ultimately didn’t materialize. Still, his efforts to strengthen ties with India’s Catholic community never waned.Just months before his passing, Francis elevated Indian priest George Jacob Koovakad to the rank of Cardinal—a significant moment that underscored his recognition of the country’s vibrant Catholic presence. The 51-year-old from Kerala’s Archdiocese of Changanassery became the sixth Indian cardinal, appointed during a grand consistory at St Peter’s Basilica on December 7, 2024. Koovakad, a key Vatican figure responsible for coordinating the Pope’s international travels since 2020, also serves as the Prefect of the Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue.PM Modi and senior church leaders welcomed the announcement with pride, with Union minister George Kurian leading a delegation to witness the historic ceremony in Rome.Pope Francis's tenure saw several landmark canonisations that brought joy to the Indian faithful. In 2014, he elevated Fr Kuriakose Elias Chavara and Sister Euphrasia Eluvathingal—both from Kerala—to sainthood. This was followed in 2019 by the canonisation of Mariam Thresia, another Kerala-born nun, adding to the growing list of Indian saints .Perhaps most notably, in 2022, Pope Francis canonised Devasahayam Pillai, an 18th-century Hindu convert to Christianity from Tamil Nadu. He became the first Indian layperson to be declared a saint, an event celebrated by both the Catholic Church and the wider Indian Christian community.However, Pope Francis’s papacy also faced challenges within the Indian Church, particularly surrounding the contentious issue of liturgical uniformity in the Syro-Malabar Church. A Vatican-endorsed directive—known as the ""50:50 formula""—required priests to face the altar for the bulk of the Holy Mass, diverging from the tradition in some dioceses of facing the congregation throughout.The directive sparked ongoing protests in the Ernakulam–Angamaly Archdiocese, with a strong section of priests and laity refusing to adopt the change. The dispute led to the resignation of Cardinal George Alencherry as the Major Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church in 2023. He was succeeded by Bishop Raphael Thattil, as the Church continued grappling with internal divisions.","Despite his long-standing desire to visit India, Pope Francis never made the journey.

Gandhi, along with many other opposition leaders had questioned the credibility of poll body repeatedly.Earlier, the sources in the Election Commission had told ANI news agency that the allegations of manipulated electoral rolls were unfounded. They mentioned that during the recent Special Summary Revision (SSR) published in January 2025, there were very few appeals or corrections sought under Sections 22 to 24 of the Representation of People Act.The SSR is a routine process to update electoral rolls, ensuring the inclusion of new voters and removal of duplicates or deceased individuals. According to officials, only 89 appeals were filed in Maharashtra, despite the presence of over 13.8 million Booth Level Agents (BLAs) across the country. With such low contestation, sources said the final electoral rolls must be considered undisputed.During his speech, Rahul Gandhi also spoke about India-US relations , expressing optimism about continued cooperation between the two nations.""We have a partnership with the US, and hopefully we will continue to work together,"" he said.He also thanked members of the diaspora for supporting the Congress party abroad.

Pune: Ranjana Sonawane ’s happiness knew no bounds on Monday when she received a demand draft for Rs 13,500 as a Mukhyamantri Mazhi Ladki Bahin Yojana beneficiary after Nandurbar’s collector Mitali Sethi intervened.Ranjana from Tembhli village in Shahada tehsil of Nandurbar district in Maharashtra was the first recepient of Aadhaar in 2010. But she was deprived of the Ladki Bahin benefits as her card was linked to someone else’s bank account in Mumbai where the monthly welfare benefit was deposited for the last nine months.A TOI report on April 18 highlighted Ranjana’s plight where she made futile efforts to rectify the error.After receiving the demand draft, Ranjana told TOI, “I waited for so long and made several rounds of govt offices and banks for the benefits. The administration acted promptly after the media report. I will use the amount for my son’s college fees, and other family expenses,” she said.Sethi, who had told TOI that she would look into Ranjana’s case, coordinated with the bank’s officials in Mumbai for delinking the fraudulent account.She said: “We initiated the recovery process from the account where her benefits were being transferred. The bank gave us a demand draft on Monday. It was handed over to Ranjana by Shahada tehsildar Deepak Girase.”Sethi also supervised the opening of a new post office savings account for Ranjana on Saturday for the Ladki Bahin benefits transfer.Girase said, “We have handed over the DD to the recipient and will check for any more fraudulent accounts like hers.”The bank will complete its investigation into the account where Ranjana’s Ladki Bahin amount of Rs 1,500 was being transferred since July 2024 when the Mahayuti govt in Maharashtra launched it before the Nov 2024 assembly election.Vivek Walvi, Nandurbar district’s women and child development officer, said, “We ensured that Ranjana got the entire amount from July. Her new account in the post office has been linked to her Aadhaar and the April amount will flow to this account.”Both Girase and Walvi will also check the entire list of beneficiaries and monitor others’ complaints.Sethi said Rajana’s case may not be the only one among the state’s 2.5 crore Ladki Bahin beneficiaries. She has set up a dedicated helpline for Nandurbar district to assist others facing similar issues.

WHO warns of health crisis due to small pool of anti-fungal meds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-warns-of-health-crisis-due-to-small-pool-of-anti-fungal-meds/articleshow/120501439.cms,"New Delhi: One of the most painful memories of the Covid-19 pandemic was families of patients suffering from a serious fungal infection called mucormycosis struggling to find drugs to treat the condition. In many cases, they couldn't get it in time leading to complications and even death.While the intensity of the drug crisis may have waned with the end of the pandemic, doctors say, the struggle to manage fungal infections continues due to the scarcity of antifungal drugs and growing resistance against the existing ones.A first-of-its-kind report released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) warns that if steps are not taken to increase the pool of antifungal medications soon, the shortage may lead to a public health crisis .""Invasive fungal infections threaten the lives of the most vulnerable, but countries lack the treatments needed to save lives,"" said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Antimicrobial Resistance ad interim.He said, ""Not only is the pipeline of new antifungal drugs and diagnostics insufficient, but there is also a void in fungal testing in low- and middle-income countries, even in district hospitals. This diagnostic gap means the cause of people's suffering remains unknown, making it difficult to get them right treatments.""Dr Rajesh Chawla, a critical care specialist at Delhi's Indraprastha Apollo hospital said even now they keep getting patients with serious fungal infections and it is becoming increasingly difficult to manage them because in many cases the fungi causing the infection are found to be resistant to existing drugs.","A first-of-its-kind report released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) warns that if steps are not taken to increase the pool of antifungal medications soon, the shortage may lead to a public health crisis.

Novo Nordisk to phase out its largest insulin brand in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/novo-nordisk-to-phase-out-its-largest-insulin-brand-in-india/articleshow/120501423.cms,"In a move which could shake up the diabetes market, Novo Nordisk is discontinuing the country’s largest selling insulin, Human Mixtard, among other older insulin brands in India. Human Mixtard alone is a Rs 800 crore brand for Novo Nordisk in India, despite it being under price control. Besides Human Mixtard, the phase-out could impact its top brands in the Rs 5,000 crore insulin market including Actrapid, Insulatard, Insulin Detemir and Levemir and Xultophy — marketed mostly in the format of pre-filled disposable pen and cartridges (Penfill and FlexPen).The company recently informed its marketing partner, Abbott India that the products would be discontinued once the current stocks are exhausted, documents accessed by TOI said. This could take about six months.The decision is in line with the global strategy of the Danish company to prioritise newer, patented blockbuster diabetes and weight loss therapies including Ozempic and Wegovy , due to their higher profitability, sources said. Also, it seems to be potentially in line with its plans to introduce these therapies in the Indian market this year.As part of its global strategy, earlier generation insulin products will be discontinued globally in a gradual manner. An email sent on April 17 to the company went unanswered.However, the company plans to continue selling Human Mixtard, Actrapid and Insulatard, in vials — which can be delivered to patients through injections. This may limit the access further as insulin delivery from pen devices is preferred by a huge majority of diabetics over vials injected with syringes, due to its accuracy, ease of dosing, and reduced stigma, a survey said earlier.","Human Mixtard alone is a Rs 800 crore brand for Novo Nordisk in India, despite it being under price control.

Kidney failure

is a chronic problem’

NEW DELHI: Dialysis has emerged as the most sought-after treatment under Ayushman Bharat-PM Jan Arogya Yojana. In the past six years since the central health scheme was launched, data shows more than 64 lakh patients have undergone the procedure.Tamil Nadu has carried out 7.3 lakh dialysis cycles, according to latest data uploaded by National Health Authority, implementing agency for AB-PMJAY, on its website. Madhya Pradesh is next at 5.4 lakh, followed by Uttar Pradesh (5L) and Gujarat (3.4L).Dialysis is provided free of cost to people under the scheme that offers an annual cover of Rs 5L a family for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation. Senior citizens are eligible for the scheme irrespective of their economic status.Every year, about 2.2 lakh new patients of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) get added in India resulting in additional demand for 3.4 crore dialysis every year. The cost of dialysis varies, with a typical per-session cost ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000.“Kidney failure is a chronic problem and patients suffering from the condition require undergoing dialysis twice weekly for survival. That’s why the number of this procedure is so high,” Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder director of Ujala Cygnus group of hospitals said. He added that diabetes is a leading cause of kidney failure and preventing or delaying its onset could help reduce risk of chronic kidney disease and, therefore, the need for dialysis.“We also need to boost infrastructure and design policy to increase kidney transplants which can help such patients avoid dialysis,” Dr Bajaj added.The health ministry also runs ‘Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Program’ (PMNDP) to make dialysis services available for free to the poor. Apart from dialysis, NHA data shows AB-PMJAY is utilised by the beneficiaries for procedures such as cataract removal, angioplasty, and caesarean deliveries.","Tamil Nadu has carried out 7.3 lakh dialysis cycles, according to latest data.

Elderly travel up to 44 kilometres to get hospitalised: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/elderly-travel-up-to-44-kilometres-to-get-hospitalised-study/articleshow/120499755.cms,"Ai generated image

NEW DELHI: An elderly person in India must commute up to 15 km to avail out-patient services, and almost 44 km for in-patient care requiring hospitalisation, claims a new study published in The Lancet Regional Health– Southeast Asia.Researchers analysed data of nearly 32,000 older adults, aged 60 and above, collected during the first wave of the Longitudinal Ageing Study of India (LASI) in 2017-2018 and found there was a significant urban-rural disparity also with the urban older adults availing out-patient facilities within 10 km of reach, while the distance was nearly 30 km for their rural counterparts.According to the Lancet study, rates of availing both out-patient and in-patient services were found to be high — 73% and 40%, respectively — when a facility was within 10 km of reach. However, with an increase in commute distance, a commensurate decline in the use of out-patient services was found — 17% utilisation of facilities for 11-30 km distance, and 10% for 30 km and above, respectively, it adds.A longer commute and far-away facility is a barrier for receiving timely, essential healthcare for people in this age group, often seen grappling with multiple long-term, debilitating conditions requiring continuous care, the research team said.They wrote, “Older adults, on an average, travelled a distance of nine miles (14.5 kilometres) to seek outpatient services and 27 miles (43.6 kilometres) for inpatient care respectively.”State-wise, Tripura, Manipur and Kerala, had the highest in-patient and outpatient visits within 10 km — over 80%, 75% and 59% of older adults availed in-patient services, respectively, while 88%, 78% and 84% availed out-patient ones, respectively.The authors attributed Kerala’s high rates to “easy access and better availability of infrastructure”. In Manipur and Tripura, it may be because people rely on nearby facilities during emergency in-patient situations, they said. Hilly states such as Nagaland, Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh could pose geographical challenges as 0%, 17% and about 5%of older adults in these areas made in-patient visits within 10 km, the study found. Further, in northeastern states, such as Mizoram and Nagaland, a higher percentage of older adults were found to travel more than 60 km to access in-patient and out-patient services, indicating a poor and limited access to nearby facilities.Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh showed a moderate proximity of 11-60 km for older adults accessing out-patient care, but a higher share of in-patient visits at distances beyond 30 km.","Researchers analysed data of nearly 32,000 older adults, aged 60 and above.

According to the US, they formally announced the finalisation of the Terms of Reference for the negotiations, laying down a roadmap for further discussions about shared economic priorities.Both sides backed an early conclusion of the agreement, which will allow India to stave off the threat from the Trump administration’s reciprocal tariffs , as Vance underscored the US pursuit of a fair and balanced trade relationship with India.“The BTA presents an opportunity to negotiate a new and modern trade agreement focused on promoting job creation and citizen well-being in both countries, with the goal of enhancing bilateral trade and supply-chain integration in a balanced and mutually beneficial manner. Guided by their respective visions of ‘ Amrit Kaal for India ’ and ‘ Golden Age for America ,’ BTA is expected to create new opportunities of growth for workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs in both countries,’’ said an American readout of the meeting.There was also talk about the Quad summit that India will host later this year and PM Modi said he was looking forward to hosting Trump for the meeting. However, while the US readout recalled the “positive and successful” meeting between PM Modi and Trump in February, it was silent on the proposed Trump visit to India.Vance and family, accompanied by senior US officials, landed in Delhi on Monday morning and were received at the airport by union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. The delegation left for Jaipur after the dinner meeting with PM Modi, which was described by the Vance delegation as pleasant and productive, in the evening.According to an Indian statement, PM Modi and Vance reviewed and positively assessed the progress in various areas of bilateral cooperation, while taking note of continued efforts towards enhancing cooperation in energy, defence, strategic technologies and other areas. The US is looking to ramp up its defence exports to India, hoping it will help bridge its trade deficit with India. Cooperation in critical and emerging technologies, and also small and advanced modular reactors, is also on top of the Indian agenda with the US.The two leaders also exchanged views on various regional and global issues of mutual interest and called for dialogue and diplomacy as the way forward, according to the Indian government. There was a discussion on the situation in both Ukraine and Gaza, with the PM reiterating India’s support for peace talks involving all stakeholders.PM Modi was said to have fondly recalled his visit to the US in February, within weeks of Trump’s return to the White House, and his “fruitful discussions with President Trump which laid down the roadmap for close cooperation between India and the US, leveraging the strengths of Make America Great Again (MAGA) and Viksit Bharat 2047”. The US side too recalled that during that meeting, the leaders had reaffirmed the strength of the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership and jointly launched the India-U.S. COMPACT (Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce & Technology) for the 21st Century, an initiative anchored in mutual trust, shared interests, goodwill, and robust engagement of their citizens.“Prime Minister extended his best wishes to the Vice President, Second Lady and their children for a pleasant and productive stay in India,’’ said the Indian government.","Both sides backed an early conclusion of the agreement, which will allow India to stave off the threat from the Trump administration’s reciprocal tariffs.

Bureaucracy must be ‘active facilitator’ of growth not just ‘keeper of rule books’: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bureaucracy-must-be-active-facilitator-of-growth-not-just-keeper-of-rule-books-pm-modi/articleshow/120497133.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the global churn has thrown up opportunities for India and that it was the responsibility of bureaucracy that these don't go to waste.Addressing Civil Services Day celebrations, PM Modi said bureaucracy and policymaking cannot function on outdated frameworks in a rapidly changing world, and stressed that as the world is eager to invest in India, it is essential to take all necessary steps to ensure these opportunities are not missed.Bureaucracy must evolve into an “active facilitator” of growth rather than merely being the “keeper of rule books”, he added, urging bureaucrats to ensure comprehensive and inclusive development.“There was a time when the role of bureaucracy was primarily that of a regulator — one that controlled the pace of industrialisation and entrepreneurship. But the country has now moved far beyond that mindset. Today, we are creating an environment that promotes enterprise among citizens and helps them overcome every barrier. Therefore, the civil services must become an enabler — not merely the keeper of rule books but an active facilitator of growth,” PM Modi said.The remarks came against the backdrop of the anticipation that the volatility US President Donald Trump has injected into global trade may result in opportunities for India and, simultaneously, the apprehension that a well-entrenched mindset of bureaucracy might come in the way .On the crucial role of bureaucracy in achieving goals related to energy security, clean energy, sports, space and others, the PM said it has a great responsibility to ensure that there is no delay in achieving the goal of making India the world’s third-largest economy. “We must evaluate every sector: is our current speed sufficient to achieve the targets we’ve set? If not, we must accelerate. We must remember that we now have access to technologies that didn’t exist before — we must move forward with the power of technology,” he said.Referring to progress made in the past decade and the tasks ahead such as building more houses for the poor, tap water connection to every household, better waste management and free medical treatment up to Rs 5 lakh, PM Modi said now there is a need to fulfil new commitments for nutrition across the country. “Our single goal should be: 100% coverage, 100% impact. This very approach has helped bring 25 crore people out of poverty in the past 10 years. And, this same approach will lead to a poverty-free Bharat,” the PM said.He added that true progress doesn’t mean minor changes but full-scale impact. Clean water in every home, quality education for every child, financial access for every entrepreneur and digital economy benefits reaching every village, this is what holistic development truly means, the PM said. “I believe that quality in governance doesn’t come just by launching schemes. Rather, quality in governance is defined by how deeply a scheme reaches people and what real impact it creates,” PM Modi said.","Bureaucracy must evolve into an ‘active facilitator’ of growth, PM Modi says. He urges bureaucrats to ensure comprehensive and inclusive development.

NEW DELHI: In an incident reminiscent of the Atul Subhash case , a 33-year-old techie from Uttar Pradesh, Mohit Yadav , has died by suicide, allegedly due to mental harassment by his wife. In a video message recorded before his death, Yadav cited the lack of legal protection for men as a key reason behind his decision.""By the time you get this video, I will be gone from this world. If there was a law for men, maybe I wouldn’t have taken this step. I couldn’t bear the mental torture by my wife and her family. Mom, Dad, please forgive me,"" Yadav said in the video. ""If I don’t get justice even after my death, then let my ashes be immersed in a drain,"" he added.He claimed that his wife Priya Yadav threatened him to register his house and property in her name and accused his mother-in-law of making his wife abort their child. The TOI could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.""My wife threatened me that if I didn't register my house and property in her name, she would implicate my family in a dowry case. Her father, Manoj Yadav, filed a false complaint, and her brother threatened to kill me,"" he said.This comes only two days after a 30-year-old woman in UP was booked for allegedly driving her husband, Mohit Tyagi, a 34-year-old media professional, to suicide through constant harassment and financial demands. According to the FIR filed by Mohit's brother, the trouble began soon after Mohit married Priyanka from Sambhal in December 2020. She allegedly took off with gifted jewellery and lodged false complaints against him and his family.Last year in December, Atul Subhash, a 34-year-old Bengaluru techie, died by suicide in his apartment. Before his death, he left behind a 24-page note and a video message, in which he accused his wife and in-laws of relentless harassment. He alleged they had filed eight false police complaints against him and demanded Rs 3 crore to settle a divorce, along with an additional Rs 30 lakh for access to his son. Following a complaint lodged by Atul’s younger brother, Bikas Modi, the three accused were arrested.Also read: Meerut murder Déjà Vu: Woman, lover kill hubby in UP","Mohit Yadav, a 33-year-old techie from Uttar Pradesh, has died by suicide.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police is investigating if alterations being carried out at a meat shop on the ground floor may have triggered the collapse of a four-storey building in Mustafabad area , which resulted in 11 deaths on Saturday.According to the FIR, just hours before the incident, construction work was underway at the shop. ""The owner (Tehsin) and others removed the wall between two shops on the ground floor, bypassing the building norms and committing negligence,"" it said. A police source said, ""We are also probing if seepage led to the weakening of the foundation.""The source said the building was constructed in a phased manner - the initial structure consisted of ground and first levels, and two more floors were added later. Police will question the builder and obtain the building's original layout. They will also seek documents from MCD related to the building's approval and compliance.Police said MCD will conduct a thorough inspection of the building on Monday to assess the structural integrity and identify potential causes of the collapse. Police will focus their inquiry on the ground-floor shops, and question their owners or anyone who had taken them on rent. Cops are also likely to seek the help of experts to reconstruct the scene of the collapse by using 3D laser scanning technology.Meanwhile, the postmortems of the 11 victims were conducted on Sunday. Family members of the deceased were overcome with grief as the bodies were brought out in ambulances.At the spot, several relatives searched for the belongings of their loved ones that might be buried under the rubble. Shehzad Ahmad, who lost his nephews Danish and Naved in the incident, said they had sold their land in Bijnor to fund two weddings in the family. “They saved some cash and jewellery, which is now trapped under the debris,” he said. The family was homeless now, he said, adding, “Everything is lost.”Neha, the sister of Danish and Naved, suffered injuries, but managed to save her parents from the debris. However, the family is now left shattered. Alim Ali, the relative of Reshma, another victim, said her two daughters, son and husband were injured in the incident. “All their savings are gone.

Portland’s rebuild continues

Theand Portland Trail Blazers are reportedly discussing a major offseason trade that could shake up both rosters. According to predictions, the Warriors may part ways with Jonathan Kuminga in a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Portland’s high-scoring guardHere’s the proposed deal:- G Anfernee Simons- F Jonathan Kuminga (via sign-and-trade)- SG Moses MoodyKuminga’s future with Golden State has been uncertain for months. Despite being the team’s third-leading scorer at just 22 years old, he was benched in crucial games, signaling a potential exit.As Bleacher Report’s Greg Swartz noted:Key reasons for Golden State:- Anfernee Simons provides immediate scoring (19.3 PPG last season) and playmaking (4.8 APG).- His 36.3% three-point shooting complements Stephen Curry ’s gravity.- At 25, he fits the Golden State Warriors’ need for dependable youth.Portland lacks the cap space to sign Kuminga outright, making a trade their best option. Anfernee Simons, their leading scorer, has only one year left on his contract before hitting unrestricted free agency.- Kuminga (15.3 PPG, 4.6 RPG) adds athleticism to their young core.- Moody (11.0 PPG, 39.4% from three) is on a team-friendly three-year deal.- Both players offer long-term stability alongside Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe.If the trade goes through, the Golden State Warriors could deploy Anfernee Simons in multiple ways:- Starting alongside Curry, Podziemski, Butler, and Green.- Leading the second unit as an elite sixth man.The Blazers would solidify their young core:- Kuminga and Moody join Henderson, Sharpe, Avdija, and Clingan.- More financial flexibility with Simons’ contract off the books.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers dream trade scenario: Can LeBron James and Luka Doncic form Big 3 with $228.2 million Milwaukee Bucks star? This trade makes sense for both sides. The Warriors get a proven scorer to bolster their title hopes, while the Blazers add two promising young players to accelerate their rebuild.

Elon Musk-led Tesla has started talks with American memory chip manufacturer Micron and Mumbai's CG Semi , a Murugappa Group subsidiary, to explore supply alternatives whilst expanding its global supply network, according to informed sources. This development follows Tesla's earlier strategic partnership with Tata Electronics for semiconductor procurement for worldwide operations. Elon Musk announced on X on Saturday about his anticipated visit to India this year.""Tesla spoke to representatives from the three large semiconductor facilities that have taken off in India — Micron, CG Semi and Tata Electronics,"" a source told ET. It ""called meetings about a month-and-a-half ago… to get a sense of what kind of chips are expected to be packaged, when they'll be ramping up and the timelines for operations.""The Gujarat-based Micron facility aims to provide assembly and testing capabilities, serving both domestic and international markets. CG Semi's unit will focus on OSAT operations. This collaboration between CG Power, Renesas and Stars Microelectronics will primarily serve Renesas whilst catering to global clients.Various Tata enterprises including AutoComp, Consultancy Services, Technologies and Electronics have established themselves as Tesla's global suppliers, preparing for expanded roles should the EV maker enter India.Tata Electronics has committed investments of Rs 91,000 crore for a semiconductor manufacturing unit in Dholera, Gujarat, alongside a Rs 27,000 crore OSAT facility planned in Morigaon, Assam.Murugappa's CG Semi is establishing an OSAT facility in Sanand with an investment of Rs 7,600 crore, alongside Micron's assembly, testing, marking, and packaging (ATMP) facility, valued at over Rs 23,000 crore ($2.7 billion).Industry experts note that international companies are increasingly considering India for semiconductor operations as they diversify their supply chains. Independent automotive analyst Ashwin Amberkar says, ""There are strong indications that Tesla has started engaging suppliers beyond China and Taiwan, with targets set as early as 2025. India is emerging as a serious contender in this shift.""Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory currently depends on Chinese fabrication facilities for mature-node chips. However, Amberkar notes that escalating geopolitical tensions and cost increases are compelling Tesla to ""rethink its sourcing strategy.""Amberkar explains that CG Semi is developing a comprehensive OSAT facility in Gujarat, whilst Micron's Sanand unit will specialise in automotive-grade dynamic random-access memory for computer processors.According to him, Tata's proposed fab and OSAT facilities could fulfil legacy-node chip requirements for automotive electronic control units or specialised vehicle computers.Also Read | ‘Elon Musk doing amazing work, but…’: Why Sajjan Jindal believes Tesla won’t find it easy in India China's move to impose over 80% import duties on semiconductor products, in response to US tariffs, is likely to affect traditional semiconductor supply networks.

""It becomes a crucial part of Tesla's whole EV plan to have an in-house semiconductor unit, have a steady supply chain as well with multiple vendors not overly dependent on one country,"" said industry veteran Arun Mampazhy.Original equipment manufacturers seek robust and varied supply chains, not solely for protection from geopolitical issues, but also to reduce operational disruptions and price fluctuations. Despite strong governmental support, India's semiconductor sector continues to face challenges regarding scale and ecosystem development.""Partnering with a global EV leader could be catalytic for India's chip ambitions,"" said analyst Amberkar.Nevertheless, India must address the technological advantages of China whilst maintaining competitive pricing structures.",Tesla has started talks with American memory chip manufacturer Micron and Mumbai's CG Semi to explore supply alternatives.

About the Thiel Fellowship

It's over for Taylor Swift. The Music Queen has lost her status as the youngest self-made billionaire woman. At just 30, serial entrepreneur Lucy Guo has surpassed pop icon Taylor Swift to become the youngest self-made woman billionaire, according to Forbes. This milestone coincides with a major financial leap for her former startup, Scale AI , which is nearing a tender offer set for June 1. The deal, valuing the AI data annotation firm at $25 billion—an 80% jump from its $13.8 billion valuation last May—allows early employees and investors to cash out shares.Guo co-founded Scale AI in 2016, a company pivotal to the AI industry, providing essential data organization for machine learning models. Its clients include the US government and OpenAI. A first-generation Chinese-American from the Bay Area, Guo taught herself to code in middle school, briefly attended Carnegie Mellon University, and then left to join the Thiel Fellowship , a $100,000 grant program for young entrepreneurs founded by Peter Thiel, popularly known as Donald Trump's man in Silicon Valley. In fact it was PayPal cofounder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel who introduced his mentee, JD Vance, to President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2021.Before Scale AI, Guo worked at Quora, where she met co-founder Alexandr Wang, and later at Snapchat. After leaving Scale, she launched Backend Capital, a venture capital firm, and invested in startups like Ramp, now valued at billions. In 2022, she founded Passes, a subscription-based platform for creators akin to OnlyFans, which has raised $50 million and is valued at $150 million. Celebrities like Olivia Dunne and Shaquille O’Neal use the platform. Passes is a platform enabling creators to monetize their brands through subscriptions, live streams, one-on-one calls, and fan management tools.Guo’s rise from a self-taught coder to a billionaire embodies the Silicon Valley dream, unseating Taylor Swift, 35, who held the title since Forbes named her a billionaire in 2023.Founded by Peter Thiel, the Thiel Fellowship provides $100,000 and mentorship to young innovators who skip or leave college to pursue entrepreneurial ventures over two years. Incidentally, Thiel’s venture fund, Founders Fund, was also an early investor in several of Elon Musk’s companies, including space cargo business SpaceX, tunneling firm the Boring Company, and brain-chip startup Neuralink.","Lucy Guo, 30, has surpassed pop icon Taylor Swift to become the youngest self- made woman billionaire, according to Forbes.

Sacked West Bengal teachers lay siege as School Service Commission misses tainted-untainted list deadline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/west-bengal-teachers-lay-siege-as-ssc-misses-tainted-untainted-list-deadline/articleshow/120504605.cms,"SSC Teachers sit on 'Dharna' outside SSC office; protest against Bengal govt.

Kolkata: The School Service Commission missed its Monday 6pm deadline of publishing the lists of “tainted” and “untainted” teachers, triggering chaos outside Acharya Sadan, its headquarters in Salt Lake.Protesters, saying they had run out of patience, clashed with police and tried to breach barricades around the SSC headquarters several times as news trickled out that the SSC had devised a new “cut-off” to separate the “tainted” from the “untainted”: only the first three of the 20 rounds of counselling that took place between 2017 and 2019 would be considered valid, implying that teachers recruited from the fourth round would not feature in the list of the “untainted”.This led to a day-long stand-off, with protesters barricading the SSC office with its chairperson Siddhartha Majumder inside. There were intermittent clashes with cops and, at one point in the evening, protesters even refused to let food meant for Majumdar and other officials enter the SSC headquarters.SSC sources said the SC judgment striking down the appointment had noted that counselling and appointments were made after the expiry of the panel, which was “illegal and contrary to the rules”. The panel was valid for a year, within which three counselling sessions were held. The SSC needed to get a legal clarification on whether the SC order invalidates counselling sessions after the third round, they said.Thirteen representatives from the protesting teachers’ ranks learnt about the new development when they met SSC Majumdar on Monday evening. They vehemently opposed the move and staged a sit-in demonstration inside the SSC office as their colleagues protested outside, arguing that the SSC petition in the Calcutta High Court said candidates appointed till the seventh round of counselling were eligible (candidates appointed after the eighth round, too, were included in later).“Is this a joke?” Chinmay Mandal, who was in the team that spoke to SSC officials, asked. “We were told two separate lists would be published — tainted and untainted — and they gave this deadline. They now have yet another excuse. The SSC chairman has now told us that the fate of the remaining candidates appointed in the fourth to the eighth counselling rounds would be decided two-three days later. We will not leave till the segregated lists are published. The CM must hold a press conference and admit responsibility for our job loss. We demand a compensation of Rs 2 crore for each of us,"" he added.Mehboob Mandal, another prominent face of the Qualified Teachers' Rights Platform, stated that the complete list of qualified teachers must be published.""They are applying a divide-and-rule policy to break our unity. But they will not succeed. We will not accept the new counselling theory. They have to publish the segregated list,” he demanded.The agitating teachers blocked Derozio Bhavan, the office of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education as well to stop its president, Ramanuj Ganguly, from leaving. There were also demands for SSC chairman Majumdar's and state education minister Bratya Basu 's resignation.Group C and Group D staffers held a separate protest march to the WBBSE office and staged a sit-in protest, demanding their issue, too, be raised at the Supreme Court just like the state had done for teachers (which led to the temporary reprieve till 2025 end).","The School Service Commission missed its Monday 6pm deadline of publishing the lists of ‘tainted’ and ‘untainted’ teachers.

Why women can't become a Pope? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/why-women-cant-become-a-pope-explained/articleshow/120503490.cms,"Pope Francis

The news of Pope Francis' sudden demise on Easter Monday, sent shockwaves around the world. Cardinal Kevin Ferrell, serving as Vatican camerlengo, delivered the announcement of Pope Francis's death on Easter Monday, stating: ""The Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of his Church.""He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with faithfulness, courage, and universal love, especially for the poorest and most marginalized. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite, merciful love of God, One and Tribune.""Following the passing of Pope Francis, cardinals must convene in the Sistine Chapel for a confidential assembly to select his successor. The selection process involves specific protocols and ceremonial practices, alongside particular requirements for potential candidates.The papal position necessitates that the individual be a baptised Catholic male without marital commitments. He must hold a position as a bishop, cardinal, priest, deacon or layman. The exclusion of women from papal candidacy stems from the Catholic Church's restriction on female priesthood, the Express reported.Canon Law (Canon 1024) states: “Only a baptised man can validly receive sacred ordination.” The Catholic Church teaches that Jesus chose only men as apostles, a tradition reinforced by Pope John Paul II in 1994.Since the early Church, no woman has been ordained a priest. While a legend claims a woman, Pope Joan, once became pope disguised as a man, historians dismiss it as a myth. Women, however, play key roles in the Church as theologians, abbesses and nuns.According to Michele Dillon, a University of New Hampshire sociologist studying American Catholic culture, Catholics prefer these words to be spoken by men because Jesus was male.In 2023, Pope Francis reaffirmed the male-only ordination rule. His predecessor, Pope John Paul II, had similarly maintained this position.Additional requirements for papal candidates include a minimum age of 35 and formal education in Biblical studies, theology or canon law.","Cardinal Kevin Ferrell, serving as Vatican camerlengo, delivered the announcement of Pope Francis's death on Easter Monday.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

'Pandemic-era freeze revoked': Why will millions in US face wage garnishment after May 5?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pandemic-era-freeze-revoked-why-will-millions-in-us-face-wage-garnishment-after-may-5/articleshow/120503057.cms,"Starting May 5, the US Education Department will resume collections on defaulted federal student loans , ending a pandemic-era freeze and putting millions of borrowers at risk of wage garnishment and seized tax refunds.“American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,” said Education Secretary Linda McMahon, announcing that the department will begin referring overdue debts to the Treasury Department’s offset program. Borrowers in default will face withheld federal payments and garnished wages after a 30-day notice.Currently, around 5.3 million borrowers are in default, and another 4 million are nearing that threshold. Borrowers are considered in default after missing payments for nine months, a status that damages credit and opens the door to collections.The move, a shift under the Trump administration, follows years of leniency during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. Federal student loan collections were paused in March 2020 and remained so through the Biden administration’s multiple — and mostly blocked — efforts at sweeping loan forgiveness.Critics say the restart will hurt working families still struggling with inconsistent policy changes. “This is cruel, unnecessary and will further fan the flames of economic chaos,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center.Confusion has mounted amid layoffs at the Federal Student Aid office, paused repayment applications, and legal uncertainty over income-driven plans like the Biden-era SAVE Plan. “Things are really difficult to understand right now,” said Kristin McGuire of Young Invincibles. “People are in default because they can’t pay their loans and because they don’t know how to pay their loans.”Borrowers still have an option to avoid garnishment through loan rehabilitation, which involves nine on-time payments and is available only once, said Betsy Mayotte of The Institute for Student Loan Advisors.While President Biden has approved over $183 billion in targeted relief for more than 5 million borrowers, McMahon said the administration went too far. “Going forward… we will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law,” she said.","Starting May 5, the US Education Department will resume collections on defaulted federal student loans.
