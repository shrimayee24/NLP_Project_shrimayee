Blast at Nagpur explosives unit kills 6 people,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/blast-at-nagpur-explosives-unit-kills-6-people/articleshow/110977886.cms,"NAGPUR: Six persons, including five women employees, were trapped in a ball of fire and charred to death after a devastating explosion tore apart Chamundi Explosives Ltd in Dhamna , 25km off Nagpur on Thursday.

While rescue operations were delayed, factory personnel couldn't venture into the smoke-filled death trap, where dismembered body parts were found in metal wreckage when the fire was finally doused. Three other employees are battling for life at different hospitals in Nagpur. A preliminary probe stated sparks from the explosive sealing section had triggered the blast .

Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis declared Rs 5 lakh compensation to kin of the deceased, but the unit's management was yet to announce relief to victims' kin.

The unit, which manufactures safety fuses, gun powder, firecrackers and detonators is located on Amravati highway.

On Thursday, angry villagers blocked the arterial Amravati highway and claimed victims remained trapped inside the explosives sealing and packing unit for over one-and-half hours and were burnt to death. ""The bodies were charred beyond recognition,"" said an eyewitness, adding there were no adequate safety measures at the factory premises.

Yadavrao Modre, relative of 21-year-old Pranjali, who is one of the victims, said the company premises did not have any effective firefighting mechanism, despite dealing with inflammatory chemicals.

"Delhi water crisis: ADM, SDM level officers to be deployed in each Zone to monitor situation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-water-crisis-adm-sdm-level-officers-to-be-deployed-in-each-zone-to-monitor-situation/articleshow/110928914.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In response to the ongoing water crisis in Delhi, the government has taken decisive action by deploying high-level officials to each zone. These teams, consisting of Additional District Magistrates, Sub Divisional Magistrates, Tehsildars, and other officials, will serve as 'Quick Response Teams' to ensure the efficient distribution of water tankers and promptly address water-related complaints from residents.

Delhi minister Atishi has instructed the Chief Secretary to oversee these teams as they monitor and inspect the main water distribution network , starting from the water sources and extending to the water treatment plants (WTPs) and primary Underground Reservoirs (UGRs). The teams are tasked with identifying and repairing any leaks in the major pipelines within a 12-hour timeframe, emphasizing the importance of conserving every drop of water during this period of scarcity.

""In the meeting held on 30.05.2024 regarding the issue of prevailing heat wave condition and rise in demand of water, it was decided that from 5th June onwards ADM/SDM level officers would be deployed in each Zone, along with a team of Tehsildars and other officials who will act as a ' Quick Response Team ' for provision of water tankers and resolution of water-related complaints,"" Atishi said in her letter to the Chief Secretary.

Despite these efforts, many residents in various parts of Delhi continue to face water shortages, relying on water tankers to meet their daily needs. The situation has led to long queues in affected areas as people wait to collect water from these tankers.

The water crisis has also sparked a heated debate between Lieutenant-Governor VK Saxena and the AAP government, with each side pointing fingers at the other. The AAP government attributes the water shortage to the BJP-ruled Haryana government, claiming that it has failed to provide Delhi with its rightful share of water. However, the LG refutes this accusation.

After a phone conversation with Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini on Tuesday, Saxena released a statement asserting that Haryana has been releasing Delhi's allocated share of water into the Yamuna River via the Munak canal. The LG places the blame for the water crisis squarely on the Delhi government, alleging that the shortage is a result of the tanker mafia ""stealing water [from the canal] in connivance with the ruling AAP"".

"Prosecute Nestle for Cerelac 'scam', NGOs tell Swiss government",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prosecute-nestle-for-cerelac-scam-ngos-tell-swiss-government/articleshow/110977844.cms,"NEW DELHI: Food giant Nestle India is in spotlight again over its widely-sold baby food Cerelac . Global civil society organisations, Public Eye and IBFAN, have submitted a formal request to the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), urging legal action against Nestle “unethical and unfair business practices” in low- and middle-income countries.

Accusing the Swiss major of “double standards”, the NGOs had in April said the company’s two best-selling baby food brands sold in developing countries, including India, have a high content of added sugar, which is prohibited under WHO guidelines. Nestle’s misleading and aggressive marketing and its double standard over added sugar are unfair business practices that affect hundreds of thousands of people in poor countries, they said. The cessation of unethical practices is important not only to protect children, but also the reputation of Nestle’s home country, they said.

When contacted, a Nestle India spokesperson said: “We understand that the authorities are conducting analysis of infant cereals and infant formulas sold by all companies in the country.” It maintained its commitment to compliance and highlighted a reduction in sugar content by up to 30% in its baby food products in India over the past five years.

In April, days after the issue became public, Nestle India’s chairman and managing director Suresh Narayanan had said Cerelac complied with local food norms, saying added sugars in the baby food are much lower than what India’s food regulator permits.

The food giant controls 20% of the baby food market, valued at nearly $70 billion. With over $2.5 billion in global sales in 2022, Cerelac and Nido are some of Nestle’s best-selling baby food brands in low- and middle-income countries.

NEW DELHI: Two days after Supreme Court sought answers from National Testing Agency (NTA) on the “sanctity” of NEET-UG 2024 being affected, the agency decided to rescind its decision to award grace marks to 1,563 students who could not get the full allotted time to take the test due to mismanagement. NTA told the court that a re-test would be conducted for these candidates .As soon as the bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta took up the petitions filed against awarding of grace marks, advocate Kanu Aggarwal informed the court about the Centre’s decision. Aggarwal told the bench that the June 4 decision on grace marks had been withdrawn and a re-test would be conducted for 1,563 affected students on June 23. The result would be declared on June 30 to ensure that counselling, which is likely to start from July 6, is not affected. The bench accepted the decision.The affected candidates will be informed about their actual scores without the grace marks and re-test will be conducted for them. Those who do not wish to appear for the re-test will retain the actual marks (minus grace marks) obtained by them in the test held on May 5.Senior advocate Naresh Kaushik, appearing for NTA, told the bench that the re-test would be notified on Thursday.“Having considered the submissions and the material placed on record, this court finds that the recommendations made by the committee on June 12, 2024, after deliberations held on June 10, 11 and 12 are fair, reasonable and justified. Accordingly, the respondent NTA may proceed for holding the re-test as indicated above,” Justices Nath and Mehta said.NEET-UG, taken by over 24 lakh students on May 5, has been marred by allegations of paper leak, mismanagement and awarding of grace marks. Some students approached SC and various high courts while many took to the streets to protest.The 1,563 students were given grace marks since they did not get the full 3 hours 20 minutes to take the test. The marks were awarded on the basis of recommendations of the grievance redressal committee constituted by NTA. As protests broke out over the decision, a second committee reconsidered the issue and recommended reversal of grace marks.Advocate J Sai Deepak insisted that 1,563 candidates were only those who had approached courts and the number of students who did not get the stipulated time was much higher. He said all those students who suffered should be allowed to appear in the re-test but NTA objected to his plea and said the problem was confined to only six test centres.The court, after hearing all sides, closed the case on the issue of grace marks while keeping the larger issue on question paper leak pending which will be heard on July 8.The entrance test was conducted across 4,750 centres in 571 cities, including 14 cities abroad.

NEW DELHI: Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday dismissed allegations of paper leak in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-Undergraduate ( NEET-UG ) and said there was no evidence to back these claims. He said govt was committed to ensure no student was disadvantaged, and added that the controversy was “motivated”, indicating that the protest was instigated by coaching centres .He also said more high scorers and more non-coaching candidates cracking the exam was due to concerted efforts of the last three years to make the difficulty level of NEET similar to Class 12 board exam instead of setting “tough” questions.NTA conducted NEET-UG on May 5 and announced results on June 4. A little over 24 lakh aspirants registered for the test of which 23.3 lakh appeared and 13.6 lakh qualified.“There is no evidence of paper leak in NEET-UG. Corruption allegations against NTA are baseless. It conducts exams for over 5 million school students annually, along with higher education exams,” Pradhan said.He said NEET-UG results indicated that there was a significant increase in the number of students qualifying and scoring high marks from govt-run schools and from rural areas who didn’t attend coaching classes.Without naming coaching centres, Pradhan said, “Even in JEE (Advanced), students of rural areas and Navodaya schools have improved their scores and are among the rank holders. They didn’t get any additional coaching. So, you can guess who has impacted them (coaching centres) adversely.”On the controversy over grace marks, the minister said NTA was evolving. “We are not saying everything is foolproof.

With Biden headed to Italy, White House said aboard Air Force One there’s an “encounter” likely between the 2 leaders as the president expects to see the Indian PM there, while reiterating it will continue to raise the foiled Sikh separatist murder plot at very senior levels with India.This is the first time the leaders will meet after their bilateral talks over dinner at Modi’s residence here, on the eve of the G20 summit India hosted last year in September. While a formal bilateral meeting isn’t ruled out in Italy, it’s possible that the leaders might just have a pull-aside because of scheduling constraints.PM Modi , in fact, will have a hectic bilateral schedule at G7 with meetings already confirmed with French president Emmanuel Macron, UK PM Rishi Sunak, Japanese PM Fumio Kishida, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian PM Giorgia Meloni. Modi is also likely to meet Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He had met him at the G7 summit in Hiroshima too last year. Zelenskyy had invited Modi for the peace summit in Switzerland, but India never considered participation at the highest level because of efforts to keep Russia out. There was no meeting scheduled with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau till late on Thursday.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, US NSA Jake Sullivan also said that the foiled murder-for-hire plot against Khalistan separatist and US national Gurpatwant Singh Pannun will be “a continuing topic of dialogue between the US and India, including at very senior levels”. Diplomatic sources did not rule out the possibility of the issue coming up in the Modi-Biden meeting.Biden had taken up the issue during his meeting with Modi in September and Sullivan is himself likely to discuss progress, or lack thereof, in the probe India is conducting into the US allegations that an Indian official masterminded the plot during his visit to India next week. While the visit has not been officially announced yet, Sullivan is scheduled to be here on June 18. He’s expected to meet his counterpart for a comprehensive review of the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET) that Modi and Biden had launched in May 2022.“He (Biden) expects to see Prime Minister Modi here. It's up to the Indians to formally confirm his attendance, but our expectation is that the two of them will have the opportunity to encounter one another.

These are the names given to three craters on the surface of Mars recently discovered by Ahmedabad-based Physical Research Laboratory ( PRL ), that hint at the red planet's wet past. Lal has been named after legendary cosmic ray physicist from Varanasi, the late Professor Devendra Lal. The other two have been named after Mursan town in UP's Hathras district, and Hilsa town in Nalanda district of Bihar.

PRL director Anil Bhardwaj told TOI they are named in accordance with international guidelines which state that small craters should be named after small towns and bigger ones after renowned personalities. Lal, a pioneer in the field of earth and planetary science, served as PRL director from 1972 to 1983.

The craters reside within the Tharsis volcanic region, a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the solar system. 'Lal' is the largest and spans around 65km. It is covered with lava, but there is geophysical evidence of material other than lava in this crater with a 45m thick sedimentary deposit in the subsurface. The discovery provides compelling proof that water has moved large volumes of sediments into the crater. Two small superimposed craters on either side, 'Mursan' and 'Hilsa', provide timeline for the infilling process of 'Lal'.

According to an article published by scientists Rajiv Bharti, Isaac Smith, S K Mishra, N Srivastava and Shital Shukla, the discovery was made within the Mangala crater of Mars using SHARAD (Mars SHAllow RADar sounder), a subsurface sounding radar mounted on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter probe, a spacecraft designed to search for the existence of water on Mars as part of NASA's Mars Exploration Programme.

Heatwaves more than double of normal this year: IMD data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heatwaves-more-than-double-of-normal-this-year-imd-data/articleshow/110977521.cms,"NEW DELHI: This summer, India has faced what's possibly the longest ever spell of heatwave days, with data from IMD revealing that Odisha experienced the most extreme weather and topped the chart by recording the highest number of such days (27), followed by western Rajasthan (23), Gangetic West Bengal (21 days), and Delhi, Haryana, Chandigarh and western UP (20 days each) during March 1-June 9.These numbers were more than double of what these regions normally experience annually.And, heatwaves continue to scorch many of these regions. Delhi, for instance, has seen three more heatwave days since June 9, including Thursday, taking the total so far to 23. IMD on Thursday said ""severe heat wave conditions"" over northern parts of India are likely to continue in the next 4-5 days.Heatwaves are spells of unusually high temperatures as compared to what is normally expected over a region. Therefore, temperatures at which heatwaves are declared differ from place to place based on the historical temperatures of that region.Data shared by IMD for the March 1-June 9 shows that 14 of 36 meteorological subdivisions in the country have recorded over 15 heatwave days. These subdivisions are spread across the country with east and north India the worst hit. Even the relatively cool high-altitude regions such as Himachal Pradesh reported 12 heat wave days followed by Sikkim (11), Jammu & Kashmir (6) and Uttarakhand (2).""The IMD's map shows a high number of heatwaves over India. This was expected and predicted in advance. In the year following an El Nino year (2023) we tend to get more heatwaves. That is due to favourable atmospheric circulation for heat waves,"" said Madhavan Rajeevan, climate scientist and former secretary, ministry of earth sciences.He attributed the longer spell to global warming, saying it is adding to the natural variability. ""We will tend to get more frequent, longer and stronger heatwaves. We, therefore, need to be well prepared,"" said Rajeevan while flagging the current longer spell against the normal 6-8 heatwave days averaged over central and northwest India per year.A heatwave is declared when the maximum temperature of a weather station is at least 40 degrees Celsius in the plains and at least 30 degrees C in hilly regions, and it is 4.5 to 6.4 degrees C above the normal temperature. If it's 6.5 degrees or more above normal, a severe heatwave is declared. Also, heatwave is automatically considered if the temperature touches 45 degrees C and a severe heatwave declared if it reaches 47 degrees C.In the coastal area, a heatwave is declared if the maximum temperature is 37 degrees C or more and the departure is 4.5 degrees or more above normal.The criteria of declaring heatwaves is, however, not the same in the other countries as quantitatively, there are different thresholds used around the globe. ""It is usually defined based on the temperature thresholds over a region in terms of actual temperature or its departure from normal. In certain countries, it is defined in terms of the heat index based on temperature and humidity, or based on the extreme percentile of the temperatures,"" the met department said.""Heatwave to severe heatwave conditions are very likely to continue over Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh-Delhi and Uttar Pradesh during next five days (till June 18) with a reduction thereafter in terms of areas and intensity,"" said the met department in its extended range forecast for next two weeks.","Odisha experienced the most extreme weather and topped the chart by recording the highest number of such days (27) Western Rajasthan (23), Gangetic West Bengal (21 days), and Delhi, Haryana, Chandigarh and western UP (20 days each) during March 1-June 9.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110977548,imgsize-1368112,width-400,resizemode-4/110977548.jpg"
Weather holds up RLV 3rd landing trial; Chopper delays Gaganyaan air drop test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/weather-holds-up-rlv-3rd-landing-trial-chopper-delays-gaganyaan-air-drop-test/articleshow/110977444.cms,"Gaganyaan Test

BENGALURU: Weather permitting, Isro will attempt to achieve another milestone in the development of reusable launch vehicle (RLV) technology this month, may be as early as next week in Karnataka’s Challakere, while “issues” with chopper (Chinook) is delaying the integrated air-drop test (IADT) of simulated Gaganyaan crew modules at the spaceport in Sriharikota.Isro, which had completed the second landing experiment of the RLV — the RLV-LEX-02 — on March 22, is gearing up for the third landing experiment (RLV-LEX-03), which will build upon RLV-LEX-02 aimed at improving the vehicle’s performance, guidance, and landing capabilities.“...We are just waiting. The helicopter is there but the weather is bad. It (weather) is expected to improve by the 14th and if that happens we can conduct the experiment next week. This will be the last landing experiment and next, we’ll attempt the orbital re-entry,” S Unnikrishnan Nair, director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), which has developed the RLV, told TOI.Compared to the previous LEX, Nair said, RLV-LEX3 will be more challenging as the “intentional cross-range error of around 500m will be tested, compared to around 150m during LEX-02. “The velocity azimuth with respect to the runway centre has been adjusted to 2°, deviating from the previous mission's 0° alignment,” he said.The mission will have another advancement: Implementation of an advanced guidance algorithm that can simultaneously correct errors in both the longitudinal and lateral planes. This decoupled algorithm, an improvement over LEX-02’s approach, will be utilised to enhance the vehicle’s precision and control.Also, to ensure a softer landing and reduce touchdown loads, the main landing gear (MLG) sink rate has been reduced to less than 1m/second, compared to the 1.5m/second limit during LEX-02. Additionally, a smoke marker system has been introduced to trace the descent trajectory, providing visual data for analysis and future improvements.Isro will also evaluate the performance of its real-time kinematics (RTK) system in a high-speed environment. This system is crucial for future landing missions, as it can enhance the robustness of the hybrid navigation system, ensuring accurate and reliable guidance.Around 550km from Challakere, in Sriharikota, Isro’s plan of conducting the IADT of a simulated crew module to validate the parachute system for India's first human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan, has been put on hold a need to revisit “some aspects” of the helicopter selected to carry out the test, arose.During the test, the crew module, weighing around 3 tonne, will be dropped from the Chinook helicopter at an altitude of 3km, and a sequence of parachute deployments will occur before splashdown and recovery. The proposed IADT is part of several such tests to be conducted as part of Gaganyaan’s preparations.TOI had reported in May that pre-mission trials had begun for this. “...During the pre-mission trials for the first IADT in Sriharikota, it was noticed that the helicopter may have ‘some issues’ that needed to be addressed. That is progressing now,” a source said.The Indian Air Force (IAF), whose Chinook aircraft Isro is using for the mission, is conducting an investigation “to understand what needs to be done”, the source said, adding that Isro was waiting for IAF to get back with its findings before moving ahead.Isro plans to conduct seven IADTs as per initial plans, with the final number depending on the test results. Alongside these tests, it is also preparing for at least one uncrewed mission and the second test vehicle mission to test various abort conditions as part of the Gaganyaan programme this year.","Weather permitting, Isro will attempt to achieve another milestone in the development of reusable launch vehicle (RLV) technology this month. “issues” with chopper (Chinook) is delaying the integrated air-drop test (IADT) of simulated Gaganyaan crew modules.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110977441,imgsize-56632,width-400,resizemode-4/110977441.jpg"

Civil society urges federal action against Nestle on unethical practices regarding Cerelac,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/civil-society-urges-federal-action-against-nestle-on-unethical-practices-regarding-cerelac/articleshow/110976276.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Nestle- Cerelac controversy is in the spotlight again. Two civil society organisations -- Public Eye and IBFAN (International Baby Food Action Network) have now submitted a formal request to the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), seeking a federal complaint against food giant, Nestle to curb its ``unethical and unfair business practices’’.

This is important not only to protect children, but also the reputation of Nestlé's home country, the NGOs' said.

Charging the Swiss biggie of ``double standards’’, the organisations said in April that the company’s two best-selling baby food brands -- sold in developing countries including India, have a high content of added sugar, prohibited under WHO guidelines.

In low- and middle-income countries, Cerelac and Nido are promoted as healthy and ""key to supporting young children’s development"" but the products contain high levels of added sugar. As against this, in its home country, Switzerland and other rich nations, the company sells such products without added sugar.

Early exposure to sugar increases the risk of numerous chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular maladies, which is why the WHO explicitly bans it in baby foods.

The findings by Public Eye and IBFAN prompted enquiries by regulators in India, Nigeria and Bangladesh. India’s food standards regulator, FSSAI collected samples of Nestle’s Cerelac baby cereal, following concerns raised by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) regarding the high sugar content.

The apex court warned the Delhi government, saying ""If you can't deal with tanker mafia , we will ask Delhi Police to take action."" The court questioned the measures taken by the government to control water wastage, considering the recurring problem of water scarcity during summers. The court further emphasized the suffering of the people, noting the visuals being shown on every news channel.

The top court also directed the Delhi government to file an affidavit detailing the measures it has implemented to control water wastage.

Delhi Lt Governor VK Saxena met Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini on Tuesday who assured him that water is being supplied to the national capital according to its allocated share.

Over the past two weeks, the ruling AAP government has repeatedly accused the BJP-led Haryana government of restricting Delhi's share of water.

In an effort to address the issue, Mr Saxena met with Delhi ministers Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj on Monday. He assured them that he would discuss the water supply problem with the Haryana government and advised against engaging in a ""blame game,"" encouraging the resolution of issues in an amicable manner.

The NEET (UG) 2024 examination was conducted by the NTA on May 5 across 4,750 centers, with approximately 24 lakh candidates participating. Although the results were initially expected to be announced on June 14, they were released on June 4, possibly due to the early completion of the answer sheet evaluation.

(UG) 2024 examination was conducted by the NTA on May 5 across 4,750 centers, with approximately 24 lakh candidates participating. Although the results were initially expected to be announced on June 14, they were released on June 4, possibly due to the early completion of the answer sheet evaluation. The plea stated that the NTA's decision to award grace marks was a reaction and not a proactive measure taken at the time of declaring the results.

""So much so this clarification came about only when queries were raised as to how 718/719 marks out of total 720 marks can be awarded when the same was not technically possible as per the marking scheme,"" the plea said. The plea has called for a comprehensive investigation into the conduct of the examination by an independent high-powered committee.

The plea questioned the basis for adopting the policy of awarding grace marks, as it was not a practice followed by the NTA in previous years. It demanded that the NTA provide details of the 1,563 candidates who received compensatory marks, including their original marks, the grace marks granted, and their revised marks.

On June 10, scores of students staged protests in Delhi, demanding an investigation into the alleged irregularities. It has been claimed that grace marks contributed to 67 students sharing the top rank.

On Wednesday, the NTA released a document with frequently asked questions (FAQs) regarding the exam, reiterating that there was no question of paper leaks. NTA officials stated that 63 cases of students using unfair means were reported in NEET-UG, out of which 23 have been debarred for varying periods. However, they emphasized that the sanctity of the medical entrance exam has not been compromised.

Last week, the Education Ministry formed a four-member panel to review the grace marks awarded to 1,563 students to compensate for the loss of time due to delays in starting the examination at certain centers.

According to NTA officials, the adjustments were made to address inconsistencies in NCERT textbooks, which resulted in 44 candidates receiving full marks and many others seeing an increase in their scores, contributing to the high number of perfect scores. Despite the exam results becoming a political issue, NTA sources maintain that the majority of the claims are an attempt to create a false narrative surrounding the exam.

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Thursday informed the Supreme Court that the decision to award grace marks to 1,563 candidates of NEET-UG 2024 by the National Testing Agency (NTA) has been cancelled.These 1563 students will also be given an option to take a re-test.The top court was hearing petitions related to the controversy surrounding the NEET-UG, 2024 examination for admission to MBBS, BDS, and other courses.One of the petitions was filed by Alakh Pandey, the chief executive of EdTech firm 'Physics Wallah', who has challenged the alleged random awarding of grace marks by the National Testing Agency (NTA) to more than 1,500 candidates who appeared for the NEET-UG, 2024.Several petitions have been submitted to high courts and the Supreme Court, raising various allegations, including paper leaks , grace marks, and a significant increase in high scorers.","The top court was hearing petitions related to the controversy surrounding the NEET-UG, 2024 examination for admission to MBBS, BDS, and other courses.

"Market crash worse than the 2008 recession, warns Economist Harvey Dent",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-crash-worse-than-the-2008-recession-warns-economist-harvey-dent/articleshow/110947932.cms,"Economist Harvey Dent (Photo: X handle)

NEW DELHI: Financial author and economist predicted another "" crash of a lifetime ,"" which could be worse than the 2008 crash. In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, Dent warned that the ""everything"" bubble has not yet burst, and the resulting crash could be more severe than the Great Recession.

Dent highlighted the unique nature of the current situation, stating, ""In 1925 to '29, it was a natural bubble. There was no stimulus behind that, artificial stimulus per se. So this is new. This has never happened."" He likened the government's response to attempting to cure a hangover by drinking more alcohol. Dent suggested that the long-term effects of continuously pumping money into the economy remain to be seen, but he expects a larger crash than the one experienced in 2008-2009 due to the prolonged duration of the current bubble.

Despite the strong performance of US stocks in May, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow Jones all posting gains, Dent predicts significant decline. ""I think we're going to see the S&P go down 86% from the top, and the Nasdaq 92%. A hero stock like Nvidia, as good as it is, and it is a great company, [goes] down 98%. Boy, this is over,"" said the economist.

Dent has slightly adjusted the timing of his prediction, now expecting market bottoms to occur between early and mid-2025. He identifies the real estate market as the epicenter of the bubble, claiming that US homes have already increased in value by double or more than their future worth. Dent points to the widespread ownership of homes and the prevalence of speculative second and third home purchases as contributing factors.

In response to critics who label his hypotheses as ""crazy"" or accuse him of fearmongering, Dent said ""I just say what I see and, frankly, don't give a damn if people don't like it, because you [have] got to choose: are you going to tell the truth, or are you going to make people happy?"" He rejects the ""perma-bear"" label, arguing that his predictions are based on historical analysis and the unprecedented power of central banks to create money out of thin air.

Dent advises investors to seek safety in the most secure bonds, emphasizing the United States' position as the world's largest economy and its ability to endure the anticipated downturn. He expects the upcoming crash to be more severe than the one experienced in 2009, as the previous crash was mitigated by stimulus measures. Dent believes this crash will purge excess from the markets, allowing the millennial generation to benefit from a healthier boom in the future.","Economist Harvey Dent predicts another "" crash of a lifetime,"" which could be worse than the 2008 crash.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has dismissed a legal case brought by US transgender swimmer Lia Thomas against World Aquatics , as confirmed by the swimming governing body on Wednesday.

Thomas sought to challenge the 2022 World Aquatics vote that prohibited transgender women from participating in women's elite races if they had undergone any stage of male puberty, arguing that the rules were discriminatory.

Despite becoming the first transgender athlete to win the highest level of NCAA title in March 2022, the 25-year-old swimmer was found by the Court of Arbitration for Sport panel to be ineligible to compete in elite competitions through World Aquatics or USA Swimming ""for the time being.""

The 24-page verdict seen by AFP stated, ""The Panel notes that the Athlete did not apply for - let alone was granted - the right to participate in 'Elite Events' within the meaning of the USA Swimming Policy.""

The court concluded that Thomas was ""simply not entitled to engage with eligibility to compete in WA competitions"" and was ""not sufficiently affected"" by the rules to challenge them, as ""She is currently only entitled to compete in USA Swimming events that do not qualify as 'Elite Events'.""

World Aquatics welcomed the ruling, describing it as ""a major step forward in our efforts to protect women's sport.""

The governing body reaffirmed its commitment to creating an environment that fosters ""fairness, respect, and equal opportunities for athletes of all genders"" and stated that its policies and practices are regularly evaluated to ensure alignment with these core values, leading to the introduction of an open category.

In a statement, World Aquatics expressed its dedication to collaborating with all stakeholders to uphold the principles of inclusivity in aquatic sports, asserting its confidence that the gender inclusion policy represents a fair approach.

Although the European Union is not a member of the G7, it participates in the annual summit.The summit promises to be a crucial platform for international dialogue, with leaders engaging in discussions aimed at tackling some of the most pressing global challenges.","The traditional Indian greeting, symbolizing respect and mutual recognition, was chosen to emphasize solidarity among the world leaders.

Lawyers and AI are ideal fit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lawyers-and-ai-are-ideal-fit/articleshow/110981626.cms,"Notorious for using complex language, the field of law is poised to be disrupted by

PLENTY OF CHALLENGES

LAWYER+AI

SpotDraft is a software company, it is not a law firm, stresses Shashank Bijapur, co-founder & CEO of SpotDraft. Yet, law is what this Bengaluru and US company is simplifying for multinational firms like Airbnb, Crunchbase and Notion.In the real world, Shashank notes, legal costs are high. It’s something that gets paid by the hour. So how do you do it at scale to reduce costs? How do you do it exactly the way an organisation wants it to get done, according to their rules?”The answer that SpotDraft came up with initially in 2018, when the company was formed, was to build an AI review tool to help legal teams review NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) faster. “We spent a lot of time training our own models but could never hit economies of scale, with the lack of sufficiently varied data required to train our models,” Shashank says.By the end of 2019, the company had pivoted into building out a CLM – a contract lifecycle management platform – and launched it in 2020. But when GPT-3 was released, Shashank and his co-founders at the company realised that everything had changed. “We could now create the best experience for legal use-cases by leveraging foundational models and adding a layer of proprietary technology.”Now, thanks to advances in Gen AI, and their own proprietary tech and training, SpotDraft’s AI-drivencontract automation platform helps businesses create, manage, analyse, and collaborate on contracts.Gen AI tools are getting incessantly better at dealing with complex language, the kind that legal contracts are notorious for. “Managing contractual obligations demands deep expertise in legal language , understanding nuances like ₹may’ vs ₹might’ and ₹shall’ vs ₹should’. Skilled resources to manage such contracts are expensive, making contract management unaffordable for many companies,” says Rishi Agrawal, co-founder & CEO of Teamlease Regtech.This complexity, Rishi says, is easily managed by Gen AI. “Gen AI can help by composing contracts with minimal resources, ensuring faster, more accurate, and more effective drafting. It can break a contract into manageable tasks, improving drafting, review, and compliance to finer points. With the right input parameters, Gen AI can create a tailor-made contract based on predefined templates. It can also review contracts to identify relevant laws and regulations and flag clauses of sig nificant importance.”Gen AI tools, Rishi says, can also quickly go through large volumes of contracts to extract key data and has the ability to simplify obligations and responsibilities within the contract for ease of understanding.There are, however, multiple challenges in deploying these tools in a field as sensitive to mistakes and privacy as law. Aadya Misra, counsel at Spice Route Legal, says that accuracy is a big concern. “AI hallucinations can significantly impact legal advice and strategy if not identified and culled.”A related problem is the accuracy of data sources, he says. “Notifications, rules, regulations, guidance, and circulars form the bedrock of legal advice – together with the actual laws and rules. In India, these ₹supplements’ to existing laws are haphazardly organised among various government and public sources. There is no guarantee that Gen AI training sources account for these aspects. In the absence of an efficiently digitised government database across all ministries and regulators, it’s unlikely that the training sources will be up to date.”Another major issue is privacy, says Siddharth Chandrashekhar, lawyer and counsel for the Bombay High Court. “AI tools often require access to sensitive client data, raising concerns about maintaining confidentiality and ensuring compliance with data protection laws. We must also remember that AI uses machine learning. This means that sensitive client data could be stored for future reference to train the AI algorithm.”So, legal jobs are nowhere close to going away. Anandita Sen, DGM of corporate legal at L&T, says it’s also worth understanding that a large portion of legal work includes tasks like interaction with businesses and clients, development of strategy, drafting of innovative solutions and contracts to address specific problems and risks, negotiation and advocacy, and so on – none of which can be replaced by AI-powered tools.SpotDraft’s Shashank says he does not see a world where lawyers will lose a job to AI. But, he says, a lawyer is definitely going to lose their job to a lawyer with AI.","SpotDraft’s AI-drivencontract automation platform helps businesses create, manage, analyse, and collaborate on contracts.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Green Party's losses at EU vote to hit climate goals?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/green-partys-losses-at-eu-vote-to-hit-climate-goals/articleshow/110978707.cms,"Loss of Green Party in European Parliament elections may be bad news for EU countries' new climate ambition at a time when Russia-Ukraine war has already dragged it down, although it is not expected to make a major dent in long-term goals. The impact of the setback to the Greens may be felt when the EU's 27 members assemble to take a call on a new global climate finance goal as a part of a larger group of developed countries at the 29th session of the UN climate summit (CO) in Baku, Azerbaijan in Nov.

Even if a tectonic shift in overall plan does not take place, the pressure is already being felt during the ongoing negotiations at the UN conference in Bonn where the countries are trying to arrive at broad contours of new global climate finance before it takes final shape in Baku. Climate finance is meant for helping developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change.

Over the last few years, the EU has cleared a package to curb emissions and taken a series of measures - seen as trade barriers by several developing nations, including India - which may be tough to undo, but their implementation may be weaker if the support for the Greens remain feeble.

It is unlikely that the results will spell an end to ""climate-progressive"" Europe. Experts insisted that EU's commitments on climate diplomacy may not be diluted. ""The EU both can - and has to - continue to act as a positive force in climate diplomacy globally. With much work remaining, Europe shall remain serious about fulfilling its climate commitments,"" said Dan Jorgensen, minister for global climate policy, Denmark. Interestingly, the Greens have either held or gained seats in Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands despite a poor performance overall. They had major setbacks in France and Germany - the two major EU economies that have been quite proactive on climate actions.

"Why Russia, China and the Big Tech use faux females to get clicks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-russia-china-and-the-big-tech-use-faux-females-to-get-clicks/articleshow/110978713.cms,"Washington: When disinformation researcher Wen-Ping Liu looked into China's efforts to influence Taiwan's recent election using fake social media accounts, something unusual stood out about the most successful profiles. They were female, or at least that's what they appeared to be. Fake profiles that claimed to be women got more engagement, more eyeballs and more influence than supposedly male accounts. ""Pretending to be a female is the easiest way to get credibility,"" said Liu, an investigator with Taiwan's ministry of justice.

Whether it's Chinese or Russian propaganda agencies, online scammers or AI chatbots , it pays to be female - proving that while technology may grow more and more sophisticated, the human brain remains surprisingly easy to hack thanks in part to age-old gender stereotypes that have migrated from the real world to the virtual. ""You want to inject some emotion and warmth and a very easy way to do that is to pick a woman's face and voice,"" said Sylvie Borau, an online researcher in Toulouse, France, whose work has found that internet users prefer ""female"" bots and see them as more human than ""male"" versions. People tend to see women as warmer, less threatening and more agreeable than men, Borau said. Men, meanwhile, are often perceived to be hostile. Because of this many people may be, consciously or unconsciously, more willing to engage with a fake account that poses as female.

When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was searching for a new voice for the ChatGPT AI programme, he approached Scarlett Johansson, who said Altman told her that users would find her voice - which served as the eponymous voice assistant in the movie ""Her"" - ""comforting"". Johansson declined Altman's request and threatened to sue when the company went with what she called an ""eerily similar"" voice. OpenAI put the new voice on hold.

Feminine profile pictures, particularly ones showing women with flawless skin, lush lips and wide eyes in revealing outfits, can be another online lure for many men. Female social media profiles receive on average more than three times the views compared to those of males, according to an analysis of over 40,000 profiles. Female profiles that claim to be younger get the most views, it found.

A report from the UN suggested there's an even more obvious reason why so many fake accounts and chatbots are female: they were created by men. It said greater diversity in programming and AI development could lead to fewer sexist stereotypes embedded in their products.

LONDON: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer were grilled by voters at a televised event on Wednesday, with both challenged over past decisions, pledges and how they would fund policies if they won a July 4 election.At their latest meeting in television studios before the poll, the two men took turns to face an interviewer and then an audience, whose questions and responses underscored the everyday struggles of many in Britain and the mistrust of politicians.With just over three weeks until an election opinion polls suggest Labour will easily win, Sunak was booed and heckled over doctors' strikes, migration and his policy to introduce national service for young people.Starmer was taken to task for what one audience member said was his avoidance of answering questions, and over his previous support of his predecessor, left-wing veteran Jeremy Corbyn.A poll taken after the event in the northern English town of Grimsby said 64% believed Starmer had won the event on Sky News.Starmer told the audience that he would start implementing his policies from 'day one' if he won the election but shied away from answering whether he was being honest when in 2019 he said his left-wing predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, should become prime minister.""I want to get the place when I can roll up my sleeves and work with you ... to say the government is on your side,"" Starmer said to applause. ""That will be a massive difference to the last 14 years.""Sunak was challenged over some of his policies, which audience members said had yet to solve their inability to get dentist appointments, reduce waiting lists in the National Health Service or stop the arrival of migrants in small boats.""I know we've been through a tough time, of course we have... its been tough for all of you here tonight, all of you watching, but I do believe we have turned a corner and we've got a clear plan for the future,"" he said.""I am going to keep fighting hard until the last day of this election.""The event came a day after Sunak unveiled 17 billion pounds of tax cuts in his governing party's manifesto, trying to convince voters' that he had a plan to make them better off while Labour's policies are vague and ill-thought through.He said again on Wednesday that a vote for Starmer was akin to writing him a blank cheque, repeating the contested accusation that a Labour government would increase taxes by more than 2,000 pounds. Starmer denied that was the case.On Thursday, Labour will be try to set the story straight with its own manifesto, a document which sets out the policies the party will pursue in government, an agenda Starmer said would put wealth creation and economic growth at its heart.Labour has repeatedly said it will stick to strict spending rules - a line Labour, traditionally seen as the party of tax and spend, has adopted not only to try to show it has changed since being led by Corbyn but also to challenge Conservative attacks that it will increase taxes.But it was Corbyn who came back to haunt Starmer on Wednesday, when he was asked whether he believed what he said when in 2019 he said the veteran leftist would make a good prime minister and when he made 10 left-wing pledges to become Labour leader a year later, several of which he has since dropped.""Have I changed my position on those pledges, yes I have,"" said Starmer. ""I think this party should always put the country first.""","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer grilled by voters.

The markdown in the outlook for rate cuts, from three quarter-percentage-point reductions seen in the Fed's March projections, was made despite the central bank's acknowledgement in its new policy statement of ""modest further progress"" towards its 2% inflation target - an upgrade from its May 1 statement. The statement said inflation remains ""elevated"".

The S& briefly pared a strong gain and was still up 1% . The yield on benchmark US 10-year notes ticked higher but was still down sharply on the day at 4.28%.

US inflation cooled in May in a sign that price pressures may be easing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-inflation-cooled-in-may-in-a-sign-that-price-pressures-may-be-easing/articleshow/110945323.cms,"WASHINGTON: Inflation in the United States eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that a pickup in prices that occurred early this year may have passed. The trend, if it holds, could move the Federal Reserve closer to cutting its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year peak.Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs — the closely watched “core” index — rose 0.2% from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3% the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, below last month’s 3.6% rise. That was the mildest such increase in three years.Fed officials are scrutinizing each month’s inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago — a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden’s re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment.Wednesday's report suggested that consumers are beginning to get some relief from the price spikes of the past three years. Grocery costs were unchanged, on average, from April to May, after actually falling 0.2% the previous month. Food prices have risen just 1% over the past 12 months, though they're still up about 20% from three years ago.Average gas prices tumbled 3.6% nationally just from April to May, though they're 2.2% higher than they were a year earlier. Those declines have continued, with gas averaging $3.45 a gallon Wednesday, down 17 cents from a month ago. Americans didn't drive as much over the Memorial Day weekend as they have in previous years, reducing demand, and oil prices have fallen.Overall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May. Measured from a year earlier, prices rose 3.3%, less than the 3.6% increase a month earlier.“It's certainly welcome news,” said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income. ""It drives home that the inflation challenge in the United States is not as challenging as monetary policy makers believe.”Airfares, furniture and clothing also dropped in price last month, helping keep inflation in check. And the cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20% from a year earlier.The Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed’s target level.Persistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates — or keeps them high — to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.The longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.Inflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a “soft landing,” whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.But inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.In early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.Some signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending. In response, several major retail and restaurant chains, including Walmart, Target, Walgreen’s, McDonald’s and Burger King, have responded by announcing price cuts or deals.","Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs rose 0.2% from April to May.
