India ready to work with K P Sharma Oli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-ready-to-work-with-k-p-sharma-oli/articleshow/111703143.cms,"With K P Sharma Oli set to return as PM, India’s primary concern in the immediate run would be whether Oli, seen as pro-China in the past, will go ahead and sign the BRI implementation plan with China during his term in office. Nepal under P K Dahal Prachanda backed down from signing the agreement last month, when Chinese vice minister for foreign affairs Sun Weidong visited Kathmandu.Nepal joined the BRI in 2017 but it’s yet to approve the implementation plan which will clear the way for over a dozen BRI projects in the country.CPN-UML and N Carrived at a power sharing agreement last week, leaving the Prachanda-led govt woefully short of majority. India would have ideally liked Prachanda and NC to come together in the game of musical chairs that has unfolded repeatedly since the elections in 2022, but govt sources said India will be happy to work with Oli as well.Despite his alleged China tilt, and the controversy over Nepal’s new map during his previous term in office, Oli has been looking to build ties with India, acknowledging the role its neighbour can play in Nepal’s development. In fact, the chief of his party’s foreign po licy department, Rajan Bhattarai, said in an interview this week CPN-UML doesn’t believe that Nepal can progress or the interest of Nepalese people could be promoted by pursuing anti-India policy. The fact that he will be dependent on support from pro-India NC will also be a determining factor. NC has maintained that while financing BRI plans, Nepal must accept only grants, and not loans, from China.",Nepal joined the BRI in 2017 but it’s yet to approve the implementation plan which will clear the way for over a dozen BRI projects in the country.

The stoppage of water caused a shortage in some parts of the capital. Delhi Jal Board officials confirmed on Friday that the breach had been sealed and there was no leakage now. But because the concrete layering of the Carrier Lined Channel was yet to start, the flow of raw water could not resume.“Water is expected to be released into the canal by Saturday afternoon,” said a DJB official. “But that is only possible after the concrete layering is over. Haryana and DJB are working hard to fix the channel.”Water minister Atishi said, “The 7-metre wide and 15-metre barrier was built with earth and is now being reinforced with concrete. The work will be completed by la te Friday night, but the concrete will take 5-6 hours to set.” She was optimistic that Haryana would release water into the Munak Canal from around 7am on Saturday: “It takes around four hours for water to reach Dwarka and water treatment will, thus, restart by 10am on Saturday.”Dwarka has been worst hit by the water shortage . Against the usual capacity of 50 million gallons per day (MGD) there, production has dwindled to 14MGD. “There are around 350 housing societies in Dwarka and almost all are suffering because of the Munak Canal breach. There was sewage overflow in some areas too,” said Rakesh Gupta, president, Dwarka Federation of Group Housing Societies.In Dwarka Sector 12, Geeta Sharma said, “We were facing a scarcity for the past few days and this has only worsened the situation. There is a severe shortage of water in our society and DJB of ficials informed us it would take two-three days for normal supply. Till then, we’ll have to buy water. The tankers are also charging a higher amount than usual.”The Bawana and Nangloi treatment plants also couldn’t process enough water, impacting colonies in west Delhi. “There was no morning water supply today,” said Sanjay Gupta, chairman, Model Town Residents’ Welfare Association, on Friday. “In some pockets, there has been no supply since Wednesday. This is in addition to the problem of dirty and smelly water.”On Friday, cumulative water production dipped significantly by 50MGD, with the total output standing at 907MGD against the average demand of around 1,290MGD.","Delhi Jal Board officials confirmed on Friday that the breach had been sealed and there was no leakage now.

Captain Anshuman Singh’s parents want Army's 'next of kin' policy revised. What is it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/captain-anshuman-singhs-parents-want-armys-next-of-kin-policy-revised-what-is-it/articleshow/111682073.cms,"But what is Indian Army's 'next of kin' policy?



NEW DELHI: Just a few days ago, heartbreaking visuals of Captain Anshuman Singh 's widow Smriti went viral as she received the posthumous Kirti Chakra awarded to her husband from President Draupadi Murmu. Now the parents of Captain Singh have come out against their daughter-in-law Smriti seeking revision of a crucial Army policy - ' next of kin ' (NOK).""We now just have a photo of our son hanging on the wall with a garland on it.We can’t place the Kriti Chakra on his photo as his wife took it away,” the father, Ravi Pratap Singh said.""The criteria set to NOK is not correct. I have also spoken to defence minister Rajnath Singh about this.

Supreme Court Ruling: Citizenship Proof Cannot Be Demanded Without Evidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-pick-anybody-randomly-ask-for-citizenship-proof-supreme-court/articleshow/111670723.cms,"NEW DELHI: Noting that while Section 9 of the Foreigners Act outs the burden on an individual to prove he/she is not a foreigner, Supreme Court, in an important ruling, has held that this does not mean govt can pick a person at random, knock on their door, and demand they prove their citizenship. There must be some material against the person before proceedings under the law can be initiated, it stressed.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Ahsanuddin Amanullah held that ""in the absence of the basic/primary material, it cannot be left to the untrammelled or arbitrary discretion of the authorities to initiate proceedings"", which have life-altering and very serious consequences for the person.It said, Section 9 could not be invoked on the basis of hearsay or bald and vague allegation(s).""...the question is that does Section 9 of the Act empower the executive to pick a person at random, knock at his/her/their door, tell him/her/they/them 'We suspect you of being a foreigner'?... Obviously, the State cannot proceed in such a manner. Neither can we as a court countenance such an approach,"" the bench observed, while setting aside the order of the Foreigners Tribunal and Gauhati high court declaring a person from Assam an illegal Bangladeshi migrant.The bench accepted the submission of advocate Kaushik Choudhury who, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that Section 9 could not be used arbitrarily and settled principles of natural justice could not be given a go-by.""It needs no reiteration that a person charged or accused would generally not be able to prove to the negative, if he/she is not aware of the evidence/material against him/her which leads to the person being labelled suspect. Ipso facto just an allegation/accusation cannot lead to shifting of the burden to the accused, unless he/she is confronted with the allegation as also the material backing such allegation,"" the court said.The court said that there was no material in possession of authority which could raise suspicion on his nationality. After fighting a legal battle for two decades, SC came to his rescue and declared him Indian as all his relatives were also declared Indian citizens. The court also said that minor spelling mistakes in names on official documents could not be the sole reason to deny authenticity as happened in the case.""However, mere allegation, that too, being as vague as to mechanically reproduce simply the words which mirror the text of provisions in the Act cannot be permitted under law. Even for the person to discharge the burden statutorily imposed on him by virtue of Section 9 of the Act, the person has to be intimated of the information and material available against him, such that he/she can contest and defend the proceedings against him,""the court said.","Section 9 of the Foreigners Act outs the burden on an individual to prove he/she is not a foreigner.

US forecasts delay in La Nina; may not impact monsoon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-forecasts-delay-in-la-nina-may-not-impact-monsoon/articleshow/111698868.cms,"NEW DELHI: The La Nina climate pattern that was expected to develop around Aug and create conditions largely conducive for bountiful monsoon rains in Aug-Sept, is likely to be delayed by about a month. As per the latest forecast by US govt weather agencies released late Thursday, La Nina is now likely to set in around Sept, the last month of India's rainy season.Experts, however, do not expect a major setback for monsoon rainfall over the June-Sept season due to the projected delay in La Nina. The monsoon is currently 3% below normal over the country but the figure is expected to improve over the next two weeks.The update by agencies affiliated to US's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) gave a 70% probability of La Nina developing in the Aug-Sept-Oct period, generally taken to mean the month of Sept. The note said the probability of La Nina forming in Aug had reduced to 48%. In the forecast released last month , the probability of La Nina setting in around Aug was 65%.In a La Nina event, surface waters in the east and central Pacific Ocean cool down below threshold temperatures, leading to associated changes in wind currents that impact weather around the world. The condition is a reverse of El Nino, where abnormal warming takes place. La Nina generally aids summer monsoon rainfall in India while El Nino often depresses it. In between the two states is a neutral or normal phase.""The projected delay in La Nina shouldn't be a cause of worry. The important thing from monsoon's standpoint is whether the sea surface temperature anomaly in the region known as Nino 3.4 (in the Pacific) goes below zero. At the moment, it is slightly above zero but is likely to fall into the negative zone by Aug. When that happens, monsoon usually gets strengthened,"" said M Rajeevan, veteran meteorologist and former secretary of the Union earth sciences ministry.","Latest forecast by US govt weather agencies released late Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar , in the eye of a storm over the authenticity of her disability and OBC status claims that got her appointed to the civil services, could face termination of service and even criminal charges of forgery if the one-man panel set by the Centre to probe the matter finds any misrepresentation or suppression of facts on her part.Sources in the government said the panel of DoPT additional secretary Manoj Dwivedi will, over the next two weeks, probe how she obtained the documents establishing her disability and OBC status, and whether proper vetting was carried out by the issuing authority.Khedkar is said to have recurrently failed to appear for mandatory medical tests at AIIMS Delhi to confirm her disability, despite having qualified for IAS in the ‘Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD)’ category.“The panel will submit its findings to DoPT which will then forward the report with recommendations to the Maharashtra government, since she is allocated to the Maharashtra cadre. If found guilty of forging her OBC and disability papers, the state government could terminate her. Also, she may face criminal liability for forgery and misrepresentation,” a source said.The DoPT panel looking into Khedkar’s claims is likely to take the help of social justice ministry to verify her OBC status. Although she claims to be from the economically weaker category, the affidavit filed by her father, an ex-bureaucrat and a candidate in the recent Lok Sabha polls, declared his assets at over Rs 40 crore. Khedkar was shown as the owner of flats and plots worth crores.The panel will, in consultation with experts from AIIMS Delhi, also examine if the visual and mental disability claimed by her meets the benchmarks for employment in the government.A senior government functionary said this was not the first case of a civil services aspirant making incorrect disability claims for selection in the PwBD category. “There are instances almost every year when those selected on the basis of false disability claims have evaded the mandatory medical test at AIIMS Delhi and even escalated the matter to the Central Administrative Tribunal seeking testing elsewhere. Eventually, however, they could not secure an appointment after having failed the test,” the functionary told",Pooja Khedkar is in the eye of a storm over the authenticity of her disability and OBC status claims that got her appointed to the civil services.

The previous YSRCP govt initially shifted him as special chief secretary to Governor in 2019. Subsequently, the govt posted him as director general AP Human Resources Development Institute (AP HRDI), which was considered as a punishment posting for a very senior official.Taking the issue of employee union leader K Suryanarayana getting an appointment with the then governor to submit a representation against the state govt into serious consideration, the govt made Sisodia responsible for the episode. The special chief secretary would not have any role to play in the fixation of appointments to the governor. ADCs of the governor would place the requests before the governor and grant appointments as per the convenience and wish of the governor. The special chief secretary to the governor would no way come into the picture.Despite knowing the facts, the officials in then chief minister’s Office (CMO) are believed to have played a role in making Sisodia responsible.

Upvan Yojna to enhance greenery in urban areas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/upvan-yojna-to-enhance-greenery-in-urban-areas/articleshow/111696665.cms,"LUCKNOW: The urban development department has launched the ""Upvan"" scheme to enhance greenery in urban areas.The scheme's objective is to transform cities into green spaces , making the state more climate-resilient , enriched with urban green cover , and developed parks .An annual budget of Rs 70 crore has been allocated for the scheme. The budget will be distributed among various urban bodies based on their needs and capacities.Municipal corporations will receive between Rs 1.5 crore and Rs 5 crore, depending on the scale of their projects and green cover requirements.Municipalities will be allocated funds ranging from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore, while Nagar Panchayats will be provided with a sum of Rs 50 lakh.A committee will be formed at the local body level to oversee the implementation of the scheme.In municipal bodies, the Municipal Commissioner will head the committee, while at the municipality (palika) and Panchayat levels, the District Magistrate (DM) will lead.Urban areas are grappling with increasing pollution, impacts of climate change, and a scarcity of natural spaces. The scheme aims to tackle these challenges by enhancing greenery, improving air quality, conserving water, and providing natural habitats for various species. Moreover, the scheme promotes groundwater recharge through the establishment of green covers.An additional key objective is to foster community engagement, encouraging residents to participate in planting and maintaining these green spaces, thereby nurturing a stronger sense of environmental responsibility.According to Principal Secretary of Urban Development, Amrit Abhijat, careful selection of land areas is crucial in the Upvan Yojana's strategy, ensuring each park spans a minimum area of 1 acre. The Miyawaki tree planting method will be employed to create densely packed and diverse green zones.","An annual budget of Rs 70 crore has been allocated for the scheme.

"World population to peak at 10.3b by 2080s, life expectancy returns to pre-Covid levels : UN report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/world-population-to-peak-at-10-3b-by-2080s-life-expectancy-returns-to-pre-covid-levels-un-report/articleshow/111669844.cms,"NEW DELHI: The world’s population is expected to peak within the current century to reach around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s, up from 8.2 billion in 2024. After peaking, it is projected to start declining, gradually falling to 10.2 billion by the end of the century.While in 63 countries, like China and Japan, population peaked before 2024, India and the US are placed among 126 countries where the peak is expected in the second half of the century or beyond 2100.Significantly, one in four people live in a country whose population has already peaked.These findings, part of the ‘ World Population Prospects 2024’ report released by the UN on Thursday, also highlight that since 2022, life expectancy has returned to pre-Covid levels in nearly all countries and areas. After a brief decline during the pandemic, global life expectancy at birth has reached 73.3 years in 2024 (an increase of 8.4 years since 1995) up from 70.9 years during the pandemic.“Further reductions in mortality are projected to result in an average longevity of around 77.4 years globally in 2054. By the late 2050s, more than half of all global deaths will occur at age 80 or higher, a substantial increase from 17% in 1995,” the report shows.By the late 2070s, the number of persons at ages 65 years and higher globally is projected to reach 2.2 billion, surpassing the number of children (under age 18). By the mid-2030s, it is projected that there will be 265 million persons aged 80 years or older, more than the number of infants (1 year of age or less).Even in countries that are still growing rapidly and have relatively youthful populations, the number of persons aged 65 or older is expected to rise over the next 30 years.According to a press statement released from New York, the analysis in the report prepared by the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) shows that the size of the world’s population in 2100 is now expected to be 6% lower — or 700 million fewer — than anticipated a decade ago according to the ‘World Population Prospects 2024’ report released by the UN on Thursday.In 63 countries and areas, containing 28% of the world’s population in 2024, the size of the population peaked before 2024. This category includes countries like China, Germany, Japan and the Russian Federation, and the total population of this group is projected to decline by 14% over the next thirty years.For another 48 countries with 10% of the world’s population, including Brazil, Iran, Türkiye and Vietnam, the population is projected to peak between 2025 and 2054.In the remaining 126 countries, including India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the United States of America, the population is expected to increase through 2054 and, potentially, to peak in the second half of the century or beyond 2100.In nine countries of this last group, including Angola, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger and Somalia, very rapid growth is projected, with their total population doubling between 2024 and 2054.The report highlights that rapid fertility declines in populous countries is a likely cause for the global population to peak within this century (80%), contrasting with a decade ago when the probability was around 30%.“The demographic landscape has evolved greatly in recent years,"" said Li Junhua, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. ""In some countries, the birth rate is now even lower than previously anticipated, and we are also seeing slightly faster declines in some high-fertility regions. The earlier and lower peak is a hopeful sign. This could mean reduced environmental pressures from human impacts due to lower aggregate consumption,” Junhua added.“The earlier population peak is due to several factors, including lower levels of fertility in some of the world’s largest countries, especially China. Globally, women are having one child fewer, on average, than they did around 1990,” the analysis shows.The data brings into focus that in more than half of all countries, the average number of live births per woman is below 2.1—the level required for a population to maintain a constant size over the long term without migration—and nearly a fifth of all countries and areas, including China, Italy, the Republic of Korea and Spain, now have “ultra-low” fertility, with fewer than 1.4 live births per woman over a lifetime.On what the journey onwards is expected to look like, the report states that the main driver of global population increase through mid-century will be the momentum created by growth in the past. ""The number of women at ages 15–49 is projected to grow from nearly 2 billion in 2024 to a peak of around 2.2 billion in the late 2050s, driving continued growth even if the number of births per woman falls to the replacement level."" Moreover, today’s youthful age structure, which is a product of past growth, will account for 79% of the population increase through 2054, adding about 1.4 billion people.The analysis also shows that the countries with youthful populations and declining fertility have a limited time to benefit economically from an increasing concentration of population in the working ages. ""In about 100 countries or areas, the working-age population (between 20 and 64 years) will grow through 2054, offering a window of opportunity known as the demographic dividend,"" the UN report states and recommends that to capitalize on this opportunity, countries must invest in education, health, and infrastructure, and implement reforms to create jobs and improve government efficiency.For some populations, immigration will be the main driver of future growth. ""In 50 countries and areas, immigration is projected to attenuate the decline in population size due to sustained low levels of fertility and an older age structure. However, in 14 countries and areas already experiencing ultra-low fertility, emigration is likely to contribute to reducing population size through 2054,"" the report states.The data also shows that early pregnancies remain a challenge, particularly in low-income countries. In 2024, 4.7 million babies, or about 3.5% of the total worldwide, were born to mothers under age 18 – and some 340,000, to girls under age 15 – with serious consequences for the health and well-being of both the young mothers and their children.The UN calls for investing in the education of youth, especially girls, and increasing the ages at marriage and first childbearing in countries where these milestone events tend to occur early will have positive effects on women’s health, educational attainment and labour force participation. ""These efforts will also contribute to slowing population growth and reducing the scale of the investments required to achieve sustainable development while ensuring that no one is left behind,"" the report asserts.","The world’s population is expected to peak within the current century to reach around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s. After peaking, it is projected to start declining, gradually falling to 10.2 billion by the end of the century. In 63 countries, like China and Japan, population peaked before 2024, India and the US are placed among 126 countries where the peak is expected in the second half of thecentury or beyond 2100.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111669848,imgsize-2260147,width-400,resizemode-4/111669848.jpg"

Our SIT officers have already done an investigation and money has been recovered. CBI have already filed an FIR and they have provisions to take up the investigation, ED doesn't have that provision. There is a procedure for how it can be done, not on NR Ramesh or somebody's complaint ED can do an investigation.""The controversy surrounding the Maharshi Valmiki Scheduled Tribes Development Corporation first came to light after the suicide of an official, Chandrasekaran, on May 26. Chandrasekaran, a resident of Kenchappa colony in Vinobanagar and a superintendent at the Corporation's Bengaluru office, left behind a six-page suicide note alleging multi-crore corruption within the Corporation and naming three officials involved.This note prompted investigations, with Chandrasekaran's allegations drawing widespread attention. The ED raids and subsequent detention of Nagendra have added further intensity to the case, raising serious questions about the governance and integrity of the Valmiki Development Corporation and its officials.The SIT’s prior intervention and the ED's involvement place a spotlight on potential overlaps or conflicts between state mechanisms like the SIT and central agencies like the CBI and ED. This complex interaction underscores the broad impacts of corruption allegations and the administrative responses elicited at various government levels.The ongoing investigations and their outcomes will likely have significant implications for political and administrative accountability in Karnataka, with particular focus on the roles and responsibilities of high-ranking officials within the state’s finance and development sectors.As the situation unfolds, the ED, CBI, and SIT continue their respective probes into the matter, which remains a hotbed of political and legal activity. The ultimate findings will determine the veracity of the claims and the extent of involvement by key figures, including those at the highest levels of the state government.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) detained former Karnataka Minister B Nagendra on Friday in connection with the alleged Valmiki Development Corporation scam. This action followed raids conducted by the ED on Wednesday at various locations linked to Nagendra and MLA Basanagouda Daddal. Nagendra, who had resigned on June 6 amid the ongoing investigation, has professed his innocence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111677817,imgsize-32942,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/111677817.jpg"

This Year Will Lead To Lesser

Cut-Off

With fewer students inching past the 195 cut-off mark this year in the rank list and engineering colleges adding 25,000 more seats, the cut-off is likely to go down for top engineering colleges this year.As many as 65 students scored 200 of 200 marks in the engineering rank list released on Wednesday.Of these, 58 were from the state board and seven from other boards. Last year, 102 students scored full marks.Thosithaa Lakshmi N from Chengalpet, Nilanjana K from Tirunelveli and Gokul from Rasipuram secured the first three ranks in the engineering rank list.“The number of students scoring above 195 has come down from 2,911 last year to 2,862 this year. Due to a big increase in the intake of seats by colleges, the cut-off may come down by up to one mark for top colleges compared to last year,” career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi said.In the 150 to 180 marks bracket, the cut-off may rise by up to eight marks as more than 15,000 students have scored in this range this year, he added. However, engineering colleges said students who scored below 180 cut-off marks have a bright chance to get admitted to top colleges.“With more seats available this year, we can expect students with below 180 cut-off marks can join reputed colleges this year,” said B Chidambarajan, director, SRM Valliammai Engineering College.Earlier, K Veera Raghava Rao, commissioner, directorate of technical education (DOTE) released the engineering rank list and the schedule for admissions. This year, 1,99,868 students feature in the rank list.“The number of students in the engineering rank list has increased by 11.7% compared to previous year. We will release the list of colleges with seat matrix by July 15 on TNEA website,” he said.Engineering counselling will begin on July 22 for special categories. The online general counselling will be conducted in three rounds from July 29 to September 3.Engineering colleges have submitted applications to the fee committee to revise the tuition fee for govt quota seats and management quota seats for 2024-25.As of now, engineering colleges collect Rs 85,000 for management quota (Rs 87,000 for accredited courses) and Rs 50,000 for government quota seats (Rs 55,000 for accredited courses). A few top colleges were allowed to collect Rs 1.25 lakh for management quota seats after they submitted their balance sheet with the fee committee.","As many as 65 students scored 200 of 200 marks in the engineering rank list released on Wednesday.

Still stuck in Space: What astronaut Sunita Williams said about her return to Earth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/still-stuck-in-space-what-astronaut-sunita-williams-said-about-her-return-to-earth/articleshow/111648877.cms,"Two American astronauts , Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams , who are currently waiting to depart from the International Space Station , expressed their confidence on Wednesday that the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they arrived on would safely bring them back to Earth, despite the significant uncertainties surrounding the vehicle's performance.The astronauts launched on June 5 aboard the new spaceship, which Nasa hopes to certify for transporting crews to and from the space station.However, their return has been delayed due to thruster malfunctions and helium leaks that were discovered during the journey.Although no specific date has been set for their return, Nasa officials indicated on Wednesday that they are targeting ""late July.""When asked during a press conference from the station if they still had faith in the Starliner team and the spacecraft, mission commander Wilmore responded, ""We're absolutely confident."" Williams added, ""I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem.""The astronauts have been keeping themselves busy on the ISS, carrying out various tasks and experiments, such as changing the pump on a machine that recycles urine into drinking water and conducting gene sequencing in microgravity.Before Wilmore and Williams can return to Earth, engineering teams need to conduct more simulations on the ground to better understand the root causes of the technical issues Starliner experienced and modify the spacecraft's flight plan if necessary.The spacecraft had a known helium leak before launch, but additional leaks emerged during the flight. Additionally, some of Starliner's thrusters, which provide fine maneuvering, initially failed to engage during its approach to the station, delaying docking. Engineers are still investigating the reasons behind these issues.Despite the challenges, Nasa and Boeing maintain that Starliner could safely return to Earth in case of an emergency, particularly since the problems affected only certain orientation-controlling thrusters. They have no concerns about the more powerful thrusters responsible for the ""deorbit burn"" that will bring the spaceship back.However, much remains uncertain, including whether the malfunctioning thrusters have become degraded, which would necessitate relying on other thrusters during descent.","Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams are currently waiting to depart from the International Space Station.

How TCS got 70% employees back to office by linking variable pay to attendance; others penalised monetarily,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-tcs-got-70-employees-back-to-office-by-linking-variable-pay-to-attendance-others-penalised-monetarily/articleshow/111679529.cms,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's largest IT services company, has said that 70% of its employees are back in office and the number is increasing every week. Interestingly, the development comes within months of TCS changing its policy to link variable pay to work from the office.At a press conference post declaration of TCS’ Q1 FY25 results, Milind Lakkad , chief HR officer said that confirmed that employees who did not adhere to the policy of working from the office five days a week were penalized monetarily, although he did not provide specific numbers.""There are implications for people not coming to office. We do not give out the amounts of what that impact would be. It is something we are doing more from basically bringing in the discipline standpoint and not for any other reasons,"" he was quoted as saying.Lakkad expressed confidence in the situation, stating, ""I'm also not worried about that. In fact, people have realised the value of coming to office, some of them have come to office for the first time because they joined TCS during the pandemic. All of that is basically creating positive energy in the system.""Also Read | Infosys & Wipro see sharp decline in number of employees earning over Rs 1 crore - here’s why In April, TCS made changed its variable pay policy. The updated policy considers work from office as a key determinant in calculating variable pay for employees. The policy has been divided into four attendance slabs, each corresponding to a specific percentage of variable pay.According to an earlier TOI report, employees who spend less than 60% of their time working from the office will not be entitled to any variable pay for that quarter. Those who attend office between 60-75% of the time will receive half of their variable pay. Employees with an office attendance of 75-85% will be eligible for three-quarters of their variable pay. Full variable pay for the quarter will only be given to those who maintain an office compliance level exceeding 85%.Meanwhile, TCS saw an increase in its net employee count by 5,452 during the first quarter of the fiscal year 2025, following three consecutive quarters of decline. The total headcount reached 606,998 as of June end, up from 601,546 employees at the end of March, according to TCS's filing on the stock exchanges.Also Read | Why Infosys’ Narayana Murthy wants to be remembered ‘not as a good man but…’ In the previous fiscal year, FY24, TCS reported an annual drop in its employee base for the first time in 19 years, with a reduction of 13,249 employees compared to the previous year. The company also saw a decline of 1,759 employees in the fourth quarter of FY24, marking the third consecutive quarterly decline in its headcount.Milind Lakkad expressed his satisfaction with the completion of the annual increment process and the net headcount addition. He attributed the industry-leading retention and strong business performance to the company's focus on employee engagement and development. The attrition rate further improved to 12.1% from 12.5% in the previous quarter ending March, and Lakkad stated that it is expected to remain in the vicinity in the coming quarter.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has said that 70% of its employees are back in office and the number is increasing every week.

The WWE has given us some truly iconic moments over its last 70 years of entertainment. Throughout the last seven decades, we have witnessed some of the greatest wrestlers in the ring battle it out for championship belts. However, not every WWE legend is created equal. There are a few who stand out, even among the brightest stars of the game.There are some whose brilliance sets them apart, even when they're grouped with legends.Today, we’ll be taking a look at the Top 10 WWE Legends of all time.If it wasn’t for the greatness of Hulk Hogan , WWE, and all its various businesses might not be where they are today. Hogan stood together with Vince McMahon and helped him expand the WWE brand. His larger-than-life persona helped McMahon sneak his wrestling promotion into the homes of millions. Throughout his career, Hogan won the WWE Championship six times and toppled legends like Andre the Giant, Roddy Piper, and Randy Savage.Even after an eight-year absence, Hogan returned for Wrestlemania X-8 and gave one of the best performances ever against The Rock . His longevity and ability to win crowds is what makes him a WWE Legend. Hogan made his debut back in 1977 and is still celebrated as one of the best wrestlers to ever grace the ring. We might never see a star who can pull in the masses as effectively as Hogan could at the peak of his career.John Cena has been the WWE Champion a total of 16 times. He arrived in 2002 and completely burst onto the scene by deciding to challenge former WWE superstar Kurt Angle in his first ever appearance. However, despite his hot start, Cena might’ve fizzled out if the company hadn’t found him rapping on buses.Thanks to his skills on the mic, the Thuganomics era began, and Cena was unstoppable. John Cena started with awkward raps full of witty insults and used that to become the face of the company. The crowd just couldn’t get enough of him, and his rapid ascent took Cena to his first WWE title back in 2005.It’s been 19 years since then, and he's still going strong. John Cena has taken on legends like The Rock, Randy Orton, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, and more throughout his decade-long reign at the top of WWE. Next year, Cena’s time in the ring will come to an end, he’s already one of the best to ever do it and will surely be giving us some historic moments as he prepares for his final run.The Undertaker is easily one of the greatest wrestlers of all time and for a man who doesn’t speak often, he is also one of the best showmen the WWE has ever seen. He was so loved by the crowd that it only took him a year to beat Hulk Hogan and become the WWE Champion. His zombie-like fighting style and his supernatural character were loved by the fans.What truly made The Undertaker great wasn’t the belts he won, it was the stories he delivered. From his scuffle with Kane to his Hell in a Cell bout with Mankind and even his entire row with Randy Orton, the Undertaker has always given us some of the best stories in the WWE. He even strung together 21 Wrestlemania victories in a row until Brock Lesnar somehow toppled the giant at Wrestlemania XXX.There aren’t many who can electrify an arena like The Rock. He arrived to the WWE as a third-generation wrestler, and the expectations were high. If he hadn’t found his way to the Nation of Domination, we might not have been able to witness his greatness. However, The Rock was able to completely reinvent his character, and his mic skills did all the rest.Within two years of his debut, The Rock won the WWE Championship at Survivor Series. Since then, he’s won the belt a total of eight times, solidifying himself as one of the greatest of all time. Rock has taken on and beat legends like Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, John Cena, Triple H, and many more. He more than deserves to be counted among the greatest WWE legends.“Stone Cold” Steve Austin is the reason WWE was able to outlast WCW in the Monday Night Wars. If it weren’t for the antihero persona of Austin, WWE, as we know it, might have looked completely different. No one expected Austin to be a success, but as it turns out, a wrestler who doesn’t care about authority, flips everyone off and drinks beer in the ring was all the rage back in the 1990s.His shenanigans in the ring and rivalry against McMahon saw Austin rise to the top of WWE. He beat Shawn Michaels at Wrestlemania XIV and etched his name into the history books by becoming the WWE Champion. Since then, we’ve seen Stone Cold turn heel and partner with McMahon on his way to five more championships. The Stone Cold Stunner outlined an era of WWE greatness and will go down as one of the best ever.Randy Savage the Macho Man is one of the most entertaining wrestlers to ever step into the ring. He brought life to the storylines he played a part in. His rivalries against Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Ric Flair, and more legends like the Ultimate Warrior go on to show, just how big of a star he was.Savage chose his wife, Miss Elizabeth, to manage him, and what a decision that was. The amount of legendary moments we’ve had due to Savage being jealous of his wife is enough to get him to the Hall of Fame. Even today, Savage’s image is used to advertise products for Slim Jim all around the world. Randy Savage is a timeless hero and a legend of the game.Not many expected a wrestler of Shawn’s size and build to become the WWE Champion, yet Michaels did it three times. After his relationship with Marty Jannetty came to an end, Michaels was dubbed the Heartbreak Kid and the rest is history. He kept working and took out some of the best competitors in the business like John Cena, Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio , and many more.Michaels also gave us one of the best Wrestlemania performances of all time at Wrestlemania XXV against The Undertaker. The Deadman won the day, but Michaels reminded the people that he’s one of the best wrestlers this brand has ever seen. Today, Michaels helps Ava run WWE NXT. Even after stepping out of the ring, Shawn is working on bringing new talents to the fans at home.We said that not many people expected someone of Shawn Michaels’ size to become WWE Champion, and this is even more true in the case of Rey Mysterio. Rey has never been able to tower over an opponent throughout his lengthy WWE career. However, his athleticism has allowed him to reach the pinnacle of WWE by winning three world championships.At the peak of his career, Mysterio was facing off against the likes of Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle. Mysterio left the company after more than a decade of greatness. Upon his return in 2019, he continued to impress, and his legend only grew. Even now, Rey continues to give us some amazing storylines, facing off against Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns and his own son, Dominik Mysterio.Before Mysterio won the Royal Rumble match in 2006, the world thought it'd be impossible for a man of his size to achieve such a thing. However, Mysterio made a career out of proving people wrong, and he did so tons of times on his way to multiple championship belts.Ultimate Warrior was pure energy every time he stepped into the WWE ring. Everything from his fae paint to the arm bands and his toned muscles made the people believe that The Ultimate Warrior was a force of nature. Thanks to his out-of-this-world presence and personality, he was able to reach the pinnacle of the WWE world and battled with the likes of Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, and Rick Dude.Ultimate Warrior’s reputation among his fellow stars might not be spotless, but his savagery and skills in the ring sure were. The Ultimate Warrior is a Hall of Famer and is easily one of the best competitors the WWE has ever seen.Ever since Bret Hard took his leave, the WWE has not seen a showman who can even be compared to him. The Hitman was a master of his trade and made a career out of selling his fights on realism. Hart was a true champion and had the pride and ego of one as well. Thankfully, he also had the skills and quality to win over the hearts of the fans.Throughout his career, Hart faced off against many legends like Ric Flair, Steve Austin, The Undertaker, and Shawn Michaels. Whoever he faced became a bigger and better star thanks to the impact Bret Hart had on his peers. It can also be said that it was Bret Hart himself who paved the way for smaller wrestlers like Shawn Michaels. Many consider the Hitman to be the greatest wrestler ever, and an argument can surely be made for the five-time WWE Champion. The WWE would look a lot different without all those who were inspired by the brilliance of The Hitman.","The WWE has given us some truly iconic moments over its last 70 years of entertainment. Not every WWE legend is created equal, even among the brightest stars of the game. There are some whose brilliance sets them apart, even when they're grouped with legends. Here are the Top 10 WWE Legends of all time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111664815,imgsize-3299136,width-400,resizemode-4/111664815.jpg"

Pakistan reaches $7 bn aid deal with IMF,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-reaches-7-bn-aid-deal-with-imf/articleshow/111701341.cms,"Cash-strapped Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund reached a three-year, $7 billion aid package deal, the Washington-based institution said on Friday, giving much-needed respite to the South Asian nation.The new program, which needs to be validated by the Fund's Executive Board, should enable Pakistan to ""cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,"" according to a statement.Faced with chronic mismanagement, Pakistan's economy has found itself on the brink, challenged by the Covid-19 pandemic, the effects of the war in Ukraine and supply difficulties that fuelled inflation , as well as record flooding that affected a third of the country in 2022.With its foreign currency reserves dwindling, Pakistan found itself in a debt crisis and was forced to turn to the IMF , obtaining its first emergency loan in the summer of 2023.The latest bailout, coming to Pakistan in the form of loans, follows a commitment by the government to implement reforms, including a major effort to broaden the country's tax base.In a nation of over 240 million people and where most jobs are in the informal sector, only 5.2 million filed income tax returns in 2022.During the 2024-25 fiscal year which starts July 1, the Pakistan government aims to raise nearly $46 billion in taxes, a 40 percent increase from the previous year.As part of the push, Pakistan's tax authority earlier this month blocked 210,000 SIM cards of users who have not filed tax returns in a bid to widen the revenue bracket.The South Asian nation initiated discussions with IMF for the new multi-billion dollar loan agreement -- its 24th bailout in more than six decades -- to support its economic reform program.While around 40 percent of the population already lives below the poverty line, the World Bank said in April it feared that 10 million additional Pakistanis would fall below this threshold.Islamabad also aims to reduce its fiscal deficit by 1.5 percent to 5.9 percent in the coming year, heeding another key IMF demand.The last loan -- a nine-month $3 billion IMF deal -- proved a lifeline.But it came on condition of unpopular austerity measures, including an end to subsidies cushioning consumer costs.In recent months, the current account balance has recovered slightly, high inflation is just starting to come down, but Pakistan's foreign debt remains very high at $242 billion.Servicing it will still swallow up half of the government's income in 2024, according to the IMF.The Fund also anticipates two percent growth this year, with inflation still expected to reach nearly 25 percent year-on-year, before gradually coming down in 2025 and 2026.","Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund reach a three-year, $7 billion aid package deal.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
