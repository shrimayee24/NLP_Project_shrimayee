Victims were being recruited, transported and transferred from India to Golden Triangle SEZ in Lao PDR via Thailand. Upon arrival, they were trained in use of Facebook, Telegram, basics of cryptocurrency, and handling of apps created by the scam company.The powerful syndicates also used victim control tactics in case any of the trafficked youth refused to continue with the online fraud work. These tactics included isolation and restriction of movement, confiscation of personal travel documents and physical abuse, arbitrary fines, threat to kill, threat to rape in case of women and threat to arraign in false case of drugs in local police station, etc.The human trafficking and cyber fraud racket, an NIA spokesperson said, was being operated with audacity, with the accused even deleting data of victims' mobile phones to destroy evidence. Victims faced threats if they approached the embassy concerned or any local authority. In some cases, victims were held in scam compounds, confined without food for three to seven days, and tortured if they refused to work. They were only released after extraction of extortion payments ranging from Rs 30,000 to Rs. 1,80,000, or intervention by the Embassy of India in Lao PDR on complaints made by the victims.According to Indian Cyber Coordination Centre (I4C), southeast Asian countries like Lao PDR and Cambodia have of late emerged as the new hubs of financial cyber fraud reported in India, with 46% of defrauded money now lost to cybercrimes like investment scams, digital arrest scams, trading scams and dating scams originating from there.","NIA chargesheeted five accused, including two foreign nationals, in a case relating to human trafficking and cyber fraud syndicates.

NEW DELHI: Cracking the whip on latecomers , the Centre's department of personnel and training (DoPT) has decided to condone a maximum delay of 15 minutes, and instructed employees across the country to be in office latest by 9.15am and mark their attendance. All employees, including senior officers, have been told to use the biometric attendance system, something several of them have not been using ever since the Covid outbreak four years ago.Staff members have been cautioned that half-day casual leave will be deducted in case they do not turn up by 9.15 in the morning. ""For any reason, if the employee is not able to attend office on a particular day, it should be informed in advance and casual leave should be applied for,"" the circular said, adding that officers will monitor the attendance and punctuality of employees in their sections.Central govt offices are open from 9am to 5.30pm but it is normal for junior-level employees to turn up late and leave early, including those in public-facing jobs, inconveniencing people.Senior officers complain that they do not have any fixed office hours as they usually leave after 7pm. Besides, they argue that post-Covid, with access to electronic files, they often end up working from home, including on holidays or over the weekend. Soon after coming to office in 2014, Modi govt had sought to enforce office timings , which was resisted by employees, many of whom argued that they travel long distances.Aadhaar-enabled biometric attendance system was monitored to ensure that people were on time, until Covid led to suspension of the mechanism. Several senior officers had installed biometric devices on their table to avoid standing in queues to mark their attendance.The latest directive refers to instructions issued last year which had asked central govt employees to revert to biometric attendance, which was resumed in Feb 2022. ""Habitual late coming and early leaving of office should be viewed seriously and discouraged. Action against the same may be initiated,"" it had said.In departments, where IT-enabled faceless mechanism of dealing with public has been put in place, several employees routinely skip office or come in for a short while. The move is expected to enforce greater discipline but will also annoy employees who routinely walk in at 10am or even after that.","Central govt offices are open from 9am to 5.30pm but it is normal for junior- level employees to turn up late and leave early, including those in public- facing jobs.

Delhi HC blocks Kejriwal's release on ED plea against bail order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-hc-blocks-kejriwals-release-on-ed-plea-against-bail-order/articleshow/111176602.cms,"Bail order perverse, didn't get time to plead case: ED

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday granted interim stay on a trial court order giving bail to CM Arvind Kejriwal in an alleged scam in the now-scrapped Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22. ED had filed an appeal on Friday morning, calling the trial court order ""perverse"" and claiming that it did not get a fair hearing.The court also issued notice to Kejriwal on ED's petition challenging the trial court's order and listed the matter for July 10.A vacation bench of Justice Sudhir Kumar Jain reserved its order, saying the bail order would remain stayed till the bench pronounced its verdict. Meanwhile, counsel from both sides can file written submissions by June 24.Additional solicitor general (ASG) S V Raju appeared for ED while Kejriwal was represented by senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Vikram Chaudhri.The ASG told the bench that he was not given adequate opportunity by the trial court to oppose the bail plea. ""The court does not hear us, does not look at the documents given by us, saying it's voluminous. The court says bulky documents have been filed. There can't be any more perverse order than this... Without going through documents filed by both sides, without giving us an opportunity, the matter is decided. It is the duty of a court to pass order in accordance with law. Without going through documents, how can you say it's relevant or not relevant?"" said the ASG.In its petition, ED said the trial court judge did not grant ""full and complete opportunity"" to the agency to muster up all its arguments and told the ASG to cut short his arguments and only indicate the page numbers that ED wished to rely upon. The judge also asked the ASG to restrict his arguments to the points argued by the bail applicant, ED claimed. ""The learned ASG on more than one occasion submitted that the bail applicant's counsel has not argued the case on merits and, therefore, it was incumbent on ED to demonstrate the prosecution case,"" said ED's petition, but the court stuck to its stance that the arguments should be cut short.The petition claimed that ED's request for submitting a detailed note within the next 2-3 days was also turned down by the trial court with a direction to file any such note the same day or next day.The judge insisted that she was hearing a ""high-profile case"" and, therefore, ""did not want to reserve the order,"" the petition said.The petition said ED was being deprived of an opportunity to seek an effective legal remedy by filing an appropriate petition before HC since the order granting bail had not been made available till the time of filing the appeal. ""Rather when the counsel for ED tried to enquire from the court after pronouncement of the order, the court staff was unavailable and the courtroom was empty with the lights switched off,"" said the petition.It claimed that the court staff had told ED's counsels that the judge had given instructions not to email or upload the order granting bail, saying it would be available at 10am on Friday ""effectively depriving ED of any opportunity of challenging the order prior to release of the bail applicant/accused"".The ASG claimed before the court that the trial court judge had admitted that she did not examine the documents. He said he had not come across a judge who admits not to have read the papers and granted bail. ""There can't be a more perverse order than this. On this ground alone, the order needs to go,"" he said.Questioning the trial court's findings, the ASG claimed ED has shown evidence for use of proceeds of crime by AAP in the Goa assembly elections and has traced an amount of Rs 45 crore.The ED also submitted that the high court had earlier taken into account statements made by approvers while rejecting a plea filed by Kejriwal challenging his arrest.The agency also pointed out that as per Section 45 of PMLA, a trial court while considering bail in money laundering cases has to give a prima facie finding that the concerned accused is not guilty. ""It has no discretion in this case where Section 45 of PMLA is involved. The court has to give a prima facie finding that he is not guilty of the offence,"" the ASG submitted.On the trial court's observation that ED had not provided direct evidence, the ASG pointed out that Magunta Reddy had met Kejriwal and the latter demanded Rs 100 crore as bribe. ""We have shown all this to prove that he had a role in the demand of Rs 100 crore. Yet the judge says no direct evidence. Direct evidence is in the form of a statement. There is corroboration also,"" said the ASG.Arguing for Kejriwal, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi told the court that the hearing in the trial court lasted for five hours out of which ED took 3.45 hours. Therefore, there is no question of ED being denied an opportunity to present its case, he said.""Just because there is political antagonism and if all the commas etc are not dealt with by the judge, it gives Mr Raju the right to malign the judge. This is deplorable and sad. It should never have come from a govt authority,"" said Singhvi.Opposing ED's submission that the trial court order granting bail to Kejriwal was perverse, the senior advocate said, ""Like Alice in Wonderland, ED has its own meaning of perversity... unless every argument of ED is repeated verbatim, it is perversity.""Singhvi pointed out that statements given in 2022 by four witnesses - Raghav Magunta, Buchi Babu, Abhishek Boinpally and Sarath Reddy - had not implicated Kejriwal. But later, Magunta Sreenivasa Reddy gave a statement against Kejriwal, and the next day, his son, Raghav Magunta, got bail. Buchi Babu also immediately got bail after he implicated Kejriwal, Singhvi submitted.Talking about proceeds of crime, Singhvi said that not ""one paisa"" has been traced to Kejriwal.","Delhi high court grants interim stay on a trial court order giving bail to Arvind Kejriwal.

"Mumbai doctor lured with Mukesh Ambani deepfake, cheated of Rs 7 lakh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-doctor-lured-with-ambani-deepfake-cheated-of-rs-7-lakh/articleshow/111147984.cms,"MUMBAI: A 54-year-old Ayurveda doctor from Andheri has lost over Rs 7 lakh after falling victim to a share trading scam that lured her with an Instagram reel featuring a deepfake video of industrialist Mukesh Ambani speaking highly of a company called 'Rajiv Sharma Trade Group' and encouraging people to join its BCF Investment Academy for high returns.

It is the second such deepfake video of Reliance Industries boss endorsing a stock trading mentorship programme doing the rounds - in the earlier one in March, he was seen urging viewers to follow his ""student Veenit"" on social media for free-of-cost investment advice.

Dr K K H Patil was duped between May 28 and June 10 when she transferred a total of Rs 7.1 lakh to 16 different bank accounts after being attracted by the promise of high returns and Ambani's ""endorsement"". She realised the fraud when she tried to withdraw the Rs 30 lakh that reflected on the trading website as profit she had earned on her initial investment.

Oshiwara police on Wednesday filed an FIR against an unidentified person under IPC sections for impersonation and cheating and under the IT Act section for identity theft. Police said the scamsters had used deepfake technology to create the video. Police are in touch with nodal officers of banks to block the money that she was made to transfer, an officer said.

Patil said she came across the video on Instagram and was convinced by seemingly legitimate endorsement. She invested her money after researching online, which showed the company had offices in BKC and London.

Once in place, the plan is to ship goods from the Indian ports to Haifa in 48 hours. But that will also require construction of missing rail links in parts of Saudi Arabia and Jordan, for which initial assessment is being undertaken. An Indian public sector company is involved with the exercise, sources said.“Although we have ships operating between India and UAE, the first phase of the project will syncronise the procedures for cargo and vessel clearances at ports on both sides through digitally enabled platforms streamlining operation. This will be the beginning of the IMEE-EC and will ensure ease of business,” said a source. Mainly containerised items will be transported through the multi-national transport corridor .This system will be operational between ports such as Mundra, Nhava Sheva and Kandla in India and Jabel Ali in the UAE.Officials said the govt nod to develop a mega port at Vadhavan in Maharashtra will also become a part of the IMEE-EC.","Digital platform to exchange information between ports of the two countries likely to be operational within first 100 days of Modi govt.

He also raised concerns over people's safety.Patole claimed that the construction quality of the bridge was poor and that a portion of the road has caved in by one foot.Talking to reporters, Patole alleged that the state government has crossed all limits of corruption and put people's lives at risk. ""A portion of the Atal Setu bridge has developed cracks within three months of the inauguration and a half-a-kilometre-long stretch of the road near Navi Mumbai has caved in by a foot.The state has spent Rs 18,000 crore for the MTHL,"" he said. ""The bridge has been named after former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and yet the government indulged in corruption. This is very unfortunate,"" he said. Patole also claimed that all environmental norms have been set aside for the Navi Mumbai International Airport as mangroves have been destroyed.The Maharashtra unit of Congress also took a dig at the BJP and said, ""Rs 17,843 crores of public money sunk by Modi in the first rain.""However, the ruling BJP as well as the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is the nodal agency for the project, said that the cracks were not on the bridge itself but on the approach road from Ulwe in Navi Mumbai.""Stop defaming Atal Setu,"" the BJP Maharashtra said in a post on X.""It is clear that the cracks in the road seen in the photo are not on the Atal Setu. Because these cracks were on the ground road leading to Atal Setu.

What team Kejriwal told high court

NEW DELHI: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was set to be out on bail for the second time after being arrested in the alleged liquor policy case. But before the order was even uploaded, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) hastily moved to the Delhi High Court against the trial court order and sought an urgent hearing.Throughout the day, a vacation bench of Justice Sudhir Kumar Jain heard the heated arguments between the councils of the probe agency and the Aam Aadmi Party chief and reserved its order. For now, the high court has put an interim stay on Rouse Avenue court's bail decision and Kejriwal will have to stay in jail. The high court said it was reserving the order for 2-3 days as it wanted to go through the entire records.Meanwhile, it has also issued notice to Kejriwal seeking his response on ED's plea challenging the trial court's June 20 order by which he was granted bail. It listed the plea for hearing on July 10.The Enforcement Directorate, which moved for urgent hearing in high court challenging bail order which was passed late Thursday evening, contended that the trial court's order was ""perverse"", ""one-sided"" and ""wrong-sided"".Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju, representing the ED, claimed that the findings were based on irrelevant facts. The relevant facts, he claimed, were not considered by the special judge.""Material facts were not considered by the trial court. There cannot be a better case for cancellation of bail than this one. There cannot be greater perversity than this,"" he argued.He also contended that the probe agency was not given adequate opportunity to argue its case.During the arguments, Raju also told the high court that when the ED lawyers urged the trial court to keep its order in abeyance for 48 hours to enable them to approach superior courts, the prayer was not considered.""I was not allowed to argue fully. I was not given proper time of 2-3 days to file written submissions. This is not done. On merits, I have an excellent case. The trial court said finish off in half an hour as it wanted to deliver the judgment. It did not give us full opportunity to argue the case,"" Raju contended, adding, ""I am making the allegations with full seriousness.""Section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) says an opportunity must be granted to the public prosecutor to present his case but that opportunity was not granted to me, he contended.He said the trial court did not even look at his reply on the ground that it was bulky and claimed that the trial court came to a conclusion that there was malafide on ED's part after considering wrong facts and wrong dates.He further contended that the trial court's findings contradicted those of the high court, which had upheld Kejriwal's arrest. Raju asserted that if irrelevant facts are considered, it constitutes a reason for the cancellation of bail. He pointed out that evidence of Kejriwal demanding Rs 100 crore was not taken into account by the trial court.""If irrelevant facts are considered, that itself is a reason for cancellation of bail. There is evidence that Kejriwal demanded Rs 100 crore but it was not considered by trial court,"" he argued.""End to end money trail was given by us,"" he asserted, adding that proceeds of crime were utilised in the Goa assembly poll campaign by the AAP.""End to end money trail was given by us,"" Raju stated, emphasizing that the proceeds of crime were used by the AAP during their campaign for the Goa assembly elections. He explained that the ED had named AAP as an accused in the money laundering case, and the offences fall under section 70 of the PMLA, which pertains to companies. The ED had compared AAP to a company and Kejriwal to its director, Raju argued.The probe agency's plea for stay on Kejriwal's bail was vehemently opposed by senior advocates Abhishek Singhvi and Vikram Chaudhari, representing the AAP leader. They said Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution does not exist for the ED for which the liberty of a person figured low in priority.Singhvi said the ED argued for 3 hours and 45 minutes before the trial judge.""This matter lasted for five hours (before the trial court). Nearly 3 hours 45 minutes were taken by Mr. Raju and then trial judge is faulted because she does not repeat every comma and full stop,"" he said.Singhvi urged the court not to stay Kejriwal's bail order and said it may send him back to jail later if it finds overwhelming and cogent circumstances.Singhvi criticised the ED's attempt to tarnish the reputation of the trial court judge presiding over the bail hearing. He argued that the agency's claim that the judge did not allocate sufficient time for their arguments and failed to consider relevant evidence was misguided and unfortunate.Singhvi emphasised that the ED's approach was deplorable and should never have originated from a government authority, especially in a case involving political antagonism. He clarified that a bail hearing should not be misconstrued, and the judge's handling of the case should not be questioned simply because every detail was not addressed.Advocate Chaudhari pointed out that Kejriwal's surrender to the jail authorities upon the expiration of his interim bail demonstrated his good faith and compliance with the legal process. He argued that granting bail to Kejriwal with court-imposed conditions would not cause any prejudice or harm to society, as he is not a terrorist or a threat to public safety.Chaudhari further questioned the potential consequences of allowing the chief minister of the state to be released on bail, suggesting that it would not have any detrimental impact on the proceedings or the society at large.""If he is out with conditions imposed by the court, what is the prejudice. He is not a terrorist that he will harm the society if he is let out. What will happen if the chief minister of the state comes out on bail?"" he argued.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for now has to remain in jail for another few days till the high court judgement to be ""delivered in two to three days"".""Till pronouncement, the operation of the impugned order shall remain stayed,"" the court said while putting an interim stay on the trial court decision granting bail to Kejriwal.(With PTI inputs)","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was set to be out on bail for the second time after being arrested in the alleged liquor policy case.

"Malihabad mangoes beat heat, pests with butter paper shield",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/malihabad-mangoes-beat-heat-pests-with-butter-paper-shield/articleshow/111175852.cms,"LUCKNOW: In this torrid summer of paper peaks and dummies, few will mind that mango growers in Lucknow's Malihabad have found a way to ""cheat"" the elements --- butter paper covers.This unique method saves the fruits from extreme weather conditions and climate change in the GI-protected mango belt famous for Malihabadi Dussehris, Gulab khaas, Husnara and more, nipping potential losses in the bud. Rolled out with the help of Lucknow's Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (CISH), the covers bags have helped save the crop not only from extreme heat and winds but also from pests.The innovation is striking in a country like India, the largest mango-producing nation in the world accounting for 46% of the output. UP accounts for 35% of India's mango produce but exports from the state and the country less than 10%, mainly due to poor preservation methods.In Malihabad, after a successful pilot phase last year, the farmers embraced the butter paper bags in a big way. ""The results were astounding. The fruit was not just bigger in size, its appearance was perfect. It held the original yellowish green colour that had almost slipped into history. Besides, the pulp was uniform and perfect contrary to the usually available jelly-like mush towards the seed,"" described Ram Sajeevan, a small orchard owner of Malihabad. in Malihabad.Before the use of bags, the growers were grappling with smaller and sunburnt fruits with dark patches. Unwanted gusty winds, unseasonal rains and unprecedented heat had hit their produce in the last two seasons.Taking lessons from the past, the mango growers reached out to Lucknow's CISH, whose scientists offered them this unique solution.Maneesh Mishra, principal scientist at CISH-Lucknow who worked with the farmers along with his team, pointed out that such bags were commonly used by vegetable and fruit producers in China, Vietnam and other nations.Primarily developed by Israeli scientists, such bags were tried out once earlier in Malihabad in 2016. But despite its benefits, it found no takers because of high costs. ""But the Covid lull and weather challenges left the farmers with two options -- innovate or perish. So, we started again last season, distributing about 4 lakh such bags to farmers for about a quarter of their trees. The difference was remarkable enough to make them embrace the change,"" said Mishra.Ujjwal Gupta, who leads a group of 2000 small orchard owners, listed other benefits. ""The bag came handy in several ways, besides saving the fruit from extreme weather. If kept well, one bag may be used for two seasons. Several southern states are giving a subsidy to mango growers to promote the use of such bags and get export-quality crop . If we get similar relief here, more farmers will adapt,"" Gupta said.The intervention brought juicy returns. ""Good quality crop fetched Malihabad farmers a handsome price of up to Rs 100 per kilogram of fruit,"" CISH-Lucknow director T Damodaran said.Listing other benefits, Damodaran said: ""The bags helped in saving the crop from unnecessary exposure to pesticides. On an average, growers in this region resorted to seven rounds of pesticide spraying. This number has come down to about three with the help of bags.""Moving off pesticides will take Lucknow's mangoes to many destinations overseas where import rules restrict the use of such chemicals in food. ""If we can meet the quality criteria with certification, many in US, Europe, Japan, Middle East and Southeast Asia are ready to spend anything for the mangoes from India,"" said Manoj Kumar Singh, agricultural production commissioner, UP.Less than 2% of UP's mangoes are exported; the figure is 6% for India. Gujarat, Maharashtra and the southern states hold the lion's share in exports, said officials.","Mango growers in Lucknow's Malihabad have found a way to ""cheat"" the elements --- butter paper covers. This unique method saves the fruits from extreme weather conditions and climate change.

Nikhil Gupta's extradition: Will it affect Indo-US ties?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nikhil-guptas-extradition-in-pannun-case-will-it-affect-indo-us-ties/articleshow/111176318.cms,"Nikhil Gupta , the Indian national at the heart of a India-US diplomatic firestorm over an alleged foiled plot to kill a Khalistan separatist, was extradited by Czech Republic to US last week, pushing the case back into limelight after the lull that preceded Indian elections.Gupta allegedly hired a hitman - at the instance of an Indian govt official -- to murder Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on US soil. Pannun is a Sikh separatist of dual US-Canadian nationality. According to US justice department, Pannun is an American national and political activist who was targeted for exercising a ""quintessential American right: his freedom of speech"". Gupta has pleaded not guilty.The Czech justice ministry announcement about Gupta having been extradited coincided with the arrival in India of US NSA Jake Sullivan, the White House point person leading the efforts to bring to justice the Indian official who allegedly masterminded the plot. The main purpose of Sullivan's visit was to undertake a review, along with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval, of the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET). However, his arrival was preceded by an interesting chain of events.Gupta's extradition was approved by Czech authorities on June 3, a day before results of Lok Sabha elections were declared in India. It was only 11 days later, and just three days before Sullivan's visit, that Gupta was flown to US from Prague on a special flight.These disclosures were made by Czech justice minister Pavel Blazek on the day Sullivan landed here. The same day, a group of Democrat senators in US wrote to secretary of state Antony Blinken seeking a stronger response over the alleged Indian involvement in the plot.These developments saw the murder-for-hire cast a shadow over Sullivan's engagements here, even though both sides took the Fifth on whether the issue was raised in the talks. The media coverage focused more on the Pannun case than the iCET talks that had the two sides pledging action to dismantle regulatory barriers against strategic technology cooperation. Sullivan had no media interaction during his visit, a rarity for a top US official. Even without that, the sequence of events leading up to the visit, by design or plain coincidence, foregrounded the Pannun plot, as Washington seeks action against the India-based conspirators.There'll likely be more pressure on New Delhi in the coming months to act against the Indian official who has already been identified in a Washington Post report. US justice department sees Gupta's extradition as a vital step towards justice and has said it won't tolerate attempts to silence or harm US citizens. Indian govt formed a committee in Nov to probe the US allegations but it has so far not made any of its findings public. This may become untenable as Joe Biden administration itself comes under renewed pressure to seek accountability from India.A group of Democrat senators led by Jeff Merkley, who is also a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Blinken calling for a strong diplomatic response in light of ""credible allegations"" about the involvement of an Indian official in the plot. They want a clear message sent to India that there will be consequences for such behaviour. With US elections still some distance away, it may be too early for India to think in terms of waiting out the storm. The Pannun case is also not just a one-off. India is facing similar allegations by Canada for the murder of another Khalistan separatist while an Australian media outlet recently claimed to have uncovered how Indian spies targeted Sikh separatists in Australia, a report that India Friday said was full of blatant untruths.While it may look like the relationship is in for a bumpy ride, it's unlikely the two countries will allow their partnership for ""global good"" to be stymied by the Pannun issue. A mature and nuanced India-US relationship, marked by what foreign minister S Jaishankar calls structural soundness, should be able to sail through a few blips, if handled carefully.This is reflected in how - unlike the situation between India and Canada - both sides have quietly worked together in the Pannun case without descending into a public slanging match. Jaishankar has said US, unlike Canada, doesn't defend extremism in the name of freedom of speech. It's also significant Sullivan didn't speak about the case in public, which he was widely expected to, during his visit. There will, of course, be apprehensions here about US using the case as a bargaining chip to extract concessions on contentious issues, especially those in the economic sector.Both sides also need each other - US, for a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China in the Indo-Pacific, and India, for access to cutting-edge technology crucial for its own growth and security. Sullivan's visit saw both sides reaffirming their commitment to iCET, the next big thing that might act as a guiding framework for further development of ties.That said, India will have to find a way to address US' quest for justice in the case. The issue has been raised at the highest level and, going by the tone and tenor of the voices emerging from US, not least the justice department, the Biden administration will have no option but to pursue the matter with India to its logical conclusion, which is the criminal prosecution of those who allegedly orchestrated the plot from India. As the senators warned in their letter to Blinken, any attempt at scapegoating - like only blaming a rogue operative - may not work.","Nikhil Gupta, the Indian national at the heart of a India-US diplomatic firestorm over an alleged foiled plot to kill a Khalistan separatist, was extradited by Czech Republic to US last week.

NEW DELHI: India slammed a recent ABC documentary which claimed to have uncovered details about alleged efforts by Indian officials to silence Sikh critics in Australia, saying it contains blatant untruths, is biased and reflects unprofessional reporting.

MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, in what was the first Indian reaction to the documentary, said it appears to serve a particular agenda to malign India. ""We obviously oppose any such attempts to condone, justify and even glorify terrorism,"" he said. The documentary claimed four Indian spies posing as diplomats were also expelled by Australia.

According to the documentary, apart from targeting Sikh separatists, Indian intelligence officers were trying to gain access to sensitive defence technology and airport security protocols. They were targeting former and current politicians as well as a state police service, it said.

The report further ""confirmed"" at least four intelligence officers were asked to leave Australia, adding some had been posing as diplomats in India's high commission. The documentary also quoted an Australian govt spokesperson as saying the govt was deeply concerned about the allegations. ""Australia values diversity and inclusion, where people should be safe and free to express who they are, including their faith and heritage. We do not tolerate violence or threats of violence,"" said an official statement.

Average retail prices of onion increased by 55% in the past one year - from Rs 23.3 a kg to Rs 36.3 a kg. Officials said the fall in rabi production, which has almost 60% share of the country's annual production of the key kitchen item, has triggered the rise in prices.The overall procurement of onions this year is around 80,000 tonnes, a little higher than the corresponding period of 2023. Officials said the consumer affairs department may start releasing onion from its buffer stock in Aug-Sept to keep a check on prices.Separately, the consumer affairs department said the stock limit on tur and chana dals would be applicable to wholesalers, retailers, big chain retailers, millers and importers. The move is aimed to ""prevent hoarding and unscrupulous speculation"" and also improve affordability. It said importers cannot hold imported stock beyond 45 days from the date of customs clearance.In govt's bid to encourage cultivation of pulses, agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Friday assured farmers of procuring 100% of their produce of tur, urad and masoor. Chairing a virtual meeting with agriculture ministers of major pulse producing states, including MP , Maharashtra, Rajasthan and UP , he urged states to work as a team with the Centre to push pulses production to achieve self-sufficiency by 2027.TOI has leant that the group of ministers headed by home minister Amit Shah had reviewed the trend of prices of essential commodities on Thursday and some key decisions included imposing stock limit and sale of Bharat dal, Bharat rice and Bharat atta.","Average retail prices of onion increased by 55% in the past one year.

NEW DELHI: Amid the controversy over NEET-UG results and the cancellation of UGC-NET exam due to paper leak, the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024 - the anti-paper leak law for examinations for central recruitment and entrance into central educational institutions that was passed by Parliament in Feb - came into effect on Friday.""In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (2) of section 1 of the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024 (1 of 2024), the central government hereby appoints the 21st day of June, 2024, as the date on which the provisions of the said Act shall come into force,"" said a gazette notification issued by the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions on Friday.The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act - the first-ever national law against the use of unfair means to rig recruitment exams conducted by UPSC, Staff Selection Commission, Railway Recruitment Board, Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS) and entrance tests for central educational institutions like JEE, NEET and CUET - seeks to address issues related to unfair means in the conduct of these exams, which are not covered under the purview of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.The anti-paper leak law provides for 3-5 years jail term and fine up to Rs 10 lakh for those impersonating a candidate, engaging in paper solving and not reporting an exam fraud. Those involved in organised crimes of cheating and other malpractices will face 5-10 years imprisonment and a minimum fine of Rs 1 crore.The thrust of the proposed law is to crack down upon persons, organised mafia and institutions engaged in paper leaks, paper solving, impersonation and hacking into computer resources, often in collusion with elements within the ""system"", for monetary or wrongful gains. Bona fide students, whose future gets jeopardised due to undetected leaks, cancellation of exams and holding up of results, will not be liable for action.Service providers and institutions found guilty of rigging public exams will have to bear the proportionate cost of examination, as per the law.","The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024 came into effect on Friday.

"States hike health spend, India set to meet '2.5% of GDP' target",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/states-hike-health-spend-india-set-to-meet-2-5-of-gdp-target/articleshow/111175669.cms,"India's govt spending on health, including on clean water and sanitation, looks set to achieve the target of 2.5% of GDP by 2024-25 despite Centre's allocation failing to reach 0.8% of GDP as planned. With states managing to push expenditure on health to 1.58% of GDP last year, the combined spending of states and Centre touched 2.13% of GDP.In govt's calculation, public health expenditure includes allocation for health and family welfare, health research, Ayush and for water supply and sanitation. Centre's allocation for health by this count was just 0.55% of GDP in 2023-24, with about 48% of that being funds for water supply and sanitation. The share of allocation for health and family welfare in Centre's budget has shrunk to 0.26% of GDP, lower than what it was in 2018-19 (0.28%).This is worrying, as it is the allocation for the department of health and family welfare that is used for funding national programmes and for maintaining and strengthening the public health system. While clean water and sanitation do contribute to people staying healthy, allocation for this cannot be a substitute for spending on the public healthcare system, say experts. If the spending on water and sanitation is not counted, the expenditure on public health has been steadily shrinking whether we look at it as a percentage of central govt's total expenditure or as a percentage of the GDP.After National Health Policy 2017 recommended spending 2.5% of the GDP on public health by 2025, a National Health Mission presentation in 2018 gave a roadmap for gradually increasing public spending on health by Centre and states over seven years from 1.4% to 2.5% of GDP.Going by the planned increase to touch 2.5% of GDP by 2025, central allocation for health from 2018-19 to 2023-24 fell short by over Rs 1.5 lakh crore while the combined spending on states was Rs 3.6 lakh crores more than planned (see graphic).States have been pushing up their spending on health (medical and public health, family welfare and water supply and sanitation). From 1.25% of GDP, the allocation of states went up to 1.58% by 2023-24. As a share of total expenditure of states, health spend has gone up from 7.5% in 2018-19 to 8.8% in 2023-24, more than the target of 8% recommended for states in the National Health Policy 2017. It is this increased allocation which might enable the overall target of 2.5% of GDP being achieved.However, states too have reduced their expenditure on the health system from a high of 75.3% of total health expenditure in 2019-20 to just below 70% in the budget allocation for 2023-24. The overall spending is high due to the increase in expenditure on water supply and sanitation.There are significant variations within states too, with some like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Haryana and Odisha spending well over the target of 8% of total govt expenditure on health and others like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka spending less than this.","National Health Policy 2017 recommended spending 2.5% of the GDP on public health by 2025.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday issued notice on petition filed by National Testing Agency (NTA) seeking transfer of pleas relating to NEET-UG, 2024 from high court to the apex court and stayed all proceedings before different high courts on alleged leak of NEET-UG exam question paper.The apex court also issued fresh notices to Centre and National Testing Agency seeking their responses on new petitions filed by students against NEET-UG and said that all petition so far filed would be taken up together on July 8.It refused to pass any interim order on the case.The announcement of the NEET-UG 2024 results on June 4 sparked significant backlash from both students and their parents. The results were met with legal challenges, which focused on three primary concerns. Firstly, there were allegations that certain students were awarded grace marks. There were also assertions that the question paper had been leaked prior to the examination. Suspicions were raised about potential malpractices at particular exam centres.SC once again declined to halt the counselling process for admissions based on the results of the NEET-UG examination. The court said that if the petitioning students were to succeed in their legal challenges, it would lead to the cancellation of the 2024 exam and the subsequent counselling process.This development follows the hearing on Tuesday, during which a petition seeking the cancellation of NEET UG 2024 was considered. During the proceedings, the court remarked that the 'sanctity of the exam has been affected' and requested a response from the National Testing Agency (NTA) regarding the matter.","Supreme Court issues notice on petition filed by National Testing Agency (NTA) seeking transfer of pleas relating to NEET-UG, 2024 from high court to apex court.

4 reasons why CM Punk will become the heel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/4-reasons-why-cm-punk-will-become-the-heel/articleshow/111173439.cms,"Here are the 4 major reasons why CM Punk will become the heel soon

1) World Heavyweight Championship

2) Rivalry against Seth and Damian

3) He is the best heel in the world

4) The Scotland Screw Job

The storyline involving Drew McIntyre has taken a dramatic turn due to CM Punk's actions. In a recent episode of RAW, Drew McIntyre announced his resignation and left the arena, attributing his decision to CM Punk, who has twice cost him the World Title. Punk has made a habit of interfering in McIntyre's matches, starting at Wrestlemania 40 and continuing at Clash at the Castle 2024. These actions strongly suggest a heel turn for Punk. However, the question remains: when will he fully embrace his role as a villain, or has he been a heel all along while fans were too entertained by his antics to notice? Let's explore five major reasons why CM Punk could officially turn heel soon.CM Punk has held both the World Championship and WWE Championship multiple times in WWE. Throughout his career, he has competed against top-tier superstars, proving himself as the ""Best in the World."" When Punk returned at the 2023 Survivor Series, he received a push from the company and earned the opportunity to face Seth Rollins for the World Title at WrestleMania 40. However, during the Royal Rumble match, Drew McIntyre hit Punk with a Future Shock DDT, causing an arm injury that forced Punk out of the WrestleMania title match.Drew replaced Punk in the match, ultimately defeating Seth Rollins to win the World Title. However, during his victory celebration, where he taunted Punk at the announce table, Punk retaliated with a quick assault. Taking advantage of the chaos, Damian Priest cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase and defeated Drew to become the new World Champion.Punk's actions suggest he is still focused on the World Title, possibly viewing Drew as his nemesis and employing mind games to remove him from his path. This could mean that Punk may also target Damian Priest in the future as part of his quest for the championship.For now, fans can assume that the rivalry between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk is over. CM Punk is now shifting his focus to Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins and Damian Priest. Although CM Punk always interfered with Drew McIntyre, it doesn't mean he has a friendly relationship with Damian Priest. With Drew off television for a while, CM Punk needs someone new to feud with, and Seth Rollins and Damian Priest are prime candidates. It's highly likely that CM Punk will interfere during the World Title match between Damian and Seth at Money in the Bank 2024. This will solidify CM Punk's role as a true heel in the company.Believe it or not, CM Punk is the best in the business when it comes to playing a heel. He has consistently been one of the greatest heels of all time, with his mic skills being his greatest asset. Punk's words can easily rub salt in anyone's wounds, and that's exactly what he's doing with Drew right now.His storyline with Drew is receiving positive responses from audiences, who appreciate Punk's portrayal of a negative character in Drew's life. It’s possible that WWE might fully embrace Punk's dark side and present him as a true heel in Drew's storyline. True CM Punk fans also enjoy seeing him as a bad guy, which is why WWE might soon bring about Punk's heel turn.Punk faced criticism for his interference in the World title match between Drew and Damian. Acting as a referee, he halted the count at two, which angered many fans, particularly those in Glasgow. Most attendees were disappointed, as they had hoped to see their Scottish Warrior win the World Title. This backlash from Scottish fans marks the beginning of CM Punk's heel turn. It's only a matter of time before the entire WWE Universe grows tired of his actions and begins expressing their frustration.","Drew McIntyre announced his resignation and left the arena, attributing his decision to CM Punk.

NEET Paper Leak: NEET-UG Paper Leak Case: Arrested Aspirant Confesses to ₹32L Scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/neet-ug-paper-leak-case-arrested-aspirant-confesses-to-32l-scam/articleshow/111151939.cms,"PATNA: The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-Undergraduate (NEET-UG) paper leak case is unfolding with new revelations emerging every day. Anurag Yadav, a student arrested in Patna , confessed that his uncle, Sikandar Yadavendu, a junior engineer at the Danapur Municipal Council, assured him of success in the examination. The night before the exam, Anurag was made to memorize the questions and answers, which perfectly matched the actual exam questions the next day.Further investigations revealed that the candidates involved in the alleged leak were accommodated at the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) guesthouse in Patna. Anurag’s name appears in the entry register with “Minister Ji” written in brackets next to his name, raising suspicions of political involvement.According to the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) sources, four of the arrested accused have confessed that question papers were arranged for some candidates a day before the exam. The candidates paid around Rs 30-Rs32 lakh for the leaked question papers. The confessions came from Anurag, his uncle Sikandar Yadavendu, and two others — Nitish Kumar and Amit Anand — who are believed to be the masterminds behind the paper leak. The confession letter of Anurag to the police states that the former arranged the NEET papers for him in advance. Anurag, who was preparing for NEET in Kota, was called to Samastipur by his uncle and introduced to Amit and Nitish. They provided him with questions and answers to memorize. During the exam on May 5, the student was shocked to find the same questions that were given to him the day before. Unfortunately, he was arrested after the exam.Yadavendu admitted that Amit and Nitish informed him about the paper leak, quoting a price of around Rs 30-Rs32 lakh. Yadavendu agreed and informed four students about the leak. On May 4, he took the students to a location where other aspirants were already memorizing answers to the leaked questions. Driven by greed, Yadavendu demanded Rs 40 lakh from each student instead of the original amount but was eventually caught by the police.Nitish and Amit confessed their involvement in the paper leak to the police, explaining how their collaboration with Yadavendu led to their arrest. After Yadavendu’s arrest, he revealed their involvement, and the police raided the location where the students were given the leaked papers. The remaining pieces of the burned question papers were discovered during the raid.The NEET-UG 2024, a crucial examination for aspiring medical students, took place on May 5. Surprisingly, the results were announced much earlier than the originally planned date of June 14, with the official declaration made on June 4. This early announcement raised eyebrows and added to suspicions surrounding the examination process.","Anurag Yadav, a student arrested in Patna, confessed that his uncle, Sikandar Yadavendu, assured him of success in the examination.

Instagram showing sexual Reels to teens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/instagram-showing-sexual-reels-to-teens/articleshow/111166707.cms,"Instagram is recommending sexual videos to users as young as 13 years old, according to a new study. The Wall Street Journal and a researcher from Northeastern University conducted tests over seven months that revealed alarming results.The study found that Instagram's video feature, called Reels , quickly began showing sexually suggestive content to test accounts set up as 13-year-olds. Within just three minutes of creating an account, sexual videos started appearing. After 20 minutes, the feeds were filled with adult content creators offering nude photos.""Instagram largely stopped recommending the comedy and stunt videos and fed the test accounts a steady stream of videos in which women pantomimed sex acts, graphically described their anatomy or caressed themselves to music with provocative lyrics,"" the Journal reported.The researchers created new Instagram accounts pretending to be 13-year-old users. They then watched videos in the Reels section, skipping over normal content but lingering on suggestive videos. They did not follow any accounts or search for specific content.At first, Instagram showed a mix of videos, including comedy and car clips. However, it soon began recommending more explicit content when the test accounts watched suggestive videos to completion. In some cases, Instagram recommended ""video after video about anal sex"" to a test account posing as a young teen.The Journal noted that similar tests on TikTok and Snapchat did not produce the same results. Those platforms did not recommend sexual videos to fake teen accounts.Meta , the company that owns Instagram, disputed the findings. A spokesperson called it ""an artificial experiment that doesn't match the reality of how teens use Instagram."" The company said it has been working to reduce sensitive content shown to teens.However, the Journal reported that Meta's own internal research has found similar problems. In 2021, company safety staff ran tests that produced comparable results. A 2022 internal analysis showed that Instagram displays more inappropriate content to young users than to adults.The findings come as social media companies face increasing scrutiny over their impact on young users. Meta has been sued multiple times over allegations of failing to protect children from exploitation on its platforms. In January, Meta announced stricter content controls for teens, but the recent tests suggest these measures may not be fully effective.","Instagram is recommending sexual videos to users as young as 13, according to a new study.

Heat wave in India: IMD has this important AC advisory for everyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/heat-wave-in-india-imd-has-this-important-ac-advisory-for-everyone/articleshow/111154670.cms,"What exactly IMD said on AC temperature

How setting AC at 24 degrees or higher can help save electricity bill

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has an important message for people across the country. In the midst of the ongoing heatwave, IMD has issued an important advisory on the right AC temperature. In its ‘Dos and Don’ts for Heat Wave ’ guideline document, IMD has recommended people to keep their AC temperature to 24 degrees or higher.“Maintain AC temperature at 24 degrees or higher. This will reduce your electricity bill and make your health better,” reads the document.Incidentally, it is not just IMD, but also the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) that recommends 24 degrees Celsius as the optimal temperature for AC for human comfort.One of the most common myths about ACs is that setting the temperature to the lowest cools the room faster. In reality, this makes the AC work harder to reach the set temperature. The AC's thermostat directs it to cool the environment to the desired temperature. For instance, setting it to 18 degrees Celsius keeps the compressor running continuously, increasing energy consumption.Conversely, setting the AC to 24 degrees Celsius or higher allows it to achieve the desired temperature over a few hours. This approach cycles the compressor on and off as needed, reducing both pressure on the compressor as well as electricity usage.","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has an important message for people across the country.

The move comes in response to new age verification laws aimed at preventing minors from accessing adult content online.Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, and Nebraska will join seven other states where Pornhub has already restricted access. The company says it's taking this action to protest laws that require users to upload government-issued ID to prove they are over 18 before viewing adult content.Pornhub argues these laws create privacy risks and could lead to identity theft . The company claims that when similar laws were implemented in Louisiana, traffic to their site dropped by 80%. They worry this pushes users to less secure websites that don't follow safety guidelines.""These laws have not only failed at protecting minors but have introduced further harm,"" Pornhub stated in a blog post. The company believes a better solution would be age verification through device operating systems, which would only require users to verify their age once.The adult entertainment industry faces increasing regulation across the United States. Some states have declared pornography a public health crisis. However, websites like Pornhub say the new laws violate free speech rights protected by the First Amendment.Critics of the age verification laws, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation , call them ""surveillance systems"" that could lead to misuse of sensitive data. They worry about the collection and potential sale of private information.Pornhub encourages its users to speak out against these laws and contact local governments to push for better solutions. The company acknowledges that ""normalizing sex work and sexual expression is an uphill battle"" but believes change is possible through education and public engagement.As more states consider similar legislation, the debate over online privacy, child protection, and freedom of expression is likely to continue.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"'Ukrainian soldiers turn to yoga on frontline, speed up recovery & rehabilitation'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukrainian-soldiers-turn-to-yoga-on-frontline-speed-up-recovery-rehabilitation/articleshow/111177236.cms,"Ukrainian soldiers are rolling out their yoga mats on the frontlines of the Ukraine war. At the command post of the 225th Separate Assault Brigade , their 37-year-old commander says yoga transformed his life. ""Before the beginning of the full-scale war, back in 2014, I was drafted into infantry operations and I hurt my spine. I started practising yoga regularly in 2016. All my problems disappeared,"" says the young commander. Yoga now helps him with his responsibilities in the war. ""I always try to do asanas, nauli and pranayama, and I read the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. It helps me have better control over my emotions and plan things in my duty.""In conflict-hit Ukraine, yoga is witnessing a rise in popularity for wellness, recovery and healing. There are projects to support Ukrainian yoga teachers and provide them with tools to deal with trauma and PTSD . Some special forces units of the Ukrainian army, like the Falcon Force, are even integrating yoga into their training.The 'Healthy Ukraine' programme, an initiative of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that started in 2021, gave yoga a serious boost. Active Parks, a project under the programme, transformed public parks into weekend fitness clubs, with instructors holding free classes. ""The response for yoga was overwhelming,"" says Elena Siderska, responsible for developing yoga in the project. ""Active Parks now supports studios and clubs that work with trauma, PTSD and rehabilitation of soldiers,"" Siderska adds.Siderska's father, Andrii Siderskyi, the doyen of yoga in Ukraine, says the roots of the Indic practice are long in his country. ""Actually, people in Ukraine came in contact with yoga as far back as the 19th century. Following World War II, Kyiv, Odessa and Kharkiv became some of the main centres of yoga in the Soviet era,"" says Siderskyi.Today yoga has travelled across the world and looped back to Ukraine. Yuliia Denisova works with the charity Fierce Calm. She has been using yoga to help injured Ukrainian soldiers at four rehabilitation centres. ""Yoga nidra and pranayama have had huge benefits for war veterans dealing with sleep disorder, PTSD, and amputation-related challenges,"" affirms Denisova. Valeria Samborskaya, who is running a project to promote trauma-sensitive yoga for Ukraine, concurs. ""We have seen affected soldiers being fearful of going near parks because they were injured in forested areas on the frontline . But after a few sessions of yoga, especially pranayama, they are able to overcome their mental trauma,"" she says. Denisova adds, ""I as a Ukrainian can't thank India enough for giving the world and keeping this wonderful ancient knowledge.""","In conflict-hit Ukraine, yoga is witnessing a rise in popularity for wellness, recovery and healing.

Trump's campaign officials clarify there would be an 'aggressive vetting process' for green cards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-campaign-officials-clarify-there-would-be-an-aggressive-vetting-process-for-green-cards/articleshow/111177001.cms,"In a surprising turnaround from policies he had pursued as the US president, Donald Trump on Thursday promised green cards to all foreign students graduating from US universities. During a podcast, Trump said he would institute policies where ""you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country, and that includes junior colleges"".But hours after Trump's unscripted remarks, his campaign officials tempered the comments, saying there would be an ""aggressive vetting process"" that would ""exclude all communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and public charges"", and that the policy would apply only to the ""most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America"".That would still open the doors to tens of thousands of skilled immigrants, mainly from India and China, who come to the US for higher education. By some estimates, more than a million foreign students come to the US every year; and at any given time nearly 300,000 students from India - now said to be the largest contingent of foreign students - are studying at US universities and colleges.In the ""All-In"" podcast hosted by David Sacks, a Silicon Valley investor who backs the former president's 2024 campaign, Trump appeared to be courting - at the risk of angering his voting base - the tech business community which has long sought to streamline the immigration process to get more high-skilled workers who come to America as students and graduate into H1-B visas that allow limited stay in the US. But Trump's nativist MAGA (Make American Great Again) base sees this as a betrayal of American workers.During the Trump presidency, his advisor Stephen Miller fashioned an immigration policy that restricted among other things a work-visa programme for foreign students even though the then president often spoke of giving permanent residency to immigrants who are wealthy and/or highly educated, at the expense of family-based immigration that also allows non-skilled or low-skilled immigrants to get a green card on the basis of family ties.","During a podcast, Trump said he would institute policies where ""you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card"" But hours after Trump's unscripted remarks, his campaign officials tempered the comments, saying there would be an ""aggressive vetting process""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111177174,imgsize-1540454,width-400,resizemode-4/111177174.jpg"
