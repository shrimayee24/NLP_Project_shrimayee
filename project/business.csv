Change Begins Here: 45 lakh and still counting- the Kudumbashree ambassadors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/change-begins-here-45-lakh-and-still-counting-the-kudumbashree-ambassadors/articleshow/113889901.cms,"NEVER-SAY-DIE: Bindu Pallichal with Kudumbashree members at their unit (top); Members participating in a food festival

When she was 15, Bindu Pallichal, from a remote village in the Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala, started giving tuitions to fund her impending college education and help her family that had limited financial resources. Little did she know then that one day, with govt support, she would set up her own business — applying her subject knowledge in Sanskrit and putting a family secret in making hair oil to entrepreneurial use.In 2007, when she joined Kudumbashree Mission, one of the world’s largest networks of women-run initiatives helmed by the govt of Kerala under its Local Self Govt Department (LSGD), Bindu’s only aim was to ensure her children didn’t grow up with a below-poverty-line tag.Seventeen years have passed since those baby steps. Today, Bindu is a proud entrepreneur, travelling to places, delivering motivational lectures, and training women on financial independence. She started off by selling herbal oil, going from door to door and earning around Rs 20,000 a month. Now, she manufactures a range of products — from herbal oils and jams to health drinks — and boasts of a monthly income of Rs 2 lakh. There are other women, all Kudumbashree members, who are helping her in her enterprise called Ayuraj Industries Pvt Ltd.Bindu’s isn’t the only success story, though. In the last 26 years, Kudumbashree, that celebrated its silver jubilee in 2023, has reached out to families in Kerala and empowered 45 lakh-plus women, including the poorest of the poor, by providing them with not just opportunities and finances, but also flexibility and proximity — allowing women to work at their convenient times, ensuring that their traditional role as the primary caregiver at home is never compromised.Explaining how Kudumbashree was born, noted economist MA Oommen , who did a seminal study on the role of the Kudumbashree movement in uplifting the social status of women in Kerala in 2007, said: “Under the central govt initiative of urban basic services, women formed self-help groups in Alappuzha. The idea of a microcredit enterprise grew out of this initiative. It was soon extended to Malappuram by the Kerala govt, and it indeed captured the potential for women empowerment. In the late 1990s, when Kudumbashree was launched as a women empowerment and poverty alleviation programme in Kerala, it was a great event with no parallel anywhere else in India.”Initiated by the State Poverty Eradication Mission (SPEM) of Kerala, Kudumbashree’s goal was to ensure community-based poverty eradication and women empowerment at the grassroots level by establishing micro-enterprises, principally led by women and ensuring they have adequate skill acquisition, financial autonomy and social mobility.Built around three vital components — microcredit, entrepreneurship, and empowerment — with the aim of improving the standard of living of poor women, ini tially Kudumbashree combined different kinds of activities such as generating savings, providing loans to members for the purchase of assets, providing education, helping with the construction of homes, and setting up of small scale industries.In later years, assistance was also provided with various income-generating activities such as chit funds, Onam fund, leasing arable land for paddy cultivation to the landless women members of Kudumbashree, roping them in for the ‘Clean Kerala business’, ensuring solid waste management, running ‘Janakeeya Hotels’ as part of the ‘Hunger-Free Kerala’ campaign. Along with organising self-employment programmes, members were also trained in farming, rearing goats, rabbits or quails.“The programme gives an opportunity to every woman to tap into their potential and earn a living out of it. This has saved many families from financial distress, pulling them out of poverty,” said Rathnavalli C from Malappuram district, who makes soft toys, stuffed dolls and artificial flowers and sells them at multiple Kudumbashree outlets, at airports in Kerala and also on online platforms.What made the programme different was that all these development initiatives were designed and implemented by women. Having ensured financial independence, members are now encouraged to actively participate in politics. Not only have Kudumbashree members voted in local self-govt elections, but many of them have even been candidates in these polls. “That nearly 17,000 Kudumbashree members fought elections and 7,071 have won is a great achievement in itself and an empowerment indicator compared to the rest of India,” Oommen said.“We’ve never stuck to any one initiative and have continuously evolved, even adopting artificial intelligence,” said Rajeena TM , the district mission coordinator from Ernakulam.With an eye on roping in the younger generation, several auxiliary groups have been formed. This was done after it came to light that members between 18 and 40 years of age constituted only 10% of the Kudumbashree workforce. Moreover, to ensure greater gender inclusivity, Kudumbashree has started special neighbourhood groups for transgenders to allow them an opportunity to earn a decent livelihood and lead a dignified life in society.“It is still at a nascent stage. We are now trying to attract qualified women who have taken a career break into the group,” said Jyothi S, who is pursuing her MBA and is herself an auxiliary group member.She said she was attracted to the group because of her mother who is an active Kudumbashree member in Ernakulam. For auxiliary group members, Kudumbashree has introduced spoken English classes, developed a website for job-seekers, especially those who have taken a career break.For women with an entrepreneurial zeal, there are also funding options, just like the one available for Kudumbashree members.Inspired by the way Kudumbashree is helping women, now several states in India and countries such as Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Mongolia, Uganda, Kenya, Malawi , and Liberia are trying to emulate this model. Kudumbashree is providing training to interested parties by providing valuable inputs on best practices, case studies and in-depth discussions on issues identified by the partner countries, with an eye on customistion.","Kudumbashree Mission is one of the world’s largest networks of women-run initiatives helmed by the govt of Kerala. It has empowered 45 lakh-plus women, including the poorest of the poor, by providing them with not just opportunities and finances.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113889933,imgsize-1232100,width-400,resizemode-4/113889933.jpg"
"After a bumper harvest in iPhone production, Apple set to make AirPods in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-a-bumper-harvest-in-iphone-production-apple-set-to-make-airpods-in-india/articleshow/113886905.cms,"NEW DELHI: After shifting iPhone production worth billions of dollars to India, Apple is set to step up the game in the country, having finalised plans to start producing AirPods , with a massive focus on exports.The company will start making the casing for the product at the Pune factory of American contract manufacturer Jabil, and thereafter the AirPods will be manufactured at a new unit of Foxconn in Telangana, sources told TOI.“It will be a mega operation, on the lines of the work done for iPhones, and will be focused mainly on global exports, considering that the market for AirPods is much bigger abroad than in India,” the sources said.A questionnaire sent to Apple as well as Foxconn was not answered.The AirPods production comes to India even in the absence of a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for hearables, something which is there for those making smartphones.Apple, which began manufacturing iPhones in India in 2021, is estimated to have exported around $14 billion of its smartphone production in FY24. This constituted 14% of the iPhone’s global production.The company is ramping up the iPhone production rapidly and has also started manufacturing the coveted Pro series of models from this year through its list of contract manufacturers -- Taiwanese Foxconn and Pegatron, and the local Tata group (who had taken over the operations of Wistron).The AirPods will be manufactured from next year, and will also be sold in India, the sources said, adding that Apple plans to ramp up the production “to a few billion dollars very rapidly.”“The focus on exports means that Apple will create a second large manufacturing base outside China, which currently is one of the key production centres for most of its products. The plan was the same when the iPhone manufacturing had started,” one of the sources said.The govt is enthused about the plans of the company to deepen its manufacturing in the country, especially as its products are in the premium category and add a lot of weight to the country’s export basket when shipped abroad.For Apple, India is gradually developing as a trusted manufacturing base, especially as many of its key vendors set up base here with the production volumes getting bigger. While state governments have pitched in with incentives for bagging the factories being set for the company’s products, the central govt has also been playing the role of a facilitator by showing leniency towards the entry of many of its Chinese parts vendors (notwithstanding the otherwise stiff positioning around investments from the neighbouring country due to border and diplomatic tensions).And as Apple prepares to add the AirPods to its India manufacturing, the company does not have any immediate plans to make the MacBooks in the country. This is despite the fact that the govt has been pushing laptop makers to Make in India, with an attractive production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme.“The MacBooks will take time when it comes to local manufacturing in India . First, the volumes for Apple’s premium notebooks are still limited here, and so the business case is also restricted. Also, with more than sufficient global production levels, creating new factories in India can lead to oversupply. Thus, MacBook production will take time as of now,” one of the sources said.","The company will start making the casing for the product at the Pune factory of American contract manufacturer Jabil.

Iran Launches Missile Attack On Israel, Causing Panic In Jerusalem | Watch

NEW DELHI: With Iran launching missile attacks on Israel late Tuesday night (India time) and the conflict set to worsen, airlines that used to overfly the region are scurrying for safety. Lufthansa ’s Tuesday flights from Frankfurt to Hyderabad and Mumbai returned to Germany as the airline decided not to venture in the war zone for safety reasons. Lufthansa’s Frankfurt-Hyderabad LH 752 and Frankfurt-Mumbai LH 756 were over Turkey when Iran launched missile attack on Israel.The aircraft turned back to Frankfurt. Consequently the return flights on these two sectors (India-Germany that these planes would have operated) early Wednesday have been cancelled.SWISS is avoiding the airspace over Iran, Iraq and Jordan. “This will increase flight times by up to 15 minutes on our Dubai, India and Southeast Asia services. Regardless of this short-term adjustment, Israeli and Lebanese airspace will be bypassed up to and including Oct 31,” SWISS said in a statement. Tuesday’s Zurich-Dubai flight diverted to Antalya in Turkey due to the longer route required to be taken. The aircraft will refuel in Antalya and continue its journey to Dubai outside the affected airspace.A Lufthansa spokesperson said, “Due to the current security situation, we are no longer flying through the airspace’s of Iraq, Iran and Jordan.” Tuesday’s Munich-Mumbai was able to operate.An Air India official said: “All our flights are assessed daily for any potential security or safety risks whether it is in the Middle East or any other part of our route network. Adjustments are made, if required, to avoid areas of risk with minimal impact on our non-stop operations.”Opsgroup — a global membership organisation for people in flight operations like pilots, flight dispatchers, schedulers, and air traffic controllers — had on Aug 1 released a “special briefing” on due to the increasing tension in the region. It said in the event of an “aerial attack” in the region, short notice closures of airspaces in Iran, Iraq and Jordan “are very likely.” It had advised members that “ongoing GPS spoofing, which can impact a multitude of aircraft systems, is predominant in two areas: Black Sea and Eastern Mediterranean.”This April also when the region as very tense, “GPS jamming and spoofing levels surged in the Middle East, with major blackout/interference spots apparent in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, as well as Israel. Traffic routing via Egypt and Saudi on a Middle East transit (Southern Route) should expect spoofing and be alert for early signs of that,” Opsgroup had said.Several pilots operating to the west say GPS spoofing and jamming is worsening by the day. “The moment we cross Iran-Pakistan border, jamming and spoofing start. This continues right till we clear Turkey in the west. The Russian airspace also has this issue, especially closer to the troubled regions,” say pilots.“We inform enroute ATCs about this and ask them to monitor aircraft position on radar. We are using the alternate DME-DME update that uses the plane’s last location to keep track of its location,” say multiple senior pilots. Airline crew are trained to deal with GPS jamming and spoofing. With multiple war zones and security theatres, this is becoming a real issue especially while crossing international borders and conflict zones as a bid to confuse crew. Airlines exchange notes on this issue in a real time basis.","Airlines that used to overfly the region are scurrying for safety.

Strengthened relations with neighbors

(With inputs from agencies)

External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday strongly defended India’s right to respond to US political leaders’ comments about Indian democracy during an address at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. In a pointed message, he said the US should not ""feel bad"" if India comments on their internal affairs in response.In a candid response to questions regarding US political figures' remarks on India's democracy, Jaishankar explained that the globalised nature of the world has blurred the lines between domestic and international politics.He emphasised that while democracies can discuss global issues, mutual respect must be maintained.""It cannot be that one democracy has a right to comment on another and that’s part of promoting democracy globally, but when others do that, then it becomes foreign interference,"" Jaishankar asserted. He clarified that foreign interference is unacceptable, regardless of the country behind it, remarking, ""Foreign interference is foreign interference, irrespective of who does it and where it is done.""Jaishankar’s remarks came in the context of increasing US commentary on democratic developments in India. He acknowledged that the US has long shaped international politics through its foreign policy and that in today’s interconnected world, political narratives are shaped globally, not just domestically.""The United States makes a special effort to ensure [its politics] doesn’t stay within its national boundaries. That is a part of how the US has conducted its foreign policy over the years,"" he observed. He also stressed that India reserves the right to comment on these matters, noting, ""You have every right to comment, but I have every right to comment on your comment. So don't feel bad when I do.""Jaishankar also addressed India’s evolving relationships with its neighboring countries, highlighting that these ties have grown significantly stronger since independence. He pointed to increased cooperation in infrastructure, trade, and energy, noting that ""our relationship with our neighbors would be much stronger than it has been since independence.""The EAM underscored India's efforts to foster regional integration, citing improvements in power grids, fuel flows, rail lines, and airways. He said that the flow of people and goods across borders had drastically increased, further enhancing India’s regional influence. ""Every year, we issue about 1.5-1.6 million visas to Bangladesh alone, and we have much more trade and economic activity than ever before,"" Jaishankar said.However, he acknowledged the challenges posed by political changes in the region, especially in countries like Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Recent political shifts, including Mohamed Muizzu's rise to power in the Maldives and leadership changes in Nepal and Sri Lanka, have presented new diplomatic challenges for India.","S Jaishankar said the US should not ""feel bad"" if India comments on their internal affairs in response.

Will Prashant Kishor's pitch against liquor ban in Bihar be a gamechanger for his Jan Suraaj Party?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-prashant-kishors-pitch-against-liquor-ban-in-bihar-be-a-gamechanger-for-his-jan-suraaj-party/articleshow/113882194.cms,"NEW DELHI: Political strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor has dared to tread an uncharted territory in Bihar politics in recent times with his promise of scrapping liquor ban in the state, within an hour, if voted to power by the people in assembly elections due next year.Interestingly, liquor ban is considered to be one of the important factors behind the continued electoral success of Nitish Kumar, who is now the longest serving chief minister of Bihar.Many analysts believe liquor ban helped increase Nitish Kumar 's popularity among women, espcecially in the rural areas. Little wonder, none of the mainstream parties have spoken openly against it, perhaps for the fear of losing women voters. There have been some individual voices against the law, but none of the parties has opposed it openly.Liquor ban was implemented in Bihar in 2016 to deal with the problem of alcoholism and problems related to it in the state. It was also Nitish Kumar’s election promise to the women of the state who suffered due to excessive drinking of their male members and as such it helped consolidate women voters in favour of ruling JD(U).However, implementing the liquor prohibition law has been a huge challenge for the Nitish government. Despite the ban, Bihar has reported several official deaths caused by consuming of illicit alcohol and also hooch tragedies. The conviction rate has also been very poor. Moreover, the stringent provisions of the law has led to widespread resentment in the state among a large population, which perhaps Prashant Kishor hopes to capitalise.Prashant Kishor claims prohibition law is annually causing losses to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore to Bihar. He plans to plug this loss after scrapping the law and use the money to provide world-class education system to the children and youth of the state.""We will need more than Rs 4 lakh crore to improve education in the state. We will raise the money by scrapping the prohibition law which is annually causing losses to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore. I reiterate that once Jan Suraaj comes to power, the ban on liquor will be scrapped within one hour,"" said the 47-year-old leader during the launch of hisJan Suraaj Party .""When the liquor ban will be removed, that money won't go into the budget and will not be used for the security of leaders, nor it will be used for roads, water and electricity. That will be used only for building a new education system in Bihar,"" he added.""Jan Suraaj's top priority will be on quality education for children,"" he said and urged people to think about their children's future. ""How many times have you voted for the education and employment of your children? Education quality and employment were never prioritised in Bihar because you never voted for these things,"" Kishor said.But the big question is - Will Prashant Kishor's emphasis on improving education have takers in a state where caste and religion have played a big role in politics? Are people in Bihar ready to say yes to liquor? Will it be a gamechanger for his Jan Suraaj Party? We do not know the answers to all these questions now. But what we do know is that Prashant Kishor's ""scrap liquor ban"" agenda will surely trigger a much-needed debate on the effectiveness of the prohibition law.The mainstream parties have played down Prashant Kishor's entry into politics with the RJD calling Jan Suraaj Party a B-team of the BJP and the saffron party taking potshots at him and claiming at least two parties get registered in Bihar before polls every time. However, it is the people of Bihar who would next year decide the fate of Jan Suraaj Party and its scrap liquor ban agenda.","Prashant Kishor claims prohibition law is annually causing losses to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore to Bihar.

"This winter may be harsh in North India due to La Nina conditions, indicates IMD",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/this-winter-may-be-harsh-in-north-india-due-to-la-nina-conditions-predicts-imd/articleshow/113863095.cms,"NEW DELHI: Summer monsoon, which ended on Monday in the 'above normal' category after recording nearly 8% higher than normal rainfall, is likely to fully withdraw from the country by mid-October and the winter monsoon will set in around the same time (by Oct 17) in the southeast peninsula, the IMD said on Tuesday. It also hinted at the possibility of a harsh winter in north India, specially northwest India, including Delhi-NCR and adjoining central region, as La Nina conditions are expected to form during Oct-Nov.La Nina is a climate phenomena associated with the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. Though it is linked to good monsoon rainfall in the Indian sub-continent, it remained absent during the southwest (summer) monsoon months despite forecasts by different global models.""There is a 71% chance that La Nina conditions will develop during Oct-Nov... The years when you have La Nina, temperatures in the northern part of the country, specially northwest India and adjoining central region, are below normal (colder than normal)... So, you can have cold wave conditions during winter months,"" said IMD chief, Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.He, however, underlined that its severity would be known only later as the La Nina condition is still weak and the Met department will have to monitor how much it will be strengthened in January or February. The IMD will follow it up and will be able to come out with a more precise forecast only in November.Good rainfall this year, however, was mainly due to other factors including six depressions, 14 'low pressure systems' in Bay of Bengal and one cyclonic storm 'Asna' in the Arabian Sea.Overall the ‘above normal’ rainfall during the season not only helped increase the acreage of the kharif (summer sown) crops beyond ‘normal’ (average of last five years) sown area, bringing hope of good crop output, but also filled reservoirs that take care of irrigation needs of rabi (winter sown) crops and hydro-power generation.Region-wise performance of the summer monsoon that technically ended on Monday showed a very unique feature of regional variation in rainfall this year with arid west Rajasthan receiving excess rainfall to the extent of 71% more showers than what it normally gets. Similarly, west Gujarat too received 75% more than its normal rainfall during the season.Mohapatra attributed ‘large excess’ rainfall in west Rajasthan and west Gujarat to formation of more numbers of ‘low pressure systems’ and ‘depressions’ that this year extended as far as Rajasthan and Gujarat. He also noted how the monsoon trough remained south of its normal position, bringing ‘large excess’ rains in both these meteorological subdivisions, covering 9% of the total area of the country.Out of the total 36 meteorological subdivisions in the country, two subdivisions received large excess rainfall, 10 subdivisions constituting 26% of the total area received excess, 21 subdivisions received normal rainfall (54% of the total area) and three subdivisions (Arunachal Pradesh, Punjab, J & K and Ladak) constituting 11% of the total area received deficient season rainfall.Data shows that Punjab and Arunachal Pradesh each received 28% less than normal rainfall whereas J&K and Ladakh got 26% deficit rainfall.",Summer monsoon ended on Monday in the 'above normal' category after recording nearly 8% higher than normal rainfall. The winter monsoon will set in around the same time (by Oct 17) in the southeast peninsula.

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor , a former political strategist turned activist, officially launched his political party, Jan Suraaj Party , on Wednesday at an event held at Veterinary College Ground in Bihar 's Patna.The launch was attended by several prominent figures, including former Union minister Devendra Prasad Yadav, diplomat-turned-politician Pavan Varma, and ex-MP Monazir Hassan.""Jan Suraaj campaign is going on for 2-3 years. People are asking when we will be forming the party. We all must thank God, today, the Election Commission has officially accepted Jan Suraaj as Jan Suraaj Party,"" Kishor said during the event.During his speech, Kishor emphasised the need for a world-class education system in Bihar, saying that Rs 5 lakh crore would be required over the next decade to achieve this goal.He also criticised the state's liquor ban , claiming that it results in an annual loss of Rs 20,000 crore, which could be utilised for improving education, infrastructure, and other essential services.""If Bihar has to have a world-class education system, Rs 5 lakh crore is needed in the next 10 years. When the liquor ban will be removed, that money won't go into the budget and will not be used for the security of leaders, nor it will be used for roads, water and electricity. That will be used only for building a new education system in Bihar.

Bharti, who hails from Madhubani, pursued his education at Netarhat in Jharkhand before enrolling at IIT Kanpur. He later completed his M Tech degree from IIT Delhi. Bharti has had a distinguished career in the foreign service, representing India as an ambassador to several countries.During his diplomatic tenure, he served as India's ambassador to Ukraine, Belarus, Timor-Leste, and Indonesia.Prior to the party's launch, Kishor called upon the people to raise the 'Jai Bihar' slogan loudly enough to be heard in Delhi, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu, where children from Bihar have been subjected to abuse and violence. He emphasised the need for Biharis to assert their identity and demand respect from the rest of the country.""You all need to say 'Jai Bihar' so loud that no one calls you and your children 'Bihari' and it feels like abuse. Your voice must reach Delhi. It must reach Bengal, where students from Bihar were beaten. It must reach Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Bombay wherever Bihari children were abused and beaten,"" Prashant Kishor had said.","Former political strategist Prashant Kishor officially launched his political party, Jan Suraaj Party, on Wednesday. The launch was attended by several prominent figures, including former Union minister Devendra Prasad Yadav, diplomat-turned-politician Pavan Varma, and ex-MP Monazir Hassan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113877640,imgsize-1294483,width-400,resizemode-4/113877640.jpg"

CM Sarma said the region has become a significant center for the semiconductor industry .Responding to Kharge's remarks on social media, Sarma expressed gratitude for Karnataka’s acknowledgment of Assam's advancements.He posted on X, ""When a minister from Karnataka speaks about Assam and its semiconductor project, I can only sincerely thank God that in just 3 1/2 years, Assam has been elevated to a position where even Karnataka, one of the most advanced states in our country, recognizes our achievements.""This exchange followed Kharge's criticism against Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Assam CM. Addressing Himant, Kharge questioned the fairness of project allocations, stating, ""CM @himantabiswa, PM @narendramodi and you protecting your respective State's interests are considered 'masterstrokes' and if I protect Karnataka's interests, it is considered being anti-Assam?"" He further added, ""Jokers of @BJP4Karnataka, do you agree on this? Hoping Sri. @BYVijayendra will share his invaluable insights on this. CM Sarma saab, Why don't you ask your PM to be benevolent enough to give Assam 2, Karnataka 2 and Gujarat 1 semiconductor projects instead of arm twisting companies?""In his response, Sarma pointed out the significant improvement Assam has seen in recent years. He wrote, “Assam Congress leaders must understand that Assam is now in a position to negotiate with major companies and compel them to invest here. Once known for militancy, Assam is now on the verge of becoming a hub for the semiconductor revolution.”Earlier, on July 16, the Assam government handed over land in Morigaon to the Tata Group for setting up a semiconductor plant. The 517.27 bighas of land was leased to Tata Group for 60 years, marking a significant step forward for the project.The formal lease agreement was signed at the Sub-Registrar's office in Morigaon, paving the way for construction to begin soon.","Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma responds to criticism from Karnataka MLA Priyank Kharge.

'Workers holding employers' cash as fiduciaries are not benamidars',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/workers-holding-employers-cash-as-fiduciaries-are-not-benamidars/articleshow/113885884.cms,"MUMBAI: The appellate tribunal which adjudicates benami matters has held that employees can hold cash in a fiduciary capacity for their employers, without it being classified as a benami transaction. This order can support both employers and employees who face a similar situation.""Fiduciary relationships involve trust and confidence, often between employer and employee, where the employee is acting in the interest of the employer.In several business setups employees do hold cash in a fiduciary capacity,"" explained Ashwani Taneja, one of the advocates who represented the employees.Cash held by employees in a fiduciary capacity, falls under the exception to the definition of a 'benami' transaction under Section 2(9)(A)(ii) of the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act , 1988. However, it is essential that the relationship of trust and safekeeping is well established, and there is no conflict of interest or intention of personal gain. Taneja said that while this tribunal order is not binding, it will have a persuasive impact and can be referenced in similar cases.In this case of Jiten Pujari and others, following a search conducted under the Income-tax (I-T) Act, a sum of nearly Rs 10 crore was found in several bank lockers of the employees. The employees did not claim ownership of the cash and stated that it belonged to their employers. In turn, the employers also did not disown the ownership of the cash. In addition, the sum was added to the income of the employers and taxed in their hands.Based on the facts, the tribunal noted that the employees were holding the cash for safekeeping, which falls under fiduciary duty, rather than being part of a benami transaction. On the other hand, if a transaction is treated as a benami transaction, the assets are confiscated by govt, the parties involved face imprisonment for up to 7 years and stiff penalties.","Employees can hold cash in a fiduciary capacity for their employers, without it being classified as a benami transaction.

TOI had reported on Tuesday that Jaishankar will visit Sri Lanka on October 4.Jaishankar’s visit for a meeting with the new president, barely a couple of weeks into Dissanayake’s presidency, is meant to build on the Indian outreach to the relatively unfamiliar leader ahead of the presidential poll that saw him visiting India earlier this year. The Indian government is also banking on the goodwill generated by its $ 4 billion-worth assistance to the strategically crucial Indian Ocean nation - in the middle of an acute financial crisis - to ride out any negative fallout from the winds of political change blowing in the country.Jha also met the new Lankan PM, Harini Amarasuriya, on Wednesday. According to Dissanayake, the high commissioner reflected on the long-standing friendship and closeness between the two nations, highlighting the importance of maintaining a continuous and stable partnership as neighbouring states.Furthermore, the president added, Jha pointed out the significance of digitizing government systems to effectively combat corruption. ``He appreciated the anti-corruption program outlined in our policy statement, and he expressed India’s willingness to assist Sri Lanka in implementing these digitization initiatives,’’ said Dissanayake.Dissanayake’s anti-corruption focus in the election campaign found a lot of traction among young voters, who were upset with the mishandling of Sri Lanka’s financial crisis and also with discredited political dynasties who for long held the reins of power. India believes Dissanayake’s emphasis on rooting out corruption in the handling of infrastructure projects will work in its favour as it believes in transparent infrastructure development backed by responsible debt financing practices.","Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake met Indian high commissioner Santosh Jha.

As a result, there were no discussions about it in society and it was like they made dirt a part of their lives,"" he said at an event to mark the 10th anniversary of Swachh Bharat Mission The PM urged the citizens to make cleanliness a lifelong mission, instead of a one-day ritual, arguing that the programme had a positive impact on public health and well-being of a large section of the society.Pointing out that more than 60% of the country's population was compelled to defecate in the open until 10 years ago, it was ""disrespectful towards the country's poor, Dalits, tribals and backward communities"", which continued from one generation to the other. He said women had to undergo the pain and faced threats to their health and safety as it was never a priority of the earlier govts.With the mission becoming a mass public movement, more than 12 crore toilets were built in the country and their coverage reached 100% from less than 40% in just five years of the mission.Slamming the earlier govts for ignoring this critical issue Modi said those who used Mahatma Gandhi for their political benefits and vote bank forgot his subject of interest and hardly did anything to improve cleanliness. He also recalled facing criticism after speaking about swachhta from the ramparts of the Red Fort. He said, ""Prime Minister's first priority is to make the lives of common citizens easier. I talked about toilets and sanitary pads, and today, we see the results.""He recollected how lakhs of people joined hands when the mission was launched, be it marriage or a public function or any other place, the message of cleanliness was spread effectively. Modi mentioned how women sold their cattle and mangalsutras to build toilets; few sold their land; some retired teachers donated pension and some retired Army personnel donated their retirement benefits for the cleanliness mission.On the success of the mission, Modi said Clean India is the world's biggest and most successful mass movement in the 21st century. ""When people talk about 21st century India even after 1,000 years, they will definitely remember SBM,"" he said.Earlier, Jal Shakti minister C R Patil said, ""Like people remember Gandhi-ji for India's independence, Modi-ji will be remembered for the Swachh Bharat Mission even after 100 years.""Highlighting the impact of the mission on public health, Modi said the number of infectious diseases among women has reduced significantly due to the mission.On this occasion, Modi also launched and laid the foundation stone for several sanitation and cleanliness projects worth over Rs 9,600 crore.","PM Narendra Modi said lack of toilets was an ""insult to the poor"" and was against ""human dignity"" He was speaking at an event to mark the 10th anniversary of Swachh Bharat Mission.

During April-June 2023, the increase was 10%.This increase is despite stiff competition from banks in the segment. According to RBI's sectoral data on bank credit for Aug 2024, gold loans grew nearly 41% year-on-year to Rs 1.4 lakh crore.On Monday, RBI had directed banks and finance companies to review their gold loan policies and procedures, and to rectify any deficiencies within three months' time. This followed a review that uncovered irregular practices such as hiding bad loans as well as evergreening loans through top-ups and roll-overs without proper appraisal.While gold loans are easy to access, given the collateral, they are treated as the last resort borrowing by those who unable to tap into other sources of funding.The growth in gold loans is more than double the overall NBFC industry's growth, which saw loan growth of 12% year-on-year.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Malcolm Gladwell , the best-selling author ofone of the most important non-fiction books of the 21st century, is back with its dark sequelWhile discussing the new book with the Guardian, Gladwell calls out what he calls Harvard’s admission officers’ “bias towards affluent white students”.Pointing out the disparity between Harvard and an institution with a merit-based admissions process like Caltech compared to Harvard, he writes: “My suspicion is that for many people it’s unconscious, but there must be a point at which [Harvard admissions tutors] are confronting the fact that they have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their campus hasn’t become dominated by Asians and Indians.”In the book, Gladwell notes that Caltech, a highly competitive university with a merit-based admissions system, saw the proportion of Asian American students rise from 25% to 43% between 1992 and 2013.In contrast, at Harvard, where the admissions process is influenced by factors such as legacy, donor contributions, and athletic scholarships, the percentage of Asian American students has remained consistently between 15-20% during the same period. Indian applicants are even more likely to be excluded by Harvard’s application process.Gladwell goes on to argue: ""Meritocracy is one of the most beautiful inventions of the 20th century – it is a foundation of a free society.""Here are 10 other key points aboutand Malcolm Gladwell:Malcolm Gladwell was initially reluctant to revisit his debut work but ultimately chose to create an entirely new version, one that reflects today's more anxious world rather than simply updating the original.The foundational idea that social trends behave like epidemics, initially growing slowly before suddenly taking off, still holds true. However, some of Gladwell's original examples have not aged well.Gladwell now finds his earlier chapter on crime ""embarrassing,"" as he once credited New York City's crime reduction to 'broken windows' policing. He has since acknowledged that this approach led to over-policing in minority neighbourhoods and wasn't actually responsible for the drop in crime rates.Gladwell values the process of learning from errors, a trait he respects in his father. He proposes that authors should periodically reassess their original works every 25 years to stay aligned with new insights.The new book is darker and more nuanced than the original. It delves into how a small number of individuals can disproportionately influence significant events, such as the opioid crisis, where a minority of doctors were responsible for nearly half of all prescriptions.While The Tipping Point became a cultural phenomenon, Gladwell’s latest book explores how individuals with substantial influence can shape societal changes, both positively and negatively.Gladwell reflects on how male leadership failures over the past eight years make a strong case for female leaders, particularly in the current political climate.Gladwell has expressed his support for Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election, noting a personal connection through his mother, who shares Jamaican heritage with Harris's father.He argues that recent examples of male leadership failures have made it increasingly difficult to justify misogynistic attitudes and believes that America is ready for a female president.Now living with his partner and two young daughters, Gladwell views parenting as a journey of intellectual humility. He continuously adapts his understanding of his children as they grow and sees this phase of his life as a ""productivity mechanism"" that shapes his evolving perspective.","Malcolm Gladwell's new book, ""Revenge of the Tipping Point,"" is darker and more nuanced than the original.

Islamabad, In an effort to minimise administrative expenditures, cash-strapped Pakistan on Sunday announced to abolish about 150,000 government posts , close six ministries, and merge two others, as part of reforms agreed upon with the IMF under USD 7 billion loan deal . The International Monetary Fund on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to cut expenditures, increase tax-to GDP ratio, tax non-traditional sectors like agriculture and real estate, limit subsidies and transfer some fiscal responsibilities to provinces.Addressing the media on his return from the US, Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb said that a programme had been finalised with the IMF, which would be the last programme for Pakistan.""We need to implement our policies to prove that it will be the last programme,"" he said, and emphasised that in order to join the G20, the economy must be formalised.The minister said right-sizing within ministries was going on and the decision to close six ministries is set to be implemented, while two ministries will be merged. ""Additionally, 150,000 posts across various ministries will be eliminated,"" Aurangzeb said.He dwelt at length on increasing tax revenues, noting that there were approximately 300,000 new taxpayers last year, and so far this year, 732,000 new taxpayers have registered, increasing the total number of taxpayers in the country from 1.6 million to 3.2 million.Aurangzeb also said that the non-filers category will be abolished and those not paying taxes will no longer be able to purchase property or vehicles.The minister claimed that the economy was moving in the right direction and the country's foreign exchange reserves had increased, reaching their highest level. He highlighted significant growth in both national exports and IT exports, and stated that investor confidence regarding the strength of the economy is a major success.Aurangzeb stated that the policy rate has been reduced by 4.5 per cent by the government after coming to power, and expressed optimism that the exchange rate and policy rate will remain as expected.""Our claim that the economy is improving is not a hollow claim because inflation has decreased due to government policies. Inflation has dropped to single digits,"" he said.Pakistan has been struggling to fix its economy for the last many years and it was close to default in 2023 but a timely loan of USD 3 billion by the IMF saved the situation.Pakistan has negotiated a long-term loan with the global lender with the hope and commitment that it would be the last loan. However, many doubt this claim as the country has already secured about two dozen loans from the Fund but failed to address the economy on a permanent basis.","Pakistan to abolish about 150,000 government posts, close six ministries, and merge two others.

Citing Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif 's United Nations General Assembly ( UNGA ) speech where he accused New Delhi of ""escalating tensions"" in Kashmir, Jaishankar also warned that Islamabad's ""actions will most certainly have consequences"".Addressing the UNGA, Jaishankar said that the ""issue to be resolved between the two countries is only the vacation of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir by Islamabad and the abandonment of its long-standing attachment to terrorism.""""Some make conscious choices with disastrous consequences. A premier example is our neighbor Pakistan. Unfortunately, the mystics affect others as well, especially the neighbors.

On the contrary, actions will certainly have consequences. The issue to be resolved between us is only the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan and of course, abandonment of Pakistan's long-standing attachment to terrorism,"" he added.This comes a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif remarks, calling India to reverse its ""unilateral and illegal"" actions in Jammu and Kashmir, referring to the 2019 revocation of Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu & Kashmir.""India spurned Pakistan's proposals for a mutual strategic restraint to the regime. Its leadership has often threatened to cross the line of control and take over Azad Kashmir,"" Shehbaz Sharif claimed.Soon after his remarks, the first secretary of India’s permanent mission to the UN Bhavika Mangalanandan also responded sharply in UNGA and, in turn, highligted Pakistan's usage of cross-border terrorism as a key strategy against India, citing numerous incidents, including the attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001 and the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.""The list is long,"" Mangalanandan said in retort to Islamabad's unfounded assertions. She further said that there can be ""no compact with terrorism"" and that Pakistan's cross-border terrorism against India will ""inevitably invite consequences"".

Thai farmer electrocuted over 100 endangered crocodiles on his farm; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/thai-farmer-electrocuted-over-100-endangered-crocodiles-on-his-farm-heres-why/articleshow/113842259.cms,"A Thai crocodile farmer , known by his nickname ""Crocodile X,"" faced an agonizing choice as Typhoon Yagi wreaked havoc in Southeast Asia. Natthapak Khumkad , a 37-year-old owner of a crocodile farm in Lamphun , northern Thailand, revealed that he had to euthanize more than 100 critically endangered Siamese crocodiles to prevent them from escaping into the nearby community.As relentless rains from the typhoon eroded the walls of his crocodile enclosure, Natthapak frantically searched for a new home for the crocodiles. Yet, no space was available that was secure enough to contain the massive reptiles.Natthapak ultimately prioritized the safety of local residents over the reptile. He told CNN, ""I had to make the most difficult decision of my life to kill them all. My family and I discussed the potential consequences if the wall collapsed. The damage to people's lives would be far greater than we can control. It would involve people's lives and public safety.""Despite the crocodile farm's 17-year history and its resilience through numerous rainy seasons, this year's prolonged downpours proved disastrous. With the enclosure's erosion rapidly progressing, Natthapak faced a pressing ultimatum—take immediate action or risk a larger catastrophe. ""I had to make a decision in less than 24 hours when I saw the erosion progressed rapidly,"" he explained. He ultimately chose to electrocute the crocodiles, a method he considered necessary given the dire situation.Typhoon Yagi's impact has been catastrophic across several countries, including the Philippines, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam being the most severely affected. The storm has claimed over 500 lives, with many still unaccounted for. In Thailand and Myanmar, heavy rains and flooding have forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.","Natthapak Khumkad euthanized more than 100 critically endangered Siamese crocodiles to prevent them from escaping into the nearby community.
