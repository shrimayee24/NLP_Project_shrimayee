JAIPUR: The Rs 450-crore ethanol project being developed by a private company in Rajasthan's Hanumangarh district is likely to wind up operations in the state once procedural formalities for relocating the project to Madhya Pradesh are completed.Work on the project was halted weeks after violent protests by farmers over fear of the plant damaging soil fertility and increasing pollution. Cleared under the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress govt in 2023, the project hit trouble in Dec 2025 amid allegations that effluents and industrial waste would likely contaminate farmland and groundwater.A company representative said, ""Given the circumstances, continuing work here is not feasible. We will comply with all procedures required for relocation.""The plant is being developed by Chandigarh-based Dune Ethanol Private Limited at Hanumangarh's Rathi Khera village. Spread over 40 acres (16.19 hectares), it was scheduled to produce 1,320 KLPD of grain-based ethanol and include a 40 MW co-generation power plant. The company planned to use rice, maize and straw sourced locally.tnn",The Rs 450-crore ethanol project in Rajasthan's Hanumangarh district is likely to wind up operations in the state.

KANPUR: Nine bank managers, three crop insurance staffers, and 32 farmers - 14 of them landless - have been booked after Rs 68 lakh was fraudulently transferred to 35 ""landless"" farmers as compensation for crop losses in Uttar Pradesh's Farrukhabad district in violation of Prime Minister's Crop Insurance Scheme (PMCIS) rules.Deputy director (agriculture) filed two FIRs. The case pertains to the 2024 rabi season, during which HDFC Ergo had insured crops of 8,849 farmers. When the crops were damaged, the insurance company paid claims worth Rs 2.28 crore to 232 farmers.This included payments of Rs 4 lakh each to several landless farmers. District magistrate Ashutosh Kumar Dwivedi ordered a probe into the landholdings of farmers who received insurance compensation above Rs 1 lakh. The subsequent probe conducted by the naib tehsildar, kanungo, and ADO (agriculture) revealed the 35 farmers did not own any land at the locations mentioned in the insurance claim records.In Balipatti Rani gram panchayat in Amritpur tehsil, out of 15 farmers who received crop insurance claims, 14 had no land. These 14 farmers were paid Rs 24.89 lakh.

SRINAGAR: Kashmir’s apple orchards — the backbone of the Valley’s rural economy — are under renewed scrutiny as lawmakers and medical experts raise concerns over a possible link between decades of pesticide use and rising cases of malignant brain tumours among orchard workers.The concerns were raised by the House Committee on Environment of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly, chaired by CPM legislator MY Tarigami, which met officials, scientists and health experts to examine the health hazards faced by those working in apple orchards.“For years, farmers have sprayed orchards unaware of the toxicity of constant pesticide exposure, leading to a rise in malignant brain tumors among those who power the valley’s billion-rupee apple economy and contribute more than 70% of India’s total apples,” the committee said.The discussion revisited findings from a study conducted by the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), which examined more than 400 cancer patients between 2005 and 2008.The study reported high incidences of primary brain cancer in districts forming Kashmir’s core fruit belt, including Baramulla, Anantnag , Budgam, Shopian and Kupwara. It identified a “quite strong and possible” link between pesticide exposure and malignant brain tumours among orchard farmers.The findings were largely ignored when first published but have resurfaced amid growing medical evidence of pesticide-linked health disorders in the Valley.Tarigami told TOI, “We don’t want to create panic among farmers who spray their orchards every season. But neither can we sit idle when data indicates a serious health hazard. If pesticide spray is harming lives, it must be addressed.”Scientists told the committee that pesticide use in apple orchards often exceeds recommended limits.Shahid Rasool, principal scientist at CSIR–Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, said many orchardists spray chemicals every 10 to 12 days instead of the advised 18 to 21, believing it boosts yield.“Few can afford protective gear; chronic cough, rashes and irritation are common. Without gloves, goggles and masks, the risk multiplies,” he warned.Rasool said orchardists now use as many as 15 rounds of fungicide and insecticide each season, far beyond recommended schedules, and called for safer practices and protective equipment.Further concerns were raised by Dr Sobia Nisar, a physician-researcher at Government Medical College, Srinagar, who has studied the biochemical effects of pesticide exposure among residents of apple-growing districts such as Shopian and Pulwama.“The initial idea was to check pesticides residue levels in the fruit,” she said. “But what we found was far more disturbing. Traces of these compounds in human blood samples.”Her findings document pesticide residues in the bloodstream of orchard workers and nearby residents, along with higher rates of obesity, lipid disorders, metabolic syndrome and early kidney impairment.“When such patterns emerge consistently across populations exposed to pesticides, it demands urgent scientific scrutiny,” Dr Nisar said.A study published in the Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine reported that 90% of brain tumour patients from Kashmir’s orchard belts had been exposed to pesticides, with all cases involving high-grade, aggressive tumours.The research focused on orchard workers in districts such as Anantnag, Budgam and Baramulla — areas that account for over 90% of the Valley’s apple-growing land — with smaller districts like Shopian and Kulgam also showing significant concentrations of cases.The House Committee on Environment said it would recommend measures to the health and horticulture departments focusing on monitoring, research funding and worker safety, as concerns grow over the long-term health impact of pesticide use in Kashmir’s apple orchards.A detailed study titled “Pesticides and brain cancer linked in orchard farmers of Kashmir”, conducted by researchers at the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), examined the relationship between pesticide exposure and primary malignant brain tumours among orchard workers in the Valley.The study analysed medical records of 432 patients diagnosed with primary malignant brain tumours and 457 control patients with non-tumour neurological conditions, all treated at SKIMS over a four-year period between 2005 and 2008.These patients had been exposed to multiple neurotoxic and carcinogenic chemicals, including chlorpyriphos, dimethoate, mancozeb and captan.Only 9.96% of patients had no recorded exposure to pesticides. Among the control group, 119 out of 457 patients had a history of pesticide exposure, while 338 had no such link.Of the pesticide-exposed cancer patients, 71.7% were male and 28.3% were female, including members of three families. Nearly a third — 31.9% — were younger than 40 years, having begun exposure at an early age.The study found that all orchard-related patients had high-grade, aggressive brain tumours, unlike those in the non-pesticide-exposed group. Mortality among pesticide-exposed tumour patients was recorded at 12%.Researchers measured serum cholinesterase levels — a marker used to assess exposure to organophosphate pesticides — and found higher-than-normal levels in 31.9% of exposed patients, while decreased levels were seen in 45.3%.Statistical analysis showed a significant case-control odds ratio of 0.28, with additional hospital and family control serum cholinesterase odds ratios of 1.1 and 1.5 respectively, pointing to what the study described as a strong suspicion of a link between pesticide exposure and brain cancer.The study noted that millions of tonnes of pesticides, insecticides and fungicides are sprayed annually across Kashmir’s orchards. Apple cultivation alone covers more than half of the Valley’s fruit-growing land, with around 40% of the population directly or indirectly exposed through farming, residence near orchards or recreational use of orchard spaces.Researchers highlighted that prolonged use of synthetic pesticides over the past three decades has coincided with a marked rise in admissions of high-grade malignant brain tumours from orchard districts to SKIMS.The study concluded that occupational and environmental exposure to pesticides in Kashmir’s fruit-growing regions poses a serious health risk, warranting closer monitoring and further investigation.","Kashmir’s apple orchards are under renewed scrutiny as lawmakers and medical experts raise concerns over a possible link between decades of pesticide use and rising cases of malignant brain tumours among orchard workers.

Press release by the defence ministry

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday cleared a major tranche of defence procurements worth about Rs 79,000 crore, approving missiles, rockets, radar systems, drones and support platforms aimed at significantly strengthening the combat capabilities of the armed forces. The approvals were granted by the defence acquisition council chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh.As per a statement by the defence ministry, the DAC accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for a wide range of proposals across the Army, Navy and Air Force. The approvals cover the procurement of Loiter Munition Systems for artillery regiments, Low Level Light Weight Radars, Long Range Guided Rocket Ammunition for the Pinaka Multiple Launch Rocket System (MRLS), and the Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System Mk-II.Following the meeting, Rajnath Singh said the decisions reflected the government’s focus on defence preparedness. In a post on X, he wrote, “The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) meeting held today accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for various proposals of the three Services amounting to a total of about Rs 79,000 crore.”He added, “The MoD under the leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi is working tirelessly to strengthen India’s defence preparedness.The decisions taken today will help in enhancing operational capabilities of the Armed Forces.”The ministry said loiter munition will be used for precision strikes against tactical targets, reflecting the growing emphasis on stand-off and high-accuracy weaponry. The low level lightweight radars are designed to detect and track small-sized, low-flying unmanned aerial systems, a capability that has become increasingly critical in modern battlefields.For the Indian Navy, the DAC approved procurement of Bollard Pull (BP) tugs, High Frequency Software Defined Radios (HF SDR) Manpack, and the leasing of High Altitude Long Range (HALE) Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). The ministry said induction of BP tugs will assist naval ships and submarines in berthing, unberthing and manoeuvring in confined harbour waters.The Indian Air Force will receive approvals for the procurement of Automatic Take-off Landing Recording Systems, Astra Mk-II missiles, Full Mission Simulators and SPICE-1000 long-range guidance kits.“Induction of the automatic take-off landing recording system will fill the gaps in the aerospace safety environment by providing high definition all-weather automatic recording of landing and take-off,” the ministry said.It added that Astra Mk-II missiles, with enhanced range, will improve the ability of fighter aircraft to neutralise adversary platforms from large stand-off distances.","The Centre on Monday cleared a major tranche of defence procurements worth about Rs 79,000 crore.

Importance of Pinaka

NEW DELHI: Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) on Monday successfully conducted the maiden flight test of the Pinaka Long Range Guided Rocket (LRGR 120). It was conducted at the Integrated Test Range in Odisha's Chandipur.""The rocket was tested for its maximum range of 120 km, demonstrating all in-flight manoeuvres as planned. The LRGR impacted the target with textbook precision,"" reported news agency PTI.Earlier, the day the Centre also cleared a fresh set of defence procurements worth around Rs 79,000 crore, giving the armed forces a significant boost in combat capability. The approvals were taken at a meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh According to the defence ministry, the council granted Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for a range of equipment to be inducted by the Army, Navy and Air Force.The cleared proposals include loitering munitions for artillery units, low-level lightweight radars, long-range guided rocket ammunition for the Pinaka multiple launch rocket system, and the Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System Mark-II, among other systems.The Pinaka Long Range Guided Rocket (LRGR 120) is an extended-range, precision-guided rocket developed for the Indian Army ’s Pinaka Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). The “120” denotes its maximum strike range of around 120 kilometres.Unlike earlier unguided Pinaka rockets, the LRGR is equipped with a guidance system that significantly improves accuracy, enabling it to engage targets such as enemy artillery positions, command nodes and logistics installations at long distances. The rocket is fired from the existing Pinaka launcher, allowing the Army to enhance capability without inducting a new launch platform.The LRGR 120 is part of India’s effort to increase indigenous, long-range precision firepower. Guidance is achieved through a combination of inertial navigation, with mid-course updates and terminal correction, reducing circular error probable (CEP) compared to earlier variants.The system provides the Army with a stand-off strike option, allowing targets to be hit from well behind forward areas, improving survivability of launch units. The rocket is intended for deployment across artillery regiments operating the Pinaka system, strengthening deep-strike and counter-force capabilities.","The rocket was tested for its maximum range of 120 km, demonstrating all in- flight manoeuvres as planned.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

Rail services hit

NEW DELHI: Dense fog blanketed Delhi and large parts of North India on Monday, triggering widespread disruption across air and rail networks, with hundreds of flights cancelled or delayed and trains running hours behind schedule, leaving passengers stranded and frustrated.At the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, at least 128 flights — 64 departures and 64 arrivals — were cancelled, while eight flights were diverted due to low visibility conditions. Nearly 200 flights were delayed, with an average departure delay of around 24 minutes, according to flight-tracking website Flightradar24.Visibility at the airport dropped to as low as 50 metres, forcing operations to continue under CAT III conditions, an advanced landing system used during dense fog. Delhi's AQI also crossed 400 on Monday, hitting 'severe' category of air pollution.Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) said runway visibility was gradually improving but warned that departures and arrivals could remain affected.IndiGo cancelled 80 flights across its network due to bad weather, with around half of those cancellations at Delhi airport. Other affected airports included Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kochi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Dehradun, Indore, Patna and Bhopal.While the airline did not explicitly disclose the number of cancellations in its advisory, it acknowledged that fog-related disruptions were likely to extend into the afternoon hours.“Fog continues to persist across Delhi and several airports in northern India. Visibility remains reduced and, as a result, flight movements are presently slower than normal,” IndiGo said in a post on X.The airline has been cancelling flights in significant numbers since the start of the fog season on December 10, following earlier large-scale disruptions caused by stricter pilot duty norms. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has designated December 10 to February 10 as the official fog window this winter, during which airlines must deploy CAT-IIIB-compliant aircraft and pilots trained for low-visibility operations.Airlines including IndiGo and Air India urged passengers to regularly check flight status and assured them that safety remained the top priority as operations continued to adjust to fluctuating weather conditions.Rail services were also hit hard.

Red tape may be often associated with officialdom but for J&K’s paperless bureaucracy, green is the go-to colour this year-end as it has achieved the equivalent of “planting over 4.5 lakh trees or taking over 2,200 cars off the roads permanently”, according to a study.Released on Monday, the study by Shahid Iqbal Choudhary, secretary in J&K’s science and technology department, shows the govt’s move from paper files to digital systems has helped avoid more than 62,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.Digitisation has removed the need for over 20 million paper pages each year, saving thousands of trees and cutting pollution, says Choudhary’s study, published by. The research provides a first-of-its-kind, scientifically grounded environmental impact evaluation of digital public administration in a fragile Himalayan ecosystem.The govt formally shifted from physical movement of files to e-office in 2021. Choudhary calls it a turning point in the region’s administrative history. “The environmental impact was massive -- 10,294 tonnes of CO2 eliminated every year. The scale of what changed is hard to grasp until you see the numbers. Since 2021, this transition has avoided printing 405.7 million pages. Think about that. Hundreds of millions of paper sheets that never got manufactured, never got transported, never ended up in landfills.Tens of thousands of trees still standing,” Choudhary said.The science and technology secretary explained the changes further. “As of mid-2025, over 26,000 users in the civil secretariat and more than 31,000 at HoD levels actively use the e-Office platform, processing millions of files and receipts annually. The transition has replaced physical file transport and in-person correspondence with a digital ecosystem supported by secure networks, VPNs, and over 1.8 lakh official email addresses,” says the study.The research was based on data from 2018 to 2025, administrative records, transport logs and energy consumption patterns, all analysed using international methodologies. “Now, 114,826 officials process everything digitally. They’ve handled 3.75 million files and 34 million receipts without paper. It’s faster, more transparent, and dramatically better for the environment,” Choudhary said.According to the secretary, the changes mark a paradigm shift in “our thinking on climate action”. “We focus so much on big industrial changes. But govt operations themselves have a significant carbon footprint. When you digitise an entire administrative system, especially in ecologically sensitive mountain regions, the environmental gains are substantial and immediate.”Choudhary held up the efforts as a model for administrative systems across India, especially in hilly states. “The combination of difficult terrain, fragile ecosystems, and administrative needs makes digital governance not just efficient but environmentally essential,” he said.","J&K's move from paper files to digital systems has helped avoid more than 62,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

NEW DELHI: From French and Israeli-origin missiles to 'Make in India' kamikaze drones and counter-drone systems as well as range extension of existing missiles and artillery rockets, the defence ministry on Monday gave the preliminary nod to a slew of military modernisation projects worth Rs 79,000 crore.The biggest project to get acceptance of necessity, first step in long-winded procurement process, from the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council was Rs 30,000 crore purchase of a large number of missiles for Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile system, jointly developed with Israel, for IAF and Navy, sources told TOI.These missiles, with an interception range of over 70km, were used as part of the multi-layered air defence network that thwarted the multiple waves of Turkish drones and Chinese missiles fired by Pakistan during the cross-border hostilities in May.The DAC also approved the Rs 1,600-crore lease of two more MQ-9B 'Predator' high-altitude long endurance drones, which will add to the existing two being operated by the Navy for long-range surveillance missions, for three years. They will fill the gap till India gets the 31 armed MQ-9B remotely-piloted aircraft systems in 2029-30 under the $3.8 billion deal with the US in Oct last year. Another major project to get the nod was the long-pending over Rs 9,000-crore acquisition of six mid-air refuelling aircraft for IAF to extend operational reach of its fighter jets.""Under it, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) will modify six second-hand Boeing 767 commercial planes into tankers. A fresh approval was required because the competition resulted in a single vendor situation,"" a source said.Two crucial home-grown design and development projects to get the AoN were for range extensions of the Astra Mark-2 air-to-air missiles and Pinaka guided rocket ammunition. The Pinaka multiple launch artillery systems currently fire multi-calibre rockets with a variety of warheads up to ranges of 75 km. ""Pinaka's deep strike lethal capability is now being increased to 120 km. It was tested successfully on Sunday. In the future, it will be extended to 300 km,"" a source said.DRDO is already working on enhancing the range of Astra missiles from the existing 100-km to 200-km. ""IAF will initially order 600-700 Astra-2 missiles. There will also be a 350-km Astra-3 in the future. Indigenous long range air-to-air missiles are crucial,"" another source said. ""DAC also approved some additional French Meteor air-to-air missiles (120 to 150-km range) for Rafale fighters as well as Israeli guidance kits for Spice-1000 precision-guided bombs (125-km),"" he added.AoN was also accorded for 850 kamikaze drones or loitering munitions for precision strikes for the Army's new 'Shaktibaan' and 'Divyastra' artillery batteries for around Rs 2,000 crore. ""They will be made in India either by domestic companies or with foreign collaboration,"" the source said. The indigenous integrated drone detection & interdiction system Mark-2 (IDD&IS) systems, with 30-kilowatt lasers to disable, degrade or destroy small remotely-piloted aircraft and swarm drones at ranges up to 3.5-km, also got the green light.The overhauls of Mi-17 helicopters in Russia and T-90S main-battle tanks in India were also approved.

Hyderabad: A year after Telangana HC declared that former BRS MLA Chennamaneni Ramesh was not an Indian citizen and imposed a Rs 30 lakh fine on him for concealing his German citizenship while contesting assembly elections, he continues to receive a pension of Rs 60,000 as a former MLA.Congress MLA Adi Srinivas has urged the assembly secretary not to pay the pension to Ramesh, arguing that he is not entitled to any govt benefits, and has demanded the recovery of benefits, emoluments, and salary already given to the German citizen.""As there has been no action on my previous request, I am again urging the assembly secretary and the Speaker to stop his pension immediately. I will approach the HC on this issue again, if required,"" said Srinivas, who had challenged Ramesh's citizenship.Sources said the assembly secretary had earlier informed Srinivas that the high court order did not mention recovering salary and other emoluments from Ramesh, and that there was no provision under existing rules to make such recoveries.Under the Telangana assembly rules, former MLAs are entitled to a pension, medical reimbursement, and other benefits. As Ramesh had served four terms as MLA from Vemulawada, he drew over Rs 50,000 as monthly pension from Dec 2023.Following court order, Ramesh paid Rs 30 lakh in damages.Former Telangana advocate general K Rama Krishna Reddy said, ""The legislative secretary cannot decide on pension issues as he does not have adjudicating powers. The assembly Speaker can decide whether Ramesh is entitled to the pension, as this is a decision to be taken post-disposal of the court case.

Supreme Court Stays Its Order On Aravalli Definition, Environment Minister Welcomes Move

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court’s decision on Monday — its last working day of 2025 — to stay its own 40-day-old order on the Aravali controversy was only the latest in a series of flip flops witnessed in the year, during which orders were set aside within months after they were passed — a fact noticed by SC itself, which emphasized in one of its judgments that the trend would cost the court’s credibility.The cases and issues that witnessed judicial reversals include menace of stray dogs, a governor’s power regarding assent to bills forwarded by a state legislature, ban on firecrackers, retrospective environmental clearance, insolvency of Bhushan Steel Ltd, and finally, the Aravali controversy.This phenomenon of one bench’s order being overturned by another within a short interval, even when there was no change in circumstances, perhaps indicates that the original orders were passed in a hurry without analysing all relevant issues related to the case. It also reflects the judge-centric approach, rather than principle-centric approach, in deciding a case.In the Bhushan Steel case, SC on May 2 quashed acquisition of bankrupt company Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd (BPSL) by JSW Steel under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and ordered liquidation of the debt-laden company. Three months later, the court on July 31 recalled the order. It passed a judgment on Sept 26 upholding the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s decision approving the Rs 19,700-crore resolution plan of JSW Steel to takeover BPSLIn the stray dogs case, SC took suo motu cognisance and passed a slew of directions on Aug 11 for catching of strays and putting them in shelter homes in view of rising number of dog bites and death caused by rabies.The case was transferred to another bench within a week and the new bench had on Aug 22 modified the order and directed that strays after being sterilised, vaccinated must be released to their territories under the Animal Birth Control Rules and they should not be confined to shelter homes.A similar thing happened in the Vanashakti petition, when SC on May 16 declared ex post facto (retrospective) environmental clearances illegal under the Environment (Protection) Act but the three judge bench of the court by a 2:1 majority recalled that order in Nov.Expressing concern over benches overturning orders passed by earlier benches, SC mentioned this in a judgment delivered on Nov 26, and said that it was “painfully” observing this growing trend which would “undermine this court’s authority”.In a rare instance of self-introspection on SC’s functioning, a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and AG Masih had said public confidence in the judiciary would be undermined if cases are reopened and special benches are set up to re-hear a case at the behest of some party aggrieved by the verdict.“In the recent past, we have rather painfully observed a growing trend in this Court (of which we too are an indispensable part) of verdicts pronounced by judges, whether still in office or not and irrespective of the time lapse since pronounced, being overturned by succeeding benches or specially constituted benches at the behest of some party aggrieved by the verdicts prior in point of time,” it had said.“To us, the object of Article 141 of the Constitution seems to be this: the pronouncement of a verdict by a bench on a particular issue of law (arising out of the facts involved) should settle the controversy, being final, and has to be followed by all courts as law declared by the Supreme Court,” the bench had said.It had held that judicial discipline, propriety and comity, which are also inseparable parts of a just and proper decision-making process, demand that a subsequent bench of different combination defers to the view expressed by the earlier bench, unless there is something so grossly erroneous on the face of the record or palpably wrong that it necessitates a re-look in exercise of inherent jurisdiction either by a review petition or through a curative petition.","Supreme Court's decision to stay its own 40-day-old order on the Aravali controversy was only the latest in a series of flip flops witnessed in the year.

NEW DELHI: As part of its ongoing river rejuvenation efforts, the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has approved multiple projects including a master plan to restore the cultural identity of the Gomti river’s origin site at Pilibhit, protect breeding habitats of sandbar-nesting birds and deploy nature based solutions for in-situ treatment of certain drains, falling in Yamuna, in Delhi.The plan to restore natural sanctity of the Gomti river’s origin site includes modern infrastructure development, catchment area treatment, rejuvenation of water sources, and nature-based treatment of sewage from Madhotanda town in Uttar Pradesh.“It also includes development of ghats and aarti platforms, rejuvenation of lakes, and conservation of turtle habitats. Facilities such as a crematorium, ‘panchvatika’ and yoga mandap will further enhance the site’s spiritual and cultural significance,” said the Union Jal Shakti ministry in a statement.The plan for Gomti and other initiatives were approved by the NMCG - a central agency to implement Ganga rejuvenation programmes - in its executive committee meeting, chaired by the agency's director general Rajeev Kumar Mittal, held last week.The project to protect breeding habitats of sandbar-nesting birds, including the Indian skimmer, will focus on long-term monitoring, community participation, and evidence-based conservation.“The project is a first of its kind initiative focusing on avifauna and would complement NMCG’s work on dolphins, fishes, turtles, muggers etc and would complete the focus on river related faunal biodiversity,” said the ministry.Under the project, nest monitoring will continue in the Chambal and lower Ganga and will be initiated in Bijnor, Narora, and Prayagraj by deploying trained local communities to help protect sensitive sandbars, reduce human disturbance, and support awareness and capacity-building initiatives.In Delhi, the nature based solutions will be used for in-situ treatment of different drains including Shastri Park, Gaushala, Kailash Nagar and Ramesh Nagar. Idea of the initiative is to treat raw sewage on-site before it enters the Yamuna using rock filters, stone masonry, and aquatic plants for natural treatment.","National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) approves master plan to restore cultural identity of Gomti river’s origin site at Pilibhit.

NEW DELHI: Police has arrested an off-duty Air India Express pilot in connection with an alleged assault on a passenger at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport’s Terminal 1, days after the incident sparked outrage on social media and prompted a government-ordered probe.The accused, identified as Captain Virender Sejwal, was arrested following an investigation into the incident that occurred on Dec 19, when he allegedly assaulted Ankit Dewan, a passenger travelling with his family.Confirming the arrest, Additional Commissioner of Police (IGI) Vichitra Veer said, “In the process of investigation, after the registration of the case, the relevant CCTV footages had been collected and statements had been recorded. The accused was also called for questioning and his arrest was effected a few days back.”According to police, the altercation took place near the staff entry gate at Terminal 1. Dewan, who was travelling with young children and luggage, was reportedly directed by CISF personnel to use the staff entry. Captain Sejwal, who was “deadheading” to Bengaluru to operate another flight, was also using the same gate.An argument allegedly broke out when Dewan questioned crew members moving ahead in the queue.The verbal exchange escalated, and the pilot allegedly assaulted the passenger, following which CISF personnel intervened and separated the two.Dewan was asked at the airport if he wished to file a police complaint but declined in writing at that time and proceeded to his destination with his family. The pilot also continued his journey.However, after reaching his destination, Dewan shared details of the incident on social media, alleging he was physically assaulted, left bleeding, and had to seek medical attention. He also said his young daughter was traumatised by the incident.The Ministry of Civil Aviation took serious cognisance of the matter and ordered a probe, directing Air India Express to ground the pilot with immediate effect. Reports were sought from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).Air India Express, in a statement, condemned the incident and said the pilot had been removed from flying duties pending inquiry. “Appropriate disciplinary action will be initiated based on the findings of the investigation,” the airline said.Delhi Police is continuing its investigation, examining CCTV footage, witness statements, and medical records. Authorities are also looking into airport crowd management and why the situation was not defused earlier.","An off-duty Air India Express pilot has been arrested in connection with an alleged assault on a passenger.

‘Worst Is Behind Us’: IndiGo CEO Says Airline Back on Track After Operational Crisis

IndiGo will pilot allowances and add new ones from January 1 to boost staff morale, according to PTI sources. This comes weeks after the airline faced massive disruptions with 4,500 flight cancellations due to rostering issues. The move follows meetings between executives and pilots at various bases, as the carrier also faces pressure from foreign airlines trying to recruit its pilots.The airline is increasing several key benefits for its pilots which includes Captains getting upto Rs 3,000 rupees instead of Rs 2,000 for layovers, while first officers will receive Rs 1,500, up from Rs 1,000, revealed the sources cited by PTI. For deadheading trips, where crew travel as passengers for their next duty, captains will get Rs 4,000, up from Rs 3,000 and first officers will receive Rs 2,000 rupees, a Rs 500 increase.The changes affect IndiGo's roughly 5,000 pilots and come at a critical time. The airline, which controls 65 per cent of India's domestic market, is under close watch from regulators. A special committee has already submitted its report about the recent flight cancellations to the civil aviation ministry.Additonally, Moody's Ratings has cautioned that the airline might face ""significant financial damage"" from lost revenue, customer refunds, and potential government penalties following the cancellations, as quoted by Reuters.The airline is also dealing with a broader industry challenge. Foreign airlines are luring Indian pilots to join them with better remuneration and lifestyle packages. This has become a problem to the extent that the government is now promoting a code of conduct internationally for recruiting pilots, according to Reuters.The recent mass cancellations at the beginning of this month caused chaos at the airports, leaving many stranded passengers across the country in India.The mass cancellations earlier this month caused widespread chaos at airports and left thousands of passengers stranded across India. Despite the airline's dominance in the domestic market, this incident has triggered both regulatory scrutiny and a competition investigation.","IndiGo will increase pilot allowances and add new ones from January 1 to boost staff morale.

ITR stuck: Why are you receiving tax alerts?

Tax Trouble

Uncertainty on Tax Refunds

Income Tax alert! The Income Tax Department is sending emails and SMSes to taxpayers, just ahead of the year-end, alerting them of mismatches in their deduction and exemption claims while processing Income Tax Returns . The blunt emails are being received by two categories of income tax payers - the salaried individuals whose claims are not reflecting in Form 16, and the wealthy individuals who appear to have donated money running into lakhs for charities. Form 16 is a consolidated statement of salary paid and tax deducted at source, which employers submit to the Income Tax Department on behalf of their staff.The income tax notices suggest that the assessment of income tax returns and the release of refunds have been paused for these categories of taxpayers. The unexpected arrival of these “do not reply” emails from the Income Tax Department in the inboxes of certain taxpayers has caused unease, according to an ET report.A December 23 release from the Income Tax Department described the exercise as one meant to assist assessees and encourage voluntary compliance. However, the sharp wording of the emails has left many taxpayers confused about their next steps. Those who have received alerts from the tax department are uncertain whether they should ignore the messages or retract the claimed benefits and file revised returns before the December 31 cut off.Also Read | ITR filing: Received ‘nudge’ from Income Tax Department for tax return & refund claims? Here’s what you need to do The reasons cited by the Income Tax Department include incorrect permanent account numbers (PANs) of recipient charities, organisations not being registered under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act, or refund claims under the old tax regime that “appear to be high compared to the gross salary.”Tax experts, however, point out that many such emails have been issued even where all details furnished by taxpayers are correct. According to the ET report, several individuals have expressed confusion after being questioned over donations made to a well known foundation in southern India that works in the area of yoga and spiritual development. As per the existing rules, taxpayers are eligible to claim a deduction of 50% of the qualifying donation amount.At the same time, this deductible amount is capped and cannot exceed 50% of the total contribution made to a trust or non profit organisation registered under Section 80G.Taxpayers who made contributions of over Rs 2 lakh appear to be the main recipients of these emails, which, notably, are not formal notices and do not reflect on the income tax portal.The messages cite several grounds for placing income tax return processing on hold. These include leave travel allowance claims that are significantly higher than the figures reported by employers in Form 16, capital gains declared in the return that do not seem to align with entries in the Annual Information Statement and the Taxpayer Information Summary, an unusually high house rent allowance claim, or donations reported above the permissible deduction threshold.The AIS and TIS are auto generated records prepared by the department using transaction level information and details reported by various third parties.Also Read | Income tax refund: Your refund may be delayed if revised return not filed by December 31, 2025 deadline - here’s why There is also increasing uncertainty over the timeline for receiving tax refunds, even among those who remain confident that claims in their income tax returns are accurate.“A policy that may have been conceived with good intentions has been undermined by ineffective communication. The use of charged terms such as ‘false claims’ for donations flagged by risk systems has rattled taxpayers who have followed the rules,” said Mohit Bang, partner at Hyderabad based chartered accountancy firm Trivedi & Bang. “We are increasingly seeing cases where taxpayers with legitimate and properly supported claims are being swept up by these automated notices,” he told ET.Bang noted that it reflects a deeper mismatch when contributions made via traceable banking channels to institutions approved by the government are described as “potentially false.” He added, “If the objective is to make compliance simpler, the department needs to fine tune its data analytics to minimise false positives. Automated communications should guide and correct, not intimidate, so that law-abiding citizens are not subjected to unnecessary stress despite full disclosure. ”He also pointed to another concern, saying that refunds are being delayed for more than four months from the date returns are filed, while notices highlighting such issues are being issued barely a week before the filing deadline.According to Ashish Karundia, founder of chartered accountancy firm Ashish Karundia & Co, “The existing reporting framework already has strong safeguards in place, with recipient organisations required to submit Form 10BD and issue donor specific certificates in Form 10BE, which taxpayers rely on while filing their returns.“This information is easily accessible for system driven verification of legitimate claims. In the same way, although employers often impose internal deadlines for declaring investments or deductions, usually around November or December, there is no legal bar on claiming genuine deductions that were not communicated to employers within those timelines,” he told ET.In the case of salaried taxpayers, differences between figures in Form 16 and the income tax return often arise because investment details could not be submitted to employers in time.“Even though the objective may be constructive, the release of these communications toward the end of the year has unsettled many compliant taxpayers. A better approach would have been to engage earlier during the filing season, giving individuals sufficient opportunity to reconcile differences or revise returns in an orderly manner. Such messages should function as advisory nudges for compliance, not as suggestions of incorrect reporting, especially when claims are valid and properly supported,” Karundia said.","The Income Tax Department is sending emails and SMSes to taxpayers, just ahead of the year-end, alerting them of mismatches in their deduction and exemption claims. The emails are being received by two categories of income tax payers - the salaried individuals whose claims are not reflecting in Form 16, and the wealthy individuals who appear to have donated money running into lakhs for charities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126227234,imgsize-61540,width-400,resizemode-4/income-tax.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Jan 1 onwards, IndiGo will increase pilots' domestic layover, deadhead, transit and night allowance, apart from introducing a new tail swap allowance.Tail swap means pilots hop over to another plane to operate another flight, which entails a series of extra checks and preparation, as opposed to operating another flight on the same aircraft they had flown in on. Captains and co-pilots will get Rs 1,500 and Rs 750 per tail swap, respectively.While many IndiGo pilots called this a ""small correction"", they hoped it signals the start of undoing a series of fatigue-inducing measures that entail a punishing flight schedule under the old FDTL.

The foundation's initiatives, like Read for 15 and Volunteer for 15, foster positive development in young people.

How Patrick Mahomes’ foundation became a source of pride beyond football

As the Kansas City Chiefs grind through a demanding NFL season, Brittany Mahomes has increasingly drawn attention for something far removed from wins, losses, or playoff math. While criticism and pressure often follow Patrick Mahomes on the field, his work away from football has continued to grow quietly and steadily.Recent recognition tied to his charitable efforts highlighted a side of the Chiefs quarterback that doesn’t show up on stat sheets. For Brittany, that impact appears to matter just as much, if not more, than the weekly noise surrounding the team..Patrick Mahomes’ 15 and the Mahomies Foundation has reached a stage where its influence is measurable, visible, and increasingly community-driven. Its partner organization, Youth Volunteer Corps has recently published annual estimates of 92, 714 hours of volunteer work done by young people equating to the community value of an estimated 3.2 million dollars..Brittany Mahomes made the most of such an achievement with a very modest yet informative gesture, as she interacted with the post, expanding its popularity..The numbers only tell part of the story. For many volunteers, Patrick Mahomes’ example has become personal motivation. Luke from Hampton explained why the quarterback’s leadership resonates with him.“Patrick Mahomes has inspired me to volunteer because of the way he uses his platform to give back to the community (being a core sponsor of Youth Volunteer Corps).“Beyond his talent on the field, he demonstrates leadership, generosity, and a commitment to helping others, showing success comes with the responsibility to make a positive impact,” Luke said.The philosophy has formed the growing programs of the foundation. Programs such as Read for 15 will help young children develop the reading habit on a daily basis, and Volunteer for 15 will expose older students to organized community service. Another branch, 15 for 15, provides funding across academics, science, athletics, and the arts.Earlier this fall, Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes hosted the sixth annual 15 and the Mahomies Foundation Gala, drawing more than 900 supporters and raising $1.5 million for 27 local charities. As football narratives fluctuate, the foundation’s steady growth offers a reminder that Mahomes’ influence and Brittany’s pride in it extends well beyond Arrowhead Stadium.Also Read: Randi Mahomes’ powerful reaction to Brittany’s holiday surprise quickly caught fans’ attention","Patrick Mahomes' 15 and the Mahomies Foundation is making a significant community impact.

Matt Hardy’s wrestling career and long-term earnings

Reby Sky’s media work, business ventures, and lifestyle

Matt Hardy continues to stand as one of professional wrestling’s most recognizable figures due to his career spanning over multiple eras and multiple promotions. Whether it was his rise as part of The Hardy Boyz or the re-inventions that kept him relevant long into his forties, Hardy has long known how to capitalize on his name. As of the year 2025, wrestling contracts, merchandise, licensing, and digital appearances remain the basis of the wealth he created.That foundation is complemented by the streams of income brought in by Reby Sky, legally Rebecca Hardy. With a modeling/television/online media career that came before and through wrestling (and continues to exist), she has become a brand unto herself outside the ring. Considering how standalone earnings will translate into 2025, most industry watchers put them in a single net worth window of $3 million to $6 million apiece, depending on how private assets and ongoing business income are counted.The key to Matt Hardy’s wealth is immortality. It's hard for many wrestlers to stay active and stay relevant as we see three decades pass, but Hardy has done just that. It led to big WWE contracts, lengthy stints in Impact Wrestling, and, eventually, every so often, a return to major promotions for consistent paydays at multiple points in his career.In addition to base salaries, Hardy experienced the upsides of merchandise royalties, pay-per-view bonuses, and foreign tours.Well into his later career, his ability to reinvent himself, often through character-driven storylines, maintained the demand for appearances and allowed him to remain a commercially viable brand long after many peers quietly exited the scene.Most of Reby Sky's contribution to the couple's net worth comes outside of the ring. From her modeling career, television exposure, and powerful presence on social media platforms, she brings in advertising and partnership revenue. Working with brands and on her own media projects has given her ongoing revenue. Overall, her net worth is expected to increase in the coming year.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Hardy and Sky share a lifestyle somewhere in the ballpark upper end of upper-middle-class; no one is reading about them in that section of the N.Y. Times, but they are investing in property, content, and long-term brand value. Though numbers are not publicly disclosed, 2025 saw their fortunes aligned, reflecting decades of diversified revenue streams, pages from similar playbooks on how to monetize notoriety, and years of incremental shifts from full-time wrestling to extended entertainment and continuing digital business interests.Also Read: Who is Jodi Lynn Calaway?

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

NEW DELHI: Call it the IndiGo schedule collapse and its fallout. A clamour has broken out between the budget airline and the Air India group over the availability of adequate captains to avoid a repeat of what happened under the new safety-enhancing Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) rules.IndiGo has had to commit to the DGCA that it will hire more pilots—it plans to induct 100 in January alone—while Air India has already issued advertisements to bring more aviators on board. However, both airlines are also facing a significant number of captain resignations, with some moving between the two carriers and many leaving to join foreign airlines. As a result, much of the hiring is aimed at simply maintaining current numbers, making the scramble more intense than anything seen before in Indian skies.For once, balance-sheet-centric human resource departments are on the back foot and can no longer oppose strengthening ranks after the events earlier this month. A senior official of one of the two major Indian carriers said its captains are already receiving “calls offering joining bonuses of up to ₹50 lakh”.“Where do we get captains from? Under the new FDTL norms, the availability of experienced pilots will become acute.There will be a lot of poaching from each other,” said a senior airline official.A few years ago, a senior pilot recalled, IndiGo had offered joining bonuses to experienced aviators to cover bond payments, if any, required to be paid to the airline they were resigning from. “This ranged between ₹15 lakh and ₹25 lakh to take care of bonds, which at the time were between ₹5 lakh and ₹15 lakh,” the pilot said.“India will witness a scramble for captains between the Air India group and IndiGo. While Air India does not currently face a shortage for most of its fleet—except the Boeing 787 Dreamliner—it needs to hire for the future. IndiGo will have to improve pilot-management relations to retain and attract talent. Akasa does not need more pilots as it has a large surplus. Unless Air India and IndiGo offer better working conditions, they will not be able to stem the outflow to the Middle East and other markets such as Vietnam,” said Captain Shakti Lumba, former vice-president of Air India and IndiGo.IndiGo has marginally raised pilot pay from next month by enhancing some existing allowances and introducing new ones. Air India, meanwhile, is planning a major move expected in the first week of January, details of which remain a closely guarded secret within the airline.Pilots at both the Air India group and IndiGo have been unhappy primarily due to poor working conditions and pay structures that have not kept pace with inflation. While the FDTL aims to reduce fatigue, the ongoing tug of war means both airlines will have to become more humane employers to retain pilots.While IndiGo will see an increase in pilot requirements due to less strenuous working norms under the new rules, Air India is preparing for aircraft inductions expected from next year. At present, only pilots operating Air India’s Boeing 787 fleet fly more intensively, while those on the Boeing 777 and Airbus A320 fleets fly less. This is expected to change from next year, and Air India does not want to find itself in IndiGo’s position when that happens.",IndiGo has had to commit to the DGCA that it will hire more pilots.

The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon.

Meet Google executive 'responsible' for Sam Altman sending 'Code Red' to OpenAI employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-google-executive-responsible-for-sam-altman-sending-code-red-to-openai-employees/articleshow/126187250.cms,"Google's Josh Woodward has jolted OpenAI, forcing a 'code red' with his Gemini app's rapid success. Gemini's user growth and image generation capabilities have challenged ChatGPT's dominance, leading to a significant shift in the AI landscape. Woodward's ability to cut through bureaucracy and his team's innovative approach are credited for Google's AI resurgence, impacting Alphabet's stock and OpenAI's strategic plans.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The numbers tell a brutal story for ChatGPT

The secret weapon: Breaking Google's legendary bureaucracy





Josh Woodward isn't a household name in Silicon Valley, but the 42-year-old Google veteran has accomplished what seemed impossible just months ago—he's made the world's most powerful AI company sweat. The executive leading Google's Gemini app triggered such alarm at OpenAI that CEO Sam Altman declared an internal ""code red"" in early December, forcing the startup to abandon lucrative projects and scramble to defend its eroding market position.Woodward's impact has been devastating for OpenAI. Since taking charge of the Gemini app in April while simultaneously running Google Labs, he's orchestrated a comeback that's transformed Google from AI afterthought to existential threat. His team's viral Nano Banana image generator crashed Google's own infrastructure in August, generating so much traffic that the company's custom AI chips nearly ""melted,"" according to CNBC reports from a November all-hands meeting.Google's resurgence under Woodward's leadership has fundamentally rewritten the competitive landscape. Gemini's monthly active users grew from 350 million in March to 650 million by October, coming close to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly users. By September, Gemini had dethroned ChatGPT atop Apple's App Store after generating 5 billion images.The impact runs deeper than raw user counts. Data from Similarweb reveals that Gemini has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months, surging from 5.4% to 18.2%.This gain came directly at ChatGPT's expense—OpenAI's flagship product plummeted from commanding 87.2% market share to just 68%, a staggering 19-point drop.The blow came in late November when Google announced Gemini 3, a LLM model that outperformed OpenAI's flagship products on industry benchmarks and sent Alphabet's stock soaring. Within days, Altman issued his ""code red"" memo, delaying OpenAI's planned advertising business, e-commerce expansion, and AI agent development to pour resources into improving ChatGPT's core experience. The desperation was palpable—this was OpenAI's most decisive admission yet of the competitive pressure threatening its $500 billion valuation.Woodward's success stems from an unusual talent in Google's notoriously slow-moving culture. Colleagues told CNBC he's mastered the art of demolishing bureaucratic barriers through systems like ""block,"" where employees flag roadblocks for his team to immediately resolve. Former Google Labs co-lead Clay Bavor says Woodward's ability to ""move fast, break down barriers and execute"" has landed him ""right at the center of the most important work at Google. ""His track record speaks volumes. NotebookLM became an instant hit after its July 2023 launch. His quarterly newsletter grew so influential that Google executives routinely seek his reading recommendations. He responds directly to user complaints on X and Reddit, bringing feedback to engineers for rapid fixes—a level of user engagement that's helped Gemini gain trust and momentum.OpenAI fired back earlier this month with GPT-5.2, claiming benchmark superiority once again. But Woodward holds structural advantages that terrify OpenAI: Google's massive cash reserves, custom AI chips, and nine products with over 1 billion users each. While OpenAI burns through funding rounds to survive, Woodward's operation runs on profits from YouTube and search.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Fake stock trading app: Rs 22.7L cyber fraud busted in Delhi-NCR; 2 arrested from Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/fake-stock-trading-app-rs-22-7l-cyber-fraud-busted-in-delhi-ncr-2-arrested-from-haryana/articleshow/126243605.cms,"NEW DELHI: A cyber fraud racket involving a fake stock trading application was busted with the arrest of 2 men from Hisar, Haryana, for allegedly duping a Delhi-based Doctor of Rs 22.7 lakh.According to police, the case came to light after the Doctor filed an online complaint on November 13, alleging that she was cheated through a fraudulent stock market investment scheme. She was added to a group where several administrators claimed to be expert stock traders and discussed investment opportunities related to Demat shares.One of the group administrators, identifying herself as Yalini Guna, persuaded the complainant to invest through a fake trading application, which was shared via a link. Initially, she invested Rs 2.7 lakh in multiple transactions. When she attempted to withdraw her funds, she was pressured into investing more money under various pretexts.Over time, the complainant invested a total of Rs 22.7 lakh. Soon after, she was blocked from the application, following which she realised she was defrauded. A case was registered and a team was formed.“During the investigation, the team traced the money trail and found that a portion of the cheated amount was transferred into a bank account.The account holder was identified as Sameer (22), a resident of Hisar, Haryana. Call Detail Records (CDRs) further revealed the involvement of additional suspects,” DCP (Shahdara) Prashant Gautam said.On November 10, a police team conducted raids in Hisar and apprehended Sameer along with Dev Singh (22). “During interrogation, Sameer disclosed that he opened 5 to 6 bank accounts in different banks and handed them over to Dev Singh in exchange for Rs 4,000 per account, which were then used for routing the fraud money,” DCP Gautam added.Police seized 2 mobile phones and 3 SIM cards from the accused. Both were sent to judicial custody.Police said the accused targeted victims through social media platforms, posing as financial experts. Victims were lured with promises of guaranteed high returns on stock market investments. Initially, small profits were shown to gain trust. Once confidence was established, victims were coaxed into investing larger amounts. After extracting maximum money, the fraudsters blocked the victims and disappeared.","Police said the accused targeted victims through social media platforms, posing as financial experts.

Saudi Arabia is taking a firmer stance against banned and counterfeit pesticides, with a draft regulation proposing jail terms, hefty fines, and strict enforcement measures. The new rules aim to protect public health, the environment, and agriculture, while giving authorities clear powers to penalize repeat offenders.The proposed regulation introduces strict consequences for anyone involved in manufacturing or importing banned or counterfeit pesticides. Under the draft, violators may face up to five years in prison, fines reaching SR10 million, or one of these two penalties. The Public Prosecution will investigate all violations and bring the cases before the competent court to enforce the penalties outlined in the regulation. In situations where the offender repeats the violation, the prosecution is authorized to double the penalties to ensure stronger compliance and deterrence.Not all violations will lead to immediate jail time or fines. The draft clarifies that if a violation is minor and does not cause significant harm to humans, animals, plants, the environment, or public health, the violator will first receive a warning. Authorities may then provide a grace period for the issue to be corrected before applying penalties.The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) will play a central role in reviewing violations related to public health pesticides. Responsibilities of the SFDA under the draft include:Additionally, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture can require violators to remove the cause of the violation. Repeating the offense within three years of a previous violation is considered a repeat offense, which can lead to doubling of fines.The draft also outlines strict measures for dealing with the materials involved in violations. These include:Beyond fines, the draft also allows authorities to temporarily close the facility for up to six months or even permanently shut it down in severe cases. Those penalized have the right to appeal the decision in the Administrative Court in accordance with its regulations.","Saudi Arabia proposes up to five years jail and SR10 million fine for banned pesticides.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population. Official figures for 2024 place the total population at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly international social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.",Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom. It is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.

Congresswoman Ilhan Omar insists she is “not a millionaire” even as reports suggest her net worth, along with her husband Tim Mynett’s, could be as high as $30 million.The disclosure says their combined assets range from $6 million to $30 million, according to the Washington Free Beacon.“Since getting elected, there has been a coordinated right-wing disinformation campaign claiming all sorts of wild things, including the ridiculous claim I am worth millions of dollars, which is categorically false,” Omar told Business Insider earlier this year.Omar and Mynett’s rise in wealth comes amid controversy over their ventures. Mynett’s firm, Rose Lake Capital (Launched in 2022) is a venture capital management company that reportedly increased in value from nearly zero in 2023 to between $5 million and $25 million in 2024. The company removed key officer names from its website, including former Obama officials, as federal prosecutors charged dozens in a $9 billion Minnesota welfare fraud case connected to the Somali community in Omar’s district.Omar’s political career intersects with the case, as she introduced the MEALS Act in 2020, which critics say relaxed oversight of government-sponsored children’s meal programs during the Covid-19 pandemic.This allegedly allowed fraudsters to claim millions of meals without verification while receiving government subsidies. Omar defended her actions, stating, “Absolutely not, it did help feed kids.”Mynett also runs a California winery, eStCru, which faced fraud allegations and a lawsuit over a $900,000 investor dispute in 2023. Despite previously being declared a failed venture, the winery’s value reportedly rose to between $1 million and $5 million in 2024.Omar’s net worth has skyrocketed since she first took office in 2019, when she declared assets between negative $25,000 and negative $65,000. Her campaign reportedly received $7,400 from at least three now-convicted fraudsters, though she said the donations were returned after the scandal emerged.The Republican National Committee said that Omar’s wealth surge raises questions about her financial transparency and the connections between her family’s ventures and Minnesota’s ongoing fraud investigation into Daycare centres.","Congresswoman Ilhan Omar insists she is “not a millionaire’ even as reports suggest her net worth, along with her husband Tim Mynett’s, could be as high as $30 million.

'Zero chance of restoration of monarchy in Nepal': Ex-PM Bhattarai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/zero-chance-of-restoration-of-monarchy-in-nepal/articleshow/126242051.cms,"Following the Sept Gen-Z protests in Nepal, do you think the anger of the protesters has been addressed now?

Why Nepal Is Fed Up With Its Democracy | I Witness

Do you think some external elements pushed the protests in Sept?

Notwithstanding elections being slated for next March, many in Nepal say this is unconstitutional and parliament should be reconvened. What’s your take?

So, should there be a constitutional amendment with regard to Article 76(5) that allows any member of Nepal’s parliament to stake claim to form govt with adequate support of any other members?

How do you see calls from certain sections for the restoration of the monarchy?

How is the current situation impacting

India-Nepal relations

?

What about updating the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship?

There is concern in some quarters in New Delhi about China’s growing footprint in Nepal. Do you see this as an issue?

So how does Nepal plan to balance between India and China?

Following the introduction of the Agnipath scheme, recruitment of Nepalese citizens in the Indian army has halted. Has this impacted our bilateral relations?

Do you think Agnipath has forced Nepali citizens to other theatres like joining the Russian army and fighting in Ukraine?

How do we insulate India-Nepal relations from political changes in either country?

India seems to have grown out of Saarc. What is the way forward then for regional cooperation?





Former prime minister of Nepal and one of the architects of Nepal’s constitution, Baburam Bhattarai, sat down for an exclusive one-on-one interview with TOI’s Rudroneel Ghosh, discussing the recent Gen-Z protests that rocked Nepal, New Delhi-Kathmandu ties, the Agnipath scheme, and the China factor:The situation is still in a flux in Nepal. My analysis is that Nepal is still going through a transitional phase. Because we democratised our society very late compared to the rest of the world. The monarchy was only abolished in 2008. Then after the institutions were not very strong until the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. That’s when institutions started developing but were not fully developed. So Nepali govts haven’t been able to deliver. Meanwhile, the aspirations of the youth have skyrocketed, especially after the advent of digital technology. So, frustrations were mounting and exploded in Sept. But things are still in a flux as of today.The crisis should be seen as a manifestation of internal contradictions in Nepali society – political, social and cultural. That was the principal factor. The triggering factor was the banning of social media by the then govt. There was also tremendous antagonism against the leadership of the traditional parties, namely the Nepali Congress and the two Maoist factions.These three parties and their leaders simply reshuffled their chairs and couldn’t deliver anything. Plus, corruption was mounting and there was utter failure on the economic front. So, these factors together gave rise to the revolt on the first day. Then there was heavy repression by govt which triggered things further. On the second day there was natural resistance by the youth, and then different vested interests, both internal and external, naturally tried to fish in troubled waters. That’s the reality.I think the question doesn’t arise. In constitutional law you already have the doctrine of necessity. When people’s aspirations are not fulfilled by govt, people have the right to express their views through the street. That is also a part of democracy. So, when govt is forced to resign and the parliament dominated by outdated parties and leaders was not accepted by the people, it was dissolved. So, the natural corollary is to hold elections on time and bring constitutional democracy back on track. If you keep postponing elections under various pretexts, the danger is collapse of constitutional democracy. That won’t be in the interest of anybody, including international players.I was one of the makers of the constitution. We had certain reservations then also. Given Nepal’s specific case and tremendous diversity, we needed to have a directly elected executive and a fully professional parliament. Only then we could ensure stability. That was our point of view at that time, but our view could not prevail. So, we made a hotch-potch-type electoral system and form of governance that led to not any party mustering enough seats, and therefore they were forced to enter into coalitions, giving rise to horse-trading and instability. To minimise this, certain provisions were kept in the constitution but even these didn’t work. One of the demands of the Gen-Z movement is to make a progressive amendment to the constitution so that these anomalies can be addressed. That can be done after the election – it could be one of the issues of the election.This is not true at all. In every society there are some fringe elements, 1-2% of the population, who are very conservative with retrograde mindset and nostalgia about the past. This happens even in Europe and America. In Nepal’s case the monarchy was overthrown by the mandate of the people. It was abolished through the duly elected constituent assembly. Monarchy had totally failed. Monarchical institutions had staged coups against democracy in Nepal since the 1960s. That is why monarchy was democratically abolished and people realised the importance of democracy. They are not at all in favour of monarchy. This bogey of monarchy is only raised by certain vested interests. There is zero chance of restoration of monarchy.India-Nepal relations are multifaceted. These things (political issues) won’t impact the relations. Yes, we have open borders, and therefore instability in Nepal may partially impact India. But overall, given our strong and broad bilateral ties, these things won’t impact much.As you know, I was one of the major proponents of that idea. Because every treaty and agreement is time specific. If you see the ancestry of the 1950 treaty, the 1923 treaty was the first between British India and Nepal. This was partially revised in 1950 when Nepal was still under Rana autocracy. And in 1951 partial democracy was introduced in Nepal. So, our position is that the treaty needs to be updated once again with mutual agreement. Apart from that we have the open border issue, which is a bit problematic for both countries and needs to be regulated, and we have some boundary issues left over from the British days. So, let us review our relationship in totality and recalibrate ties for the 21st century. This was mutually agreed upon and the eminent persons group was constituted when I was PM. But unfortunately, it couldn’t fructify. I would request both sides to sit down and revise and strengthen our relations further.This is highly exaggerated. Geopolitics is fast changing in the region with the rise of both India and China as global powers. Add to this the interests of global superpower US. Naturally, their interests would collide to some extent. But I don’t think Nepal can be a playground for any external forces to the detriment of any of our neighbours. Nepal won’t come in between our neighbours and other powers. Nepal being an independent sovereign country would want to maintain its independence and territorial integrity, and won’t allow its soil to be used against anybody.That is not a big issue. I think vested interests overplay these things. Just an example: When we had the Sugauli Treaty in 1816 between Nepal and the British, a delegation was sent to Beijing. The then Chinese emperor advised Nepal to have good relations with the south or the then British empire. Later on also in 1964, when Nepal’s PM visited Beijing, both Mao and Zhou Enlai also advised Nepal to have good relations with India. This is recorded. When I was PM, Chinese premier Wen Jiabao visited, he also gave us the same advice. So, I see that consistency on Beijing’s part. I don’t think any power would like to play Nepal against any power, including India. The Nepalese people are very sensitive about this and they won’t indulge in such games.Recruitment of Nepalese nationals in foreign armies of India and Britain has a long history. This has roots in the British days. The issue of review of our bilateral treaties included a review of recruitment of Nepali citizens in foreign armies. This also needs to be revisited. Again, my humble request is to review all the elements of our relationship as a package.This is due to lack of fast economic development and industrialisation of Nepal’s economy. Many of our youths have been ejected from the agriculture sector. They are forced to migrate for employment to different countries. So Agnipath is not the main reason. Key factor is the lack of industrialisation of our economy and lack of gainful employment.We shouldn’t indulge in issues for partial gains of particular political party or leader. In a democracy, leaders and parties do change periodically. So, state policy should have continuity. In our case, as I have practically experienced, certain leaders for their own arrogance rake up these issues. But the Nepalese people and state shouldn’t engage in matters that vitiate relations with neighbours that will also impact our own economic development. I don’t see any problem between us that cannot be resolved through dialogue. We must propagate our relations for mutual benefit of both sides.With the fast-changing geopolitical scenario across the world, this period is seen as one of a multipolar world. Even if you go by the latest US national security strategy, they have admitted that they are going back to the old Monroe Doctrine and withdrawing from regions outside the western hemisphere. So, they have accepted that the world is heading towards multipolarity. Naturally, this will also impact South Asia where countries have a common history and socio-economic conditions. There is reason for South Asian countries to cooperate and resolve their issues peacefully, and deal with a multipolar world. For that India being the largest country and biggest power in the region, should be taking the initiative and every country should be playing a positive role in this effort.","Baburam Bhattarai is the former prime minister of Nepal and one of the architects of Nepal’s constitution.

‘If they can’t speak English…’: Tommy Robinson slams £12 million going to translators for migrants in UK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/if-they-cant-speak-english-tommy-robinson-slams-12-million-going-to-translators-for-migrants-in-uk/articleshow/126230426.cms,"Tommy Robinson does not like the idea of non-english speaking immigrants getting legal benefits in UK

Should claimants pay for their own translators?



Tommy Robinson's on immigration





A row erupted over the rising cost of translators in the UK benefits system after far-right, anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson accused the government of wasting millions of pounds of public money on people who ""can't speak English. ""In a post on X, Robinson criticised the use of taxpayer-funded interpreters for migrants and pushed for their deportation: “If they can't speak English, then they shouldn't be here anyway. Absolute p***take. Deport.”His comments came as a new report called for migrants to be banned from using free translation services when claiming benefits. The study was published by the Policy Exchange think tank, according to the Daily Mail. It argues that the ability to speak English should be a basic requirement or bare minimum for accessing the welfare system.The report follows a surge in benefit claims and says the government should stop offering free translators in most civil cases. It describes the benefits system as part of a “social contract” with society and its people, adding: “Part of this is the ability to converse in the official, national language.”According to official figures cited in the study, spending on translation services in civil cases rose by 80 per cent in the three years after the Covid-19 pandemic, reaching £12.8 million last year.Claimants are currently entitled to free translation to help them appeal decisions denying benefits such as Personal Independence Payment and Employment and Support Allowance.The report also says that in future, claimants who cannot speak English should be expected to pay for their own interpreters. It recommends that free translation should remain only for deaf people and for criminal cases, where “freedom and liberty are on the line”.The proposal is to curb the growing welfare bill and reduce the influence of courts over benefit rules. The report argues that courts have gradually expanded the rules on who qualifies for benefits, driving up overall costs. It says Parliament has failed to assert control, with MPs unwilling to reverse decisions made by judges.Spending on sickness and disability benefits alone is forecast to exceed £100 billion by the end of the decade. More than 300,000 young people are now receiving sickness benefits that do not require them to look for work, double the figure from five years ago.Tribunals hear thousands of benefit appeals each year, and the study found that the majority succeed, with up to 75 per cent of decisions overturned in some courts.The report estimates that £750 million a year could be saved by tightening rules around mental health claims linked to travel difficulties.Tommy Robinson is known for his strong opposition to immigration, especially from Muslim-majority countries. He argues that mass migration compromises British identity, security, and social cohesion. In September, Robinson led major anti-immigration rallies in London that included tens of thousands of supporters and sometimes turned violent.","Tommy Robinson criticises use of taxpayer-funded interpreters for migrants.

The case

(With PTI inputs)





An Indian national is set to receive nearly £70,000 in compensation for wrongful dismissal and being subjected to racial discrimination, after a tribunal ruled in his favour against his manager at the KFC outlet in London where he was previously employed.Madhesh Ravichandran, from Tamil Nadu, told the employment tribunal that his Sri Lankan manager discriminated against him, using a derogatory term such as “slave.”In a hearing earlier this week, judge Paul Abbott described Ravichandran’s claim as “well-founded.”“We have found on the facts that the claimant was subjected to less favourable treatment… his holiday request was refused because he was Indian, while (manager) Kajan prioritised requests from Sri Lankan Tamil colleagues, and he was referred to as a ‘slave,’ which is self-evidently less favourable treatment because of his race,” Abbott wrote in his judgment.Ravichandran joined KFC’s West Wickham outlet in January 2023, where Kajan became his direct supervisor. Problems, however, began soon after he started.The situation escalated in July when Kajan tried to make Ravichandran work excessive hours, prompting him to resign. The judge accepted that his decision to leave was a direct result of the manager’s “persistent efforts” to make him work “excessive hours.” During follow-up calls, Kajan reportedly became “racially abusive and threatening” toward Ravichandran.“This racial abuse from a manager had the purpose and effect of violating the claimant’s dignity. He was ‘summarily dismissed’ while serving out his notice and was denied his statutory right to one week’s notice,” the tribunal’s judgment read.“The respondent did not show that the claimant had done anything to entitle it to dismiss him without notice. The claimant was, therefore, wrongfully dismissed and is entitled to be paid one week’s pay in lieu of notice,” it stated.Ravichandran was awarded £62,690 in compensation, with additional payments for holiday pay and employment-related particulars bringing the total to around £66,800 (approx. Rs 81 lakh).The tribunal also directed Nexus Foods Limited, which operates the West Wickham KFC outlet, to implement a training programme on workplace discrimination for all employees. The programme should include training for managers on the “appropriate handling” of such grievances and must be completed within six months of the judgment.","Madhesh Ravichandran, from Tamil Nadu, told the employment tribunal that his Sri Lankan manager discriminated against him, using a derogatory term such as “slave” The situation escalated in July when the manager tried to make him work excessive hours, prompting him to resign.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126214872,imgsize-34544,width-400,resizemode-4/kfc-business.jpg"
