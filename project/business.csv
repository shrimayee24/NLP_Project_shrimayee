"Jet Airways: Rescind Jet Airways resolution plan, order liquidation, SBI tells SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rescind-jet-airways-resolution-plan-order-liquidation-sbi-tells-sc/articleshow/114300003.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved verdict on the plea of SBI-led lenders’ consortium seeking scraping of the three-year-old Rs 4,783 crore resolution plan of Murari Jalan-Florian Fristch for revival of bankrupt Jet Airways under IBC on the ground that the successful resolution applicant has failed to deposit even the first tranche of Rs 350 crore.Additional solicitor general N Venkataraman with SBI counsel Sanjay Kapur told a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra that the SRA has floundered at the inception stage every step of the resolution plan, which warranted upfront deposit of Rs 350 crore, which was part of the Rs 4,783 crore payment the SRA was to pay over five years.The Jalan-Fristch consortium, the successful resolution applicant (SRA), has so far deposited only Rs 200 crore with an additional bank guarantee of Rs 150 crore and failed to comply with the SC order that extended time for payment of balance Rs 150 crore by Jan 31 this year, the ASG said.SBI-led consortium said the RP was approved by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) in June 2019 when the airport dues payable by Jet Airways were Rs 240 crore, which after five years have spiraled to Rs 11,00 crore. The SRA cannot escape this liability nor the mandate to pay the statutory dues of Jet Airways employees amounting to Rs 226 crore, it said.Jalan-Fristch was to deposit Rs 475 crore towards airport dues within 180 days of the effective date of the RP. Moreover, the SRA till date does not have a Air Operation Certificate, which was valid till September 3 last year and was extended till June this year on NCLAT orders.Seeking setting aside of NCLAT’s March 12 order and rescinding of the RP for Jet Airways, the SBI-led consortium said, “The SC should direct liquidationof Jet Airways invoking its omnibus powers under Article 142 to prevent further litigation.”It sought appropriation of Rs 200 crore and invocation of bank guarantee for Rs 150 crore deposited by Jalan and Fristch and requested the SC to direct the latter “to pay airport dues which stood at Rs 1,100 crore.”“There has been inordinate delay and utter non-cooperation at every stage and right from the beginning, Jalan-Fristch had no inclination to execute the plan and valuable time of more than 2.5 years had been lost since the NCLT passed on June 22, 2021, approving the resolution plan. The SC should therefore impose huge damages for the loss of valuable and irretrievable time,” it said.For the SRA, senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Gopal Sankaranarayanan told the court that the SRA has done its best and met the condition precedents, but the SBI-led consortium has adopted a non-cooperation approach right from the beginning. They said the SRA is still willing to work out modalities to revive Jet Airways.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved verdict on the plea of SBI-led lenders’ consortium seeking scraping of the three-year-old Rs 4,783 crore resolution plan of Murari Jalan-Florian Fristch.

India Canada News: Justin Trudeau alone responsible for damage to India-Canada relations: MEA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-confirms-india-on-trudeaus-admission-of-not-providing-hard-proof-on-nijjar-killing/articleshow/114297476.cms,"NEW DELHI: India on Thursday responded firmly to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ’s recent admission that his government had no ""hard proof"" when it accused India of involvement in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar . The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that Trudeau's testimony before a public inquiry only confirms what New Delhi has been saying from the start—that Canada has provided no evidence to support the serious allegations made against India.Trudeau, testifying before a foreign interference inquiry, acknowledged that his government initially accused India based on intelligence, rather than concrete evidence, in connection with Nijjar’s assassination last year. Trudeau said intelligence from Canada and its allies suggested Indian agents were involved, but admitted there was no hard proof at the time. He said, ""We told India it is not hard evidence but just intelligence at that point.""""Behind the scenes (were trying) India to co-operate with us. Their ask was...give us the evidence you have on us. Our response was it is within your security agency. You should be looking into how much they know, you should be engaging. 'No, no but show us the evidence'. At that point, it was primarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof.

Jaiswal went on to say that the damage caused to India-Canada relations is entirely Trudeau’s responsibility.""The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone,"" he said in his statement.The diplomatic row between India and Canada erupted when Trudeau accused India of orchestrating Nijjar’s killing in British Columbia in June last year. India labelled the claims as “absurd” and part of a broader political move by Trudeau.Tensions escalated when Canada identified India's High Commissioner and other diplomats as ""persons of interest"" in the Nijjar investigation. In response, India expelled six Canadian diplomats after summoning Charge d'Affaires Stewart Wheeler. The Indian government condemned Canada's ""baseless targeting"" as unacceptable and expressed concerns about the safety of its diplomats amid rising extremism. India also announced the withdrawal of High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, asserting its right to take further action against what it perceives as Canadian support for extremism.Canada’s initial accusation, made without clear evidence, had strained an already delicate relationship, especially over the issue of Canada allowing pro-Khalistani activities on its soil.

LONDON: The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) issued on Wednesday a statement siding with Canada in the diplomatic firestorm that has erupted between Ottawa and New Delhi, saying India’s “cooperation with Canada’s legal process was the right next step”.The FCDO issued a strongly worded statement “on the ongoing Canadian investigation linked to the govt of India”.The heading, in big bold letters, read: “Canadian investigation linked to the Govt of India.”The statement quoted an FCDO spokesperson as saying: “We are in contact with our Canadian partners about the serious developments outlined in the independent investigations in Canada. The UK has full confidence in Canada’s judicial system. Respect for sovereignty and the rule of law is essential…”The diplomatic row had erupted on Monday when India withdrew its high commissioner, Sanjay Verma, and five other diplomats from Canada and expelled six Canadian diplomats from India, including the acting high commissioner. The MEA said it was a response to a diplomatic communication it had received from Canada on Sunday suggesting that Verma and the other diplomats are “persons of interest” in the investigation into the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a separatist advocating the creation of Khalistan who was designated a terrorist by India.The same day Canadian police held a press briefing and claimed they had “multiple ongoing investigations into the involvement of agents of the govt of India in serious criminal activity in Canada” and accused agents of India’s govt of being involved in “homicides, extortions and other criminal acts of violence” in Canada and of coercing individuals and businesses to “collect information” to “target members of the South Asian community” in Canada.Overseas Friends of BJP UK president Kuldeep Singh Shekhawat said: “For the Canadian PM to survive the next year until the elections, he needs NDP’s support, otherwise his govt will fall. It looks like Jagmeet Singh has made a condition of his support to Trudeau being that Trudeau should malign India and Indian diplomats. India has nothing to hide or ignore.

Justin Trudeau: 'No hard proof when we made first allegation ...

In a surprising admission, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revealed that his government had no concrete evidence when it initially accused India of being involved in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a prominent Khalistani extremist. The revelation comes at a time of escalating tensions between India and Canada , raising questions about the diplomatic storm that followed these unsubstantiated allegations.Trudeau, who was testifying before the foreign interference inquiry, acknowledged that when his government implicated New Delhi in Nijjar's assassination last year, they were acting on weak intelligence rather than definitive proof.Trudeau said, ""Over the course of summer I was apprised by intelligence services that govt was involved in the killing of Nijjar, there was not an obvious immediate international nexus... In August, intelligence from Canada and The Five Eyes made it clear that india was involved...agents from India were involved on Canadian soil and told them we have real concerns that your security agencies are involved. India's response to our investigation was to double down on attacks against our government...We told India it is not hard evidence but it is just intelligence at that point...India undermined our government and governance...These were clear indications that India has violated our sovereignty""He further said, ""They [India] asked us how much do you know? Give us the evidence you have on this and our response was well, its within your security agencies, you should be looking into how much they know you should be engaging.""""They [India] asked to show the evidence, and at that point, it was primmarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof,"" Trudeau said, underscoring the fragile basis of the initial accusations.The timing of Trudeau's confession coincides with an explosive claim by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a designated Khalistani terrorist and leader of the banned group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). Pannun revealed that he had been in contact with Trudeau’s office for the past three years, regularly sharing information—further complicating the narrative of Canadian-Indian relations.This diplomatic row erupted when Canada labeled India's High Commissioner and other diplomats as ""persons of interest"" in the investigation of Nijjar’s death. India swiftly denounced the allegations, dismissing them as ""preposterous"" and part of Trudeau's political maneuvering.The fallout saw India recall its High Commissioner from Canada, followed by Ottawa expelling six Indian diplomats. In retaliation, New Delhi ordered six Canadian diplomats to leave before October 20, signaling a deepening divide between the two nations.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revealed that his government had no concrete evidence when it initially accused India of being involved in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

"No bilateral but India, Pak ‘break the ice’ with Jaishankar visit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-bilateral-but-india-pak-break-the-ice-with-jaishankar-visit/articleshow/114294069.cms,"Modi, Sharif likely to come face to face at COP29 in Nov



ISLAMABAD: External affairs minister S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days even though there was no formal bilateral meeting between the foreign ministers on the margins of the SCO heads of government summit in Islamabad, diplomatic sources said. The fact that the first visit by an Indian foreign minister to Pakistan in almost 9 years went off without a hitch was seen as a positive development by the Indian government.As he departed after a 24-hour stay in Islamabad from the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi, Jaishankar, who had said recently India isn’t passive on Pakistan and will react to positive and negative developments accordingly, thanked Shehbaz and Dar in a post on X for the hospitality and courtesies.While Indian government sources described the talks as casual conversations, Pakistan officials said there was a brief pull aside, which lasted for 5 to 7 minutes, between Jaishankar and Dar on the sidelines of the dinner hosted by Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday evening. Pakistan’s interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chief of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), is learnt to have joined Jaishankar and Dar.A source speaking on condition of anonymity said Pakistan suggested resumption of bilateral cricketing ties as a way of “breaking the ice”. Naqvi was later quoted as saying that Jaishankar’s visit was an ice-breaker even though neither side proposed a bilateral meeting. Pakistan is looking to host the Champions Trophy next year and would like India to participate.The relationship between the 2 countries has remained in deep-freeze since the abortive bid to resume the dialogue process in 2015 under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. Things only worsened after Pakistan recalled its high commissioner in August 2019, following India’s decision to revoke the special status of J&K.Indian government sources appreciated the fact that Shehbaz didn’t rake up any bilateral issue in his remarks as the host of the summit.While Jaishankar’s remarks on terrorism were seen as a message for Pakistan, Indian sources said the minister had only spoken about issues that the SCO has identified as key challenges and that other member-states can also relate to.Jaishankar is learnt to have had another extended conversation with Dar at the SCO lunch table on Wednesday where both were seated next to each other. “It wasn’t initially planned that way but later they sat together and spoke over lunch in the presence of other delegates,’’ said.Both sides denied that there was any proposal for resumption of dialogue. Shehbaz and Indian PM Narendra Modi are expected to come face to face next month at COP29 in Azerbaijan but for any substantive engagement, India will want Pakistan to first reappoint high commissioner.After his return from Pakistan, Jaishankar said in another post on X that India made a positive and constructive contribution to the talks in Islamabad and identified 8 takeaways from India’s perspective from the documents that were signed. These included upholding fair and balanced connectivity projects in accordance with international law, the goals and principles of the UN Charter and SCO Charter and a fair, open, inclusive and transparent multilateral trading system with WTO at its core.Significantly, another Pakistan minister, Ahsan Iqbal, had told visiting Indian journalists on Tuesday that Pakistan wants the 2 countries to return to the 1999 Lahore Declaration that called upon both sides to refrain from intervening and interfering in each other’s internal affairs. Shehbaz’s brother Nawaz Sharif, who reached the agreement with then Indian PM A B Vajpayee, has repeatedly accused former president Pervez Musharraf of scuttling the Declaration through his Kargil adventurism.","S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days.

"SCO must root out terrorism, respect territorial integrity: Jaishankar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sco-must-root-out-terrorism-respect-territorial-integrity-jaishankar/articleshow/114294031.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Combating terrorism , extremism and separatism – characterised as “3 evils’’ by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) since its inception in 2001 – is essential for the Eurasian group to realise its goals of balanced growth and integration, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said, addressing the 23meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of Government in Islamabad.However, Jaishankar did not name or single out Pakistan and ensured his remarks fell strictly under the ambit of the SCO Charter that doesn’t allow bilateral issues to be raised at the forum.Without skirting round the issue of terrorism though, the minister said activities across borders characterized by terrorism, extremism and separatism would be detrimental to trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchangesJaishankar sought an honest conversation on the issue saying, “if trust is lacking or cooperation inadequate, if friendship has fallen short and good neighbourliness is missing somewhere, there are surely reasons to introspect and causes to address”. He said attaining these original SCO objectives was even more important in an uncertain world marred by conflicts and debt.“It is axiomatic that development and growth requires peace and stability. And as the Charter spelt out, this means being firm and uncompromising in countering the three evils,’’ said the minister.In a message to both China and Pakistan, the minister also said SCO cooperation in areas like trade, investment, energy and connectivity must be based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. “It should recognize territorial integrity and sovereignty. It must be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas,’’ said the minister, adding cooperation can’t progress if global practices are cherry-picked, especially of trade and transit.India was again the only country in SCO to not endorse China’s BRI in the SCO joint statement. BRI’s flagship China Pakistan Economic Project ( CPEC ) passes through PoK, which India sees as under illegal occupation of Pakistan. Since it became a full member of SCO in 2017, India has repeatedly reminded member-states that it’s important for them to respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. China was represented by Premier Li Qiang in the meeting.The minister also spoke about the need to make the UN Security Council more representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable. “The SCO must be in the lead of advocating such change, not hold back on a matter of such importance,’’ said the minister. China is the only P5 country not to publicly declare support for India’s UNSC permanent membership bid.“While we each make our contribution, the world order is more than the sum of its parts. As it changes, global institutions do need to keep pace. That is why the case for ‘reformed multilateralism’ gets stronger by the day. Comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council, both in the permanent and non-permanent categories, is essential,’’ said the minister.","S Jaishankar said activities across borders characterized by terrorism, extremism and separatism would be detrimental to trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges.

While sticking to his allegation that Indian agents killed pro-Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar , Canadian PM Justin Trudeau on Wednesday said that he lacked “evidentiary proof” but only had intelligence when he first went public with the accusations last year.Testifying before Foreign Interference Commission, he admitted Canada had not shared any evidence with India but only sought to work together and New Delhi kept demanding proof.“Our response was, well, it’s (proof) within your security agencies,” he said. Later, he told the inquiry panel looking into surveillance of two Conservative lawmakers that there were “clear indications India had violated Canada’s sovereignty”, stopping short of repeating the claim they had shared “evidence” of Indian govt’s complicity in Nijjar’s killing.Trudeau’s choice of words echoed what govt officials in New Delhi have been saying for a year that Canadian authorities have not shared any evidence to back their claims.Trudeau, who is grappling with a big loss in public support, sought to play on the sovereignty of Canada and repeatedly tried to bracket India with China and Russia.“Indian govt made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada, and we need to respond,” Trudeau said.He said Canadian police started probing the Nijjar murder after “credible intelligence” and demands from South Asian members of parliament and those from the community who alleged an Indian hand. He said he was briefed about it in late July or early Aug.“I was briefed on the fact that there was intelligence from Canada, and possibly from Five Eyes allies that made it fairly clear, incredibly clear, that India was involved in this... Agents of the govt of India were involved in the killing of a Canadian on Canadian soil,” Trudeau said.He said his govt could have chosen to make it “very uncomfortable” for India by going public just before the G20 Summit in Sept 2023 but chose to work with Indian govt. Trudeau also said when he raised the issue with PM Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G20 meeting, the latter’s response was not helpful. “He responded with the usual response that ‘we have people, who are outspoken and speaking against India, living in Canada that we would like to see arrested’,” Trudeau said, while seeking to defend the “freedom of expression” of several persons whom India sees as pro-Khalistan separatists.",Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said that he lacked “evidentiary proof” but only had intelligence when he first went public with the accusations last year.

Imposing a cost of Rs 20,000 on Railways for causing mental agony to the passenger, an NCDRC bench comprising Justice Sudip Ahluwalia and Rohit Kumar Singh, said, ""...it is concluded that Railways is liable for the theft, and there was deficiency in service provided to the petitioner (passenger) owing to negligence of railway officials concerned."" The Railways owe a duty of care towards passengers travelling in a reserved coach with their personal belongings and luggage, it said.NCDRC passed the order while hearing a revision petition filed by Durg-based Dilip Kumar Chaturvedi against the order of Chhattisgarh State Consumer Commission.The case dates back to May 9, 2017, when Chaturvedi with his family was travelling from Katni to Durg in a sleeper coach. He had lodged an FIR with railway police about his luggage - cash and articles of around Rs 9.3 lakh in value - being stolen around 2.30am. He then filed a case in the Durg district consumer commission, which directed South East Central Railway GM, Durg station master, and Bilaspur GRP thana in-charge to pay the claimed amount. But, the respondents challenged the order in the state commission, which quashed the district commission's order.Chaturvedi filed a revision petition before NCDRC, submitting that the TTE and railway police staff were grossly negligent in allowing ""unauthorised persons"" in the reserved coach.

Harris has big lead over Trump in poll of South Asian voters in US battleground states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/harris-has-big-lead-over-trump-in-poll-of-south-asian-voters-in-us-battleground-states/articleshow/114297242.cms,"Kamala Harris, Donald Trump

In a first of its kind poll of South Asian voters in the key battleground states of America, which will play an important role in deciding the winner in the Presidential election next month; US Vice-President Kamala Harris is seen to have a commanding lead over Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump . The survey was commissioned by the Indian American Impact Fund , a political organisation representing Indian and South Asian American communities, and conducted by public opinion research and political strategy firm GBAO , among 600 South Asian likely general election voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania last month.It included a large percentage of Indian Americans.The South Asian electorate, which could be the deciding factor in the swing states, is highly motivated to support Harris, who they see as aligned with their top priorities in this election, the survey found. “The results of this first-of-its-kind South Asian battleground poll demonstrated that Harris is more popular among our communities and leads Trump by a significant margin. The South Asian population in the battleground states is large and voters are likely to be the deciding factor in who wins the Presidential election next month. Members of our community trust Vice-President Harris and are energised by her,” Chintan Patel, executive director Indian American Impact Fund, told the Times of India.He added that while Indian Americans felt a deep sense of pride about being represented at the highest office in America by a woman of Indian heritage, who looks like them; they also support Harris on various policy issues.Besides Harris leading Trump by a wide 48-point margin among South Asian battleground voters, other key findings of the survey included Harris voters holding a motivation advantage over Trump supporters and inflation, the economy and abortion being top of mind issues for South Asians in the US Presidential election.South Asian voters, who were surveyed, overwhelmingly supported abortion. The survey found that Harris is trusted more than Trump on a wide range of issues including the economy, taxes, and crime, signalling a confidence in Harris’ approach and policies.Indian American Impact is now continuing with its targeted outreach to the South Asian community following the survey, in the last weeks before the Presidential election. “It will be crucial for Harris to secure battleground states and make history as the first South Asian American president. We are ramping up our efforts in the next weeks to campaign among the 400,000 plus eligible South Asian voters in key states. Our community can swing this election,” Patel said. The organisation is working to mobilise resources with door-to-door campaigns, phone and text banking. “Some of the Indian American elected officials have also joined us for events to help galvanise and motivate voters from the community on the ground,” Patel added.The Impact Fund has also tied up with Future Forward (FF PAC), a US Presidential Super Political Action Committee, to launch a $3.5 million advertising campaign to reach South Asian and Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters in support of Harris. This represents the largest independent expenditure programme ever focused on AAPI voters for a presidential candidate, according to Impact Fund.The campaign will spotlight key priorities important to South Asian communities, such as the economy, abortion rights, and supporting caregivers, while also highlighting how Harris’s South Asian heritage and background inform those values. The ads will be featured across multiple platforms, including TV, digital and radio channels to reach 1.3 million eligible AAPI voters, including 400,000 South Asian voters, in the critical battleground states.""We are witnessing an unprecedented moment for South Asian and Asian Americans in US politics,” Patel said. “This partnership with Future Forward represents a historic investment in ensuring South Asian and AAPI voices are heard at the ballot box, and with Kamala Harris leading the charge, we have a unique opportunity to make history.”","US Vice-President Kamala Harris is seen to have a commanding lead over Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump.

The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security ( BCAS ) had this June proposed to the Union aviation ministry that people people making hoax threats to flights and other aviation-linked infra be put on no fly list.“BCAS had not identified the relevant law to base this move on. We will work it out,” a senior aviation ministry official said.Security has been beefed up at airports and on flights by additional deployment of sky marshals, say sources. They add agencies are close on heels of culprits behind the recent hoax calls and that they could be nabbed soon. ""Some people have been zeroed in,"" sources said.Airlines are urging government to crack down on this menace that troubles passengers; disrupts schedules and costs a lot. Air India will now “consider legal action against those responsible to recover damages incurred by the airline.” Both airlines and passengers hope the aviation ministry can put in place the deterrence of no fly list for people making such calls at the earliest.Wednesday — third day running for such threats — has already seen two flights getting these threats. An Akasa Delhi-Bangalore flight returned to Delhi and an IndiGo Mumbai-Delhi flight was diverted to Ahmedabad. Monday and Tuesday, between them saw at least 10 flights getting such threats, including for Air India Delhi-Chicago which had to divert to a remote town in Canada and AI Mumbai-New York which diverted to Delhi.BCAS DG Zulfiquar Hasan has sounded a stern warning to all those issuing these hoax messages. “All standard operating procedures were followed. All our flights are safe and the Indian skies are absolutely safe. We are confident of tracing all those behind these threat messages and very strict action under law will be taken against all of them. Police across the country is cooperating in ensuring this happens.” Hassan ensured air travellers amid growing threats that “there is zero risk in flying.”Meanwhile, the over 200 passengers stuck in Canada’s remote Iqaluit town after Air India’s Delhi-Chicago flight was diverted there on Tuesday following a threat message finally reached their destination on a Royal Canadian Air Force Airbus A330 Wednesday sans their checked-in baggage. The crew operating AI 127 from Delhi to Chicago could not operate their aircraft out of the remote sub-Arctic town due to flight duty time limitations.The small town did not have adequate hotels or other facilities for the over 220 passengers and crew of AI 127 so a request was made to fly out at least the passengers to their destination. Alternate AI crew will be sent to Iqaluit which will then take the aircraft along with baggage to the US.“With passengers from Air India flight 127 stranded in Iqaluit, after an emergency landing due to a bomb threat, we have approved a request to have Canadian Armed Forces provide an airlift to get passengers safely to their destination in Chicago,” Canadian minister of national defence Bill Blair said on X (former Twitter) early on Wednesday morning (India time).In a statement Wednesday morning, AI said passengers of AI 127 are on their way to Chicago. “Passengers are being ferried on a Canadian Air Force aircraft that took off from Iqaluit at 3.54 am (UTC) and is expected to land in Chicago at 7.48 am (UTC).

New Indian Railways bridge in Varanasi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has approved a new rail-cum-road bridge in Varanasi over river Ganga. According to Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw , the new rail-road bridge will be ‘one of the biggest’ in terms of transport capacity.The new road bridge in Varanasi will have four railway lines and a six lane highway. The new bridge will be designed for a lifespan of 150 years and will be over one kilometre long.Vaishnaw said that given the complexity of the bridge structure, it will take around four years to complete it.The new bridge will save diesel imports of about 8 crore litres per year, which translates into a saving of about Rs 638 crore per year.The multi-tracking project, with an estimated cost of Rs 2,642 crore, aims to streamline operations and alleviate congestion on the busiest sections of Indian Railways. The project will provide essential infrastructural improvements and spans across the districts of Varanasi and Chandauli in Uttar Pradesh.As a critical hub in Indian Railways, Varanasi Railway Station connects important zones and serves as a gateway for pilgrims, tourists, and the local population.The route between Varanasi and Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya (DDU) Junction is crucial for both passenger and freight traffic. However, it experiences significant congestion due to its role in transporting essential goods such as coal, cement, and foodgrains, as well as catering to the increasing demands of tourism and industry.To tackle this challenge, infrastructure upgrades are necessary. These include the construction of a new rail-cum-road bridge over the Ganga River and the introduction of 3rd and 4th railway lines.These improvements are designed to enhance capacity, efficiency, and support the socio-economic development of the region. In addition to easing congestion along the stretch, the proposed section is expected to handle 27.83 MTPA of freight.Covering two districts in Uttar Pradesh, the project will expand the existing network of Indian Railways by approximately 30 kilometers.The Malviya bridge , situated in Kashi, is a crucial railway bridge that spans the Ganga river, linking the Northern, Eastern, and Western states of India. This rail-cum-road bridge, which is approximately 137 years old, consists of two rail lines and two road lanes.Due to the bridge's age and the oversaturation of the route between Varanasi and DDU, which currently stands at 163%, there is a pressing need to replace the Malviya bridge to ensure efficient and safe transportation across the region, Vaishnaw said.","The new road bridge in Varanasi will have four railway lines and a six lane highway.

It is the first time that Gabba will not host an Ashes series-opener in Australia in more than four decades.That first Test is scheduled for November 21-25, 2025 with the second a day-night Test at the Gabba in Brisbane from December 4-8.Adelaide Oval will host the third Test from December 17-21.The Melbourne Cricket Ground will continue to host its traditional Boxing Day Test beginning December 26, with the Sydney Cricket Ground also maintaining its usual time slot for the January 4-8 fifth and final Test.The last time an Ashes in Australia started away from the Gabba was in 1982 when the historic foes drew at the WACA in Perth.Australia lost the 1986 opener at the Gabba to Mike Gatting's England but have not lost another Ashes Test at the iconic ground since.Once Australia's first choice to start a home summer of cricket, the Gabba's stocks have fallen in recent years since Perth Stadium opened in 2017 and following Adelaide Oval's redevelopment a decade ago.The Gabba's future is up in the air, with no Test scheduled in the 2026-27 home summer and a planned redevelopment for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics scrapped over cost concerns.Australia have won the last eight Ashes Tests in Perth, though 2025 will be the first time the teams have played at the new stadium in Burswood.Adelaide Oval, meanwhile, will host its first daytime Ashes Test since 2013 when fast bowler Mitchell Johnson took 7/40 in the first innings to help the hosts claim a 218-run win.The Ashes dates align with Australian Cricket’s seven-year scheduling plan announced earlier in the year which will create greater certainty around fixturing and help grow matches and cricket-related events in partnership with governments and their events and tourism departments.The focus this summer, though, will be on the five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy Series.Australia have won 13 and drawn two out of the 15 Ashes Tests on home soil since England's win in Sydney in 2011. Australia won the last home series 4-0 in 2021-22 and retained the urn last year with a 2-2 draw in England.Perth Test (West Test): Perth Stadium | Nov 21-25Brisbane Test (Day/Night Test): Gabba | Dec 4-8Adelaide Test (Christmas Test): Adelaide Oval | Dec 17-21Melbourne Test (Boxing Day Test): Dec 26-30Sydney Test (New Year’s Test): Jan 4-8",The first Ashes Test will be played at Perth Stadium in Western Australia.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"Pakistan to repay over $30 billion debt in FY25, says central bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-repay-over-30-billion-debt-in-fy25-says-central-bank/articleshow/114208042.cms,"Representative Image

Cash-strapped Pakistan 's central bank has revealed the country is scheduled to repay a total of USD 30.35 billion in maturing foreign debt and interest payments in 12 months (August 2024 to July 2025) including those significant loans which bilateral creditors roll over every year.The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, cited by a JS Global report, showed that the payments from August 2024 to July 2025 include significant loans that bilateral creditors roll over annually.The Express Tribune reported that Pakistan is set to repay maturing foreign debt amounting to USD 26.48 billion and an additional USD 3.86 billion in interest expenses during this period.Under the latest USD 7 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Pakistan's repayments and interest payments are fully secured for the 37-month loan period. Despite the rising repayments and interest payments, the foreign debt-to-GDP ratio has decreased from 27.6 per cent in August of the previous year to 20.2 per cent in August 2024, due to the expansion of Pakistan's economy in FY24 compared to the contraction in FY23.The data highlights the increasing foreign debt repayments and interest payments each year, emphasizing the need for economic managers, planners, and parliamentarians to explore ways to boost foreign income and reduce external expenditures. Compared to the USD 21.2 billion (including rollovers) paid by Pakistan over the past 12 months (August 2023 to July 2024), the current 12-month period's repayment and interest payment sum of USD 30 billion is significantly higher, according to JS Global.The increase in repayments and interest payments for the ongoing 12 months can be attributed to fresh loans provided by Saudi Arabia, UAE, and IMF in late June and July 2023, amounting to around USD 4 billion, as well as an additional USD 2 billion lent by IMF between August 2023 and April 2024. These loans have increased the repayment pressure (including significant rollover) in the coming years.Topline Research, citing the latest IMF documents, reported that Pakistan's gross external financing requirement has dropped to a 9-year low of USD 18.8 billion (excluding expected rollovers and contained current account deficit) for the ongoing fiscal year (July 2024 to June 2025). However, another researcher mentioned that Pakistan is also expected to add fresh foreign loans amounting to USD 3 billion to USD 4 billion in the current fiscal year (FY25).A third researcher emphasized the need for Pakistan to reduce its external expenditures through import substitution. Implementing such measures would help improve the country's ability to make external payments and increase foreign exchange reserves, as reported by The Express Tribune.","Pakistan is set to repay maturing foreign debt amounting to USD 26.48 billion and an additional USD 3.86 billion in interest expenses during this period.

"IMF asks Pakistan to end preferential treatment to agriculture, textile sectors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-asks-pakistan-to-end-preferential-treatment-to-agriculture-textile-sectors/articleshow/114205816.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund has asked Pakistan to swiftly end preferential treatment, tax exemptions and other protections for the agriculture and textile sectors, which it says, have stifled the country's growth potential for decades, a media report said here on Monday. The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ), in its staff report on the diagnosis of the factors behind Pakistan's struggling economy, blamed these two sectors not only for failing to contribute adequately to the national revenue but also for consuming large portions of public funds while remaining inefficient and uncompetitive, The Dawn newspaper said.As part of the recently approved USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the IMF stressed that Pakistan must break from its economic practices of the past 75 years to escape its recurrent boom-bust cycles.The IMF report released on October 10 highlighted the country's significant lag behind similar nations, a stagnation that has compromised living standards and pushed over 40.5 per cent of the population below the poverty line.It said Pakistan had struggled to develop more sophisticated export goods, and the share of knowledge-intensive exports remains low as it failed to innovate. As of 2022, Pakistan ranked 85th in the Economic Complexity Index, the same rank it held in 2000.""With an export basket strongly biased towards agriculture and textiles (cotton yarn, rice, woven fabrics, beef, and leather apparel), the country has struggled to reallocate resources towards more technologically complex products,"" it said.The current focus on agriculture has limited Pakistan's ability to diversify into more technologically complex goods. While Pakistan does export some high-value products, such as medicines, medical instruments and plastic products, these sectors operate in a heavily distorted economic environment, it said.The report highlighted tariffs on intermediate and final goods as barriers to competitiveness and domestic market growth, inhibiting the country's transition towards more advanced manufacturing.""Reallocation, however, is held back by existing microeconomic distortions, including public procurement of agricultural goods, price controls on raw inputs, and fiscal and financial incentives for low productivity sectors,"" it observed.The report identified the textile sector as having the highest tax gap relative to its value added, noting that between 2007 and 2022, the sector benefited from subsidies, favourable pricing on inputs, concessional financing schemes and preferential tax treatment.Earlier, the IMF on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to certain conditions. This USD 1 billion tranche came under an agreement to receive USD 7 billion over 39 months.The latest IMF report pointed out that as of May 2024, 70 per cent of the outstanding concessional central bank loans were tied to the textile sector.The IMF recommended that the government focus on simplifying trade policies under the upcoming National Tariff Policy (2025-29) and urged Pakistan to avoid using tariffs to promote industrialisation or protect inefficient sectors, arguing that such policies weaken exports, hinder participation in global value chains, and incentivise rent-seeking.The report also warned that ""trade policies aimed at promoting specific domestic sectors, including export subsidies and local content requirements, should be discontinued as they are likely to promote resource misallocation and may violate international obligations"".Compared to other regional peers, Pakistan's export growth has been weak, with sales to the world particularly stagnant during the 2010s.It said several complex goods were within likely technological proximity to Pakistan's current export basket, including glassware, paints, chemicals, fabrics for industrial use, paper, cosmetics and rubber products.However, to facilitate the development of such new industries, the country needed a level playing field for business, avoiding targeted policies aimed at picking winners.This includes greater integration into global trade and easier access to imports, both as intermediate inputs for production and as final goods to promote domestic competition, the IMF said, adding, the removal of fiscal incentives would reduce the existing misallocation of resources and promote price discovery across firms.","The International Monetary Fund has asked Pakistan to end preferential treatment, tax exemptions and other protections for the agriculture and textile sectors.

The implementation will be gradual, and officials will focus on persuading people that such images are against Islamic law.Saiful Islam Khyber, the spokesman for the ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice (PVPV), stated, ""Coercion has no place in the implementation of the law.""The new legislation outlines several rules for news media, including the ban on publishing images of living things and the requirement not to mock or humiliate Islam or contradict Islamic law, according to a report by news agency AFP. While some aspects of the law have not yet been strictly enforced, such as advising the public not to take or view images of living things on their devices, the implementation has begun in certain provinces like Kandahar, Helmand, and Takhar.In Ghazni and Maidan Wardak provinces, local journalists were summoned by PVPV officials and informed about the gradual implementation of the law. Visual journalists were advised to adapt their practices, such as taking photos from a distance and filming fewer events. Under the previous Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001, television and pictures of living things were banned nationwide, but a similar edict has not been widely imposed since their return to power in 2021.However, officials have sporadically enforced censorship rules on business owners, such as crossing out faces on advertisements, covering mannequin heads, and blurring the eyes of fish on restaurant menus. The media industry in Afghanistan has suffered since the Taliban takeover, with the number of media employees dropping from 8,400 to 5,100, including only 560 women who have faced severe restrictions dubbed ""gender apartheid"" by the United Nations.","The Taliban's morality ministry in Afghanistan has announced its intention to enforce a law prohibiting news media from publishing images of all living things.

LONDON: Prince William says one of his roles as Britain's heir to the throne is to try to help people in need, as he explained his efforts to end homelessness in a documentary to be broadcast later his month.Last June, William, 42, the elder son of King Charles, launched the five-year project "" Homewards "", which he said was inspired by his late mother Princess Diana who had alerted him to the crisis when he was a child.""I think everyone having a right to a safe and stable home benefits us all,"" the royal says in an extract from the ITV documentary, ""Prince William: We Can End Homelessness"", released on Wednesday.""I come with no other agenda than desperately trying to help people who are in need, and I see that as part of my role.""Critics have said it was hypocritical for someone with William's wealth and many homes to be talking about battling the issue.Asked whether he was the right person to lead the project, William said: ""Why else would I be here if I'm not using this role properly to influence and help people where I can. And I like a big challenge, I do like that, but I can't do it on my own.""When he launched Homewards, William said visits to homelessness shelters with his mother, the first when he was 11, had left a deep and lasting impression.In 2009, he slept rough on a winter's night to highlight the issue, and in 2022 he was spotted selling copies of the ""Big Issue"" magazine, a title that is normally sold by the homeless, on the streets of London.His scheme works in six locations across the United Kingdom aiming to find and develop new solutions that could be used to ultimately end homelessness across the country.William will also later on Wednesday help present awards for Centrepoint , a charity for homeless young people for which he is patron, recognising those who have turned round their lives after experiencing homelessness.The documentary, which followed the prince's work over a 12-month period, will be broadcast on Oct. 30 and 31.","Prince William says one of his roles as Britain's heir to the throne is to try to help people in need.

LONDON: Britain's new government is unlikely to upset investors in its first budget this month and the outlook for its debt is more positive than financial markets appear to believe, senior executives from global asset manager PIMCO said.Finance minister Rachel Reeves is due to announce her debut tax-and-spending plans on Oct. 30, a little more than two years after then-prime minister Liz Truss plunged the UK government bond market into crisis with her plans for big tax cuts.Speculation about increased borrowing by the government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer - whose centre-left Labour Party returned to power in July after 14 years in opposition - has contributed to an underperformance of gilts in recent weeks.""We do expect the fiscal outlook in the UK to be tight, and we continue to expect the deficit to fall in future years,"" Peder Beck-Friis, a senior vice president at PIMCO, said in a Reuters interview with executives from the firm on Wednesday.""We will be surprised if the government announced anything that would lead markets to question the fiscal credibility that we've seen in the UK over the last two years.""Beck-Friis said he believed financial markets would price in more interest rate cuts by the Bank of England once markets and the BoE realised the outlook for inflation and growth was lower than they thought, following similar shifts in the United States, Canada and New Zealand.""We continue to like UK government bonds,"" he said. ""I think one of the key premises is that we think that the terminal rate that's priced into financial markets looks high relative to our expectation and that inflation will continue to ease.""British government bond prices rose sharply on Wednesday after weaker-than-expected inflation data but those gains narrowed only some of their recent underperformance.""Gilts yields are attractive on an absolute basis in terms of yield, but also we would expect some potential capital appreciation on these holdings over time,"" Beck-Friis said.Andrew Balls, PIMCO's chief investment officer for global fixed income, said the expected fiscal restraint in Britain by the new government stood in contrast to much bigger deficits in the United States.""We tend to favour gilts as one of the better global sources for duration,"" Balls said, speaking in the same interview.On Britain's economy, Beck-Friis said weak productivity improvements, tighter immigration controls and higher levels of workplace dropouts since the pandemic meant growth was likely to be stuck at around 1% to 1.25% a year, similar to the euro zone.Balls said one area for optimism was the government's plan to reduce red tape and speed up construction of infrastructure and housing.""It's not easy for a government to raise productivity growth, but to the extent they're able to deliver on it in the planning permission stuff, (it) seems like a positive if they're able to do something significant there,"" he said.","Finance minister Rachel Reeves is due to announce her debut tax-and-spending plans on Oct. 30.
