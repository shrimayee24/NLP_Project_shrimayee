"HC: Words, gestures in email can insult woman's modesty",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-words-gestures-in-email-can-insult-womans-modesty/articleshow/112726026.cms,"Mumbai: An email would amount to an utterance, ""gesture"" and ""exhibit"" - words used in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to define what constitutes an act intended to offend a woman's privacy and dignity - held Bombay HC in a judgment pronounced Wednesday.Words and gestures communicated via email would fall under the ambit of offence under IPC Section 509 that deals with words, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman, ruled the HC bench of Justices Ajay Gadkari and Neela Gokhale.The ruling came as HC granted partial relief to a Mumbai resident and quashed part of a 2009 FIR against him registered with the cyber call for alleged sexual assault and criminal intimidation of a woman, who is now over 70 years old. HC, though, did not quash the part of the FIR that invoked prosecution for offence intended to invade a woman's privacy and outrage her modesty under Section 509 and Section 67 of Information Technology Act (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form), based on emails to third persons. The emails, HC said, ""are a personal attack on her dignity, poise and self-esteem"". Interpreting Section 509, HC said, ""Insult can manifest as an intrusion upon the woman's privacy... encroaching upon her personal space or violating her sense of privacy intentionally, in a manner that affronts her modesty.""""The purpose of law is not to allow the offender to sneak out of the meshes of law,"" ruled HC. It said ""intent"" is the linchpin of the offence and opined the emails intruded on the woman's privacy and ""demonstrate his intent"".There were allegations of emails containing the woman's personal details being shared. HC, invoking SC's constitutional bench judgment on privacy, said, ""Sharing such details... especially the residents of the same Society who she is likely to see frequently and without her consent is an affront to her personal dignity."" Words used in the email about the woman may tend to deprave and corrupt persons who read it, said HC, as it said some could ""conjure"" an image of her.In 2011, the man petitioned HC to have the FIR and case quashed, arguing it was out of ""vengeance"" over animosity between the two. HC did not accept his arguments, stating, ""If such narrow interpretation is accepted, many a man will walk away, unhindered by consequences merely by shooting emails or using social media to malign a woman and outrage her modesty... Modern technology makes such manner of perpetrating the offence verily real.""","Bombay HC rules that an email would amount to an utterance, ""gesture"" and ""exhibit"" Ruling came as HC granted partial relief to a Mumbai resident and quashed part of a 2009 FIR against him registered with the cyber call for alleged sexual assault.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

Amidst the turmoil, a man was seen setting a tyre ablaze directly under the bus.The visuals showed the bus fully occupied by school children in uniform.The attempt, however, was thwarted by the police.The Bihar Police resorted to using lathi-charges and water cannons to scatter demonstrators who had set up blockades on railways and roads in support of the Bharat Bandh, which was organised to demand community-based reservation.

West Bengal medical college principals reveal how deep the rot is: 'Bullied & threatened if we don’t toe the line',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/threatened-bullied-to-do-a-lobbys-bidding-ima/articleshow/112693204.cms,"KOLKATA: Hushed talk of medical college principals in Bengal being bullied and threatened if they don't toe the line of an influential lobby in the health department came out in the open at a meeting to seek inputs on improving healthcare and addressing the safety concerns of doctors and students, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said Wednesday amid continued unrest and administrative changes triggered by the Aug 9 rape-murder at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College.A woman principal recounted during Monday's meeting convened by IMA's Bengal chapter that a junior doctor officiating as a member of the penal and ethical committee of the West Bengal Medical Council ""called me names"" for not doing the bidding of the ""north Bengal lobby"", purportedly named after their alma mater North Bengal Medical College and Hospital.""My family wasn't spared either. The junior doctor said 'they' would 'see' how my children stepped out of home,"" a source in IMA quoted the principal as saying.IMA West Bengal's action committee issued a release on what transpired at the meeting. ""We have zero expectation of justice when even a medical college principal does not feel safe at her workplace,"" it said.""What has shocked us even more is non-action from Swasthya Bhawan (the state health department headquarters) despite being informed by the principal (about what she faced). It is evident that the health department is run by power-hungry, blindfolded officials whose only worry is their next posting.""Some of the principals alleged that question papers were given to select students before exams and that many of them illegally used mobile phones and laptops to access ChatGPT. The principal of a suburban medical college recommended that exams held this year be reviewed given the fact that at least 40% of the answer sheets were identical.""The principal of a medical college in north Bengal reported that a faculty member distributed question papers to students before the start of the exam. A teacher from another north Bengal teaching hospital was removed as invigilator in the middle of an exam,"" IMA said.The association named two young doctors who were allegedly part of the lobby and mentioned at least one instance of an allegedly politically-motivated transfer of a teacher from north Bengal to Kolkata.""Such mass oppression can only happen when a large part of the system is corrupt and operates like an efficient cartel,"" IMA said.All 15 principals who attended the meeting expressed anguish over the rape-murder of a young doctor studying for her postgraduation at RG Kar, whose former principal Dr Sandip Ghosh is currently being interrogated by CBI.The principals felt Ghosh's handling of the aftermath of the crime tarnished the medical fraternity's image, IMA officials said.","Hushed talk of medical college principals in Bengal being bullied and threatened came out in the open at a meeting.

PM and his Poland counterpart Donald Tusk spoke about the negative impact of the Ukraine war on global food and energy security, especially for the Global South, and said the threat of use of nuclear weapons is unacceptable.""They underscored the importance of upholding international law, and in line with the UN Charter, reiterated that all states must refrain from the threat of or use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state,"" said the joint statement.Tusk described Modi's Ukraine visit as historic and said Poland believed India can play a very essential and constructive role in ending the war. ""PM Modi confirmed his willingness that he is ready for peaceful, rightful and immediate end to war,"" said Tusk.After his engagements in Warsaw, Modi flew from Warsaw to the Rzeszow Jasionka airport in southeastern Poland and drove to Przemysl on the Polish-Ukrainian border, from where he undertook a 10-hour overnight train journey to Kyiv. Most leaders, including US President Joe Biden, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have used the same 'VIP luxury' train run by the Ukrainians to travel to Kyiv.The first visit by any Indian PM to Ukraine will last for 7-8 hours, during which Modi will have bilateral talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and interact with the Indian community, including students.""We support dialogue and diplomacy for an early return of peace and stability. For this, we are willing to contribute in every possible way along with our friendly countries,"" said Modi.During his meeting with Zelensky, Modi is likely to reiterate his govt's position that it's ready to offer any assistance within its means for restoration of peace than to come up with his own formal proposal for peace. India has maintained that while it's open to mediate if it's asked to, it won't initiate any peace proposal on its own. The Indian govt wants Russia to be also involved in any international initiative for enduring peace. While Zelensky is expected to focus on his 10-point peace plan that seeks Russian withdrawal from Ukraine and accountability for war crimes, it's unlikely that Modi will endorse it.The PM delivered a similar message of peace while addressing the Indian community in Warsaw on Wednesday, as he said India is the land of Lord Buddha's legacy, does not believe in war and advocates for peace in this region.""India is an advocate of permanent peace in this region. India's concept is clear: this is not an era of war, and it is the time to unite to tackle the biggest challenges of humanity .

What is victory for Ukraine?

Sirens go off in Kyiv as PM Modi makes his way to Ukraine for a historic visit. The alert was issued for ballistic missile strikes covering parts of central Ukraine including Cherkasy, Poltava and Sumy regions. While it remains to be seen what impact the Russian attack has on the visit, I spoke to Larysa Bilozir, an independent People's Deputy of Ukraine, on expectations from the visit:Ukrainian people are very happy that Indian PM Modi is coming for the first visit in 30 years.This is a very important visit for us because Modi I believe is a humanistic person as he keeps saying in meetings with world leaders, including Putin, that India is for peaceful solutions to conflicts. We are very grateful to India’s participation in the Ukraine Peace Summit. India also played a key role in the Black Sea Grain Initiative. So we are grateful that Modi is coming to Ukraine to show solidarity with us.First, the return of our abducted children. There is already a coalition of more than 70 ombudsmen from around the world who are helping us get back our children. India can and should participate in this effort. The Russians are abducting our children and they are being forced to fight against Ukraine. There are around 20,000 Ukrainian children that need to be returned by Russia .Second, we need India’s support in the return of our civilians. Third, we need help in return of the bodies of disappeared Ukrainians. Fourth, we need help in ensuring food security. India as a leader of the Global South has a critical role to play here. Fifth, we need help with energy security. And sixth, we need help in ensuring just peace.Victory is when all our territories and people will be restored and returned. It is about the preservation of our state. We also have to realise that even if we recover all our territories, Russia won’t stop attacking us. So ultimately victory is decolonising Russia. Russia has enslaved so many nations – Dagestan, Chechnya, parts of Georgia, etc. So victory will be when Russian imperialism is destroyed. We will continue to fight till the end for our freedom.",Ukrainian people are very happy that Indian PM Modi is coming for the first visit in 30 years.

"Dhaka blames India for flooding, Delhi hits back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dhaka-blames-india-for-flooding-delhi-hits-back/articleshow/112724351.cms,"NEW DELHI/DHAKA: The Indian government on Thursday strongly denied claims in Dhaka that flooding of districts on the eastern borders of Bangladesh had been caused by the opening of Dumbur dam upstream of the Gumti river in Tripura, saying that floods on cross-border rivers is a shared problem on both sides. Indian govt sources also warned the interim govt against any official backing of ""misplaced"" narratives.The warning came in the wake of allegations by one of the advisers to the interim govt, Mohammad Nahid Islam, that India's ""non-cooperation"" was the reason for the flooding.""Without any prior warning and without giving us time for preparation, the dam was opened. Through this India showed an inhuman approach and is demonstrating non-cooperation with Bangladesh,"" Islam said after a meeting of the advisory council with chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.Amid cross-border acrimony, there were rumours in Dhaka that Yunus had summoned Indian envoy Pranay Verma. Sources in Delhi, however, said that the request by Verma for a call was lodged several days ago and before the events related to the floods.Nahid, one of the coordinators of the protests against ousted PM Sheikh Hasina, who is supervising information and broadcasting affairs, hoped that India will come out from this ""anti-Bangladesh policy"".""Any official backing of such misplaced narratives is unhelpful to bilateral ties and the use of the word 'summon' is clearly an attempt at disinformation,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.In a statement, the foreign ministry said this problem requires close mutual cooperation, adding India continues to provide real-time flood data to Bangladesh as per a bilateral protocol.With the two countries sharing 54 common cross-border rivers, river water cooperation is an important part of their bilateral engagement. Looking to allay concerns in Bangladesh about India's alleged role in the floods, which followed the political crisis in the country, Indian govt said it remained committed to resolving issues and mutual concerns in water resources and river water management through bilateral consultations and technical discussions.India pointed out that the catchment areas of the Gumti river that flows through India and Bangladesh have witnessed the heaviest rains of this year over the past few days and the flood in the neighbouring country is primarily due to waters from these large catchments downstream of the dam.""Dumbur dam is located quite far from the border - over 120km upstream of Bangladesh. It is a low-height (about 30m) dam that generates power that feeds into a grid and from which Bangladesh also draws 40MW power from Tripura. Along the about 120km river course, we have three water level observation sites at Amarpur, Sonamura and Sonamura 2,"" said MEA .""Heavy rainfall has been continuing since Aug 21 in whole of Tripura and adjoining districts of Bangladesh. In the event of heavy inflow, automatic releases have been observed,"" it added, while recalling that the Amarpur station is in part of a bilateral protocol under which India is transmitting real-time flood data to Bangladesh.""Data showing a rising trend has been supplied to Bangladesh up to 3pm on Aug 21, 2024. At 6pm, due to flooding, there was a power outage, leading to problems of communication. Still, we have tried to maintain communication through other means created for urgent transmission of data,"" said govt.Heavy rainfalls have caused heavy flooding, the worst since 1956, in Tripura with more than 80% of the state capital, Agartala, waterlogged. The situation worsened in the city after it received 233mm rain on Wednesday that could not be pumped out as the Haora river was overflowing.Eight districts of Bangladesh have been flooded due to heavy rains and onrush of water from the upstream, said the ministry of disaster management and relief on Wednesday. The eight districts are Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Feni, Chattogram, Noakhali, Comilla and Khagrachhari. At least 1,796,248 people have been affected, the ministry said on Thursday.(With inputs from AKM Moinuddin in Dhaka)","India strongly denies claims in Dhaka that flooding of districts on eastern borders of Bangladesh had been caused by the opening of Dumbur dam upstream of the Gumti river in Tripura.

Supreme Court reaffirms 'general' seats open to meritorious SC/ST/OBC candidates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-reaffirms-general-seats-open-to-meritorious-sc/st/obc-candidates/articleshow/112724350.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has reiterated the settled principle that SC/ST/OBC candidates who make it to the merit list on their own are entitled to be selected for open seats in the general class . The open category is open to all, and the only condition to be eligible is merit, irrespective of class, the court said.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan granted relief to petitioners from SC/ST/OBC categories who were not given MBBS admission under Unreserved (UR) Category Government School (GS) quota in MP for 2023-24 despite being more meritorious, having scored higher marks in the entrance exam than those who were eventually admitted.the bench said the principle was to be applied in both horizontal and vertical reservation. While vertical reservation applies separately for each of the groups specified under the law (such as SC, ST, OBC), horizontal quota is provided to other categories of beneficiaries such as women, veterans, transgender community, and individuals with disabilities, cutting through vertical categories.The court said petitioners were denied admission in medical colleges in Madhya Pradesh in 2023-24 session due to ""erroneous application of methodology in applying horizontal and vertical reservation"". It said that a meritorious reserved category candidate who is entitled to the 'General' category of the said horizontal reservation on his own merit, will have to be allotted a seat from the said 'General' category of the horizontal reservation. GS quota was introduced by MP in 2023.The petitioners alleged that the procedure followed by the govt in sub-classifying the candidates further into categories as UR-GS, SC-GS, ST-GS, OBC-GS and EWS-GS was totally illegal.""The methodology adopted by the respondents in compartmentalising the different categories in the horizontal reservation and restricting the migration of the meritorious reserved category candidates to the unreserved seats is totally unsustainable. In view of the law laid down by this Court, meritorious candidates belonging to SC/ST/OBC, who on their own merit, were entitled to be selected against the UR-GS quota, have been denied the seats against the open seats in the GS quota,"" the court said.Referring to previous verdicts of SC, the bench said the horizontal as well as the vertical reservation would not be seen as rigid ""slots"", where a candidate's merit, which otherwise entitles her or him to be shown in the open general category, is foreclosed. ""It was observed that by doing so, it would result in communal reservation, where each social category is confined within the extent of their reservation, thus negating merit,"" the court said.""It is to be noted that, in the present case, the cut-off for UR candidates was much less as compared to the cut-off for SC/ST/OBC/EWS candidates. As such, the respondents ought to have admitted the present appellants against the UR-GS categories. It is further to be noted that many seats from UR-GS category were required to be transferred to the general category,"" the court said.","Supreme Court reiterates settled principle that SC/ST/OBC candidates who make it to merit list on their own are entitled to open seats in the general class.

Sureties are essential to ensure the presence of the accused released on bail. At the same time, where the court is faced with the situation where the accused enlarged on bail is unable to find sureties, as ordered, in multiple cases, there is also a need to balance the requirement of furnishing the sureties with his or her fundamental rights under Article 21 of the Constitution,"" the court said.The accused, in this case, was facing prosecution on the basis of 13 FIRs in UP, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. In spite of obtaining bail in 13 cases, the petitioner has not been able to furnish sureties.""Whether it is to get individuals, to stand as a guarantor for a loan transaction or as a surety in a criminal proceeding, the choice for a person is very limited. It will very often be a close relative or a long-time friend. In a criminal proceeding, the circle may get even more narrowed as the normal tendency is to not disclose about the said criminal proceeding to relatives and friends, to protect one's reputation.

Bangladesh: Dozens Of Hasina's Party Members Chased & Killed In Mob Attacks; 29 Bodies Found

Heavy rains in Brazil have led to a remarkable paleontological discovery that will astound one and all: a 233 million-year-old dinosaur fossil . This significant find was made in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , near the town of São João do Polêsine. The fossil, which is almost fully preserved, was unearthed next to a reservoir after torrential rains eroded parts of the fossil site.The dinosaur, believed to be a member of the Herrerasauridae family , roamed the Earth during the Triassic Period when all the continents were part of a single landmass known as Pangea, also often referred to as a ""super continent"".Herrerasaurids were among the earliest carnivorous dinosaurs, and this particular specimen is estimated to have been about 2.5 meters (8 feet) long. The discovery was made by a team led by Rodrigo Temp Müller , a paleontologist from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM).The site where the fossil was found has been a focus of paleontological research for about 20 years. The region is known for its rich deposits of Triassic fossils, which have provided valuable insights into the early evolution of dinosaurs . The recent heavy rains accelerated the erosion process, exposing the fossil that had been buried for millions of years. According to Müller, the fossil was initially thought to be just a few isolated bones, but further excavation revealed an almost complete skeleton.This discovery is particularly significant because it is one of the oldest dinosaur fossils ever found. The oldest known dinosaur fossils date back to around 231 million years ago, making this find potentially one of the earliest examples of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s excellent preservation allows scientists to study its anatomical details, which could provide new insights into the characteristics and behaviors of early dinosaurs. Truly an exciting find!The Herrerasauridae family, to which this dinosaur belongs, includes some of the first known carnivorous dinosaurs. These dinosaurs were bipedal, much like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, meaning they walked on two legs, and had free hands with sharp claws for catching prey. The newly discovered fossil is expected to shed light on the evolutionary adaptations that allowed these early dinosaurs to thrive in their environment.The discovery has generated excitement in the scientific community, as it could help fill gaps in our understanding of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s advanced age and preservation make it a unique and valuable addition to the fossil record, offering a rare glimpse into the past. Researchers are now working to carefully extract the fossil from the surrounding rock and conduct detailed analyses to determine whether it represents a new species of dinosaur.The region where the fossil was found has been subject to increasingly severe weather events, including the heavy rains that led to this discovery. In June 2024, the state of Rio Grande do Sul experienced three months’ worth of rain within just two weeks, causing widespread flooding and displacing over 500,000 people. While the rains have accelerated the erosion process, they also pose a threat to newly exposed fossils, which can be damaged or destroyed if not promptly rescued.The Federal University of Santa Maria and other research institutions are now focused on preserving the fossil and conducting further studies. The findings from this discovery are expected to be published in scientific journals, contributing to our knowledge of early dinosaur evolution and the conditions that shaped their development.For the unversed, dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago. They were some of the most successful and varied animals ever to have lived, ranging from the small, bird-like Velociraptor to the gigantic, long-necked Brachiosaurus. Paleontologists study dinosaur fossils to learn about their behavior, diet, and appearance. Fossilized bones, teeth, footprints, and even eggs have been found, offering insights into these ancient creatures. There were over 1,000 different species of dinosaurs identified so far, ranging from the plant-eating sauropods to the fierce carnivorous theropods, showcasing their incredible diversity.Did you like this article?

Not all states on board for fewer GST slabs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/not-all-states-on-board-for-fewer-gst-slabs/articleshow/112720636.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the demand for fewer slabs of GST, several states , including Opposition-ruled West Bengal and Karnataka, do not see any need to reduce them from the current four, with a ministerial panel set to review representations from insurance, online gaming, restaurants and beverage sectors for lowering of rates.While the demand for lowering GST on health insurance from the current 18% came up during the first meeting of the group of ministers ( GoM ) on rate rationalisation on Thursday, the matter has been referred to the fitment committee, comprising officers, which will come back with its analysis.""Some GoM members are demanding that there should be no change in tax slabs under GST. More discussions will happen, and then only a final decision will be taken,"" Bihar deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, the convenor of GoM, said after the meeting. The GST Council is due to meet on Sept 9, where the issue of rate rationalisation is likely to figure but Thursday's talks indicate that discussions would drag on for a while.While there was discussion on reducing the slabs from four to three, there was no consensus on the matter. Currently, there are four main slabs - 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.West Bengal FM Chandrima Bhattacharya said she has suggested that there should not be any change in the slabs and a presentation will be made to the GST Council. Karnataka revenue minister Krishna Byre Gowda said GST has broadly stabilised. ""Why disturb something which is going on smoothly,"" he said.Reducing the slabs from four to three will require merging the 12% and 18% slabs and converging them around 15-16%. It will mean that products in the 12% bracket - including butter, ghee, computers, mobiles, umbrellas and hotels with room rent up to 7,500 a night, among others - will face a higher levy. Besides, there may be a requirement to increase the rate in the lowest slab, which may not be politically palatable.A review of rates on restaurants, beverages and online gaming sectors demanded by industry will also be taken up by the GoM and some could be sent to the fitment committee, Chaudhary said.The GST Council will also discuss phasing out of compensation cess on products, such as tobacco, automobiles, beverages and coal, which was extended up to March 2026 but may not be needed from late 2025. The cess was originally in place for five years but had to be extended to recover the borrowings during Covid-19.","Several states, including Opposition-ruled West Bengal and Karnataka, do not see any need to reduce them from the current four.

This tech cuts road accidents by 40-50%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/times-techies/this-tech-cuts-road-accidents-by-40-50/articleshow/112725402.cms,"Towards GenAI

Reduction in road accidents by almost half in a few months! Sounds incredible! But that’s the kind of impact, Avneesh Agrawal says, their AI device is having on customer fleets globally. In India, which has the world’s worst road fatalities record, the effect could be dramatic.Avneesh, who spent years at Qualcomm, including as its research head, and who holds over 200 patents, developed the product together with Qualcomm colleague David Julian as part of a venture called Netradyne that they founded in 2015.Netradyne today has about 800 employees globally, with the majority of its R&D team in India.The company has over 3,000 customers, all of which are commercial fleets – taxis, limousines, school buses, large inter-state vehicles. Customers are across the US, India, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Germany.The device integrates multiple sensors – GPS, LTE connectivity, several cameras, inertial sensing unit – and is fitted on the windshield. A software ties it all together. “The real innovation is in the software where we are running all of the algorithms at the edge and really understanding the world around us,” says Avneesh.The AI in the device can figure out if the driver is distracted, drowsy, speaking on the phone, following too close to another vehicle, not following traffic signs. And accordingly, it can alert the driver with a ₹beep’ and even inform the fleet safety manager . As the system tracks a driver’s behaviour over time, it also assigns each driver a ₹green zone score’, an estimate of the driver’s risk of having an accident.The latest version of the product also has micro weather recognition capabilities. It can detect if there is snow on the road, if there is fog. “So, now we can provide combo alerts, combine the driver behaviour and weather conditions, and accordingly modify the alert definitions,” Avneesh says.Netradyne’s systems have done about 14 billion miles to date, and are doing about 600 million miles a month now. With that amount of data, including data of thousands of accidents a month, Avneesh says the company is able to very accurately predict the chances of a driver having an accident in the next 12 months, or how many vehicles in a large fleet could have an accident in the next 12 months.Apart from real-time alerts, the system is also able to bring long-term behavioural changes to drivers. Netradyne sends snippets of videos of driver behaviour and points out what needs to change in order to lower risks. Since fleet safety managers too are aware, drivers are careful. “We have seen a 90% reduction in distracted driving because of use of phones in 3-4 months of launch with a customer. Big customers have reported 40-50% reduction in accidents,” Avneesh says.The systems to date have been built using classical AI techniques of deep learning, where you collect a huge corpus of data, identify scenarios, and train your system on those scenarios (like vehicles being too close, or what to do for traffic lights). Now, Avneesh and team are developing a generative AI platform using the hundreds of billions of data they have. “We are training a foundational model, similar to an LLM. It allows us to predict fairly accurately how the world will evolve in the next 2-3 seconds. It’s in the early stages, but the results are very interesting. GenAI models almost show emergent behaviour, a level of reasoning very similar to humans, they can anticipate situations that they have not even been trained for. I think this will leapfrog us to the next level in understanding safety and guiding drivers,” Avneesh says.","Avneesh Agrawal and David Julian founded Netradyne in 2015. The company has over 3,000 customers, all of which are commercial fleets.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

'Monsoon brides': Extreme weather fuels Pakistan child marriages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/monsoon-brides-extreme-weather-fuels-pakistan-child-marriages/articleshow/112579850.cms,"'I thought I would get lipstick'

'I want to study'

DADU: As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan , 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.""I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier,"" Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life.""But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible.""Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity .The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage.Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests.""This has led to a new trend of ' monsoon brides ',"" said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage.""Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money.""Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon -- 15 of them in May and June this year.""Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area,"" said village elder Mai Hajani, 65.""They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done"".Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money.Shamila's mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave 200,000 Pakistan Rupees ($720) to the young bride's parents -- a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day.Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan.""My husband gave my parents 250,000 rupees for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now,"" she said.""I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery,"" she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby.""Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat.""Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water -- its stench overwhelms the area.""We had lush rice fields where girls used to work,"" said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma's mother.""They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022,"" she added.""The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless.""Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December.The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced.Unicef has reported ""significant strides"" in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk.""We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,"" it said in a report after the 2022 floods.Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.""When I was there, I thought to myself 'we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities',"" the daily wage labourer told AFP.Mehtab was just 10 years old.""The night I decided to get her married, I couldn't sleep,"" said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married.An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education.But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive.""I have told my father I want to study,"" she said. ""I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don't want this for myself.""","Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years. But after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise.

According to AFP news agency, the verdict was delivered by a five-judge bench led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya. It does not carry immediate legal consequences due to Wickremesinghe's immunity while in office.However, it places a spotlight on the state of the economy ahead of next month's presidential election.The March 2023 local polls were postponed, making the September 21 presidential election the first opportunity for voters to weigh in on Wickremesinghe’s administration since he assumed office. Wickremesinghe, who took over after the resignation of Gotabaya Rajapaksa amid widespread protests over a severe economic crisis, is seeking re-election for a five-year term.The Supreme Court ruled that Wickremesinghe failed to allocate funds for the local elections, which was previously mandated by court order. His administration argued that the funds were necessary for public servants and pensions. The court criticised Wickremesinghe’s ""arbitrary and unlawful conduct,"" which it said violated constitutional rights.In response, Wickremesinghe defended the postponement of the local elections, saying he was ""not sorry"" for the delay, as it was necessary to address the economic challenges and ensure the right to life. He promised to protect both the right to vote and live.The court has ordered the independent election commission to conduct the local polls as soon as possible, ensuring they do not interfere with the upcoming presidential vote. The state has also been directed to cover the legal fees of the petitioners who challenged the postponement.Wickremesinghe, who was elected interim president by lawmakers in July 2022 following Rajapaksa’s resignation, secured a $2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in March 2023. This followed significant measures, including tax hikes and energy price increases. The postponed local election was widely regarded as a referendum on these severe measures.","Sri Lanka's top court has found President Ranil Wickremesinghe guilty of "" unlawful conduct"" for delaying local elections.
