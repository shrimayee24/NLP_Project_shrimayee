Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes

In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don't just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5% of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India's bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80% phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams. ""When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,"" said Hany Farid, professor at University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. ""I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,"" Sitharaman said at an event in Mumbai. ""Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos that can manipulate people,"" she added.Given that over 97% of India's urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. ""Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,"" said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. ""The very term 'deepfake' comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,"" said Farid, calling the new term 'Generative AI' clever ""rebranding"" by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. ""We need to label everything as real or not real,"" said Farid. ""We need real disclosures,"" he added. To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our 'Don't Get Scammed' stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, ""if you don't know what's real, how will you know what's false""?","Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes. 85.5% of Indian households owning at least one smartphone.

Four cities targeted

What DNA test from blast site revealed



A wider terror web

(With inputs from agencies)

The investigation into the deadly Red Fort blast that killed 13 people on November 10 has unveiled a chilling web of terror networks spanning Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Kashmir. As agencies sift through CCTV footage, encrypted chats, and forensic trails, a clearer picture is emerging of how a group of educated professionals allegedly plotted one of the most audacious terror conspiracies in recent years.The probe has exposed a “white-collar” Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM)-linked module led by doctors from Kashmir who used Al-Falah University in Faridabad as their base. The group reportedly received guidance from a handler in Turkiye, coordinated on encrypted apps like Signal and Threema, and planned multiple blasts across India.Police said the conspiracy was hatched inside Al-Falah University, a private institution in Faridabad. 2,900 kg of explosives were recovered from its premises and nearby locations. Three Kashmiri doctors — Dr Umar Un Nabi, Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, and Dr Muzaffar Rather — were allegedly the masterminds. They stored ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, and sulphur in small quantities before assembling improvised explosive devices (IEDs).The trio used the campus’s laboratories and rented rooms for storage. Following the blast, the government ordered a forensic audit of the university’s finances and the Enforcement Directorate was asked to trace its money trail. The Association of Indian Universities suspended Al-Falah’s membership citing “irregularities”.The group was dubbed a “white-collar” or “white-coat” terror module because most accused were medical professionals. PTI reported that Dr Umar, who drove the explosives-laden Hyundai i20, was a 28-year-old doctor from Qazigund, Kashmir. Dr Muzammil and Dr Muzaffar were his close associates. Another, Dr Shaheen Sayeed from Lucknow, was accused of providing logistical support. Investigators found that they radicalised peers at Al-Falah, using Telegram and Signal for coordination. The police have sought an Interpol Red Corner Notice for Muzaffar, who fled India in August and is believed to be in Afghanistan.The plot’s international dimension was uncovered when investigators traced a handler in Turkiye, codenamed Ukasa. He allegedly acted as the conduit between the Delhi-based doctors and leaders of JeM and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind. Dr Umar and his associates had travelled to Turkiye in 2021–22, where they received ideological training. Ukasa reportedly instructed them on how to establish covert cells and communicate without detection. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is coordinating with foreign counterparts to track his digital footprint.CCTV footage analysed by Delhi Police, cited by PTI, revealed Dr Umar’s last movements. After leaving Faridabad, he was seen stopping for food near Nuh before entering Delhi through the Badarpur border. He looped across multiple areas — Okhla, Connaught Place, and Ashok Vihar — before parking near a mosque close to Asaf Ali Road, where he stayed for nearly three hours. Police believe he offered prayers and received instructions before driving toward the Red Fort Metro Station, where his car exploded at 6:52 pm.Investigators found coded notebooks and diaries from Room 13 and Room 4 at Al-Falah University, belonging to Dr Muzammil and Dr Umar respectively. As per PTI, the documents contained dates between November 8–12, coded names, and numerical sequences. The repeated mention of the word “operation” suggested detailed coordination. References to 25–30 individuals, mostly from Kashmir and Haryana, indicated a large, decentralised network. Police believe the diaries outlined phases of the operation, including procurement, transport, and execution.According to ANI, the module had planned simultaneous blasts in four cities. Eight suspects were to split into pairs, each assigned to one city. The targets were believed to include Delhi and Ayodhya, where an attack was allegedly planned around November 25 to coincide with Ram temple events. Each pair was to travel with multiple IEDs for coordinated strikes, mirroring tactics used in earlier JeM operations. Intelligence sources said at least two more vehicles — a red Ford EcoSport and a Maruti Brezza — were being modified for attacks.Police told PTI that the suspects pooled over ?26 lakh in cash, which Dr Umar managed for operations. The funds were used to purchase 26 quintals of NPK fertiliser from dealers in Gurugram and Nuh. This fertiliser, when mixed with chemicals, forms a key component of homemade explosives. A total of 2,900 kg of explosive substances were seized across Faridabad, confirming large-scale preparation. Authorities suspect additional funding from abroad, possibly routed via hawala channels linked to Turkiye and Pakistan.Dr Shaheen reportedly told interrogators that the attack planning coincided with the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition on December 6. Officials suspect the date was chosen to trigger communal tension. The group referred to December 6 as “Operation D-6” in their notes, according to ANI. Investigators believe this symbolic choice underscores the ideological motivation of the JeM-linked cell. The timing, they said, reflected an intent to cause maximum national disruption and political impact.Delhi Police confirmed via DNA profiling that Dr Umar Un Nabi was the driver of the car that exploded. PTI reported that his leg was found trapped between the steering wheel and accelerator, confirming he was behind the wheel. His remains were matched with samples from his mother and brother at AIIMS. Investigators believe the explosion was premature — possibly triggered accidentally while he was assembling or arming the IED inside the car.As ANI reported, the Delhi blast is only the visible part of a larger conspiracy. The module had prepared plans for 32 vehicles to be fitted with explosives for coordinated strikes. Police recovered a red Ford EcoSport linked to Dr Umar and are searching for a missing Maruti Brezza. Over 350 kg of ammonium nitrate and traces of RDX have been seized so far. Investigators are now probing whether the group was preparing to form a new outfit aligned with ISIS’s India affiliates. The Home Ministry has ordered a multi-agency review, while calls grow for an all-party discussion in Parliament on the attack.","The investigation into the deadly Red Fort blast that killed 13 people on November 10 has unveiled a chilling web of terror networks.

How far are we from resuming the talks on a bilateral trade deal?

When the talks were halted, it had reached a certain level. So, does that mean that you're reviewing what was agreed upon till then?

What do you make of foreign minister Anita Anand's remarks on progress in the normalization of the relationship being contingent upon the law enforcement dialogue?

Did you discuss India's purchase of Russian oil?

For India, visas are an important issue especially for professionals and business visitors in trade agreements. Can you give us a sense of what the visa policy is going to be?

And this would be STEM and similar skills?

Now that high level engagements have resumed, can we expect the Prime Ministers to meet on the margins of the upcoming G20 summit in South Africa? Can we expect Prime Minister Carney to visit India for the AI Summit in February?

Canada’s minister for international trade Maninder Sidhu, who is in India to take forward the bilateral dialogue on trade and investment ties, says that his government is looking for skilled workers from foreign countries, focusing more on quality. In an interview, he tells TOI that India and Canada are taking one step at a time and assessing the changes in the global economy before moving ahead with talks on a trade deal. Excerpts:We had a great meeting today to focus on a lot of the opportunities; opportunities around aerospace, energy, AI and critical minerals. These are all critical sectors for India. As India grows, Canada is there in complementary services and that's what we discovered today in terms of how fast India is growing.India needs 70% more energy by 2040. Canada is building the projects to get there. We have seven LNG projects in various phases of development. It was our first trade and investment dialogue at the ministerial level in many years.We need to continue building on that energy. Prime Minister Carney has given me a mandate, an ambitious target of $300 billion of (additional) non-US exports within the next 10 years and I'm looking at every market to see how we can continue diversifying and building on our trade partnerships.India is a great partner with $30 billion of two-way trade right and there's room to grow.Right now, we're identifying opportunities and hopefully, in the near future we'll be able to get into the trade conversations, taking investment and trade to the next level. We also need to bring the business community along with us.Look, this is a new government, new Prime Minister, new mandate, new focus. As you've seen from Prime Minister Carney, it's new energy, it's starting afresh. The context has changed from even six months ago. You know, President Trump's tariff policies have really shifted things globally. So, we're in a different frame right now. We just wrapped up a trade agreement with Indonesia a few weeks ago and launched negotiations with Thailand, with the Philippines. Two weeks ago, I ran into minister Jaishankar at the Asean Summit in Malaysia.We had a good conversation. Canada is looking at every opportunity, but now is the window that we can use. Our geography with the US Is not going to change. They'll always remain important. We have to match the energy from businesses in Canada. It was very positive to hear from minister Goyal that he's looking to come to Canada early next year with a delegation so we can continue building on this. Minister Jaishankar was in Canada yesterday and I'm here today. You know, there's this sustained energy that we need to continue building upon because it's not going to happen overnight.The minister’s visit was positive, and it laid the groundwork for what I'm doing now. The safety and security of citizens of both countries is paramount. So those conversations are encouraging that law enforcement agencies are talking to each other to resolve some of the challenges. My job as an economic minister is to focus on the trade and investmentsWe talked about alternative sources of energy and Canada can provide that. As you look for stable, reliable, long-term supply, Canada is that. These contracts are done for 10, 15, 20 years, now is the time to get in early. You'll notice in LNG, different countries have invested that those countries are now receiving the first shipments.Look, immigration comes up quite a lot; look at the diaspora, it's huge in both countries. We have a lot of family and friends visiting each other. That's why I sat down with Air Canada to talk about more flight options. In Canada, 13% of our trade flows through our airports. The Prime Minister has been very clear on immigration. It's a focus on economic immigration, a focus on skilled immigration. So making sure we're creating pathways to permanent residency for those skilled immigrants is very important for Canada's growth plans.When you look at what's happening to the south of us with the H1B anxieties, it's in our budget. It's still early in the conversations, but we're looking at different pathways to attract technical capabilities, skilled capabilities to Canada. The PM's focus is how do we build Canada. You have your localized talent, but you also need to bring in some talent that can add to that. So a part of that is looking at India and maybe something around the H1B programme is very important.Yes, STEM, skilled workers. We need nurses and doctors. We have specialized pathways. Are we going to continue that as a government? These are all considerations that we were looking at because in the past, it was more about quantity. With us, yes, the quantity, quality is also important. There are no caps on postgraduates, they can come to Canada and study at the University of Toronto, McGill, many of the universities.Prime Minister Modi has been very clear he'd like universities and colleges to come to India from other countries like Canada to set up shop here. And so we're facilitating those conversations because we'd like that partnership. It's important. It helps build the partnership and trust between communities through research, through students. And so we're looking at that option as well.The schedules are still being looked at. But of course, more conversations are very important to this relationship, to have that sustained dialogue.","Canada’s minister for international trade Maninder Sidhu is in India to take forward the bilateral dialogue on trade and investment ties.

Candidates Party Votes polled Voter percentage Bijendra Prasad Yadav BJP Minnatullah Rahmani INC Anil Singh JS Margin of difference

NEW DELHI: Counting of votes in the Supaul Assembly constituency will begin at 8:00am today, with the spotlight on JD(U) heavyweight Bijendra Prasad Yadav , who is seeking to retain the seat for a third consecutive term. He faces a triangular contest against Congress’s Minnatullah Rahmani and Jan Suraj’s Anil Singh, in a region where caste alignments and rural priorities have long shaped electoral outcomes. The contest this year comes against the backdrop of complex caste arithmetic, a predominantly rural electorate, and the continuing influence of agrarian and livelihood issues.Located in Supaul district, the constituency falls under the Supaul parliamentary seat, which comprises five assembly segments.Classified as a general category seat, it has long been a key political ground for Yadav, one of JD(U)’s senior-most leaders and a cabinet minister in the state government.Supaul had 2,97,943 registered voters and 392 polling booths in the 2020 Bihar Assembly election. During the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the number of polling booths was revised to 320. Voter participation has remained steady over the years - 56.71% in 2020, 58.09 per cent in 2015, and 60.05 per cent in the 2019 parliamentary election.The constituency’s diverse voter base - with a significant presence of Muslims, Scheduled Castes (SC) and Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) - continues to shape its political outcomes. Muslims make up a considerable share of the electorate, making their support decisive for any candidate.In 2020, Bijendra Prasad Yadav (JD(U)) defeated Minnatullah Rahmani (INC) by a comfortable margin of about 28,000 votes. Yadav secured 86,174 votes (50.2 per cent), while Rahmani polled 58,075 (33.8 per cent). Five years earlier, in 2015, Yadav had won with 82,295 votes (54.7 per cent), defeating Congress’s Renuka Devi, who garnered around 44,898 votes.With the JD(U) hoping to maintain its stronghold and the opposition banking on local anti-incumbency, early trends from Supaul will offer a glimpse into north Bihar’s rural mood and the social coalition dynamics driving this election season.",JD(U) heavyweight Bijendra Prasad Yadav is seeking to retain the seat for a third consecutive term.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday rejected Tamil Nadu's strident opposition to Karnataka's proposed multi-purpose Mekedatu project and said that the M K Stalin govt's objection to preparation of a detailed project report (DPR) is misconceived as it is yet to be approved by the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) and the Central Water Commission (CWC).A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and Vipul M Pancholi said Tamil Nadu's application seeking cancellation of the Mekedatu project is ""totally misconceived and premature"" as Karnataka is bound to release TN's share of water as per the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) award, as modified by SC in 2018.""If Karnataka fails to do so, it runs the risk of committing contempt of court,"" the bench said while rejecting Tamil Nadu's application.However, it said if the DPR gets approved by the CWC, then the states would be free to take steps as permitted under the law.Tamil Nadu, through senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, used strong words against Karnataka and tried every possible argument to persuade the top court to stop the detailed project report's preparation.The bench said the CWDT award has allocated the share of water between the two states and the Union territory of Puducherry, and that whether the Mekedatu project is constructed or not, Karnataka is bound to release of 177 tmcft water to TN as per the SC judgment.Rohatgi said, ""Karnataka is the upper riparian state. It wants to construct the dam and control the flow of water to Tamil Nadu. The dam will have the key for release of water to TN."" The bench said that if Karnataka does not release water as per the judgment, it would face contempt of court proceedings.Tamil Nadu said it has had a water dispute with Karnataka for the last 50 years and that it cannot trust that state on equitable sharing of Cauvery water. The bench asked, ""If Karnataka is constructing the dam without affecting TN's water share, how can TN oppose the project?""When the bench said the DPR is yet to be finalised and wanted to know how Tamil Nadu could oppose at this premature stage, TN said, ""The mechanism for complaint against not honouring the water share decree is such that it will take a complaint months to be addressed. That is why we want to nip the problem in the bud.""Appearing for Karnataka, senior advocate Shyam Divan and advocate general Shashi Kiran Shetty told the court the state will utilise its share of Cauvery water for the purpose of storage in Mekedatu dam, which is to provide drinking water to the burgeoning city of Bengaluru and generate 400 MW of electricity. The dam would not impede the flow of water to Tamil Nadu, they assured.","Supreme Court rejects Tamil Nadu's strident opposition to Karnataka's proposed multi-purpose Mekedatu project. The court said Karnataka is bound to release TN's share of water as per the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) award, as modified by SC in 2018.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125313991,imgsize-49878,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The origins of the 'Faridabad' module - with tentacles extending to UP and beyond - lay in Jaish-e-Muhammed and Pakistan's ISI 's larger plan, hatched almost four years ago, to raise and nurture a ""homegrown"" outfit in India on the lines of Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind. The aim was to carry out attacks on the instructions of Pakistani handlers while allowing them deniability before the international community.Sources in security agencies told TOI that after AGUH - an al-Qaida offshoot - became almost defunct following neutralisation of its chief Zakir Musa in 2019, ISI turned to Jaish chief Maulana Masood Azhar to help build a similar outfit with radicalised youths not just from Kashmir, where local terror recruitments have dropped to single digits, but also from other parts of India.The plan was to have Kashmiris in leadership roles, who would then use encrypted platforms like Telegram to identify, radicalise and recruit members.The first link in the ISI-Jaish plan was established by Pak-based operative Umar bin Khattab, alias Hanjullah, who connected with Maulvi Irfan Waghay, a cleric from Shopian. Irfan, who had radicalised several youths over the years, offered to help create the pan-India outfit.He roped in Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, bringing him into the JeM mission, and used his Deoband connections to spread the network further.Dr Muzammil expanded the chain by recruiting his colleagues at Al Falah University. Both Dr Adeel and his brother Muzaffar were contacted; while Adeel joined the plan, Muzaffar switched allegiance to al-Qaida and is believed to be in Afghanistan. Muzammil also brought in Dr Shaheen Shahid and her brother Dr ParvezAnsari.""Muzammil, Adeel and Umer were constantly in touch on Telegram with three Pakistani handlers, Faisal, Hashim and Ukasha, who sent them instructions, radicalisation material and bomb-making videos,"" an officer said.The radicalisation and recruitment drive aimed to build a strong, educated cadre capable of operating discreetly across India. ""Zakir Musa himself was a BTech dropout. Al Falah provided the perfect platform to tap students and faculty for recruitment,"" an officer said, adding that separatist elements like Dr Nisar-ul-Hassan, sacked from a Srinagar college over terror links, were embedded there.Members of the homegrown Jaish-backed network were encouraged to generate funds through their salaries or religious donations such as zakat, while Jaish supplemented them via hawala.Over the past two years, after gaining organisational strength, operatives began sourcing explosives and bomb components. Around 2,900 kg of IED-making material was amassed by Dr Muzammil, Dr Adeel, and Dr Umar Un Nabi, and stored with the help of Mewat cleric Hafiz Mohd Ishtiak. Agencies suspect more such dumps exist.""It is possible that Dr Umer hurriedly assembled the car bomb using the instructional videos sent by Pakistan-based handlers. The device was crudely made, which limited its impact.

The land deal controversy

Activist’s allegations and demand

Pawar’s defence and political response

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday responded to activist Anjali Damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged Rs 300-crore land deal in Pune, saying he would “use his conscience” before making any decision.A company linked to his son, Parth Pawar is at the centre of the controversy surrounding the purchase of government-owned land in Pune’s Mundhwa area.The state government has since scrapped the deal and ordered an inquiry led by senior IAS officer Vikas Kharge.“I will use my conscience and take a decision,” Pawar told reporters in Pune when asked about Damania’s resignation demand, news agency PTI reported.The controversy involves around 40 acres of government land, reportedly valued at Rs 1,800 crore, which was sold to Amadea Enterprises LLP, a firm in which Parth Pawar holds a 99% partnership for Rs 300 crore. Following allegations of irregularities, the government cancelled the sale deed and suspended several officials.Revenue minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule confirmed that FIRs have been registered against three individuals involved in the transaction but said Parth Pawar’s name was not included, as it did not appear in the sale deed.However, the firm has been issued a notice to pay double stamp duty of Rs 42 crore to complete the cancellation process.Bawankule added that activist Anjali Damania met him on Wednesday and submitted documents related to the case.“I have told her that if she has any proofs, she can submit them to the inquiry committee,” he said, assuring that the probe would be free from interference.Anjali Damania accused Ajit Pawar of shielding his son and said a fair probe cannot happen while he remains in office, news agency United News of India (UNI) reported.“As long as Ajit Pawar is in power, a fair investigation is impossible. He must step down from both posts. Parth Pawar holds a 99% stake in the firm and yet no FIR has been registered against him,” Damania told reporters.She urged the state to register a case against Parth and ensure transparency in the inquiry.The deputy chief minister has denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations “random accusations” raised before local body elections. He maintained that Parth was unaware the land was government-owned.“I still don’t understand how a document can be registered without even a rupee being exchanged. The truth will come out soon,” he said.He also said he had already briefed chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and welcomed the inquiry.“If anyone close to me has done something wrong, I will never support it. I have told the Chief Minister to order a probe,” Pawar said. He added that the issue was “a lesson” for his son to be more cautious in future dealings.Meanwhile, minister Bawankule reiterated that the inquiry would continue independently under ACS Vikas Kharge.Bawankule said the officer heading the inquiry is honest and that there will be no interference in the investigation.","M Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar responds to activist Anjali Damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged Rs 300-crore land deal in Pune.

Indian Air Force Opens Nyoma Airbase In Ladakh, A Strategic Game-Changer Along The China Frontier

Nyoma airbase underwent Rs 230cr upgrade

NEW DELHI: In a major booster shot for military capabilities in eastern Ladakh, India on Wednesday operationalised its new Nyoma airbase close to the frontier with China, even as a large Army exercise called 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' is now under way in Arunachal Pradesh on the eastern front.The developments at the opposite ends of the 3,488-km LAC underscore the high military readiness being maintained along the China frontier. ""There is ongoing reset in bilateral diplomatic ties. Military CBMs are also being progressively strengthened but the trust deficit on the ground remains high,"" a senior officer told TOI. ""With no de-escalation along LAC, troops will continue to be forward deployed for 6th successive winter since multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020,"" he said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself flew a C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi to the Mudh airfield at Nyoma, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, to formally inaugurate the strategically located airbase. He was accompanied by Western Air Command chief Air Marshal Jeetendra Mishra.Located just about 35 km from the LAC, Nyoma has undergone an upgrade worth Rs 230 crore, which included extending the original airstrip into a 2.7-km 'rigid pavement' runway, a new ATC complex, hangars, crash bay and accommodation, as was earlier reported by TOI.The Mudh airfield is now fully capable of handling and sustaining operations by heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. Primarily, it will help quickly rush troops, weapons and supplies to areas such as Pangong Tso, Demchok and Depsang in eastern Ladakh.The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026 though high altitude will be a limiting factor. China has assiduously upgraded all its airbases facing India over the last five years to offset the terrain constraints due to high-altitude and rarefied air, which limits the weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.China now has additional fighters, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters, as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones deployed at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping. It has also built many new heliports all along the LAC.In the far reaches of the Eastern Himalayas, thousands of soldiers from the 3 Spear Corps of the Indian Army, along with elements of IAF, ITBP and others, are now also engaged in the 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' exercise in the high-altitude terrain of Mechuka and other areas of Arunachal Pradesh.From airlift and force projection to mountain warfare manoeuvres and multi-domain integrated operations, the exercise aims at validating rapid mobilisation, operational logistics and precision-strike capabilities. ""The right force must reach the right place at the right time during conflicts,"" an officer said.While Nyoma will be another operational base for the IAF in Ladakh after Leh, Kargil and Thoise airfields and the Daulat Beg Oldie ALG (advanced landing ground), India has also progressively upgraded the infrastructure at ALGs like Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, civil ALGs in the middle sector (Uttarakhand, Himachal) of the LAC are also now being increasingly used for military purposes.","IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh flew a C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi to the Mudh airfield at Nyoma, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers

'H-1B flawed but America needs the best of other countries'







Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said his words on H-1B were taken out of context as he drew flak for defending the visa program that steals American jobs. President Donald Trump's recent statement that America needs certain talents from foreign countries reignited the H-1B row once again, and this time Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are not in the picture, like they were in 2024. MAGA is now openly revolting against Trump, claiming that they didn't vote for H-1B.Ben Shapiro came under attack as he was seen defending the visa program. But he later said that his words were taken out of context, as he was explaining how labor is connected with the affordability issues and if companies move out of the US, no American gets a job.Shapiro said there are indeed some positions that require people from outside because American universities are not producing graduates with that particular skill in enough numbers. Shapiro called it the shortcomings of the education system. ""We should absolutely up our game educationally but in the meantime, if you do not bring people into tech, tech will go find the labor supply. So in an office, there are 30 Americans and 3 H-1B visa people, but if the cost goes too high, the company goes elsewhere, hires 30 Indians and 0 Americans,"" Shapiro said.Citing the example or Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella, Ben Shapiro said America needs the best of other countries. The process of determining the best can be improved and H-1B might be flawed, Shapiro said, asserting that brain-draining other countries is good for America. Shapiro added that there should be the precondition that these foreigners assimilate with American values, they should like America and become American patriots.Shapiro defended Donald Trump's latest stand on H-1B and got canceled by MAGA who told him that he has no idea what scam H-1B is.",Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said his words on H-1B were taken out of context as he drew flak for defending the visa program that steals American jobs.

Bahraini woman reaches Captain status

Who is Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood?

Why does the A380 matter?

Bahraini women in aviation

Inspiration for the next generation





For the Kingdom of Bahrain, the year marks a soaring new chapter in its history books. Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood has landed an unprecedented achievement, becoming the nation's first female Captain to command the majestic Airbus A380. Taking the controls of the world's largest passenger aircraft, Captain Al Qaood has not only validated her own mastery of complex flight technology but has also symbolically lifted her entire country onto a global stage, demonstrating Bahrain's commitment to nurturing pioneering female leadership in one of the most demanding professions on Earth.The skies have a new commander, and she hails from the Kingdom of Bahrain. Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood has officially achieved the ultimate dream of commercial pilots: the prestigious rank of Captain. What makes this an extraordinary milestone is the aircraft she commands—the colossal Airbus A380. Captain Al Qaood is the first woman from Bahrain to reach this elite status while piloting the world’s largest commercial passenger jet.This achievement follows a rigorous and demanding journey.Reaching Captain status requires accumulating thousands of flight hours, passing complex technical examinations, and demonstrating flawless command ability—skills proven by Captain Al Qaood on one of the most sophisticated machines ever built.Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood's historic ascent to the command seat of the Airbus A380 is a defining moment for Bahrain and the Arab world, marking a major triumph for women in professional aviation. As a proud Bahraini national, her achievement is uniquely significant because she is the first woman from the Kingdom to achieve the rank of Captain while piloting the colossal A380, the world's largest commercial aircraft. While other pioneering women, such as Captain Yasmeen Fraidoon, previously broke the barrier by becoming Bahrain's first female Captains on smaller fleet aircraft, Captain Al Qaood has taken that legacy to the ultimate level of complexity and scale.Her success is the culmination of years of rigorous, demanding technical training and thousands of hours flying in the sky, positioning her not merely as a remarkably skilled pilot, but as a global inspiring symbol of the ambitious, highly-trained female workforce that is steadily shattering traditional barriers throughout the modern Gulf region.To truly grasp the scale of Captain Al Qaood’s achievement, one must understand the significance of the Airbus A380, often nicknamed the ""Superjumbo."" It represents the pinnacle of commercial aviation engineering, and commanding it is a globally recognized feat of skill.The A380 is a double-decker giant that demands exceptional expertise:Unmatched Scale: It is the largest passenger plane in operation, weighing nearly 600 tonnes at takeoff and carrying over 500 passengers.Technical Mastery: Its complex systems require a Captain who possesses not only piloting skills but also superior crew resource management and emergency procedure expertise.The Elite Few: The number of pilots, particularly women, qualified to command this massive aircraft is incredibly small, placing Captain Al Qaood in an elite global cohort of aviators.Her position is a powerful testament to her technical precision and ability to lead a crew responsible for hundreds of lives.Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood’s achievement is the latest in a line of groundbreaking firsts for Bahraini women in the air, showing a consistent national commitment to female empowerment in the aviation sector.First Captains: Captain Al Qaood follows in the footsteps of pioneers like Captain Yasmeen Fraidoon, who became Gulf Air's first female Bahraini Captain on the national carrier's fleet (Airbus A320s/A330s). Captain Al Qaood's achievement extends this legacy to the A380.Military Milestones: In 2018, Sheikha Aisha bint Rashid Al Khalifa made history as the Kingdom's first female fighter pilot, flying a BAE Hawk.Engineering Excellence: Pioneering women like Hend Al Awadhi were the first female aircraft engineers, ensuring the safety of the fleet from the ground up.Captain Al Qaood’s command of the A380 is a symbol that the glass ceiling for women in the Gulf is not just cracked—it’s been completely shattered at the cruising altitude of 43,000 feet.Captain Al Qaood’s success is a direct, visible call to action for young women across the Middle East. Her journey is proof that dedication, passion, and rigorous training open doors to the most challenging and rewarding careers, regardless of background.By taking the ultimate seat on the ultimate jet, she has provided a powerful narrative: the complex technical fields of science and aviation are fully accessible. Her legacy, flying the world’s largest commercial aircraft, serves as a beacon of possibility, ensuring that the future of aviation is increasingly diverse and female-led.","Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood is the first woman from Bahrain to reach this elite status while piloting the world’s largest commercial passenger jet.

BENGALURU: A 23-year-old techie was arrested and remanded to judicial custody at the central prison on charges of attempting to murder a couple and their son by ramming his car into their two-wheeler, in a case of road rage.Sukruth Gowda lives with his parents at Balaji Layout, Kodigehalli, and works at a software company in Whitefield.

NEW DELHI: The city's air quality remained in the severe category for the third consecutive day on Thursday. It was also the third day on the trot that the Centre's Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS), clearly underestimating the pollution levels, missed its mark after forecasting the air to be ‘very poor'.The average air quality index (AQI), on a scale of 0 to 500, was recorded at 404. It was better than Wednesday's 418, but above the threshold of very poor.On Tuesday, AQI peaked to a season-high 428, prompting Commission for Air Quality Management to invoke stage-3 measures of graded response action plan for the first time this season.In its daily bulletin on Thursday, EWS again predicted that AQI will be in the very poor zone from Friday to Sunday.""The outlook for the subsequent six days shows the air is likely to hover between very poor and severe,"" it said.EWS operates under Union ministry of earth sciences and is managed by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune. The institute also runs decision support system (DSS) that measures the share of pollutants, including those emanating from stubble burning, in the city's air.IITM officials did not comment on the AQI forecasts missing their mark.Experts called for a detailed review of the forecasting model. ""DSS and EWS are reliant on an older emissions inventory. So, though dynamic weather forecasts are in place, the overall end-product is inaccurate,"" said Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst at Envirocatalysts, an environmental think tank.On Thursday, Delhi was among the worst polluted cities in the country after Bahadurgarh (AQI at 466) and Rohtak (430). Since Tuesday, slow wind and the falling mercury caused a temperature inversion in the capital, preventing pollutants from dispersing.CPCB data revealed that 28 of Delhi's 39 active ambient air quality monitoring stations were in the severe category. The worst-affected locations included Wazirpur at an AQI of 458, Chandni Chowk at 453 and Bawana at 452.Last Nov, the city recorded eight severe air days, with AQI peaking at 494 on the 18th. There were nine such days in Nov 2023, three a year before, 11 in 2021 and nine in 2020.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president at Skymet, said the wind speed was between 5-7 km/hr during Thursday and fell at night, while the minimum temperature was 10.6°C, nearly three notches below normal. ""The wind was expected to marginally pick up, but that did not happen,"" he said, adding no significant changes in meteorological conditions are expected.The maximum temperature was 26.3°C, two notches below normal, and is likely to be between 24 and 26°C on Friday. The minimum is expected to fall further to 9-11°C on Friday.DSS data indicated that stubble burning contributed 12% of Delhi's pollution on Thursday, down from a season-high of 22.4% a day earlier, 15.5% on Tuesday and 13.7% on Monday.

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half.

SEBI’s advisory in digital gold



Read SEBI’s advisory here:



SEBI has enabled investments in gold and gold related instruments through various SEBI regulated gold products. These are exchange traded commodity derivative contracts, Gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) offered by Mutual Funds and Electronic Gold Receipts (EGRs) tradeable on stock exchanges. Investments in these SEBI regulated gold products can be made through SEBI registered intermediaries and are governed by the regulatory framework prescribed by SEBI.

It has come to the notice of SEBI that some digital/online platforms are offering investors to invest in ""Digital Gold/E-Gold Products'. Digital Gold is being marketed as an alternative for investment in physical gold.

In this context, it is informed that such digital gold products are different from SEBI regulated gold products as they are neither notified as securities nor regulated as commodity derivatives. They operate entirely outside the purview of SEBI. Such digital gold products may entail significant risks for investors and may expose investors to counterparty and operational risks.

Investors/ participants are made aware that none of the investor protection mechaims under securities market purview shall be available for investments in such Digital Gold/ E-Gold products.





Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath has now issued a cautionary note for the investors following SEBI’s recent advisory on digital gold. For those unaware, earlier this week SEBI issued a an advisory on digital gold calling it an unregulated and inefficient way to gain exposureto the precious metal. Now Kamath shared a post of social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) advising the users to not to go after digital gold and instead opt for the one of the safest and easiest ways — gold ETFs if they want to inset in gold. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” wrote Kamath.In a post shared on X, Kamath emphasised that digital gold is not regulated by any financial authority, which means that investors have limited recourse if the platforms selling it collapse or default. He noted that most buyers are unaware of this regulatory gap. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” Kamath wrote.Along with this, Kamath also pointed out the high upfront costs associated with digital gold purchases such as a 3% GST, plus 2–3% in spreads, which in tern means that the investors will lose another 6% immediately after buying digital gold, even before the regulatory risks kick in.Kamath also said that with Sovereign Gold Bonds going away, the only safest and easiest way to invest in gold is through gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Now that Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) have stopped, gold ETFs remain one of the safest and easiest ways to get exposure to gold,’ Kamath.The remarks made by Kamath align with the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) recent warning about the risks of investing in digital gold. SEBI cautioned that these products are not covered under its regulatory framework and urged investors to exercise due diligence.","Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath has issued a cautionary note for the investors following SEBI’s recent advisory on digital gold.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

The medium to long-term trend of the market will be dictated by fundamentals, particularly the earnings growth. On this front there is room for optimism as indicated by prospects of robust GDP growth and improving earnings growth. ”“India’s underperformance this year is unlikely to last. It is important to understand that despite the big underperformance of Nifty, so far this year, Nifty continues to be the best performing index among the large markets of the world during the last 5-year period.The dip in corporate earnings in FY25 and the elevated valuations have been weighing on the market this year. This market construct is set to change for the better, going forward. ”US equities declined on Thursday, particularly in Nvidia and AI-related stocks, as investors reduced rate cut expectations amid inflation concerns and mixed views from central bankers about US economic conditions.Asian equities declined at Friday's opening following Wall Street's retreat, influenced by Fed rate cut uncertainty and high technology stock valuations.Foreign portfolio investors offloaded shares worth Rs 384 crore on Thursday, whilst domestic institutional investors purchased Rs 3,092 crore net.","While Nifty50 was below 25,800, BSE Sensex was down almost 300 points.

St Louis Fed president Alberto Musalem said the bank should show “caution”, adding that “there’s limited room for further easing without monetary policy becoming overly accommodative”.Investors are also waiting for key economic data, including jobs and inflation numbers, that were delayed because of the record-length shutdown.Concerns about interest rates come at the same time as worries that tech stocks may be overpriced.

‘Deport Him…’: Team Trump Moves To Strip Mamdani Of US Citizenship After NYC Win

New York will survive, but will get worse before it gets better







Billionaire real estate investor Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai as he pledged to freeze rents because tenants' incomes have stagnated. Sternlicht who has both commercial and residential holdings in NYC said when one neighbor finds out that their neighbor is not paying, they stop paying and thus NYC will turn into Mumbai.“Over $100 million, every project in New York has to go union, and it’s super expensive. It leads to extremely expensive housing. And other developers have tried to cut deals with the unions, but they rule New York, and that’s one of the key reasons the blue states are so expensive and they’re so difficult to add supply of housing to,” Sternlicht said in an interview with CNBC Property Play, reacting to Mamdani's win.“And then the far left gets really nuts and says the tenants don’t have to pay. Well, you can’t kick them out if they don’t pay. So the neighbor finds out the neighbor isn’t paying, and they don’t pay, and the next guy doesn’t pay, and then you’re basically going to turn New York City into Mumbai,"" he said.Sternlicht said his New York team is considering leaving the city as well.“The core issues are not what he’s focusing on. We need to increase housing.That’s not going to happen easily, right? You need serious subsidies from the government if they want us to work with unions. The unions have to be more accommodative on their work laws and the wages and everything else, otherwise you can’t add economically,"" he said. Sternlicht said rent freezing is not the solution but increasing housing is.Sternlicht said he believed New York will survive but will first gets a lot worse before it gets better. “People are working really hard. Just how do we help others to do well and believe in the American dream? That’s probably a better message for a leader in the city than saying, let’s just tax everyone who’s been successful, force them to leave and then have to rely on Washington for handouts to basically keep the city going,” Sternlicht added.","Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai.

Beyond its economic significance, AMAALA promises an unparalleled fusion of regenerative tourism, wellness experiences, and world-class hospitality.AMAALA, derived from the Arabic word for hope, is nestled across three naturally occurring bays where the Hijaz Mountains meet the Red Sea. The destination offers a new approach to coastal luxury, with a focus on wellness, rejuvenation, and connection to nature. Its guiding principle is simple: to help guests and residents “live longer, better,” whether through tranquil retreats or adventure-filled experiences along the sun-drenched coastline.John Pagano, Group CEO of Red Sea Global, underscores the ambition: AMAALA is envisioned as the new home of wellness, drawing inspiration from Saudi Arabia’s long-standing traditions of retreat and renewal. The destination is designed to balance high-end luxury with environmental and cultural stewardship.AMAALA’s launch will introduce six world-class resorts, alongside a yacht club, marine life institute, state-of-the-art marina, and a Marina Village. A 5km linear park, the Wellness Route, will connect the resorts and experiences, allowing visitors to traverse pristine natural surroundings seamlessly.Additional first-phase attractions include Corallium, a three-level marine life institute highlighting the Red Sea’s biodiversity, and the AMAALA Hotel, offering 144 keys and multiple dining options for staff and guests alike.AMAALA is integral to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. Red Sea Global anticipates the project will create 50,000 jobs and contribute SAR 11 billion (USD 3 billion) to the national GDP upon completion. Phase One alone involved an investment of SAR 51.04 billion, encompassing nine resorts and over 1,600 keys. Future openings include the Clinique La Prairie Health Resort, Jayasom Wellness Resort, and The Ritz-Carlton Resort.The destination also promotes sustainable development at a global scale. Designed to host no more than 500,000 visitors annually, AMAALA aims to achieve a 30% net conservation benefit to local ecosystems by 2040. The development is fully powered by renewable energy, preventing the emission of 350,000 tCO₂e each year.Guests can now easily reach AMAALA via the Red Sea International Airport, now offering direct flights from Doha, Dubai, Jeddah, and Riyadh. Transfers to the resorts will be conducted in luxury electric vehicles, with additional convenient European routes imminent. AlWajh Airport is scheduled to fully reopen in 2026, further enhancing regional accessibility and connectivity.Red Sea Global, wholly owned by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, is a multi-project developer committed to regenerative tourism. The company prioritises environmental protection, community upliftment, and sustainable economic growth. AMAALA exemplifies this vision, combining luxury development with environmental stewardship, cultural heritage preservation, and socio-economic impact.The project reflects RSG’s broader ambition to demonstrate how luxury tourism can be both world-class and responsible, serving as a model for destinations globally while actively contributing to the wellbeing of communities and ecosystems.","AMAALA, derived from the Arabic word for hope, is nestled across three naturally occurring bays where the Hijaz Mountains meet the Red Sea.

Amrutesh Vallabhaneni, an H-1B visa holder in the US, has brought a lawsuit against his employer, accusing the company of forced labor, labor trafficking and withholding visa documents, Breitbart News reported. Jay Palmer, Vallabhaneni's consultant who prepared the lawsuit, said it is a Squid Game for Indian workers in the US job market, as the ultimate goal is to stay in America, surviving the exploitative culture, created by Indian CEOs.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers



Users hit back with income, education and mockery

“If they are so low IQ, why do they keep getting hired to fix everything Americans cannot”

“This tweet has the same IQ as the number she thinks India has.”

“Americans are smarter? Girl, half your country cannot find India on a map.”

“Before we debate nations, what is your IQ score? Asking for evidence.”

“If just ten percent of Indians have an IQ over 120, that is 140 million people. Good luck competing with those numbers.”

“You are comparing America’s average to India’s elite. That is not a debate. It is comedy.”

“Kids from slums are scoring higher than the average 76 you googled.”

“We do not have enough doctors, engineers or coders. But sure, let us debate IQ instead of reality.”

“Young Americans want influencer careers, not STEM. Somebody has to do the hard work and it is not you.”

“If Americans are so smart, why does every major tech company have Indians running key divisions”

“America’s problem is not IQ. It is effort.”



The larger picture: Data over slogans





A MAGA activist has ignited a political and cultural firestorm after claiming “Americans are smarter than Indians” in a viral post arguing that the United States should fix its own education system rather than rely on H-1B workers from India. Lauren Witzke’s message, built on disputed IQ figures and an appeal to American exceptionalism, has instead triggered a wave of data-led rebuttals, mockery and resignations to the reality that high-skilled immigration remains critical to the US workforce.Witzke’s original claim leaned on IQ estimates often attributed to the controversial work of Richard Lynn, asserting an American average IQ of 98 versus India’s 76.She argued that if the US “allegedly doesn’t have the talent” to build advanced defence technologies, the solution lies in fixing American schools, not “importing India” through “endless H-1B visas.”The rant directly countered President Trump’s 12 November 2025 defence of the H-1B programme as essential for specialised defence roles. It also collided with decades of data showing Indian H-1B recipients are among the most elite and economically successful immigrant groups in modern US history.Many of the strongest pushbacks came from users armed with hard numbers. Respondents highlighted that Indian Americans have the highest median household income in the US, often between 100,500 dollars and 126,891 dollars, nearly double the national average. Others noted that Indian Americans have some of the lowest crime rates and a bachelor’s degree attainment of over 70 percent compared to the US average of 28 percent.Several users mocked the contradiction in Witzke’s argument. One wrote:The tension between national pride and economic need surfaced repeatedly, mirroring the broader 2025 debate around immigration, sovereignty and global competitiveness.In the end, Witzke’s argument was undercut not by partisanship but by data. Indian H-1B workers are not average representatives of India. They are highly selected, highly educated and disproportionately successful. Meanwhile, the US continues to face shortages in engineering, healthcare and advanced technology sectors, shortages that cannot be solved quickly by domestic reform alone.The backlash to Witzke’s post reflects a broader truth. In an interconnected world, IQ talking points and nationalist slogans struggle against the reality of labour markets, demographic scale and global competition."," MAGA activist Lauren Witzke sparked a firestorm after claiming “Americans are smarter than Indians” in a viral post.

HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor

A call for New Yorkers from all walks of life

Early appointments signal direction



A victory that jolted the political establishment

Fundraising numbers add to the momentum



What comes next for the 50,000?





New York City’s incoming mayor Zohran Mamdani has sparked an extraordinary wave of interest before even stepping into City Hall. His transition team revealed that more than 50,000 people have already applied through the official portal, transition2025.com, hoping to secure a role in the administration he promises will put working people at the centre of city governance. The portal launched on 5 November 2025, making the surge all the more striking given the short timeframe.For Mamdani, the overwhelming applicant pool is not merely a hiring challenge. He views it as proof that the grassroots energy behind his campaign has continued into the transition. In a written statement, he described the response as “the excitement at the heart of this movement,” presenting the numbers as evidence that thousands believe in the possibility of a more affordable and more equitable New York.His transition’s executive director, Elana Leopold, shared the same view and called the 50,000 applicants a sign of the strength and momentum behind the incoming administration.The transition team has invited applicants from a wide range of backgrounds, from policy veterans and experienced civil servants to community organisers and early-career hopefuls. Mamdani’s message has remained consistent: anyone committed to his affordability agenda is welcome to contribute.The team is co-chaired by five women, including former City Hall officials and a former Federal Trade Commission chair. Their leadership reflects significant experience in public service and regulatory oversight. The team has explained that applications remain open as they search for candidates to fill roles in policy development, community engagement, administration and citywide service delivery.Mamdani has already begun building his senior leadership. Dean Fuleihan, a former First Deputy Mayor with significant fiscal and administrative experience, has been appointed once again to the same role. Elle Bisgaard-Church, who served as Mamdani’s campaign manager and his chief of staff in the Assembly, has been named Chief of Staff. Her appointment reflects continuity within his core political team.Mamdani has also expressed interest in retaining the current NYPD Commissioner, Jessica Tisch. Discussions are still underway and no final decision has been announced. Public safety and policing remain among the most closely watched areas of the transition.Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist and state assemblyman from Queens, surprised political observers by winning the city’s mayoral election on 4 November. His campaign focused on tenant protections, transit investment and the growing cost of living. These priorities drew national attention and helped him build a broad coalition of supporters.The surge of applicants suggests significant enthusiasm for his approach, including interest from outside New York City.The hiring interest comes at the same time as another notable figure. The transition committee raised more than 517,000 dollars from more than 7,000 donors in under 30 hours. The donor count alone exceeded the first-term transitions of Eric Adams and Bill de Blasio combined. This level of support highlights the scale of public engagement with Mamdani’s victory.The combination of rapid fundraising and a high volume of applications has strengthened the view that Mamdani’s election represents both a political shift and a movement that wants to be involved in governing.Although the interest has been extraordinary, the timeline for hiring remains unclear. The transition team has not yet stated when formal appointments will begin or how many positions will ultimately be available.For now, one thing is evident. The Zohran Effect has created a rare situation in which an incoming administration has far more enthusiastic applicants than available roles. This level of civic engagement is likely to shape the early months of Mamdani’s tenure as he prepares to take office.","More than 50,000 people have already applied through the official portal, transition2025.com.

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

Prices surge, tandoors punished

Trade paralysis and a deepening food crisis

Water shortage adds to worries – dams running dry





(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s twin cities are staring at a worsening flour emergency after the Punjab food department halted wheat supplies to mills in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, triggering panic across markets and raising questions over the country’s fragile food security. The sudden suspension has deepened an already tense economic climate, with transport blockades, water shortages and declining dam levels all feeding fears of another nationwide crisis.Dealers say all existing orders for flour, wheat and fine flour were cancelled from Friday night, leaving shops and tandoor owners without stock, PTI reported citing the The Express Tribune.The Rawalpindi Flour Mills Association, which held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, warned that “production will remain paralysed” unless wheat permits are restored immediately. The association described the ban as “ill-considered” and cautioned that shortages could spiral into a humanitarian emergency in the federal capital and adjoining regions.Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers. According to the Pakistan Naanbai Association, the price of a 79-kilogram sack of red flour has doubled to PKR 11,000 since the Shehbaz Sharif–Maryam Nawaz government took office.Fine flour, used widely for bread and bakery items, has risen from PKR 6,200 to PKR 12,600.The association’s president, Shafiq Qureshi, accused authorities of “state oppression”, claiming that dozens of tandoors have been demolished and nearly a hundred sealed for selling roti at higher prices in line with rising flour rates. Many owners have been fined between PKR 25,000 and PKR 50,000. “Instead of fixing the wheat supply, they are taking out their frustration on us,” Qureshi said, warning that families are being pushed to breaking point as bread becomes increasingly unaffordable.While wheat supply chokes Punjab’s food chain, Pakistan’s transport routes are already gridlocked due to deteriorating relations with Afghanistan. Thousands of trucks carrying food items, pharmaceuticals and export consignments for Afghanistan and Central Asia have been stranded at ports and highways.Senior Vice Chairman of the Goods Transport Association Imdad Hussain Naqvi said drivers are stuck without food, water or security. “This is not just a loss for transporters; it's a loss for the entire state,” he said, as quoted by PTI. He further warned that perishable goods are rotting on highways and thousands of workers are on the brink of starvation.The current wheat crisis comes months after India regulated flows from the Chenab following the Pahalgam terror attack. The move had contributed to a sharp drop in water levels at the country’s two key dams, Mangla and Tarbela.Pakistan is among six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use, worsening freshwater losses amid arid conditions, according to the World Bank’s first global water monitoring report, Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future.The study highlights that inefficient irrigation in drying regions—particularly in Pakistan, Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Thailand, Tunisia, and Romania—drives massive water waste, with more than two-thirds linked to water-intensive crops.","Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers.

A glimpse of the future at Manchester Airport





Building an “Intelligent” border





Results, reactions and next steps





Britain’s place in a global shift









The United Kingdom has begun trials of a “contactless” border control system, allowing British travellers to re-enter the country without presenting their passports. The technology, which uses facial recognition to verify identity, was tested over three weeks at Manchester Airport and marks a major step towards what officials call an “intelligent, frictionless border. ”Passengers arriving at Manchester Airport in October became the first to pass through Britain’s experimental contactless border. For three weeks, British passport holders were able to clear immigration without scanning their passports. Instead, their faces were matched against existing government databases through AI-driven facial recognition systems integrated into the familiar e-gates.Phil Douglas, director-general of Border Force, confirmed that the trial had “considerably reduced” processing times.He described the new experience succinctly: “People approach the e-gate, it recognises them as already on our database, and they’re checked through.” The system’s success has prompted officials to consider a wider rollout, signalling a potential transformation in how Britain manages its borders.Douglas said the Manchester trial forms part of a broader effort to modernise the UK’s borders. “The border has really changed over the last few years and that work is picking up pace,” he noted.Advances in artificial intelligence, biometrics and digital identity verification are now being combined with traditional checks such as passports and visas.Plans for the contactless border were first disclosed last year, when the Border Force outlined its ambition for an “intelligent border” designed to make crossings smoother while maintaining security. More than 270 e-gates are already in use across Britain’s airports and ports. Under new contracts, the number is set to expand, with Douglas stating: “It’s our intention that almost everybody will go through an e-gate of one description or another. ”While the technology promises faster movement, Douglas stressed the importance of preserving what he termed the “theatre” of the border—the visible sense that every traveller is still subject to scrutiny. “When people are crossing the border, they’re stopped, and it’s a moment they know they’re being checked,” he said. “New technology must not remove that feeling.”According to Douglas, the Manchester pilot demonstrated that the new system can sharply cut transaction times, making Britain’s border performance “compete pretty well with almost any other country.” Some airports, however, have raised an unusual concern: passengers are clearing border control so quickly that baggage reclaim areas risk becoming congested. “It has been said to me by some airports, ‘don’t get too fast, because then you’ll give us a problem at baggage collection’,” Douglas remarked.The contactless system remains limited to British passport holders for now, but the government intends to expand its reach. Over the past decade, e-gates have gradually been opened to arrivals from countries including Australia, Canada, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the United States. The new technology is expected to extend this inclusivity further, aligning the UK with international leaders in biometric border management.The trial places the UK alongside nations such as the United States, Australia and the United Arab Emirates, which have invested heavily in biometric border technology. Dubai, for instance, already permits contactless passage for citizens of 50 nationalities. Britain’s approach aims to meet this “gold standard,” positioning its border as one of the most technologically advanced in the world.Douglas contrasted the UK’s innovations with the European Union’s forthcoming Entry/Exit System, which will soon require British travellers to provide fingerprints and photographs upon each entry and exit. By comparison, the UK’s biometric recognition system seeks to simplify travel rather than add new layers of formality.","The UK has begun trials of a “contactless” border control system, allowing British travellers to re-enter the country without presenting their passports.

Honourable mentions







Turbulent times are ahead for the BBC as the search for the next director general begins following Tim Davie’s resignation, which came after the corporation broadcast a doctored version of Donald Trump’s Jan 6 speech that the White House condemned as misleading.With questions over bias dominating headlines and key funding talks approaching, BBC chair Samir Shah has urged a “smooth transition” as he begins the search for Davie’s successor, according to the Guardian.The BBC is under pressure on several fronts. Its news output is facing backlash and its audience habits are shifting. The next director general will need both a newsroom background and strong commercial experience. This has shaped a developing list of front-runners, some familiar from the last recruitment round and others newly in contention who could replace Davie, now the former director who served for over 20 years in BBC.One of the most talked-about names is former Channel 4 chief executive Alex Mahon, who was previously approached about the job but chose not to take part in the final shortlist. Mahon recently left Channel 4 after nearly eight years in charge, becoming the broadcaster’s first female chief executive and leading it through threats of privatisation, major restructuring and crises including the Russell Brand scandal.She has now become chief executive of Superstruct, a private equity-backed live entertainment company that runs events such as Boardmasters in Cornwall. The question is whether the chance to become the BBC’s first female director general would tempt her to leave her new role.Charlotte Moore, the BBC’s former director of content, was also a finalist last time. She oversaw a budget of £1 billion and helped deliver huge hits such as The Great British Bake Off, Luther and Bodyguard. Moore has recently taken over as chief executive of Left Bank Pictures, the Sony-owned studio behind The Crown. Her return to the BBC is considered possible but not guaranteed, given the timing of her new position.Jay Hunt, currently creative director for worldwide video and Europe at Apple TV Plus, is another strong contender. She has held senior positions at Channel 4, Channel 5 and the BBC, including editing the BBC’s flagship news programmes and later running BBC One. At Channel 4, she orchestrated the high-profile acquisition of The Great British Bake Off from the BBC, and at Apple she has overseen successes including Slow Horses. Her mix of news, entertainment and international streaming experience makes her stand out.ITV boss Carolyn McCall is said to be weighing up her future while exploring a possible sale of ITV’s television business to Comcast. She was approached for the BBC role previously and remains highly regarded, but after almost eight demanding years at ITV she may be reluctant to take on another exhausting challenge.Several names that surfaced in past searches are being discussed again. All3Media chief Jane Turton and former Sky executive Sophie Turner Laing were both approached previously. Turner Laing now leads the National Film and Television School’s board and has not held a major executive post in recent years, which could work against her.The 2020 shortlist also featured Will Lewis, now chief executive of the Washington Post. Allegations linked to the phone-hacking scandal, which he denies, are seen as making him a high-risk option for the BBC. Another former finalist, Doug Gurr, the one-time head of Amazon’s UK operations, currently serves as the interim chair of the Competition and Markets Authority.","The BBC is under pressure on several fronts. Its news output is facing backlash and its audience habits are shifting. The next director general will need both a newsroom background and strong commercial experience. This has shaped a developing list of front-runners, some familiar from last recruitment round and others newly in contention.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125231379,imgsize-745692,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"Hitler’s DNA reveals he possibly had a micropenis, one testicle and severe sexual-development issues",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/hitlers-dna-reveals-he-possibly-had-a-micropenis-one-testicle-and-severe-sexual-development-issues/articleshow/125309765.cms,"

What the DNA findings actually show





Dispelling myths about Hitler’s ancestry

Exploring possible neurodiverse and mental health indicators

How researchers obtained Hitler’s genetic material

What science can illuminate, and what it cannot





A new forensic genetic analysis featured in Channel 4’s documentary Hitler’s DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator is offering unprecedented scientific insight into Adolf Hitler’s biological and medical history. Using DNA recovered from blood-stained cloth taken from the sofa where Hitler died in 1945, researchers suggest he may have had multiple sexual-development abnormalities, including the possibility of a micropenis, an undescended testicle and Kallmann syndrome, a condition that disrupts hormonal development and puberty. The findings challenge long-circulated rumours while shedding fresh light on aspects of his life long shrouded in speculation.The genetic analysis indicates that Hitler likely carried markers associated with Kallmann syndrome, a congenital condition that affects reproductive development. Individuals with the disorder may experience reduced testosterone, lack of puberty, infertility and underdeveloped sexual organs.The researchers note that people with this condition have a one-in-ten chance of having a micropenis. While the DNA cannot confirm this definitively, the new evidence aligns with historical accounts suggesting Hitler may have had genital abnormalities.Stories from the First World War described ridicule from fellow soldiers, and a 1923 medical record discovered in 2015 documented that Hitler had an undescended testicle.Professor Turi King, the geneticist leading the study, said she approached the project with caution but believed it was important to carry out the work with scientific rigour. Her previous work identifying the remains of King Richard III lent credibility to the approach and methodology.The documentary also debunks one of the most persistent myths about Hitler: the rumour that he had Jewish ancestry. Genetic markers associated with that lineage were not found in the analysed sample. Historians have long argued there is no credible evidence for the claim, and the DNA results reinforce that conclusion.For a dictator who built policy around ideas of racial purity, the destruction of this myth is a significant historical clarification.The DNA analysis suggests Hitler showed elevated genetic markers linked to conditions such as autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, experts stress that these findings do not amount to a diagnosis. Genes can indicate predispositions but cannot determine behaviour, personality or moral choices.Dr Alex Tsompanidis, an autism researcher at the University of Cambridge, emphasised that no psychiatric label can be retroactively applied. He noted that environmental, social and personal factors play far larger roles in shaping behaviour than genetics alone.Professor Sir Simon Baron-Cohen warned that associating Hitler’s crimes with neurodiverse traits risks creating stigma. Most people with such conditions are neither violent nor cruel, he stressed, and many are empathetic and peaceful.The DNA sample used for the study originated from a blood-stained fabric cut by a US Army colonel from Hitler’s bunker sofa shortly after his death. Advances in forensic genetics made it possible to extract and sequence fragments of DNA decades later, though the researchers acknowledged the limitations of working with an aged and degraded sample.The scientific team verified the integrity of the material through multiple checks, following standards similar to those used in other historical forensic investigations.The new DNA analysis paints a clearer picture of Hitler’s possible medical conditions and helps separate biological fact from long-standing myth. It supports rumours about his sexual-development abnormalities, dismisses claims about Jewish ancestry and offers clues to potential neurodiverse markers.But the researchers are clear that genetics alone cannot explain the motivations or actions of one of history’s most destructive figures. Biology may influence development, but it does not predetermine cruelty or ideology.","DNA recovered from blood-stained cloth taken from the sofa where Hitler died in 1945.

Ultracheap and still duty-free

Millions of packages from China

Protecting consumers in the EU

EU authorities are not sitting still

EU countries are not sitting still either





When Chinese fast-fashion online retailer Shein opened its first boutique last week, there were both protests and a crowd of shoppers.The brick-and-mortar shop inside the BHV Marais department store in central Paris hit a nerve and not just because it is in the home of haute couture. It was a love-hate response to the company seen in many other areas.Shein, which is often put in the same category as the Temu online platform that allows manufacturers to sell much more than just fashion directly to consumers, has been criticized for things like counterfeits, aggressive marketing, poor working conditions, and unsafe products. Despite that, many are happy with more shopping options and the cheap prices.Though the two companies are different and have different business models, the result is often the same: a flood of cheap Chinese goods and the packaging to go along with it.Besides simply being ultracheap, another factor that played in the companies' favor is the European Union 's exemption from import duties for packages valued under €150 ($174).The US had a similar loophole for packages valued under $800 (€691), but has changed its regulations leading to a reduction in shipments.The EU is in the final stages of passing a similar rule to close its own low-value loophole, though it may not come into force until 2028.In the first half of 2025, Temu had an average of 115 million monthly active users in the EU and Shein had 145 million, according to their own numbers. For both platforms, this is around 12% more than the previous six months.One of the biggest concerns about these Chinese e-commerce platforms is sustainability. A majority of goods bought on their platforms are sent directly to consumers around the world from manufacturers in China. These individually packed goods are flown in for quick delivery and overwhelm customs authorities and often cannot be returned.Environmental groups are concerned about the clothing waste caused by cheap fast fashion, the plastic and cardboard packaging trash, plus the emissions from all those flights to move the goods around the world. And the numbers are indeed huge.In 2024, around 4.6 billion low-value items were imported into the EU, according to a report published in February by the EU executive Commission. That is twice the number in 2023 and more than triple the number in 2022.Of these 12 million packages a day, 91% are from China. Not all of these packages are from Temu or Shein, but together they have a huge share of the pie.""Europe is inundated by a tsunami of small parcels coming from China, and it's not about to stop,"" Agustin Reyna, director general of the Brussels-based European Consumer Organization (BEUC), told DW.Besides sustainability issues, consumer protection watchdogs and the European Commission have repeatedly warned of unsafe products that don't meet EU standards.New test results published on October 30 by Stiftung Warentest, an independent organization based in Berlin that specializes in product testing, reinforce what many fear.The tests, which were conducted with groups from Belgium and Denmark, showed dramatic results. Together, they looked into necklaces, USB chargers and baby toys.Of the 162 items purchased from manufacturers selling through Temu and Shein, 110 were not up to EU standards, and around a quarter were potentially dangerous. Some of the items had high levels of formaldehyde or heavy metals like cadmium. Some of the USB charges simply got too hot.The European Consumer Organisation thinks flouting safety regulations leads to unfair competition since some companies sell products that do not meet European safety standards, while local companies must follow such rules.In May, the EU Commission notified Shein about practices on its platform that infringe EU consumer law. Among the complaints are fake discounts, pressuring consumers to complete purchases, misleading information about consumers' legal rights, deceptive product labels and misleading sustainability claims.In July, the Commission preliminarily found that Temu is in breach of its obligations under the Digital Services Act by not doing enough to stop the sale of illegal products. Further investigations are ongoing and could lead to a large fine.In October, Germany's antitrust authority, the Cartel Office, initiated proceedings against Temu. They want to see if the platform is possibly influencing the pricing on its German online marketplace, including setting the final selling prices.In August, Shein was fined €1 million by Italy's competition authority for using misleading environmental claims.In July, Shein was fined €40 million by France's competition agency for misleading discounts and environmental claims. That brings total French fines for the company this year to €191 million.France has gone a step further and is working on new regulations for fast-fashion companies like Temu and Shein. If approved, it would ban their ads in France, force them to report on the environmental effects of their goods and add a levy of up to €10 for each garment bought.Big fines and more regulations may slow Chinese e-commerce giants but will not stop them.""Europe needs to get its act together and make Temu and Shein accountable,"" said Agustin Reyna. ""We need clear responsibilities and deterrent consequences when the products they sell break our rules.""To make this happen, the EU needs ambitious customs reform and market surveillance. But if the EU allows packages valued under €150 to come in duty-free until 2028, companies will continue to take advantage of the loophole and European customers will likely keep shopping.","In 2024, around 4.6 billion low-value items were imported into the EU, according to a report published in February.

Fujian Vs Ford: China Unveils Its Most Advanced Carrier, Reshaping Indo-Pacific Power Balance





PARIS: China's CO2 emissions remained flat in the third quarter as power generation from solar energy surged and electric car use continued to grow, a study showed on Tuesday.Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months, said the analysis published by climate news specialist Carbon Brief.""After the first three quarters of the year, China's CO2 emissions in 2025 are now finely balanced between a small fall or rise, depending on what happens in the last quarter,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.""A drop in the full-year total became much more likely after September, which recorded an approximately three percent drop in emissions year-on-year,"" said Myllyvirta, who is also a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute.The new analysis, which is based on official Chinese data, comes as the UN's COP30 climate conference kicked off in Brazil on Monday.""While an emission increase or decrease of one percent or less might not make a huge difference in an objective sense, it has heightened symbolic meaning,"" Myllyvirta said.""China's policymakers have left room for emissions to increase for several more years, leaving the timing of the peak open,"" he added.Emissions from the power sector, China's dominant source of CO2, remained flat in the third quarter despite strong demand for electricity, Myllyvirta said.Electricity generation from solar energy rose 46 percent while wind grew 11 percent compared to the same period last year.Emissions from transport fuel dropped by five percent, with declines also in cement and steel production.Oil demand and emissions grew elsewhere by 10 percent as the production of plastics and other chemicals surged, the analysis found.In September, China issued its first-ever absolute targets for cutting planet-warming gases.Under the new plan, China will reduce economy-wide emissions by seven to 10 percent by 2035 relative to the year of the country's peak emissions, believed to be 2025.China had previously pledged to peak its carbon output before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, without ever previously setting near-term numerical targets for total emissions reductions.","Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months.

A Chinese research vessel docked in the Cook Islands Saturday as it probed the Pacific nation's deep-sea mining potential, a fledgling industry of mounting interest to both Beijing and Washington.The Da Yang Hao docked in the palm-shaded port of Avatiu on a ""scientific research cruise"" through the tropical archipelago, the Cook Islands' Seabed Minerals Authority said.Huge areas of seabed around the Cook Islands are carpeted in polymetallic nodules, lumpy rocks studded with rare earths and critical minerals such as cobalt, nickel and manganese.The Cook Islands -- which lays claim to one of the world's biggest deposits of polymetallic nodules -- signed a contentious deep-sea mining cooperation deal with China earlier this year.""This cruise is about learning by doing,"" said Seabed Minerals Authority spokesman Edward Herman.""Our team is actively participating in all activities to build our knowledge and capacity in marine research.""This included mapping the seabed with sonar arrays and dredging up sediment samples, said the authority.Fringed by sparkling lagoons, South Pacific nation the Cook Islands has opened its vast ocean territory for deep-sea mining exploration.With existing supplies of critical minerals heavily exposed to trade disputes, both the United States and China have this year ramped up interest in the highly contentious industry.Critical minerals, such as cobalt and nickel, are in hot demand for electric vehicles, rechargeable batteries and advanced military technology.The United States secured its own agreement to pursue deep-sea mining research with the Cook Islands in August.- Deep-sea exploration -photos showed the near-100 metre (330 feet) Da Yang Hao vessel cutting through the Cook Islands' sleepy main harbour before docking on Saturday morning.The ship was emblazoned with the logo of China's Ocean Mineral Resources Research Association, which is tasked with the exploration of seabed minerals.Chinese research vessels have been accused of carrying out surveillance and other military activities under the auspices of scientific work.Pacific island nation Palau, a staunch US ally in the region, in 2021 alleged that the Da Yang Hao had entered its exclusive economic zone without proper permissions.The Da Yang Hao arrives in the Cook Islands less than one month after a deep-sea research voyage backed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.While exploration for deep-sea mining is far advanced, no company or nation has started production on a commercial scale.Critics fear deep-sea mining will smother marine life with waste and the noise of heavy machinery will disrupt oceanic migrations.International regulators are still trying to thrash out environmental rules governing the industry.sft/lb","Chinese research vessel docked in the Cook Islands Saturday.

SINGAPORE/BEIJING: When bank clerk Ren Yingxiao was looking for a honeymoon destination with her partner, they came across a scenic spot in the Xinjiang region that had it all - including a marriage registration office.""So we thought, why not go there and get our marriage certificate as well?"" the 30-year-old said about secluded Sayram Lake, where authorities are trying to attract young Chinese to tie the knot as part of a nationwide push to boost marriage rates and ease the country's demographic crisis.In May, China started allowing couples to get married anywhere in the country - instead of their place of residence - making the process more convenient and the event more special. Local govts have since started to scramble for marriage tourists, setting up registration offices around scenic spots, at music festivals - and even in subway stations, shopping malls and parks.For now, the effort is working. Marriages, which demographers use as a proxy for the country's birth rate, rose 22.5% from a year earlier to 1.61 million in the third quarter of 2025, putting China on track to halt a downtrend in annual nuptials, which has gone almost uninterrupted for more than a decade.Last year's 20.5% decline in marriages, to 6.1 million, was the biggest on record.In the eastern city of Nanjing, couples can get married at the Confucius Temple, where they can have a Ming Dynasty-themed ceremony. In southwestern Chengdu, authorities set up an office on the picturesque Xiling Snow Mountain at an altitude above 3,000 metres. In eastern Hefei, a marriage booth opened in a subway station whose name, Xingfuba, translates to ""the place of happiness."" And in Shanghai, couples can choose to get their certificate at a nightclub after appearing at a marriage registration office.In Beijing, 31-year-old lawyer Wang Jieyi and 33-year-old Zhan Yongqiang, a bank employee, registered their marriage at the Huguo Guanyin Temple. ""The Huguo Guanyin Temple was originally built to safeguard the peace and tranquility of the nation,"" Wang said. ""And also, in our traditional religious culture, the Guanyin Temple is associated with auspicious events like marriage and giving birth, symbolising happiness and well-being. "" The couple said the new policy didn't necessarily fast-track their plans to get married but it made the process more convenient as they both work in Beijing and no longer need to go back to their native Shandong province. ""It made our lives a little bit easier,"" said Wang.Demographer Yi Fuxian from the University of Wisconsin-Madison said the removal of geographic restrictions is making weddings easier in China, but expects the positive results to be ""short-lived."" With the population declining, Yi expects the number of women aged 20 to 34 to nearly halve to 58 million by 2050. Moreover, he expects young women - and their parents - to give priority to education and economic independence over marriage, in line with global trends.Reuters","In May, China started allowing couples to get married anywhere in the country - instead of their place of residence.
