US lawmakers questions FDAs drug inspection programme in India and China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-lawmakers-questions-fdas-drug-inspection-programme-in-india-and-china/articleshow/111244891.cms,"WASHINGTON: Three top American lawmakers have questioned the foreign drug inspection programme of the Food and Drug Administration in India and China. In a letter to FDA commissioner Robert Califf, the lawmakers on Monday wrote that the difference in inspection outcomes appears to be just another example of institutional weaknesses and dysfunction in the FDA's foreign drug inspection programme.The letter dated June 21 was written by House Energy and Commerce committee chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, subcommittee on health chair Brett Guthrie, and subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Chair Morgan Griffith following the analysis of the outcomes of FDA inspections in India and China from January 2014 to April 2024. ""The results of this analysis were surprising, revealing tremendous variation in inspection outcomes. Some FDA inspectors found compliance issues during all or almost all of their inspections. Other inspectors rarely reported finding a single compliance issue. Two inspectors never found a single compliance issue throughout a combined 24 inspections in India,"" they wrote.Another inspector found zero compliance issues in 20 out of 23 inspections (85 percent) in China while finding compliance issues in almost half of domestic inspections during the same period. These are unusual inspection outcomes, the opposite of what would be expected given the widely reported failures in quality control and lack of adherence to current good manufacturing techniques by drug manufacturing facilities in China and India, the lawmakers wrote.""By contrast, 16 FDA inspectors, with over 325 inspections collectively in India, found compliance issues during every inspection they conducted. As a measure of what a pattern of rigorous inspections should look like, the committee reviewed the inspection outcomes for 3 FDA inspectors with a professional reputation for thoroughness who also had at least 10 inspections in China or India during the studied period,"" they wrote.These expert inspectors reported finding no compliance issues during inspections in China at a rate of only 6.7 to 11.4 percent and at a rate of zero to 9.5 percent in India, they said, adding that such large variations in inspection outcomes are troubling, and they merit further investigation. At a minimum, the committee is concerned that these findings suggest vast differences in the skill, thoroughness, and competence of FDA inspectors.As such, the lawmakers pressed for more information regarding the agency's foreign drug inspection programme.","Three top American lawmakers have questioned the foreign drug inspection programme of the Food and Drug Administration in India and China.

"IB chief, NHRC secretary general get 1-year extension",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ib-chief-nhrc-secretary-general-get-1-year-extension/articleshow/111240765.cms,"Intelligence Bureau chief Tapan Kumar Deka

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday announced a one-year extension for Intelligence Bureau director Tapan Kumar Deka until June 30, 2025. This comes close on the heels of national security adviser Ajit Doval's reappointment as the national security adviser for a period co-terminus with that of the Narendra Modi govt.

The continuity in the higher echelons of the central security establishment under Modi govt 3.0 is being seen as crucial to the regime's keenness to move further on key priorities like countering terrorism in J&K that now has the Jammu region on target, holding J&K assembly polls peacefully, pushing back Maoists further in Left-wing-extremism-hit pockets, initiating talks with different communities in Manipur to end the ethnic strife, reaching a settlement with Nagas and tackling pro-Khalistan elements in Punjab.

Deka, a 1988 batch IPS officer belonging to Himachal Pradesh cadre, was appointed its director in June 2022. He has served in different security theatres, including LWE-hit areas, through his career in the premier central intelligence agency, and was instrumental in the strategy to defang Indian Mujahideen.

The Centre on Monday also gave a year's extension to secretary general of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Bharat Lal.

Indian Migrants Pay Rs 80 Lakh for New Illegal US Entry Routes via Charter Flights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/rs-80-lakh-new-routes-and-charter-flights-how-indian-are-trying-to-illegally-enter-into-us/articleshow/111193058.cms,"Here are some FAQs based on Reuters investigations:

What are the new routes for illegal migrants?

What triggered the investigation into these new routes?

What is the cost of these new smuggling routes?

How have US authorities responded to this new smuggling tactic?

What are the broader implications of these smuggling routes for US immigration policy?

How are these new routes avoiding traditional migration barriers?

What role does Nicaragua play in these smuggling operations?

What impact has this had on the passengers caught in these operations?

In a new phase of illegal immigration to the United States, migrants from India and other nations are paying smuggling networks substantial fees for travel packages that include airline tickets, bus rides, and hotel stays en route to the US-Mexico border .These routes involve charter flights to Central America, with migrants then traveling overland to the border.The Biden administration is working with regional governments and travel companies to curb this flow, revoking US visas for owners and executives of charter airlines and other companies suspected of facilitating smuggling.As per a Reuters investigation, one route starts in West Africa, with migrants paying up to $10,000 for multi-stop commercial flights to Nicaragua before continuing by land to the US. The second route, serving migrants from India, offers charter flights to Central America and overland transfers to the US border for between $72,000 and $96,000 per person, with full payment often due after arrival in the US.Nicaragua has emerged as a new entry point for many migrants, with President Daniel Ortega's government allowing individuals from anywhere in the world to fly directly in exchange for a cash payment. The US has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on Nicaraguan officials and sanctions on government-affiliated companies over irregular migration and repressive policies, the Reuters investigation found.On July 15, when a Legend Airlines Airbus A340 touched down at San Salvador airport after an 18-hour journey from the United Arab Emirates, the crew sensed something was amiss. Salvadoran officials, suspecting the nature of the flight, refused to connect the jet bridge, leaving approximately 300 passengers, all Indian nationals, stranded on the plane. According to three former crew members who spoke to Reuters anonymously, several passengers admitted their intentions to travel to Mexico and then cross into the US illegally.Salvadoran officials and their US counterparts grew suspicious after noticing an unusual pattern of charter flights arriving in El Salvador with Indian nationals who claimed to be tourists but had minimal luggage for extended stays. Nearly all passengers disembarking in San Salvador were later found to have crossed the US border illegally, the Reuters report said.According to Indian court documents and KT Kamariya, a deputy superintendent of police in Gujarat, India, migrants from India pay between 6 million ($72,000) and 8 million rupees ($96,000) for packages that include charter flights to Central America and overland transfers to the US border.The US administration has been collaborating with regional governments and travel companies to curb the flow of migrants. Measures include revoking U.S. visas for owners and executives of companies suspected of facilitating smuggling and warning commercial airlines to monitor passengers who might be intending to migrate illegally.These new routes complicate the enforcement of US immigration laws, especially as the Biden administration faces criticism and political pressure over high border crossings. The administration attributes the surge in migration to global economic and political instability, while opponents argue that current policies encourage illegal migration.The new smuggling routes bypass visa requirements for direct flights to Mexico and the dangerous Darien Gap trek between Colombia and Panama. Instead, migrants are flown to Central American countries like Nicaragua and El Salvador, from where they make overland journeys to the US border.Blas Nuñez-Neto, the US Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for Border and Immigration Policy, identified Nicaragua as a new entry point for many migrants. The Nicaraguan government, led by President Daniel Ortega, has been accused of exploiting migration flows by allowing anyone from around the world to enter the country in exchange for cash payments.Many migrants, like Gurpreet Singh from India, have faced multiple failed attempts to enter the US, often resulting in financial ruin and legal troubles. Singh, who paid $72,000 for a smuggling package, was deported from several countries and now faces forgery charges in India.","Migrants from India and other nations are paying smuggling networks substantial fees for travel packages that include airline tickets, bus rides, and hotel stays.

NTA NEET updates: 750 Students Skip NEET-UG Retest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/750-of-1563-students-skip-neet-ug-retest-nta/articleshow/111209526.cms,"CBI

files FIR over

alleged irregularities

in NEET-UG

Key developments since May 5 NEET exam

The CBI's involvement follows the education ministry's announcement to hand over the probe, a move that some protesting students had demanded. The CBI has registered a new case against unidentified individuals under Indian Penal Code sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating), among others.

The development comes after widespread protests and student litigation regarding paper leak claims. The accusations of irregularities led to protests in various cities, legal battles, and political disputes, with the opposition accusing the government of jeopardising students' futures.

Ten students have approached the Supreme Court, seeking directions for the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to investigate the alleged irregularities in NEET-UG. Their petition also requests that the Bihar Police expedite their investigation and submit a report to the apex court.

In another instance, the Supreme Court has asked the Center, the National Testing Agency (NTA), and others to respond to multiple petitions, including those calling for the cancellation of the NEET-UG 2024 exam and a court-monitored probe. The court has also paused proceedings on similar petitions in various high courts.

Following criticism over alleged discrepancies in various competitive exams, the central government has replaced NTA Director General Subodh Singh. Additionally, a seven-member panel led by former ISRO chief K Radhakrishnan has been established to review the NTA's functioning and suggest exam reforms.

NEW DELHI: National Testing Agency (NTA) on Sunday said that 750 of 1,563 students who were awarded grace marks skipped the retest conducted for NEET-UG candidates. Meanwhile,813 appeared for the retest after an order from the Supreme Court.The retest took place at seven centers. An official reported, “As many as 813 of the 1,563 candidates who were earlier awarded grace marks in NEET-UG appeared for a retest on Sunday.”Among them was an exam center in Chandigarh which was set up with all necessary arrangements including police and invigilators. However, it closed its gates after two students scheduled for the NEET-UG retest on Sunday did not show up.The NEET-UG exam, administered by the NTA on May 5, took place across 4,750 centers in 571 cities, including 14 international locations. Over 23 lakh candidates participated in the examination.An unprecedented number of students—67—scored a perfect 720, raising concerns about potential irregularities. Among these, six students from a center in Faridabad, Haryana, have attracted particular suspicion.Controversy also arose over grace marks awarded to students affected by time loss at six centers due to a late start. The Center informed the Supreme Court that these grace marks would be scrapped, and 1,563 affected students would be offered a retest.The NEET-UG examination is a critical pathway for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH, and other related courses in both government and private institutions nationally.The NEET-PG entrance exam has also been postponed, marking the fourth entrance exam affected recently.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed an FIR over alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG exam conducted on May 5, following a reference from the Union education ministry. CBI sent dispatched special teams to Godhra in Gujarat and Patna in Bihar to take over existing police investigations.The ministry's complaint to the CBI cited 'certain isolated incidents' in a few states during the examination, prompting the agency to investigate allegations of irregularities, conspiracy, cheating, impersonation, breach of trust, and evidence destruction.","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed an FIR over alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG exam conducted on May 5.

He comes down often to meet his mother, but this time he drove all the way. His route took him through the UK , France, Germany, Belgium, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Russia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Estonia, China, Tibet, Nepal and finally, India.The first leg of the journey saw Mungale accompanied by a Nepales, Roshan Shresta, up to Kathmandu.“I had planned this after reading about the historic Silk Route, and later after I read about a couple who had done it, but emails to the couple did not yield any response from them, I thought I’d plan it myself,” Mungale said. “When I shared this plan with my wife, she thought I was joking, but later, she supported it, and that’s how I planned the entire trip. Though it was planned before the pandemic, it got postponed until now.”Mungale meticulously charted his entire driving route before setting off. Averaging 400-600 km a day, sometimes covering up to 1,000 km, depending on the conditions, he was careful to avoid late-night driving to ensure safety. “We had done pre-maintenance on the SUV, but faced a minor technical problem when we reached Poland, but we overcame it, and it was a smooth drive from there.”Experiencing the diverse nature and culture of each country along the way, the IT professional took two months of leave without pay. Mungale secured all necessary permissions before entering each country.“Being a British national, I did not have any issues entering European countries or any other country. All my documents were ready, and the legal processes were taken care of.”“We did not face any major weather in any climatic conditions, though it was summer in most places... We had also reached the higher altitudes of 5,200 mts and faced minor altitude sickness, snow and extreme cold, altogether amazing experience but well prepared for that as well,” Mungale said.“Food was not a problem either, as apart from beef and insects, I eat everything. We would take a break after 3-4 pm and start searching for hotels or places to stay overnight,” he revealed.In the second leg, from Kathmandu, Mungale was joined by his wife and a relative for the remainder of the trip. Each leg of the journey was meticulously planned to manage fatigue and ensure safety. The entire 18,300 km journey required nearly 3,000 litres of fuel.Mungale’s journey stands as a testament to human endurance and the spirit of exploration, highlighting wonders and challenges of overland travel across diverse terrains and cultures.","Virajit Mungale embarked on his adventure on April 20, till June 17.

Another dirty NEET secret? Students' ranks jump on 2nd attempt from obscure centres,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-dirty-neet-secret-students-ranks-jump-on-2nd-attempt-from-obscure-centres/articleshow/111240029.cms,"Experts: NEET issue not local, likely to have ‘large spread'

MUMBAI: When Ashalata (name changed) took the NEET for the first time in 2022, her rank was in the six-digit range. However, in her second attempt the following year, her rank leapfrogged from 2 lakh-plus to 8,000. At present, the 20-year-old is a student of LTMG Sion Hospital in Mumbai.Another aspirant from 2022 who had secured a rank beyond 10 lakh now studies in a govt hospital in Mumbai after she secured a rank of around 13,000 in her second attempt in 2023.This ""second-time lucky"" trend, with students scoring ""unbelievable"" ranks after taking a year's break to prepare for the second attempt, has been seen as baffling by academics in medical corridors. And there was a common thread: the second time, each had taken the exam from an obscure centre. While some took it from a tiny village in Belagavi, others opted for a small town near Patna and other places not popular as coaching hubs.Govt sources said attempts are on to make a list of students who scored well in their second attempt at obscure centres and are now pursuing MBBS in govt-run medical colleges.This year, a similar scenario emerged when students from various states opted to take the exam from a school in Godhra, Gujarat. The Gujarat police, who blew the lid off the scam, said students were asked to fill answers for the questions they knew and leave the rest unanswered.""The empty answer-sheets were to be filled in by the centre's deputy superintendent during the half-hour gap the supervisors get to pack the papers. The answer key was to be provided by coaching institutes, which make the key available online after the exam,"" Godhra superintendent of police Himanshu Solanki said. A counsellor said police should investigate how students managed to get allocated to centres that are ""compromised"".When candidates fill their NEET (UG) application, they are expected to give two cities as options for exam centres. Parent representative and counsellor Sudha Shenoy said, ""Before filling the form in Feb, parents called me about agents who had said that they would fill the form for the candidates and that exam centres would be far from cities.""They had assured the parents that their child would get ‘high’ rank and demanded Rs 1 lakh as advance and Rs 9 lakh after the results. I had dissuaded them from falling into any such trap, parent representative and counsellor Sudha Shenoy said.The National Testing Agency (NTA) has always maintained that a computer randomly generates an exam centre based on the choice of cities given by each candidate. “If computer-generated centres are given, how are students who have paid ending up in compromised exam centres,” asked Shenoy.In another instance last year, a private university’s head was surprised to find the brightest first-year students failing on concepts that they had cracked in the entrance test conducted by the university just about 10 months ago and analysed the problem closely to find that some of their exam centres were compromised. “We changed the test agency we worked with. We realised that the exam centres were compromised,” the head of the university, who did not want to be named, told TOI.Experts said the NEET 2024 controversy is not just “local” but probably one with a “large spread.” The NTA needs to “look closely” at the system and “find gaps and fix them”, they said.Student representative and counsellor Sachin Bangad said, “A student should be allotted a local centre based on the combination of where the candidate took the Class X, XII exams and the address on the Aadhar card. Additionally, govt officials need to be roped in for supervision. Like in the polling system, they should be informed merely a night before where their exam supervision duty is.”An officer, who has worked with the Maharashtra admission process for decades, said NEET should be conducted on computers for safety reasons. “Additionally, the new provisions brought in for the post-graduate test, to break down the test into multiple-timed sections that cannot be revisited once the time is up, should also be brought into the UG test,” the officer added.","When Ashalata (name changed) took the NEET for the first time in 2022, her rank was in the six-digit range.

So many engineers are here and the Pran Pratishtha was held on January 22, but water is leaking from the roof.

This is expected because Guru Mandap is exposed to the sky as the second floor and completion of Shikhar will cover this opening.""""I also saw some seepage from the conduit as this work on the first floor is in progress.

'Ram Setu' as seen from space: European agency shares stunning picture,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ram-setu-as-seen-from-space-european-agency-shares-stunning-picture/articleshow/111229449.cms,"The European Space Agency has released an image of the Ram Setu , also known as Adam's Bridge , captured by its Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite .This chain of shoals links India and Sri Lanka , stretching 48 km between Rameswaram Island, off the southeast coast of India, and Mannar Island in Sri Lanka. It separates the Gulf of Mannar, an inlet of the Indian Ocean to the south, from the Palk Strait, an inlet of the Bay of Bengal to the north.There are numerous theories about the formation of this bridge. However, geological evidence suggests that these limestone shoals are remnants of land that once connected India and Sri Lanka.Historical records indicate that this natural bridge was traversable until the 15th century, after which it gradually eroded due to storms over the years, the ESA said.The European Space Agency noted that some of the sandbanks in the Ram Setu are dry, and the sea in this area is very shallow, ranging from only 1 to 10 meters deep, as indicated by the light color of the water.Mannar Island, covering around 130 square kilometers, is connected to mainland Sri Lanka by both a road bridge and a railway bridge, which are visible at the southern end of the island.On the Indian side of Adam's Bridge, Rameswaram Island, also known as Pamban Island, can be accessed from the Indian mainland via the 2-km-long Pamban Bridge.

Bihar govt’s recent inquiry of a possible paper leak in the NEET-UG 2024 exam has sparked off a heated controversy across the country. This essential exam, which serves as the doorway for medical students, is now being scrutinized, raising serious concerns about the integrity of Indian examination boards and the steps required to assure fairness in high-stakes testing. Full cancellation or rewriting for some the crux of the dispute is whether the entire NEET-UG 2024 exam should be cancelled or only specific applicants should be compelled to retake the exam. Both sides make compelling points.A leaked paper compromises the exam’s integrity, making it unfair to all candidates. A complete cancellation ensures that no student benefits from the leaked content.Setting a strict precedent against any form of malpractice is essential to maintaining the credibility of such exams in the future.Identifying and segregating those affected by the leak may be practically impossible, as the leaked content could have spread widely and undetectably.A full cancellation and rescheduling would significantly disrupt the academic calendar, causing undue stress and inconvenience to lakhs of students.If the leak can be traced to specific individuals or groups, only those applicants should be penalized, preserving the efforts and hard work of the majority.Reorganizing an exam for a subset of candidates is more feasible and cost-effective than a nationwide rescheduling.The controversy surrounding the NEET-UG 2024 paper leak extends beyond the immediate decision of whether to cancel the exam. It casts a shadow on the credibility of Indian examination boards, prompting a re-evaluation of their practices and procedures.Security Measures The repeated instances of paper leaks in various examinations call for a comprehensive overhaul of security measures. This includes adopting advanced encryption technologies, ensuring secure transportation and storage of exam papers, and employing robust digital surveillance methods.Examination boards must enhance transparency in their operations. Clear protocols for handling leaks and a public commitment to addressing malpractices can rebuild trust among stakeholders.Leveraging technology can help mitigate the risk of paper leaks. Online exams with randomized question sets, block chain for secure record-keeping, and AI-based monitoring systems are potential solutions that need to be explored and implemented.Establishing a rapid response team to investigate and address any allegations of malpractice can ensure that such issues are resolved swiftly and decisively, minimizing disruption to the examination process.The NEET-UG 2024 paper leak incident is a critical juncture for Indian examination boards. Whether the decision is to cancel the entire exam or to require a rewrite for specific candidates, the priority must be to uphold the principles of fairness and integrity. This situation underscores the need for systemic changes to prevent future occurrences and restore confidence in the examination system. As the nation awaits a resolution, it is imperative that stakeholders collaborate to reinforce the robustness and reliability of the educational assessment framework.","Bihar govt’s recent inquiry of a possible paper leak in the NEET-UG 2024 exam has sparked off a heated controversy across the country.

World's oldest egg gives 1st evidence of ostrich presence in south India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/worlds-oldest-egg-gives-1st-evidence-of-ostrich-presence-in-south-india/articleshow/111239772.cms,"VADODARA: A team of archaeologists stumbled upon an ostrich nest that dates back 41,000 years - the oldest found in the world - in Andhra Pradesh.

Archaeologists from the Vadodara-based MS University, and colleagues from Germany, Australia, and US found this archaeological evidence while investigating a fossil-rich site in Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh. The nest was the home of 9-11 ostrich eggs, the researchers said.

Typically, an ostrich nest is 9-10 feet wide and can accommodate 30-40 eggs at a time. Researchers say this finding is crucial in finding out why megafauna (animals weighing more than 40kg) went extinct in India. The discovery of nearly 3,500 pieces of ostrich eggshells from a patch of 1x1.5 metres is not only the first evidence of the presence of ostrich in south India, it is also the first time that archaeological evidence of a 41,000-yea-old ostrich nest has been established.

Megafauna, literally large animals, refers to animals like horses, elephants, cattle, and hippopotamus. Some of these megafauna became extinct around 40,000 years ago from different parts of the world. ""The oldest ostrich eggshell were discovered from the Siwalik Hills on the Indian side of the Himalayas. They date back more than 20 lakh years. Even in peninsular India, the oldest evidence of ostrich eggshells was discovered from Katoti in Rajasthan, which date back to 60,000 years,"" said Devara Anilkumar, assistant professor at the Department of Archaeology and Ancient History at MSU. He has been working on the project since April 2023.

On Monday, the ministry of personnel and public grievances and pensions also notified the rules for conduct of public exams by the Centre, which prescribe the procedures for conducting inquiry and filing of reports against those involved in cheating during public exams. This means that students as well as those involved in paper leaks in Bihar and elsewhere will face up to 10 years in jail and a fine of up to Rs 1 crore. Similarly, students who allegedly resorted to unfair means in locations such as Godhra can face a sentence of at least three years along with a Rs 10 lakh fine.The law aims to prevent unfair means in public examinations conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), railways, banking recruitment examinations and the National Testing Agency (NTA), among others.According to the rules, educational institutions, coaching centres, or any other entities found to be complicit in facilitating unfair means can face legal action, including fines and other penalties. Involvement of ""coaching centres"" in recent irregularities are already being probed. Coaching institutes and their personnel as well as examination authorities and service providers can face up to 5-10 years in jail.These measures are significantly tougher than current regulations for dealing with cheating, forgery, and paper leaks which are punishable with imprisonment of maximum of three years, and will apply to irregularities in exams currently under investigation, like NEET-UG and UGC-NET by CBI.These rules require the National Recruitment Agency ( NRA ) to establish norms, standards, and guidelines for computer-based tests (CBT), among other responsibilities. The rules include provisions for ""engagement of services of other govt agencies by public examination authority,"" ""preparations of norms, standards and guidelines,"" and ""reporting of incidents of unfair means or offences,"" among others.

Anu gives cops the slip in Jammu

Anu was spotted boarding a Mumbai-bound train at Katra station

NEW DELHI: Street-smart, talkative, and tech-savvy—these traits proved invaluable for Anu as she ascended the ranks within Himanshu Bhau's gang , notorious for the audacious murder of Aman Joon at a Burger King outlet in Delhi last week.According to reports, during the shootout where 38 bullets were pumped into Aman Joon, the enigmatic Anu remained remarkably composed. She even slipped Aman's phone into her pocket and escaped from the scene alongside the two shooters.Interestingly, it was Anu who lured Aman through one of her Instagram accounts, arranging their meeting at the Rajouri Garden eatery where the murder took place.CCTV footage showed her calmly fiddling with Aman's phone as the two shooters sat silently, waiting for the right moment to carry out the hit.According to a report, Anu hails from Rohtak district in Haryana. She is currently facing several criminal charges, including an alleged extortion attempt on a well-known sweetshop owner in Haryana—a case that also purportedly involved Himanshu Bhau.Following the hit job at the Burger King outlet, the Delhi Crime Branch team visited her home in Rohtak and the PG accommodation she had been staying in for the past few days in Delhi'sMukherjee Nagar to prepare for competitive exams, an officer reported. She had used a fake Aadhar card to secure the accommodation in Mukherjee Nagar, the officer added.Police revealed that Anu is a psychology graduate and had consistently good grades in school.Investigators suspect that Anu, along with the shooters identified as Ashish and Vicky, may be attempting to escape the country with Bhau's assistance.The west district police's technical investigation has uncovered that Anu created a fake Instagram account under the name Preeti to connect with Joon. She managed at least 15 accounts on the platform, all under different names, suggesting that she might be targeting others on Bhau's orders. Bhau had previously claimed on Instagram that more targets were lined up and would be eliminated one by one.Anu returned to her paying guest accommodation in northwest Delhi within an hour of the murder and was captured on CCTV cameras at various locations. When the police arrived at her PG in Mukherjee Nagar, they discovered that she had already left, claiming a family emergency. The PG owner was instructed to give her security deposit to a friend.Although Anu's surname is Dhankad, she is known only by her first name. Her family had previously filed a habeas corpus writ in court when she went missing, but it was later revealed that she had joined Bhau's syndicate.The CCTV footage from inside the restaurant shows Anu tampering with Joon's phone while the two shooters position themselves at a table directly behind them.One of the shooters abruptly stands up and begins firing from behind, causing Joon to run for cover towards the billing counter.Anu remains surprisingly calm and exits the restaurant along with other customers as the shooters pursue Joon, firing indiscriminately in a crowded restaurant, narrowly avoiding a tragedy. After leaving the outlet, Anu is seen going to the nearby metro station, taking a train to Azadpur, changing trains, and finally disembarking at GTB Nagar metro station. The footage shows her negotiating with an autorickshaw driver and requesting to be taken to Kashmere Gate ISBT, according to an inspector.Delhi Police narrowly missed apprehending Anu at Katra station in Jammu. She managed to board the last coach of a Mumbai-bound train, possibly heading to Goa or nearby areas to meet shooters Ashish and Vicky, with the intention of fleeing the country.Anu, who lured the target, Aman Joon, to the restaurant on June 18, fled to Jammu that night and stayed at a guest house in Katra the following day. CCTV footage from the station shows her hastily walking across the platform, carrying a trolley bag and a backpack, wearing a neon green top, black trousers, and a scarf. She managed to board the Bombay Swaraj Express just as it started moving at 10.06am on June 20.Gangsters of north India are increasingly using women during operations against their targets. The kingpins fish for women on social media who are fascinated with crime and criminals and then induct them into the syndicate, investigators said. Lawrence Bishnoi and his associates were were the first to start this trend, leveraging their popularity on social media to identify and recruit women who could contribute to the gang's operations. Bishnoi's rival, Himanshu Bhau, has now followed suit by employing Anu in his criminal activities.","Anu, who lured the target, Aman Joon, to the restaurant on June 18, fled to Jammu that night and stayed at a guest house the following day.

The team is scheduled to visit various dam sites in the region over the next few days. This visit marks is a step towards bilateral efforts to address and manage water resources shared by India and Pakistan under the treaty, which governs the use of the Indus River and its tributaries. The delegation's itinerary includes inspections of key dam projects to facilitate discussions on water management and treaty compliance.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed by then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and former Pakistan President Ayub Khan in 1960, establishes a framework for cooperation and information exchange on the use of the Indus River system. The treaty is overseen by the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), a bilateral body with commissioners from both countries tasked with implementing and managing treaty provisions, and resolving any questions, differences, or disputes that may arise.The PIC, which includes Indus Commissioners from India and Pakistan, has been a crucial platform for technical discussions and treaty compliance. Despite the treaty's framework, India and Pakistan have faced ongoing disagreements over hydroelectric projects. Pakistan has raised objections to India's construction of the Kishanganga (330 megawatts) and Ratle (850 megawatts) hydroelectric plants, arguing they violate treaty provisions. India, however, maintains that the projects are compliant with the treaty's guidelines and asserts its right to develop them.Efforts to resolve these disputes have been ongoing, with the World Bank encouraging both nations to explore alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. In 2015, Pakistan requested the appointment of a Neutral Expert to review its technical objections to India's projects but later sought arbitration in 2016. Despite five meetings of the PIC from 2017 to 2022, Pakistan has refrained from discussing the issue, complicating efforts to reach a consensus.The arrival of the Pakistani delegation signals a continued commitment to dialogue and cooperation under the Indus Waters Treaty, with the upcoming site visits expected to further discussions on water management and treaty implementation.",Pakistani delegation arrives in Jammu as part of ongoing discussions concerning Indus Water Treaty.

Juvenile Hilsa Overfishing Alarms Experts in Kolkata,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/experts-worried-as-juvenile-hilsa-floods-kolkata-markets/articleshow/111213480.cms,"KOLKATA: Markets across the city have been flooded with juvenile hilsa, weighing between 50 g and 200 g. This rampant fishing of khoka ilish is causing severe damage to the hilsa ecosystem in the Ganga estuary . Fine mesh nets, which trap even the smallest fish, are being used in what many describe as an act of temporal greed. This unsustainable practice is pushing the hilsa population to spawn in Bangladesh, where catching juvenile hilsa is a punishable offence.The first hilsa catch of the season predominantly comprises the juvenile fish. Larger hilsa weighing between 400 g and 600 g have also been caught but their numbers are very low. Last week, an average of 130 trawlers brought in 80% small hilsa hauls with the remaining 20% consisting of other fish and larger hilsa. In the past two days, there has been a slight increase in the quantity of larger hilsa.Ajed Ali Gaji, a fisherman, explained, ""The fishermen were in dire straits during the ban period from April 15 to June 14, staying at home. Trawler owners face significant expenses and pressure. During Eid, the guards on the India-Bangladesh river border are more relaxed, and many unscrupulous traders take advantage of this. They cross the border under the cover of darkness with their trawler lights off and capture juvenile hilsa indiscriminately. This has been happening for the past week, though it's now reducing slightly. About 130 trawlers are bringing in 2.5 quintal-3 quintal of juvenile hilsa daily. This fish is then taken to Namkhana, Kakdwip and Patharpratima, and end up at Diamond Harbour's Nagendra market. It's an open secret that everyone knows but pretends not to. Juvenile hilsa is also sold in Murshidabad, Nadia and North 24 Parganas. The slightly larger fish are sold in city fringe markets, like Senhati, Behala, Dharapara, Kudghat, and Kasba.""Expressing his concern, Bijon Maity, secretary of the Kakdwip Fishermen Association, said, ""We are against catching small fish. We have warned and discussed this issue in many ways. While some listen, a few unscrupulous fishermen continue to do this in secret. We have also appealed to the traders to stop buying and selling small fish."" Jagannath Sarkar, secretary, Diamond Harbour Hilsa Market, said, ""I am looking into the matter. It must be stopped.""Principal scientist and head of the Kakdwip Research Centre, ICAR - Central Institute of Brackish Water Aquaculture, Debasish De said, ""As long as bottom-trawling with trawl nets continues, this problem will persist. Unless the rule of using 90 cm or 90 mm net mesh is strictly followed, we can't solve this issue. Awareness needs to be increased.""""We experience a second migration here. The first peak migration is from Oct 15 to Nov 15, and the second is from the end of Feb to the end of March. Attention must be paid during these times as well, and restrictions should be imposed on fishermen if necessary. The third migration is from June 15 to April 14. Restrictions similar to those during this period should be imposed during the other two migration periods,"" De added.The hilsa fishing industry is at a critical juncture, with experts and stakeholders calling for stringent measures to preserve this vital fish population and ensure sustainable fishing practices .","Rampant fishing of khoka ilish is causing severe damage to the hilsa ecosystem in the Ganga estuary.

Up to 42 people died in Kallakurichi, Tamil Nadu after consuming illicit liquor, causing shock. Vijay, a cinema star turning politician, criticized the government's negligence. His visit to victims' families and hospital showed support and emotion.

Chennai: In yet another breakthrough in the Kallakurichi hooch tragedy, police on Sunday arrested one of the main suppliers of methanol to the illicit liquor dealers in Kallakurichi. A total of 57 people have died in the incident so far.The suspect, who has been identified as Sivakumar, had been hiding in his sister’s house at Sulapallam in Chennai. He was nabbed by officials of the PEW (prohibition enforecement wing) in the early hours and handed over to the CB-CID for further investigation. According to police, Sivakumar was working at a private chemical company in Vadaperumbakkam, near Puzhal. Police also searched the factory premises to find out if he had stocked up on methanol there. However, nothing was found. Sources from CB-CID are investigating to see how long he supplied the chemical and from where he purchased it.Sivakumar was nabbed based on the information given by 19-year-old Madhesh, a chemical engineer who had been arrested two days ago on charges of supplying methanol to the brewers in Kallakurichi. Investigations revealed that Madhesh had procured the chemical from Sivakumar by using the GST number of Shakthivel, a hotel owner from Panruti in Cuddalore district.Madhesh requested Shaktivel to provide his GST number to start an industry dealing with thinner and promised a good commission for the same. Upon getting the number, he created fake bills, and several companies procured chemicals from him as he sold them at a cheaper price.Investigations revealed that Madhesh initially stocked thinners at Shaktivel's hotel and supplied 1,000 litres to an industry at Vriddhachalam. The fourth time, he procured methanol and stocked it in the hotel, and everyone thought it was thinner. He later sent 10 barrels of methanol to Kallakurichi. The sleuths have recovered CCTV camera footage of Madhesh loading the barrels of methanol.A total of 216 patients have been admitted to four hospitals after consuming illicit liquor. The Crime Branch CID (CB-CID), which is probing the case, has confirmed that the deaths were due to the consumption of illicit liquor mixed with methanol. Ten people have been arrested so far. A one-man commission, headed by Justice B Gokuldas, a retired Madras high court judge, has been appointed to investigate the tragedy. The police have intensified their efforts to apprehend all those involved in the incident.","The suspect, who has been identified as Sivakumar, had been hiding in his sister’s house at Sulapallam in Chennai.

Karnataka’s Rs 200 Crore Harekala Dam Awaits Water Storage Survey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/not-a-drop-of-water-in-rs-200-crore-karnataka-dam-built-last-year/articleshow/111213010.cms,"MANGALURU: A Rs 200-crore bridge-cum-dam built across the Nethravathi and declared ready a year ago - to serve twin city suburbs of Ullal and Bantwal, besides parts of Mangaluru city -- doesn't have a drop of water yet.The bridge-cum-saltwater-exclusion dam (SWED), launched in 2020, is awaiting a crucial survey to determine the actual area of submersion and the required compensation before water could be stored. The dam is constructed under Paschimavahini Scheme at Harekala. The four-metre-high dam will have 51 crest gates. The bridge provides easy access for people from Puttur, Bantwal, and other taluks to reach Harekala , Konaje, Mudipu, Thokkotu, Ullal, and Kerala. The project was launched by minister for minor irrigation, JC Madhu Swamy, in 2020.Mangaluru MLA and legislative assembly speaker UT Khader said a survey would be conducted soon, paving the way for the start of water storage. ""We've built a dam in Harekala since the water availability at Thumbe is not sufficient, considering increase in demand. A sufficient quantity of water can be drawn from the nearly 4km gap between the Thumbe dam upstream and the new Harekala dam downstream.""""All works related to the (new) Harekala dam are complete, and we have been conducting a trial run to see how much water can be stored in it. Further, the areas that will be submerged when storage begins will also be measured. We'll maintain the water level to a point at which farmers and nearby residents are not affected. Compensation will be paid to property owners based on the survey. In the future, the storage level can be increased,"" he said.Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner Mullai Muhilan MP said, ""I don't think there is any fear of submersion of the nearby villages due to the new dam.""The 7.5-metre-wide road with footpaths of one metre each on either side over the dam has already been opened. In fact, youth organization members had opened the bridge voluntarily by removing the barricades when the model code of conduct was in force in April 2023, and a case in this regard was also booked by Konaje police then.","Bridge-cum-saltwater-exclusion dam (SWED), launched in 2020, is awaiting a crucial survey to determine the actual area of submersion.

Exploring the new rumor, Zilla Fatu debut and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/is-roman-reigns-coming-back-to-wwe-exploring-the-new-rumor-zilla-fatu-debut-and-more/articleshow/111238552.cms,"Following his defeat by Cody Rhodes at Wrestlemania 40, Roman Reigns has been absent from television. In his absence, Solo Sikoa has been crowned the new Tribal Chief and is leading the Bloodline, bolstering their ranks with new, formidable members like Jacob Fatu . The Bloodline is currently wreaking havoc in WWE, growing more powerful each week. This raises the question of when Roman Reigns will return and what his objectives will be. Will he confront Solo Sikoa and the other Bloodline members, or will he focus on reclaiming the WWE Undisputed title from Cody Rhodes? Let's explore these possibilities below.Is Roman Reigns coming back to WWE?Xero News on Twitter has reported that Roman Reigns is set to return in the next few weeks. While they did not specify an exact date, other sources suggest that his return will occur before SummerSlam. According to the same tweet from Xero News, Roman's comeback will allow ample time to set up a SummerSlam match. This indicates that fans could see the former Tribal Chief Roman Reigns back in action after Money in the Bank, with enough time for his involvement in a potential new storyline.After WrestleMania, SummerSlam is regarded as the next biggest event, featuring high-octane matches with top competitors. Therefore, it is highly likely that fans will see Roman Reigns in action at SummerSlam. While his opponent remains unknown, current tensions within The Bloodline suggest that Roman might face Solo Sikoa, Jacob Fatu, or other members of The Bloodline.What’s next for Roman ReignsAs of now, it is unclear what storyline will involve Roman Reigns, but several reports suggest he will be facing off against The Bloodline. Some sources have indicated there could be a Civil War-like situation between the brothers, meaning Roman Reigns will lead a separate faction to compete against The Bloodline. This development is likely because the current Bloodline is a dominant heel group and the primary villainous faction in the company.Currently, Solo Sikoa and other members are targeting Cody, Randy, and Owens. With the addition of new member Jacob Fatu, The Bloodline is escalating the chaos in WWE. Jacob Fatu made a shocking debut on the most recent episode of SmackDown, where he single-handedly took down Randy, Owens, and Cody.Following Jacob's debut, another cousin of Roman Reigns, Zilla Fatu, has hinted at his WWE arrival. Zilla Fatu, the son of the late great wrestler Umaga, is a talented wrestler trained by the legendary Booker T. After Jacob's debut, Zilla posted a cryptic message on Instagram saying, ""SEE YOU SOON,"" suggesting his imminent debut. Fans might see Zilla Fatu 's arrival in WWE very soon.Whether Roman Reigns makes his return at Money in the Bank 2024, Madison Square Garden, or surprises everyone on SmackDown, the reaction to The Real Tribal Chief will be an unforgettable roar from the WWE Universe that will be remembered for ages.","Roman Reigns has been absent from WWE since his defeat by Cody Rhodes at Wrestlemania 40.

A recent rumor about Shane McMahon 's current stature in the wrestling world has had fans on the edge of their seats.The wrestling community was speculating that Shane McMahon might join the AEW. However, Tony Khan had conveyed to the Wrestling Observer that he had never interacted with Shane McMahon. Reliable wrestling sources have also confirmed that Shane McMahon has not discussed his potential recruitment within AEW.Sean Sapp, a reporter from Fightful Select stated that Shane’s father, Vince McMahon , told some WWE insiders that owing to a mishap in the 2022 Royal Rumble , Shane McMahon ""would never get another pop in the company again"" while he was in charge.Despite having appeared at WrestleMania last year, Shane no longer has any ties with the WWE. This also means that he does not have access to talent, legends, or similar agreements with this organization. However, this wrestler was reportedly included in WWE 2K24 under a separate arrangement.According to Ringside News, Shane was ""let go"" from WWE after the 2022 Royal Rumble. He was said to be causing conflicts due to his bossy and entitled stature, including disagreements over the use of stars like Bad Bunny. This resulted in Vince McMahon removing Shane from the event, and the Rumble match was planned without him.Shane McMahon is currently in good health, having been seen fully recovered at a baseball game. He has continued his fitness routine during recovery, focusing on his upper body while keeping his knee in a brace.It remains uncertain whether Shane McMahon will join AEW. If Tony Khan were to bring him in, it would be a major surprise. The main question is how he would be used. However, fans are speculating that if Shane had to join the AEW, it would already have happened by now. Since he hasn’t had a contract with the WWE in recent times, it is highly unlikely of him making a comeback.","The wrestling community was speculating that Shane McMahon might join the AEW.

Nearly 450 Indian Sikh are currently in Pakistan to observe the death anniversary of Ranjit Singh who ruled Punjab in the 19th century and was the first maharaja of Sikh empire.

Lahore's Fakir Khana Museum director Fakir Syed Saifuddin spearheaded the project to repair, rebuild, and restructure the statue that had incurred nearly 80% damage.

""It was out of love and respect for Ranjit Singh that I undertook this project. The restoration cost around Rs 27 lakh and the work spanned over a year. The statue was donated for its installation in Gurdwara Darbar Sahib complex,"" Saifuddin, a fifth generation descendant of Fakir Sayed Azizudin who was chief secretary and foreign minister in Ranjit Singh's govt said. His brothers Fakir Syed Imamudin and Fakir Syed Noorudin were acting governor, Amritsar, and governor, Lahore, respectively.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
How Texas abortion ban in fact led to rise in infant mortality and birth defects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-texas-abortion-ban-in-fact-led-to-rise-in-infant-mortality-and-birth-defects/articleshow/111245303.cms,"A recent study from Johns Hopkins University reveals that Texas has experienced a rise in infant mortality and birth defects following the implementation of its abortion ban in September 2021.The research, which was published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found that Texas saw an 8% increase in its infant mortality rate in 2022, compared to a 2% increase in the rest of the United States. This amounted to 216 more infant deaths than expected from March to December of the following year.The study compared infant deaths in Texas with those in 28 other states, some of which also have abortion restrictions. Specifically, Texas saw a 23% increase in the number of deaths caused by birth defects, while the rest of the US experienced a 3% decrease. The Texas law prohibits abortions after detecting cardiac activity, usually at around five to six weeks into pregnancy, before most tests for fetal abnormalities can be conducted.Alison Gemmill, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, author of the study, told USA Today about the negative of abortion ban. She said, “It just points to some of the devastating consequences of abortion bans that maybe people weren't thinking about when they passed these laws.” She also referred to the fatalities that occurred after the implementation of the Texas heartbeat law as the ""spillover effects on moms and babies.""“I think these findings make clear the potentially devastating consequences that abortion bans can have,” said Suzanne Bell, a fertility researcher and co-author of the study, quoted by AP.Bell noted that infant deaths are relatively rare, so the team was somewhat surprised by the findings. Due to the small number of cases, the researchers could not analyze the data to see if the rates were higher among certain races or socioeconomic groups.The research team also indicated an unexpected factor due to limited data preventing them from breaking down the rates for different population groups, such as racial or socioeconomic demographics. However, this was not a surprise for experts like Tiffany Green, who have extensively studied racial inequities in reproductive health.Although the findings are significant, Bell mentioned that the small numbers involved made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions for specific subpopulations. This complexity underscores the necessity for further research and resources to understand and address the broader impacts of such policies.Green emphasized the vulnerability of individuals who typically seek abortions, pointing out that restrictive abortion laws could compound existing health disparities.Texas governor Greg Abbott's spokesperson, Andrew Mahaleris, responded to the study's conclusions by standing by Texas's anti-abortion legislation in a statement to USA Today. He highlighted the 2021 heartbeat law, stating its purpose was ""to save the innocent unborn, and now thousands of children have been given a chance at life.""","The study compared infant deaths in Texas with those in 28 other states, some of which also have abortion restrictions.

Hajj deaths put spotlight on underworld of illicit tour operators,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/hajj-deaths-put-spotlight-on-underworld-of-illicit-tour-operators/articleshow/111244710.cms,"CAIRO: More than 1,300 people died making the Islamic pilgrimage of haj in Saudi Arabia this month, the vast majority of whom the Saudi govt said did not have permits. Many walked for miles in scorching heat as high as 51.8 degrees Celsius after paying thousands of dollars to illicit tour operators.The fatalities included 660 Egyptians, 165 from Indonesia, 98 from India and dozens more from Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria and Malaysia, according to an AP tally. Two US citizens also died.While pilgrims with permits are transported around Mecca in air-conditioned buses and rest in air-conditioned tents, unregistered ones are often exposed to the elements.On Sunday, Saudi health minister Fahd bin Abdurrahman Al-Jalajel said 83% of the 1,301 reported deaths involved pilgrims who lacked permits.With nearly 2 million participating each year, it is not unusual for pilgrims to die from heat stress, illness or chronic disease. But it is unclear if the number of deaths this year was higher than usual, because Saudi does not regularly report those statistics.But as so many of those who died had no permits, this year's toll exposed an underworld of illicit tour operators and smugglers who profit off Muslims desperate to make the journey. An estimated 400,000 undocumented people tried to perform haj this year, a senior Saudi official told AFP.Haj tour operators, pilgrims and relatives of the dead described easily exploited loopholes that allow people to travel to the kingdom with a tourist or visitor visa before haj. Once they arrive, they find illegal brokers and smugglers who offer their services, take their money and sometimes abandon them to fend for themselves, they said.The number of unregistered pilgrims appeared to have been driven up this year by rising economic desperation in countries such as Egypt and Jordan. An official haj package can cost more than $5,000 or $10,000, depending on a pilgrim's country of origin - far beyond the means of many.One unregistered pilgrim who died was Safaa al-Tawab from the Egyptian city of Luxor. Al-Tawab, 55, had not been able to obtain a haj permit but found an Egyptian tour company to take her for around $3,000, her brother Ahmed said. After she arrived, she told relatives she had been put in inadequate housing and prevented from going outside. Although the tour operator had promised air-conditioned buses, she found herself walking for miles in the heat, her brother said. She died midway through the pilgrimage, but when her brother contacted a representative from the tour company, he assured him she was fine, then turned off his phone. Even for the young and fit, haj is a physically challenging event, and many pilgrims are elderly or ailing by the time they can make the journey. Some believe the hajj might be their final rite, and that dying in Mecca will confer great blessings.","More than 1,300 people died making the Islamic pilgrimage of haj in Saudi Arabia this month.

Where is Melania Trump? Former first lady's elusive presence on US 2024 campaign trail sparks curiosity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/where-is-melania-trump-former-first-ladys-elusive-presence-on-us-2024-campaign-trail-sparks-curiosity/articleshow/111216727.cms,"Following her conspicuous absence from pivotal events in her husband's presidential bid , former First Lady Melania Trump has become the center of media speculation. Her minimal public appearances this year have fueled curiosity about her role in Donald Trump 's 2024 campaign.Earlier in the year, Melania missed key events such as the campaign kickoff in Iowa and the Super Tuesday victory party. When asked in March about her future involvement, she coyly responded, “Stay tuned.” Since then, she has kept a low profile, only attending a few fundraisers in April and her son Barron's high school graduation.Significantly, Melania was absent during Donald Trump’s hush money trial in New York. She did not accompany him on any of the trial days, was absent for the guilty verdict, his subsequent remarks at Trump Tower, his 78th birthday celebration, and several campaign rallies.Katherine Jellison, a history professor at Ohio University specializing in first ladies, remarked that Melania's behavior, while unusual, is not entirely surprising. “As First Lady, she kept a low profile and was not very active in his 2020 campaign,” Jellison noted. She highlighted that the Trumps often deviate from traditional political norms.Unlike Melania, other political spouses have been active in supporting their partners' campaigns. Casey DeSantis, wife of Florida Gov Ron DeSantis, was heavily involved in his primary bid, and Dr Apoorva Ramaswamy, wife of Vivek Ramaswamy, often appeared on the campaign trail with their children.Efforts to reach Melania Trump for comments have been unsuccessful. She has made only one recent public statement regarding her son's selection as a delegate for the Republican National Convention, citing his prior commitments as the reason he could not attend.During Donald Trump’s trial, reporters repeatedly questioned his wife’s absence. Trump’s attorney, Todd Blanche, avoided the topic, focusing instead on the challenging nature of the case. Testimony during the trial included sensitive details about Trump's alleged affair with Stormy Daniels, which reportedly concerned him more for its potential impact on his 2016 campaign than on his marriage.Despite her absence, Trump frequently mentions Melania in his speeches, portraying her as an active, albeit behind-the-scenes, supporter. Larry Snowden, president of the “Club 47” fan group, recounted his brief interaction with Melania at a February gala, describing her as “charming” and “accommodating.”Snowden expressed optimism about Melania's future involvement in the campaign, anticipating that she will make key appearances and speeches while remaining protected by the former president.As the campaign progresses, Melania Trump's enigmatic presence continues to intrigue both supporters and critics, leaving many wondering if she will step into a more public role or continue to support her husband from the shadows.","The former First Lady has kept a low profile this year, only attending a few fundraisers in April and her son Barron's high school graduation.

Billionaire Hinduja family members sentenced to jail for exploiting staff at Geneva villa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/billionaire-hinduja-family-members-sentenced-to-jail-for-exploiting-staff-at-geneva-villa/articleshow/111173810.cms,"'Family spent more on pet dog than they paid a help'

NEW DELHI: A Swiss court sentenced four members of the Hinduja family to up to four and a half years in jail on Friday for exploiting domestic workers at their Geneva villa .The criminal court, however, cleared the members of a billionaire family of charges that they engaged in illegal human trafficking of their servants, who were employed at their luxurious lakeside villa in Geneva. The court said that the staff understood the conditions they were agreeing to. There was no effective detention for any members of the family.""Our clients have been acquitted of all human trafficking charges. We are appalled and disappointed by the rest of the decision made in this court of first instance, and we have of course filed an appeal to the higher court thereby making this part of the judgement not effective. Under Swiss law, the presumption of innocence is paramount till a final judgement by the highest adjudicating authority is enforced"", lawyers representing Hinduja family said in a statement.The counsels also said that the plaintiffs in this case had withdrawn their respective complaints after declaring to the court that they had never intended to be involved in such proceedings.The Switzerland court found Indian-born businessman Prakash Hinduja, his wife, son, and daughter-in-law guilty of exploiting workers and providing unauthorised employment.The Hinduja family, who have been residing in Switzerland for decades, were accused of confiscating workers' passports, paying them in rupees instead of Swiss francs, restricting their movement, and forcing them to work excessively long hours for meager wages. Prakash Hinduja had previously been convicted on similar, albeit lesser charges in 2007, but prosecutors allege that he continued to employ people without proper documentation.Last week, it was revealed that the family had reached an undisclosed settlement with the plaintiffs. Swiss authorities have already seized various assets, including diamonds, rubies, and a platinum necklace, which could be used to cover legal fees and potential penalties.According to prosecutors, employees, including cooks and house help, were sometimes forced to work up to 18 hours a day with little or no vacation time. They were paid less than one-tenth of the amount required under Swiss law. Some staff members allegedly slept in the basement of the villa in the upscale Cologny neighborhood, occasionally on a mattress on the floor. Prosecutors described a ""climate of fear"" instituted by Kamal Hinduja.Certain employees reportedly spoke only Hindi and were paid their wages in Indian rupees in banks back home that they couldn't access. A separate tax case brought by Swiss authorities is pending against Prakash Hinduja, who obtained Swiss citizenship in 2000. The Hinduja family, consisting of Prakash and his three brothers, leads an industrial conglomerate spanning various sectors, with Forbes magazine estimating their net worth at approximately $20 billion.According to Swiss prosecutor Yves Bertossa, the family allegedly spent more money on their pet dog than they paid one of their servants. Bertossa presented this information during a trial concerning the alleged trafficking and exploitation of the Indian employees.On Monday, the prosecutor had delivered a scathing critique of the Hinduja family's actions recommending jail sentences ranging up to five and a half years for those involved. Bertossa's arguments were based on testimonies provided by the staff and the Hindujas themselves, as well as evidence gathered during his investigation into the matter.""They spent more for one dog than one of their servants,"" he said. The woman, he said, was paid at one point as little as 7 Swiss francs ($7.84) for a working day that lasted as long as 18 hours, seven days a week. He pointed to a budget document headlined ""Pets"", which he said demonstrated that the family spent 8,584 Swiss francs in a year on their family dog.Staff contracts didn't specify working hours or days off, but rather that they be available as needed by their employers, Bertossa continued. Given their passports had been confiscated, they had no Swiss francs to spend as wages were paid in India and couldn't leave the house without their employer's permission, they had little to no freedom, he argued.","A Swiss court sentenced four members of the Hinduja family to up to four and a half years in jail on Friday for exploiting domestic workers at their Geneva villa.

"Puerto Rico power company suspends $65M worth of maintenance projects, sparking outcry amid outages",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/puerto-rico-power-company-suspends-65m-worth-of-maintenance-projects-sparking-outcry-amid-outages/articleshow/111245080.cms,"SAN JUAN: The private operator of Puerto Rico's power grid confirmed Monday the deferral of $65 million worth of maintenance and improvement projects in the US territory, with some repairs postponed for at least a year because of budget constraints, putting at risk the already troubled grid and sparking a widespread outcry. Some of the deferred projects include maintenance of more than 100,000 light posts, fire mitigation and repairs on underground circuits, among other improvements.Luma Energy 's head of regulatory affairs, Mario Hurtado, told The Associated Press on Monday that the suspended projects he aims to bring back next year risk more outages across the island.""The risk is always that there will be more failures in terms of public lighting,"" Hurtado said.At a budget hearing on Friday, Hurtado said Luma Energy prioritized other tasks based on ""professional judgment,"" which they consider calculated risks. The lack of fire mitigation puts the grid at risk as hotter temperatures seize Puerto Rico, increasing the chances of wildfires disrupting power lines.""We make judgments based on what we have available and what our goals are,"" Hurtado said Friday. ""Although it entails a risk, it's an acceptable risk.""Luma's budget, proposed to Puerto Rico's energy bureau, includes $1.3 billion for the entire electrical sector , with 65% allocated to Luma, which is in charge of transmission and distribution, 32% to Genera PR, which operates and maintains the grid, and 3% to the Puerto Rico electric power authority.The budget aims to inject funds into Luma's customer service, personnel safety and renewable energy projects.Luma's announcement to defer millions of dollars' worth of projects amid chronic power outages has angered many.""It is unacceptable that Luma Energy can unilaterally decide to suspend crucial tasks,"" Jesus Manuel Ortiz, a member of the house of representatives who's also running for governor, said in a statement Monday. ""It is evident that Luma continues to fail in its responsibilities, and that no one in the Government of Puerto Rico is responsible.""The company confirmed a delay in funds disbursement from the federal emergency management agency on Friday. Luma has submitted about 400 projects for approval to upgrade the energy grid, and about 100 have been approved, Hurtado said.The budget hearing comes as the island of 3.2 million people contends with frequent power outages more than six years after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm. The combination of storms, earthquakes and underinvestment has hindered recovery efforts.A massive blackout in mid-June left over 340,000 customers in the capital, San Juan, and nearby cities without power during a heat wave . Prior to the blackout, towns in central and southern Puerto Rico were left without power for about five days after a transformer collapsed early June. The company restored the service on June 9, with some residents still experiencing sporadic outages last week.Over the weekend, Luma shipped a transformer via boat from San Juan to the southern coastal city of Ponce and then transported it to the nearby town of Santa Isabel.Governor Pedro Pierluisi activated the national guard to help with the energy crisis and ordered an investigation into the June 13 blackout. The energy bureau is also investigating and has directed Luma and Genera PR to submit a plan to stabilize the island's electrical network.","Luma Energy's head of regulatory affairs, Mario Hurtado, said the suspended projects he aims to bring back next year risk more outages across the island.
