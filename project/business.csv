NEW DELHI: India reported 68,994 environment-related crimes in 2023 which is over 30% higher than the total number of such crimes (52,920) reported in 2022, shows the latest Crime in India report released by the home ministry's National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) this week.Nearly 86% (59,279) of environment-related crimes, however, pertain to only one offence -- the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003 that prohibits advertisement and regulates trade, commerce, production, supply and distribution of such products.The report shows that the highest number of overall environment-related crime was reported in Tamil Nadu (41,304) followed by Kerala (8,786), Rajasthan (7,794), Maharashtra (4,854) and Uttar Pradesh (1,804).Offences under Noise Pollution Act, and Forest Act and Forest Conservation Act figure at second and third position with reporting 6,640 and 2,076 crimes, respectively. The other offences were reported under the Wildlife Protection Act (526), the Environmental Protection Act (389), and Air and Water Pollution control law (68) among others. Sixteen cases were reported under the National Green Tribunal Act 2010, of which all these cases were filed in Meghalaya.Though chargesheets were filed in nearly 98% of the environment-related cases which eventually reported higher rate of conviction compared to other cases filed under IPC and special and local laws (SLL), an overwhelming majority relate to only tobacco-linked offences and crimes under the Noise Pollution Act. Other than crimes under these two Acts, the conviction rate in the remaining environment-related offences was quite low.The UT of Delhi, which faces air pollution crisis every year during winter due to multiple violations of different nature, did not file a single case under the Air Pollution Control Act in 2023. Though its neighbour Haryana reported three cases under the law, Punjab that witnesses violation on stubble burning issues too did not file a single case under the Act.Offence-wise data shows that Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number (1,282) of cases under forest-related crimes followed by Rajasthan (232), Himachal Pradesh (141), Jharkhand (139) and Karnataka (98) in 2023.Under the Wildlife Protection Act, Rajasthan reported the highest number of cases (181) followed by Uttar Pradesh (116), West Bengal (41), Maharashtra (27) and Bihar (25).","India reported 68,994 environment-related crimes in 2023 which is over 30% higher than the total number of such crimes (52,920) reported in 2022.

"Safest time to be alive, in India & the world?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/safest-time-to-be-alive-in-india-the-world/articleshow/124245208.cms,"Representative image

This may seem very hard to believe, but now is probably the safest time to be alive. Murder rates in India are at their lowest since we started tracking such data, according to the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).And it’s the same story for most countries globally. NCRB started releasing data for murder and culpable homicide in 1957. In that year, India’s murder rate per lakh was 2.57. By 2023, the latest year for which NCRB has released its data, this had dropped to 2.25.The murder rate rose steadily since 1957, and peaked in the 1990s, after which it has kept dropping. It fell below 4 in 2001, and dropped to under 3 in 2013.Among large states that registered more than 1,000 cases of murder and culpable homicide, the rate is the highest in Jharkhand – at 3.8 per lakh population. Jharkhand is followed by Haryana, Chattisgarh, Assam, Odisha and Telangana – each reporting a rate of 3 or higher. Globally, Japan is the safest country and South Africa the most dangerous, according to World Bank data. Japan, in 2020 – the last year for which comparable data across countries is available – saw only 0.3 murders per lakh population.","The murder rate rose steadily since 1957, and peaked in the 1990s, after which it has kept dropping.

I-T drive to target tax evasion on capital gains in joint deals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-t-drive-to-target-tax-evasion-in-joint-deals/articleshow/124244497.cms,"Representational image

NEW DELHI: The income tax department is set to launch a drive to nudge people who entered into joint development agreements, but didn’t pay capital gains, to deposit the requisite tax. In Kolkata and Bengaluru alone, there are 25,000 to 30,000 such entities have been identified, said sources.Joint development agreements — a deal between real estate developers and landowners — are used across the country with Delhi and other cities also on the radar. The transfer under the agreements, which could cover a small piece of land where three or four floors are built or a larger tract with multiple houses or plots, require landowners to pay capital gains tax.The campaign is expected to be launched over the next few days with emails and correspondence addressed to identified taxpayers, asking them to come clean on their own. Govt sources said that the tax department believes that majority of individuals may have missed paying taxes and are likely to come forward and clear dues. Only in cases where landowners do not come forward will tax authorities contemplate the next set of measures.Taxpayers, whose transactions pertain to the last financial year, can update their latest income tax return and pay the requisite tax. For cases related to previous years, an additional 25% may be required to be paid but compliance will ensure there is no penalty.In recent years, the tax department has adopted ‘Nudge’, or Non-Intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable Taxpayers, to push taxpayers to pay their dues without penalty and the response has been quite encouraging. For instance, a campaign on foreign assets and income for FY 2023-24 which nudged 19,500 individuals saw 12,700 revised returns, with close to 900 changing their residency from residents to non-residents. More than 30,000 reported overseas assets and income during the period with disclosures of Rs 29,000 crore assets and over Rs 1,000 crore additional taxes. Similar focused campaigns have been run for virtual digital assets and HRA exemptions, getting people to comply without taking punitive action.","In Kolkata and Bengaluru alone, there are 25,000 to 30,000 such entities.

Avg GDP growth rate of 12% must to tackle unemployment in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/avg-gdp-growth-rate-of-12-must-to-tackle-unemployment-in-india/articleshow/124244547.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Average GDP growth rate of 12.2% is needed to start addressing India’s underemployment challenge and a bigger push is needed for a pro-growth, pro-jobs policy agenda to tackle the country’s high youth unemployment problem, a report by investment banking and financial services firm Morgan Stanley has said.“In our base case, India’s GDP will grow at an average of 6.5% over the coming decade, one of the fastest-growing economies globally. But this pace will not be enough to generate enough jobs,” said the report, asserting growth momentum needs to be stronger.The report said to achieve higher growth, India needs stronger growth in its industrial and exports sectors. “Studies have shown that every job created by manufacturing exports creates two other jobs in related sectors like transportation and logistics,” it said.“In this sense, India has significant scope to increase its market share in exports because it is still just at 1.8%, well below its weight in terms of working age population and GDP,” it added.The report said policymakers are already making efforts but the magnitude of the jobs problem means there is a need to accelerate pace and do more.“A comprehensive reform package will be needed, including accelerated build-out of public infrastructure, especially for last-mile connectivity, plus a systematic approach that incentivises state govts to improve the business environment and ensure the labour force is adequately skilled,” the report further said.It said over the medium term, one pressing issue is that AI will reduce job growth prospects, particularly for IT services sector — which has been a key source of employment creation — and for the domestic services sector as well.It said Asia’s youth unemployment is high and underlying situation is worsening. Slowing growth adds to the cyclical challenge; AI and automation are structural headwinds. Policymakers must either make reforms to shift growth models or redistributive efforts to manage potential social stability risks.","Average GDP growth rate of 12.2% is needed to start addressing India’s underemployment challenge.

Gadget tips for monsoon: What to do and what to avoid this rainy season

NEW DELHI: The four-month summer (southwest) monsoon season ended on Tuesday with India reporting 8% more than normal rainfall. East & northeast India, however, reported a huge deficit of more than 20% and witnessed the second lowest rainfall year in the rainy season since 1901. The country as a whole, on the other hand, saw fifth highest rainfall this year since 2001 and 38th highest since 1901.“Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Meghalaya saw deficient rainfall in three of the four monsoon months. The lowest rainfall in the monsoon season in the region was recorded in 2013,” IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said.He said, “Rainfall over east & northeast India has been deficient in many years in recent times. There is a trend that shows that the rainfall over this region is decreasing since 2020. Studies also show that rainfall over the region has decreased in the last 20 years.”Though the ‘above normal’ monsoon season was marked by many disasters, including cloudburst, landslides, floods and mudslides, specifically in northwest India (Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir), the good rains helped farmers in increasing their acreage of Kharif (summer sown) crops not just more than last year but also more than the normal sown area of the season.The agriculture ministry's latest data, released on Monday, shows that the country reported an overall acreage of 1,120 lakh hectares this Kharif season, which is 24 lakh hectares more than normal acreage and seven lakh hectares more than the acreage in 2024. It raises a hope of record foodgrains during the 2025-26 crop year, even as few lakh hectares of farm land got submerged in floods in Punjab and other states.The monsoon season technically ended on Tuesday, but certain parts of the country will continue to report rainfall for a couple of more weeks till the complete withdrawal of the monsoon mid-Oct. The delay in complete withdrawal of the monsoon may delay the onset of northeast (winter) monsoon in Peninsular India.Mohapatra said most parts of the country are expected to receive above-normal rainfall during the post-summer monsoon season (October to December), except for some areas in northwest India, where rainfall is likely to be normal to below-normal.In October alone, the country is expected to receive 15% more than normal rainfall.The met department’s forecast suggests that the winter monsoon (October to December) rainfall over south Peninsular India, comprising five meteorological subdivisions of Tamil Nadu, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, Kerala and South Interior Karnataka, is most likely to be above normal (more than 112% of the long period average).Asked about the possibility of early winter arrival due to developing La Nina conditions, Mohapatra said it would be premature to predict early winter onset at this juncture as the status of colder weather depends on multiple dynamic meteorological factors.La Nina (means Little Girl in Spanish) is a climate pattern associated with the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. La Nina is linked to good monsoon rainfall in the Indian sub-continent. In the La Nina year, the winter in India is invariably colder than normal.The IMD chief said maximum (day) temperatures in October are likely to be above normal in most parts of east-northeast and northwest India whereas “normal to below-normal” maximum temperatures are expected in other regions of the country during the month.","The four-month summer (southwest) monsoon season ended on Tuesday with India reporting 8% more than normal rainfall.

There are wide regional variations when it comes to suicides. While Kerala tops the list at 30.6 per lakh population, Bihar has the lowest suicide rate in the country at 0.7.But one factor stands out sharply: income. A vast majority of victims came from households earning less than Rs 1 lakh a year, showing how poverty and financial insecurity push people to the edge. The less educated are also more vulnerable. More than four in five victims had not studied beyond higher secondary school.Men in their 30s and early 40s were the most affected, while among women the highest toll fell on those aged 18 to 30. Strikingly, among children under 18, more girls died by suicide than boys, as opposed to the trend visible in every other age group.","Kerala tops the list at 30.6 per lakh population, Bihar has the lowest suicide rate in the country at 0.7.

States high on crime, low on murders

Going by the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Delhi is the country’s crime capital. Per lakh population, 1508.9 cases of IPC were recorded in 2023. Kerala is second on this list with 721.7 IPC cases per lakh population. Among major states and UTs, Jharkhand had the fewest reported cases at 126.6 per lakh population.That would make Delhi almost 12 times more unsafe than Jharkhand, and Kerala about six times so. But — and this is where the story takes an unexpected twist — the chances of getting murdered in Jharkhand is almost one and a half times more than in Delhi, and nearly three times higher than in Kerala.So, are we to believe that Jharkhand has a fantastic record in controlling all other crimes except the most heinous one — murder? On the contrary, this is likely a case of gross under-reporting. Delhi and Kerala have much better policing, and a much more rigorous reporting of crime.Delhi is ranked first in overall crime, but is eighth when it comes to murders. Kerala is ranked second in overall crime and 22nd in murder. Jharkhand, on the other hand, is ranked 22nd in overall crime and ranks first in murder. Similarly, Punjab and Assam are ranked 19th and 20th in overall crime and 7th and 4th in murder.Haryana, Telangana, Odisha and Tamil Nadu have the minimum gap in their overall crime rate and the rate of murder and culpable homicide, probably indicating a better capture of both data sets.","Delhi is ranked first in overall crime, but is eighth when it comes to murders.

Accidental deaths

NEW DELHI: A staggering 1,217 lives were lost daily in accidents in 2023, an increase of around 3% over the previous year, according to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report.While fatalities due to forces of nature, such as lightning, avalanche, flood and landslide, saw a decline of nearly 20%, the overall increase in deaths — more than 4.4 lakh in 2023 — was on account of other reasons, like road and rail accidents , electrocution, poisoning, sudden deaths, stampede, falls and deaths by animals.Traffic accidents — road and rail — had the maximum share of around 45% of all such deaths, followed by sudden deaths (14.3%) and drowning (8.5%) in 2023, data showed.While road crashes claimed around 1.74 lakh lives — a little more than the road transport ministry’s report of 1.73 lakh for the same period — deaths on railway track and crossings claimed 24,000 lives.

Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh reported the maximum number of fatalities in rail accidents — 3,445 and 3,149 respectively.In 2023, among all rail accidents, there were 56 cases due to fault of driver while another 43 mishaps took place due to mechanical defects, such as poor design, track faults, bridge or tunnel collapse.The report stated that there was a 12.3% increase in sudden deaths, which includes heart attacks, in 2023 over the previous year. In total, 63,609 people died due to sudden deaths. Data showed that heart attacks claimed 35,637 lives in 2023 compared to 32,410 in 2022.

Revision Done,Stage Set ForState Poll Dates

3.7L electors, declared ‘ineligible’, deleted from EC’s Bihar draft roll

PATNA: Bihar will have a total electorate of 7.4 crore when state assembly elections are held, according to the final electoral roll published on Tuesday by the Election Commission of India . Overall, the voter count has dropped by 6%.The final number of voters arrived at after completion of the special intensive revision (SIR) has fallen by about 47 lakh from the 7.9 crore it was on June 24, before the exercise. But it has 17.9 lakh more voters compared to the draft roll, which had 7.2 crore on Aug 1 after 65 lakh names were deleted, show details issued by EC.The release of the rolls kicked off the drill for announcement of poll dates. EC had indicated CEC Gyanesh Kumar and his two colleagues would visit Bihar before announcement of dates, around Oct 5-6.The names of another 3.7 lakh electors, declared “ineligible”, were deleted from the draft list, while 21.5 lakh new ones were added, taking the final figure to 7.4 crore. There may be a small change in the final number as supplementary lists are published during the poll process.While the number of names removed is far less than what was being anticipated, a break-up of caste- and community-wise deletions will determine the response of parties to the SIR process carried out by the EC.The exercise dominated the buildup to the polls, relegating regular issues to the periphery. On Tuesday, the responses of opponents of SIR were muted in comparison to the earlier high-wattage protests against the exercise.However, that might change. EC said those eligible and wanting their names included in theroll could still do so up to 10 days before the last date for filing nominations for the assembly polls. Those not satisfied can file a first appeal with the district magistrate under Section 24 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, and a second appeal before the chief electoral officer, it said.The opposition had objected strongly to the SIR after the names of 65 lakh voters were initially dropped from the electoral roll on various grounds. The first major protest had been Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s statewide ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ from Sasaram, a Dalit bastion, on Aug 17, as the entire opposition rallied behind him. He was supported by RJD neta Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, CPI-ML general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahani, among others.","Bihar will have a total electorate of 7.4 crore when state assembly elections are held, according to the final electoral roll published on Tuesday.

Prepare to deal with biothreats , says CDS



NEW DELHI: With the Army , Navy and Air Force yet to resolve their differences over the creation of integrated theatre commands, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said the armed forces must break their old institutional silos and move together towards “jointness” to deal with adversaries and challenges across all domains, including cyber & information warfare.The evolving character of warfare, combined with the complex interplay of traditional and non-traditional threats, makes jointness “a core operational necessity” and a fundamental requirement for national security rather than a matter of choice, Singh said.“While each of our Services possesses the capacity to respond independently, the interconnected nature of land, sea, air, space & cyberspace makes collaborative strength the true guarantor of victory,” he said, speaking at a seminar organised by IAF.“Our govt’s objective is to further promote jointness & integration among the three Services. This is not only a matter of policy but a matter of survival in the fast-changing security environment.”India must step-up preparedness to deal with biothreats as well as radiological contamination from nuclear weapons in the future, even though the possibility of the latter is low, CDS General Anil Chauhan said on Tuesday.Noting that the world has been through a period of intense trials and tribulations during Covid-19 pandemic, the CDS said biothreats — man-made, accidental or natural — are likely to increase in future. “While possibility of use of nuclear weapons in our context is low, it is prudent to take this into our security calculus,” he said.","India must step-up preparedness to deal with biothreats as well as radiological contamination from nuclear weapons in the future, says CDS General Anil Chauhan. “Our govt’s objective is to further promote jointness & integration among the three Services,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124244172,imgsize-1158104,width-400,resizemode-4/rajnath-singh.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday searched six premises in connection with a case of money laundering against Anil Ambani and R-ADAG entities.Sources said the searches were a part of the investigation into overseas remittances by Reliance Infrastructure, allegedly in violation of certain regulations of Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema).In a statement, Reliance Infrastructure said Tuesday’s searches were related to matters dating back to 2010, when the company had awarded an EPC contract for construction of JR toll road (Jaipur-Ringas highway) to Prakash Asphaltings & Toll Highways.“This was a domestic contract with no foreign exchange involved. The work was completed, and the company has no continuing connection or relationship with the said contractor. The toll road has been with NHAI for the last four years,” it said, adding that the company and its executives are fully cooperating with ED in its probe.On Aug 5, Ambani was questioned at ED headquarters in connection with another money laundering probe against him and his entities, and his Cuffe Parade residence was searched by CBI on Aug 23 as a follow-up of an FIR registered by the anti-corruption agency for alleged “misappropriation of funds” received from SBI During his visit to ED headquarters, Ambani was asked about his foreign assets and other transactions, both in India and overseas. Some of his other close associates have also been questioned over the past two months in the same case.ED is probing alleged laundering of public money exceeding Rs 20,000 crore, some of which was allegedly siphoned outside the country through “undisclosed foreign bank accounts and foreign assets” created over the years.","ED searches six premises in connection with a case of money laundering against Anil Ambani and R-ADAG entities.

NEW DELHI: No flying training organisation (FTO) in India has been placed in the top A+ or A category in the first ever ranking done of flying schools here by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.This ranking — a brainchild of DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai — was to start from Oct 1 and the regulator made the list public on Tuesday. Based on multiple parametres like safety record and time taken to complete required flying to earn a commercial pilot licence (CPL), these two categories require a score of 70% and above.Thirteen FTOs have found a place in the B category — with scores between 50% and 70%. These include Chimes Aviation Academy, SVKM's NMIMS Academy of Aviation Shirpur, Bihar Flying Club, Orient Flights Aviation Academy, Skynex Aero, FSTC Flying School, Patiala Aviation Club, Haryana Institute of Civil Aviation, Jet Serve Aviation, Nagpur Flying Club, National Flying Training Institute, Banasthali Vidyapith Gliding & Flying Club and Rajiv Gandhi Academy for Aviation Technology.Twenty-two FTOs have been placed in the C category, which is for those with score below 50%. DGCA sends them “a notice for self-analysis towards improvement of their performance.” Govt-owned Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRUA) which comes under the Union aviation ministry also falls in this category.This is the first time FTOs have been ranked in India. “The idea is to improve FTOs in terms of both safety record and making them student-friendly.There will be lot of churn and improvement among the schools to either improve or retain their ranking — and become attractive enough for students. We hope to see some FTOs in A category next time,” said sources.FTO ranking will be published bi-annually, “preferably on October 1and April 1 of every year.” FTOs scoring 85% and above will be ranked A++; 70-84.99% as A+; 50%-69.99% A and below 50% as B. “Category ‘B’ FTOs will receive a notice from DGCA for self-analysis towards improvement of their performance.”FTOs are being ranked on several key parameters like safety record and time taken to complete 200 hours of flying — which is among the things required to earn commercial pilot licence (CPL). This will help budding pilots help choose “good” schools. Currently even after paying several lakhs, they have to virtually “beg” to get their flying hours at a majority of the schools.Through ranking, Govt wanted FTOs to improve on all counts, with safety being key along with timely completion of flying, in order to get better rankings and therefore attract students. While being a regulated sector, a majority of FTOs in India are anything but student-friendly and that forces large number of budding pilots to go abroad every year to earn their CPLs.“This is part of DGCA’s continued commitment to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of pilot training in India, while fostering a performance-driven and transparent training ecosystem. (Ranking) holds FTOs accountable for maintaining regulatory compliance and operational standards. Aspiring pilots and their families often struggle to identify credible FTOs. A ranking system serves as a reliable guide, helping them choose institutions based on quality, safety, and training outcomes rather than mere location or fees,” the regulator says.Apart from these actors, the DGCA sees ranking system will “ensure training quality and standardisation; enhance transparency and accountability; guidance for student pilots; aid in identifying high-performing FTOs for expansion or international collaboration, and underperforming ones for closer monitoring or corrective action.”All FTOs will have to submit performance data within the stipulated timelines for the scoring to be done in time. “DGCA reserves the right to verify submitted data through audits and inspections. Misreporting or non-compliance may adversely affect ranking and may invite regulatory action.

NEW DELHI: After flying schools, India could soon now start ranking organisation conducting aircraft maintenance engineering (AME) courses — thereby allowing students who wish to pursue this field make an informed choice. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) will for the first time rank flying training organisations (FTOs) starting Oct 1 — a brainchild of DG Faiz Ahmed Kidwai. “We plan to start ranking AME institutes shortly. The preparatory work has started,” said sources.FTOs are being ranked on several key parameters like safety record and time taken to complete 200 hours of flying — which is among the things required to earn commercial pilot licence (CPL). This will help budding pilots help choose “good” schools. Currently even after paying several lakhs, they have to virtually “beg” to get their flying hours at a majority of the schools. The proposed ranking for AME institutes could have a similar focus on both the quality of training being imparted and how friendly — or otherwise — they are for students.Sources say the ranking system for FTOs has led to pressure on schools to improve their performance and become attractive for students. This pressure, say people in the know, has led to schools also seeking faster clearances from DGCA to cut delays in training. “The cumulative impact will be a win-win for students pilots and the future of Indian aviation with our aim to be a(self reliant) in the field. Govt is looking for a similar positive impact in the field of AME trading by improving things for students,” said sources.TOI had first reported the plan of DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai to rank flying schools in India on March 24, 2025. Through this move, Kidwai wanted flying training organisations (FTOs) to improve on all counts, with safety being key along with timely completion of flying, in order to get better rankings and therefore attract students.

What is TrumpRx? Donald Trump announces new website to offer discounted drug prices; savings expected to reach 50%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/what-is-trumprx-donald-trump-announces-new-website-to-offer-discounted-drug-prices-savings-expected-to-reach-50/articleshow/124246331.cms,"AP file photo





US president Donald Trump on Tuesday announced the launch of a new federal website, TrumpRx.gov, as part of a deal with Pfizer to offer prescription drugs directly to consumers at discounted prices. The initiative, aimed at cutting healthcare costs, is expected to grow with more deals from other drugmakers in the coming months.The new website is part of a broader push to align US drug prices with those in other developed nations, a strategy known as “most-favored-nation” pricing. Under the deal, Pfizer agreed to offer the same prices for new drugs in both the US and other advanced markets.“The United States is done subsidizing the health care of the rest of the world,” Trump said in a press conference. ""They put all of that on us, and yet they were the beneficiaries too. So it's been changed.""A senior administration official said Tuesday that the TrumpRx site, set to launch in early 2026, will not directly sell or distribute medications. Instead, consumers will be able to search for their prescriptions and be redirected to drugmakers’ direct-to-consumer platforms, as cited by CNN.Pfizer said most of its primary care drugs will be offered through TrumpRx, though it did not specify which ones.The company also announced plans to invest an additional $70 billion (£52 billion) in US manufacturing, research, and development.""We now have the certainty and stability we need on two critical fronts, tariffs and pricing,” Pfizer’s chief executive, Albert Bourla, said, as reported by the BBC.According to a company press release, direct-to-consumer prices for Pfizer drugs on TrumpRx.gov will average 50 percent lower. However, key details on how those discounts were determined were not provided. “Specific terms of the agreement remain confidential,” the release stateThe administration on Tuesday clarified that “Most Favored Nation” pricing is based on a drug’s net price, including discounts and rebates, compared with the lowest price in other wealthy countries such as Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, Switzerland, and Denmark. This lowest international price then serves as the benchmark for US pricing.Pfizer, the first drugmaker to fully meet the demands outlined in Trump’s July letter to industry CEOs, plans to offer Medicaid “Most Favored Nation” pricing starting in early 2026, with the president indicating other companies may follow.Trump has often highlighted that Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs than people in other developed nations, especially in Europe, where governments frequently set prices. A Health and Human Services report last year found US drug prices to be nearly three times higher than in comparable countries. During his first term, Trump unsuccessfully pushed for a “Most Favored Nation” pricing policy to address the gap.","Donald Trump on Tuesday announced the launch of a new federal website, TrumpRx.gov, as part of a deal with Pfizer to offer prescription drugs directly to consumers at discounted prices.

Post Office Small Savings Schemes Latest Interest Rate October-December 2025: The government has kept the interest rates for all small savings schemes, also popularly known as post office savings schemes, unchanged for the October to December 2025 quarter. This means that you will continue to earn the same interest rate on schemes like Public Provident Fund (PPF), Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS), National Savings Certificate, Kisan Vikas Patra, and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.The interest rates for these schemes, which are mainly managed by post offices and banks, have been unchanged for several quarters now. The last adjustments to certain schemes were made in the fourth quarter of 2023-24. The government maintains its practice of declaring interest rates for small savings schemes on a quarterly basis.As per the latest notification, the government has maintained the interest rates for key savings instruments, with the Public Provident Fund (PPF) offering 7.1%, whilst the National Savings Certificate yields 7.7%. Both the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY) deliver 8.2% returns.These small savings schemes are commonly referred to as post office schemes.A circular released by the Department of Economic Affairs, operating under the Finance Ministry, confirmed these rates on September 30, 2025.Post Office Savings Scheme rates are determined according to the Shyamala Gopinath Committee framework. These guidelines stipulate that small savings instruments' returns should correspond to secondary market yields on comparable Central Government Securities, incorporating a supplementary margin of 25 basis points.The computation of interest rates for 5-year time deposits should mirror the secondary market performance of 5-year G-secs, with an additional 25 basis points.Whilst the prescribed methodology indicates that falling repo rates and bond yields should trigger proportional decreases in small savings rates to maintain market alignment, the government's ultimate determinations sometimes deviate from these precise numerical computations.","The interest rates for these schemes, which are mainly managed by post offices and banks, have been unchanged for several quarters now.

‘End Of Trump…’: US Govt Heads For Shutdown? JD Vance’s Emergency Declaration | Watch

Why stakes are higher this time

Deep political divide

Who will be impacted?





The United States has entered a federal government shutdown, the first in nearly seven years, after Senate Democrats blocked a Republican-backed funding bill. The impasse was triggered by deep partisan divisions over spending and health care, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees furloughed and government operations disrupted.The Senate vote on Tuesday night fell 55–45, short of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster and pass the legislation, which would have extended federal funding for seven weeks. The bill’s defeat ensures a shutdown at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, as Democrats refused to back the measure without concessions on health care subsidies, while President Donald Trump and Republicans insisted on a “clean” continuing resolution.Since the 1977 fiscal year, the US government has experienced 20 funding gaps, often lasting just a day. Wednesday’s shutdown marks the 21st such event. The last full shutdown in 2013 saw around 850,000 federal workers furloughed without pay.The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the current closure could see 750,000 staff furloughed, costing $400 million per day in lost compensation.According to a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), current federal funding levels “expire at 11:59 p.m.tonight,” officially declaring a government shutdown. The memo warned agencies to “execute their plans for an orderly shutdown,” though certain functions such as NASA space missions, immigration enforcement, and some public health activities at the FDA and USDA will continue.“Unfortunately, Democrat senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate due to Democrats' insane policy demands, which include $1 trillion in new spending,” the OMB memo stated.Millions of federal employees face furloughs or working without pay. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated around 750,000 federal workers would be affected, with a total daily cost of roughly $400 million in lost compensation. While workers in essential roles—such as air traffic controllers, law enforcement, and Social Security operations—will continue working, many services, including passport processing, national park operations, and regulatory inspections, are likely to halt.Despite the disruption, members of Congress will continue to receive paychecks, protected under Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution. “The Constitution says members will be paid,” Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, told reporters.The shutdown follows a bitter standoff over temporary funding measures. Democrats demanded extensions of Affordable Care Act subsidies and reversals of Medicaid cuts as part of a deal, while Republicans argued these policy issues should be considered separately. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he hoped the bill’s defeat “will open lines of communications” with Republicans, but Senate votes indicated little movement toward compromise.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., emphasised the urgency of health care concerns: “If the president were smart, he'd move heaven and earth to fix this health care crisis right away, because Americans are going to hold him responsible when they start paying $400, $500, $600 a month more on their health insurance.”President Trump, meanwhile, defended the GOP-led funding bill and framed the shutdown as a tool to advance his political agenda. “A lot of good can come down from shutdowns,” he said, including the ability to cut programmes “that Democrats like.”The White House had attempted to ensure military personnel would continue receiving pay, but efforts were unsuccessful. Vice President JD Vance warned the country was “headed into a shutdown” due to Democratic “obstruction.”Government shutdowns historically cause significant disruption. Essential services persist, but non-essential operations stop. Past shutdowns have closed national parks, delayed tax refunds, paused federal grants and permits, and disrupted inspections by the FDA and Environmental Protection Agency.Mandatory programmes like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid continue, but administrative support may be delayed, affecting benefit distribution and enrolments. Contractors and temporary staff often face financial losses, while federal employees endure missed paychecks. Prolonged shutdowns can weaken consumer confidence and slow economic growth, with the 2018–19 closure estimated to have cost $3 billion in GDP.The OMB has issued contingency plans to manage federal operations, warning that some layoffs could become permanent, a departure from previous shutdowns where furloughs were largely temporary. Analysts and unions have criticised the approach, warning that public trust in government and employee morale could suffer long-term consequences.","US government enters shutdown after Senate Democrats block Republican-backed funding bill. 750,000 federal employees face furloughs or working without pay.

Poll Is the $100,000 fee for new H-1B applications justified? Yes, it's needed for regulation No, it's excessive

""Wonderful Opportunity"" for Canada





President Donald Trump's decision to significantly increase the fee for H-1B visa has prompted an immediate reaction from business world, political leaders and more. The change in H-1B visa has also drawn attention of Canada's political leadership and industry. Several business experts and industry expert in Canada have urged Canadian government to seize the moment and open its doors to highly skilled professionals.The US announcement late last week to charge $100,000 for new H-1B applications has stunned American technology companies that rely on the program to employ foreign workers. Experts believe the move will severely limit opportunities for highly educated foreigners, particularly recent international graduates of U.S. universities.The call to attract and retain the talent left stranded by the H-1B changes appears to have the attention of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. In a recent speech before the Council of Foreign Relations in New York City, Carney highlighted Canada's homegrown research and AI talent, noting that ""unfortunately, most of them go the U.S.""He then addressed the US policy change directly, quipping, ""I understand you're changing your visa policy.Maybe we can hang on to one or two of them.""Immigration lawyer Evan Green stated that the situation presents ""a wonderful opportunity for the Canadian government to take advantage of.""His sentiment is echoed by the non-profit group Build Canada, which has released a memo urging the country ""to move fast.""

While the White House stated that the change doesn't affect current H-1B holders and is expected to face legal challenges, the uncertainty is already driving workers to look elsewhere.Canada immigration challengesDespite the clear opportunity, some industry observers caution that those looking north for an alternative may find that Canada's immigration system presents its own set of challenges.","President Donald Trump's decision to significantly increase the fee for H-1B visa has prompted an immediate reaction from business world, political leaders and more.

Poll Do you agree with Jensen Huang's view that American companies should compete openly in China? Yes, it's beneficial for both countries No, it poses risks to national security

China-US geopolitical tensions





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again made an urgent appeal to Washington, arguing that allowing American technology companies to compete openly in China serves the best interests of both the countries. On the tech podcast BG2, a podcast hosted by tech investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley, Huang emphasized that a competitive presence in China would enable the US to ""proliferate the technology around the world"" and ""maximise America’s economic success and geopolitical influence.""Huang also expressed hope that China would remain open to outside investment, noting Beijing's pledges to maintain an ""open market."" ""What’s in the best interest of China is for foreign companies to invest in China, compete in China and for them to also have vibrant competition themselves,"" he said.Huang highlighted the rapid advances and robust potential of China's chipmaking industry, cautioning that the country is ""nanoseconds behind"" the US. ""We’ve got to go compete,"" he asserted, pointing to China's deep talent pool, hustling work culture, and intense internal competition across its provinces.He described the environment as a ""vibrant, entrepreneurial, hi-tech, modern industry.""Nvidia's Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the essential backbone for training and running artificial intelligence (AI) models, a factor that has propelled the company's market capitalization to record highs. However, this success has been complicated by escalating geopolitical tensions, which have severely disrupted sales in China, one of the world's largest markets.Earlier this year, the US temporarily blocked exports of the H20, a downgraded chip designed to comply with restrictions, before relenting after a 15% levy to the US government was agreed upon. In August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal under which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of Chinese sales of the H20 going to the US government.In a related news, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang welcomed President Donald Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program but warned that the new $100,000 application fee may be prohibitively expensive, potentially driving tech investment and talent away from the United States.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says U.S. companies should be able to compete openly in China.

Accenture: Building an AI workforce







Accenture has reportedly laid off thousands of employees across the globe in the past three months. During earnings call, the company said that it is laying off employees that cannot be trained in AI, as Accenture looks to reshape its workforce for the AI era. It further added that it plans to expand headcount in the coming fiscal year.During the earnings call Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said that the company has been ""exiting"" employees it can't retrain with artificial intelligence skills. “We are exiting on a compressed timeline, people where reskilling, based on our experience, is not a viable path for the skills we need. And, we're continuously identifying areas of how we operate Accenture to drive more efficiencies, including through AI in order to create more investment capacity,” Accenture CEO said.At the end of August, Accenture’s global headcount stood at 779,000, down from 791,000 three months earlier. ""In FY26, we expect to increase our headcount overall across our three markets, including in the US and Europe, reflecting the demand we see in our business,"" said Julie Sweet. The restructuring at the company majorly covers severance costs and is said to save more than $1 billion for the company. Accenture CFO Angie Park said that the company will also divest two acquisitions as part of what the company calls “rapid talent rotation.” ""Before I move on to the details of the quarter, I want to spend a moment on the six-month business optimization program we initiated in Q4, for which we recorded a charge of $615 million and expect to record an additional approximately $250 million in Q1, for a total of approximately $865 million over the period. The business optimization program has two parts. One related to rapid talent rotation that Julie mentioned, which reflects severance associated with headcount reductions that we are making in a compressed timeline, and second, related to the divestiture of two acquisitions that are no longer aligned with our strategic priorities. These actions will result in cost-savings, which will be reinvested in our people and our business,"" he said.While trimming roles that don’t align with its future needs, Accenture is said to be aggressively expanding its AI capabilities. The company has revealed that it has doubled down on its AI and data specialists to 77,000 since 2023 and has also trained more than 550,000 employees in generative AI. “Advanced AI is becoming a part of everything we do,” Sweet said, adding that the company views AI not as “deflationary” but “expansionary. ”Despite the layoffs, Accenture reported a 7% year‑on‑year revenue increase to $17.6 billion in the June–August quarter of fiscal 2025, beating estimates. Sweet said the results demonstrate Accenture’s “unique ability to deliver for clients as they seek our help to reinvent and lead with AI.”It is quite clear that Accenture’s restructuring mirrors the trend across companies. Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft and others have also cut down on traditional job roles along with ramping the AI hiring process. For white-collar professionals, the message is clear: adapt to AI or risk obsolescence.","Accenture has reportedly laid off thousands of employees across the globe in the past three months.

Trump's $100K H-1B fee creates opportunities, not obstacles for Accenture



Accenture reports strong Q4 results despite immigration policy uncertainty





Accenture CEO Julie Sweet downplayed concerns about the Trump administration's new $100,000 H-1B visa fee, stating the policy change poses minimal threat to the global consulting giant's operations. ""This is really a non-issue because we only have about 5% of our people in the US on H-1B visas, and they're for really specialised experience and skills for our clients,"" Sweet said during the company's earnings call Thursday following its fourth-quarter results announcement.The Dublin-based company's limited reliance on H-1B visas contrasts sharply with many Indian IT firms that depend heavily on the program to staff US projects with skilled workers from abroad. Accenture secured approval for 1,568 H-1B visa beneficiaries in the first half of the year, placing it among the top 25 US employers using the program, according to US immigration data.President Trump's executive order signed September 19 mandates the hefty one-time fee as part of broader immigration reforms, creating uncertainty across the technology sector. The move threatens the traditional cost-saving model many IT service providers rely on.Rather than viewing the policy as problematic, Sweet framed it as a business opportunity. ""Every time there's a big policy change, unfolded over decades, it has usually driven more business for the company,"" she explained, noting Accenture could help clients navigate compliance requirements.The announcement came as Accenture reported strong fourth-quarter results, with revenue of $17.6 billion beating analysts' average estimate of $17.36 billion. The company also unveiled an $865 million restructuring program to realign its workforce for rising demand in digital and AI services.Accenture employs over 770,000 people globally, with more than 350,000 based in India—its largest workforce concentration. The company has steadily reduced H-1B dependency over recent years, with initial approvals dropping from 3,442 in 2015 to just 190 in the first nine months of 2025.In other news, Box CEO Aaron Levie is pushing back against President Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, warning the policy will give large tech companies an unfair advantage over cash-strapped startups in the competition for global talent.","Accenture CEO Julie Sweet downplayed concerns about the Trump administration's new $100,000 H-1B visa fee.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said.

Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Gold price prediction today: Will stellar gold rally run continue in the near term?

(AI image)

Gold Price Outlook:

Weekly View: Volatile week ahead for precious metals

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price prediction today: Gold and silver prices are poised for a long-term bull run, though there may be short term volatility due to global factors, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. He shares his views and recommendations for gold and silver investors:Gold continued to shine bright at the start of the current week, climbing past $3,800 per oz for the first time ever in Spot markets. The Yellow metal printed yet another all-time high near $3,871 in Spot on Tuesday after spending much of last week consolidating just below the previous all-time high near $3,791. This was due to positive momentum which returned following the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report. While the data came in broadly as expected, bets remain elevated that the US Fed might continue easing its rates in the upcoming meeting in October favoring sentiments in Gold & Silver.Meanwhile in the current week the US faces the risk of a government shutdown effective 1st October unless Congress agrees on new funding legislation. Republican leaders in the House pushed a stopgap bill to extend funding through November 21, but Senate Democrats have refused to back it without policy concessions.The dollar had suffered from rising risk of a US government shutdown and falling oil prices since the weekend, with safe haven currencies like yen emerging as the top performer. President Trump had already stated that a shutdown is now likely after little progress on congressional negotiations. In case of a shutdown, a lower Yen may well remain the favourite trade as history shows it lost 1.5% during the 2018-19 shutdown.Finally, focus also remains on US data due later in the week, with the closely monitored JOLTS report due on Tuesday followed by Payrolls on Friday. An upside surprise in US payrolls may bring in volatility in prices, but data might also be delayed due to the risk of shutdown. An extended shutdown may also result in profit booking moves in global equities leading to risk of a near term correction in prices especially in Silver complex.Brace for high volatility in bullion prices especially in silver, on a weekly basis as markets witness a data heavy week along with US shutdown risk to persist in the current week. The department of labor had said that the release of economic data, including Non farm payrolls would be suspended if a US shutdown takes place, which could again bring back safe haven appeal in gold on medium term basis.Any major corrective move in global equities in case of US shutdown in near term, needs to be watched out which could limit upside especially in silver prices. This is due the fact that silver had already witnessed a run up of up to 50 % in prices since 21st of April, the day where Gold hit an all time peak, while gold prices are up only 12 – 13 % since then.Again Gold/Silver ratio which has declined to almost 80 levels on Friday (in International Spot markets) from a high of 107 hit on 21st April is now poised to bounce back in near term to 84 – 85 levels indicating Silver may witness more downside moves as compared to Gold in near term.However from a medium to long term perspective, Gold is still poised to continue its bull run as it may test a level $ 3,950 – 4,000 per oz in spot markets by the end of 2025 or by the start of next year. Long term bias in Silver prices also remains positive as a breach of all-time highs in International markets (hit in Apr 2011 around $ 49.60) could be witnessed by the start of next year.","Gold and silver prices are poised for a long-term bull run, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

takes the trust crown, but at what cost?

Proof that responsible AI pays off

A pivotal moment for AI’s trust equation

For the good of society, businesses and employees: trust in AI is imperative

In order to achieve this, the AI industry must increase the success rate of implementations, humans must critically review AI results, and leadership must empower the workforce with AI

Disclaimer: This article has been produced by SAS Institute by Times Internet’s Spotlight team.

Artificial intelligence has moved from pilot projects to mainstream use, powering everything from predictive analytics to conversational assistants. Organisations are no longer debating if AI should be adopted, but rather how it can be applied responsibly and effectively. This shift has brought forward an urgent question: can AI systems be trusted to deliver accurate, fair, and explainable outcomes?Public perception adds to the complexity. Generative AI tools have quickly entered the mainstream, often treated as authoritative despite risks of bias, hallucinations, or limited explainability. Business leaders are caught between accelerating innovation and ensuring responsible oversight. This tension between confidence and caution defines today’s debate on AI trust.A new IDC study, The Data and AI Impact Report: The Trust Imperative, commissioned by Data and AI leader SAS, explores this paradox. It examines how business and IT leaders perceive trust in different AI technologies, the safeguards being applied, and the business impact of building AI responsibly.Nearly half (48%) of global IT and business leaders report “complete trust” in generative AI (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT, more than in any other form of AI. By comparison, just 18% say they fully trust traditional AI models such as machine learning, despite their longer track record of reliability and explainability. In other words, GenAI is viewed as more than 200% more trustworthy than traditional AI, even though the latter is more established and explainable.Agentic AI also earned notable confidence, with 33% of respondents reporting complete trust. Meanwhile, 26% expressed strong trust in quantum AI , even though the technology is still in its early stages of application. Almost a third of decision makers said they are already familiar with quantum AI, highlighting how quickly the technology is gaining attention.“Forms of AI with humanlike interactivity and social familiarity seem to encourage the greatest trust, regardless of actual reliability or accuracy,” said Kathy Lange, Research Director of the AI and Automation Practice at IDC. “As AI providers, professionals and personal users, we must ask: GenAI is trusted, but is it always trustworthy?”The survey of 2,375 leaders across regions shows a striking imbalance. While 78% of organisations say they “fully trust” AI, only 40% have invested in safeguards such as governance, explainability, and ethical oversight. Even fewer are acting on governance frameworks: just 2% listed AI governance as a top organisational priority, and under 10% are developing responsible AI policies. IDC warns that deprioritising safeguards could limit the long-term value of AI investments.Respondents also flagged ongoing risks around AI use, with concerns centred on data privacy (62%), transparency and explainability (57%), and ethical use (56%).The study highlights a direct connection between trust practices and outcomes. Organisations identified as “trustworthy AI leaders”, those investing in governance, ethics , and strong data strategies, were 1.6 times more likely to report double or greater ROI on their AI projects. In fact, companies that build trustworthy AI are 60% more likely to achieve significant returns, while those neglecting safeguards risk undermining adoption and performance.Yet barriers remain. Nearly half (49%) of organisations cite fragmented or non-optimised cloud data environments as their biggest obstacle to effective AI use. Other top challenges include weak data governance (44%), shortages of skilled specialists (41%), and difficulty accessing relevant data sources (58%). Concerns about data privacy (49%) and data quality (46%) further constrain impact. As AI systems become more autonomous and deeply integrated into critical processes, the quality, diversity and governance of data directly influence AI outcomes.The findings underscore a paradox: emerging technologies such as GenAI and agentic AI are trusted more than established models, despite limited safeguards in place. This disconnect raises concerns about the sustainability of current adoption patterns.,” said Bryan Harris, Chief Technology Officer at SAS. “”, he added.The study makes the stakes clear. On one hand, organisations that embrace responsible practices are already reaping greater returns. On the other, underinvestment in governance and skills could create systemic vulnerabilities as AI adoption deepens. With generative AI rapidly eclipsing traditional AI in visibility and application (81% vs. 66%), the next few years will be pivotal for closing the trust gap between confidence in AI and the trustworthiness of the systems themselves.","A new IDC study, The Data and AI Impact Report: The Trust Imperative, explores this paradox.

Understanding how UAE fuel prices are set

Tips to save on fuel in 2025





The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September. These adjustments align with global oil market trends and are part of the UAE's monthly review process to keep domestic fuel prices in line with international rates.These price changes are determined based on the average global price of oil and are applicable across all Emirates, including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and others. The UAE's approach to fuel pricing ensures that residents and businesses experience consistent and transparent fuel costs. For people commuting daily to work, school, or errands, the small price hike may feel noticeable at the pump. Middle-class and lower-income residents can manage costs by:The recent increase in UAE fuel prices for October 2025 is closely linked to trends in the global oil market, which plays a major role in determining local fuel costs. Factors such as international supply and demand, geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions, and fluctuations in crude oil prices all have a direct impact on the rates residents pay at the pump. For example, disruptions in major oil-exporting countries or unexpected changes in production can quickly drive up global prices, which then filter down to domestic markets. Additionally, seasonal demand spikes, such as increased travel during holidays, can also influence pricing.By understanding these global dynamics, everyday commuters and middle-class families can better anticipate changes and plan their monthly fuel budgets more effectively, rather than being caught off guard by sudden hikes.Fuel pricing in the UAE follows a deregulated model introduced in August 2015, which links local petrol and diesel rates to international oil prices. This policy ensures transparency and aligns retail prices with global market conditions. Each month, the UAE Fuel Price Committee reviews global trends and announces new rates, typically during the final days of the month. These rates take effect from the 1st day of the following month.This approach means UAE motorists feel the impact of both upswings and drops in the international energy market, encouraging more efficient fuel usage while maintaining pricing fairness.Looking to keep more dirhams in your pocket while filling up? Think of it as fuel-saving hacks for everyday heroes. First, carpooling like a boss sharing rides with friends or colleagues not only saves cash but also gives you some gossip time on the road. Next, combine your errands; that extra trip to the supermarket? Toss it in with the school run. Drive like a Zen master gentle acceleration, smooth braking, and no sudden sprints can stretch every litre farther. Don’t forget your car needs TLC too; proper tire pressure and timely servicing mean your engine sips fuel, not gulps it. And if you really want to be clever, fill up during off-peak hours, so you avoid long queues and unnecessary idling. A little planning and some smart moves can turn fuel anxiety into a monthly money-saving win.While the October 2025 fuel price adjustments represent a modest increase, they underscore the UAE's commitment to aligning domestic fuel prices with global market conditions. Staying informed about these changes allows consumers and businesses to plan and adapt accordingly.","The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September.
