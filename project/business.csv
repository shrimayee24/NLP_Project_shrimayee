Canada has so far not shared any evidence to back its case against India, and, according to Indian authorities, Canadian authorities haven’t yet shared details with India about the charges against the arrested Indian men.Speaking about the arrests, Trudeau on Saturday stressed this was important because Canada was a rule of law country with a “strong and independent justice system”. He made the remarks at an event organised in Toronto to celebrate Sikh culture and heritage.“As the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) stated, the investigation remains ongoing, as does a separate and distinct investigation not limited to involvement of the three people arrested yesterday,” said Trudeau, who precipitated a diplomatic crisis with India with his allegations last year in Parliament that Indian agents may have killed Nijjar.Trudeau went on to say that every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free from discrimination and threats of violence in Canada, while acknowledging that, according to local media reports, Sikhs in Canada were feeling unsafe after the killing of Nijjar.The arrests came days after a report by Washington Post identified an Indian official who allegedly masterminded a foiled plot in the US to eliminate another Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun and who may have had a role in similar plots in Canada. Ottawa claims to be coordinating its actions with the US.In another development last week, a Canadian public inquiry, which accused China of meddling in Canada’s electoral process, also named India for foreign interference. While India has not officially responded, govt sources here said the report was a “sham” and a self-serving exercise. On the arrests, sources said the matter could only be looked into if Canada shared details about the charges.On the allegations of Indian involvement, Canada actually has not denied that it has so far not shared any evidence with India. However, it had also said earlier this year that with progress in the investigations, the police would be able to share more information for India to consider.","Canadian PM Justin Trudeau doubled down on the arrests last week of three Indian nationals for the murder of pro-Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

Urban transport set for complete revamp? Metro and bus networks to be integrated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/urban-transport-set-for-complete-revamp-metro-and-bus-networks-to-be-integrated/articleshow/109867265.cms,"Urban transportation set for makeover

Urban transportation set for revamp? The government is planning a comprehensive overhaul of the country’s urban transportation system, focusing on the integration of metro and bus networks while promoting the adoption of clean fuel . The proposed plan aims to address inefficiencies in the current system, where metro and bus routes often overlap without reaching full capacity, leading to reduced revenue and financial viability.To tackle this issue, the government will prioritize integrated planning and route optimization, states an ET report by Twesh Mishra.By aligning bus and metro routes, the authorities aim to improve the viability of both systems. Additionally, incentives will be provided to encourage the use of clean fuel for intracity goods transport, particularly for small trucks .Currently, public bus networks across India are operated by state governments, municipal bodies, or government undertakings such as the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). On the other hand, metro networks are managed by joint ventures between states and the central government, such as the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). A government official said there is a need for synergy between these networks to enhance overall efficiency and effectiveness.The proposed revamp of India's urban transport system is expected to bring about significant changes in the way people commute in cities.The participation of banks and bidders in recent tenders for procuring electric buses has been hindered by the presence of multiple entities vying for the same revenue stream. The responsibility for fixing and collecting fares remains with state government-controlled entities, making bus suppliers reliant on states for recovering their supply costs.An official stated, ""A payment security mechanism will soon be ready for improving the viability of operating bus services. Focus is also on improving non-fare revenue streams to keep the service affordable for commuters."" The official emphasized that public transport systems worldwide, even in developed countries, continue to receive support from government agencies. ""The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport and DTC model for public transport is the solution for improving the viability of buses. The state transport undertaking should make business models for them like real estate management agencies,"" the official added.Also Read | Indian Railways’ big 100-day plan: Vande Bharat sleeper, bullet train, J&K rail project with Chenab bridge & more - check details The government is providing support for the deployment of electric buses through subsidy schemes, but there are no concessions available for commercial vehicles such as large and small trucks. ""Financial support could be offered for electrification of small commercial vehicles that largely move goods within cities. The technology is now established,"" the official said, indicating that incentives will be announced in the near future.The feasibility of large electric trucks for transporting goods over long interstate distances is also being evaluated, and the official added that a new scheme for them will also be necessary.","The government is planning a comprehensive overhaul of the country’s urban transportation system.

The lake’s deterioration is attributed to various factors, including the construction of an embankment that severed its connection to the Yamuna, its primary water source.Additionally, the unchecked disposal of household waste, religious offerings, and dairy waste has exacerbated pollution levels, leading to a loss of biodiversity and aesthetic value.Muzzammil Hussain, a scrap dealer who works nearby, explained, “Due to the scorching heat of Delhi, dumped garbage has dried up and it is very difficult to remove it now.”Locals say the size and shape of the lake have changed over the years as major portions of the waterbody have been consumed by encroachment and slums that have come up in the vicinity.The restoration of Bhalswa Lake is not only crucial for the environment but also for the wellbeing of the local communities and the preservation of Delhi’s natural heritage.","Bhalswa Lake, once a pristine waterbody in northwest Delhi, has faced significant environmental challenges over the years.

Bajrang Punia: Nada suspends Bajrang Punia for not giving sample for dope test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/wrestling/nada-suspends-bajrang-punia-for-not-giving-sample-for-dope-test/articleshow/109869306.cms,"NEW DELHI: National Anti-Doping Agency ( Nada ) has provisionally suspended wrestler Bajrang Punia , four-time World Championships medallist and Tokyo Olympics bronze winner, for his refusal to give his urine sample to dope control officers during the recent selection trials in Sonepat.Bajrang is now staring at a two-year ban and his prospects of competing at the upcoming Paris Olympics also look doubtful.His case will be heard by Nada's anti-doping disciplinary panel (ADDP) where he will be represented by prominent sports lawyer Vidushpat Singhania. Nada has asked Bajrang to file his reply by May 7.In its suspension order, Nada wrote: ""With subject to paragraph 4:1:2 below and in accordance with Article 7.4 of the NADR 2021, you are immediately provisionally suspended from participation in any competition or activity prior to the final decision reached at a hearing in this matter."" Nada's communication was sent to Bajrang on April 23.""If you do not accept the consequences, the case will be resolved without further disciplinary proceedings, subject to the right of appeal. If you disagree, the matter will be referred for adjudication to the anti-doping disciplinary panel (ADDP),"" the order further read.Bajrang had failed to win a spot in the men's freestyle 65kg category at the trials held on March 10 and India were represented by Sujeet Kalkal in the weight division at the qualifiers in Bishkek last month.So far, no Indian wrestlers has been able to qualify in the men's 65kg division. Kalkal will be representing India at the World Olympic qualifiers -- which will also act as the final qualifying tournament for Paris -- starting on May 9 in Istanbul. If Kalkal is able to win a quota place at the meet, he could potentially face Bajrang at a selection trial later this month. Since, the quota place belongs to the country, the WFI will have trials between the winner and other potential challengers to pick the best wrestler for the Games.If the ADDP doesn't give any relief to Bajrang for his indescretion, he would not only be out of the Paris race but might also get banned for two years.Bajrang was earlier warned by the Nada for his whereabouts failures and a similar warning for provisional suspension was issued to him by Nada on April 10, 2024. A copy of the communication is with TOI. An athlete is required to inform about his whereabouts on at least three occasions in a year so that he can be tested for dope by Nada officers on the available dates.Any failure by an athlete to make himself available during those dates tantamount to whereabouts failures and can lead to suspension. In Bajrang's case, according to Nada's letter, no whereabouts was recorded against Bajrang in the last 12 months and it had amounted to ‘missed tests', for which, the wrestler was asked to reply at the earliest.In his defence, Bajrang put out a statement on X, which read, ""I want to clarify that I never refused to give my sample to Nada officials. I requested them to first answer me as to what action they took on the expired kit they brought to take my sample.""When TOI contacted WFI president Sanjay Singh for his response, he expressed his ignorance regarding any communication from Nada and said he got to know about Bajrang's suspension from media outlets. ""We never received any such letter or a copy of order from Nada. We were absolutely clueless. We will be seeking answers from the Nada as to why Bajrang's suspension wasn't shared with us. Also, the WFI will write to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) to make them aware of the matter,"" he said.",National Anti-Doping Agency ( Nada ) has provisionally suspended wrestler Bajrang Punia. Punia refused to give his urine sample to dope control officers during the recent selection trials in Sonepat. He is now staring at a two-year ban and his prospects of competing at the upcoming Paris Olympics also look doubtful. His case will be represented by prominent sports lawyer Vidushpat Singhania.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109869310,imgsize-36150,width-400,resizemode-4/109869310.jpg"

Additional civil judge Indu Sharma also ordered the DMC to pay a compensation of ₹1,000 a day (for homelessness) to the affected families, amounting to ₹13 lakh each.The municipal corporation has been given a one-month deadline to complete the reconstruction.The properties were allegedly under dispute when they were razed during the pandemic. The victims ’ advocate, Jitendra Kumar, said that the court had pronounced the verdict on April 12. The order, however, came in the public domain on Saturday.“The judge recognised that the municipal corporation’s actions were against the rules, given the ongoing legal dispute. Consequently, the victims are to be compensated for the loss and inconvenience caused by the improper demolition of their homes,” Kumar said.The victims, who were allocated the plots in 1995 due to their ‘backward and Scheduled Caste status’, had built their homes on these lands with their names registered in govt records. However, in 2003, the DMC claimed ownership of land and threatened demolition, leading the victims to obtain a stay order. Despite the pending case, the corporation proceeded with the demolition, prompting the victims to demand reconstruction and compensation.","The properties were allegedly under dispute when they were razed during the pandemic.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
UK PM Sunak promises to work 'as hard as ever' after disastrous local elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-sunak-promises-to-work-as-hard-as-ever-after-disastrous-local-elections/articleshow/109857373.cms,"NEW DELHI: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Sunday vowed to persevere ""as diligently as ever"" following a dismal election outcome that witnessed his Conservative party losing ground across various local authorities and even relinquishing a mayoral stronghold in England's West Midlands region.The British Indian leader expressed his disappointment as Andy Street, the Conservative Party's well-liked mayor of West Midlands, narrowly succumbed to Labour opponent Richard Parker by a mere 1,508 votes, prompting a recount for the closely contested outcome.This outcome leaves Sunak with a solitary glimmer of optimism in Ben Houchen, who managed to retain the party's mayoralty in Tees Valley on Friday amidst a near-complete dominance by Opposition parties, spearheaded by Labour.""It's been disappointing of course to lose dedicated Conservative councillors and Andy Street in the West Midlands, with his track record of providing great public services and attracting significant investment to the area, but that has redoubled my resolve to continue to make progress on our plan,"" British PM said in a statement.""So we will continue working as hard as ever to take the fight to Labour and deliver a brighter future for our country,"" he said.As Tory rebels gather momentum, their focus appears to be shifting from replacing Sunak as party leader to pressuring him to take a tougher stance on core party issues, such as implementing a cap on legal migration and significantly reducing taxes. Leading this push is former home secretary Suella Braverman, who delivered a scathing critique in 'The Daily Telegraph,' urging Sunak to transition away from ""managerialism"" and demonstrate resolute leadership.""Let me cut to the chase so no one wastes time over-analysing this: we must not change our leader. Changing leader now won't work: the time to do so came and went. The hole to dig us out is the PM's, and it's time for him to start shovelling,"" expressed the sacked Indian-origin ex-minister, who is at the forefront of the backbench rebellion.""Either we start fighting to win now, or we'll have no one else to blame when this week's political earthquake is made to look like a mere tremor come the general election night,"" she said.Others have joined in to urge Sunak to ""wake up and smell the coffee,"" pointing to the local election results indicating that the Labour Party is poised for success in an upcoming general election, anticipated later this year.Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer has celebrated his party's ""phenomenal result,"" highlighted by Labour's Sadiq Khan securing a historic third term as London Mayor on Friday.However, Starmer also reached out to voters who expressed discontent over the party's perceived inadequacy in addressing the Israel-Gaza conflict. Analysis revealed that Labour faced setbacks in areas with significant Islamic populations, where voters opted for independents and the anti-war Worker's Party of Britain.""I have heard you. I have listened. And I am determined to meet your concerns and to gain your respect and trust again in the future,"" said Starmer.Overall, the Labour camp will be rejoicing this weekend as it virtually dominated the mayoral elections across England, securing victories in Liverpool, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and Greater Manchester.With the majority of results now tallied from Thursday's local council elections, Labour appears poised to claim over 1,100 seats. The Liberal Democrats surpassed the Tories, securing over 500 seats, while the Conservatives suffered losses of around 400 previously held seats of local councillors. These councillors oversee day-to-day matters such as waste collection, roads, local infrastructure, and crime prevention.(With inputs from agencies)","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak vows to persevere ""as diligently as ever"" British Indian leader expressed his disappointment as Andy Street, the Conservative Party's well-liked mayor of West Midlands, narrowly succumbed to Labour opponent Richard Parker.

"China is buying gold like there's no tomorrow, jacking up prices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-is-buying-gold-like-theres-no-tomorrow-jacking-up-prices/articleshow/109866107.cms,"Often considered a safe investment during times of geopolitical and economic turmoil, gold has soared in price in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the war in Gaza But gold's climb to record highs above $2,400 per ounce has proved more resilient, and lasted longer, because of China. Chinese consumers have flocked to gold as their confidence in investments like real estate or stocks has faltered.At the same time, the country's central bank has steadily added to its gold reserves, while whittling away at its holdings of US debt. And throwing fuel on the fire are Chinese speculators betting there is still room for appreciation.China already held considerable sway in gold markets. But the country's influence has become more pronounced during this latest bull run - a nearly 50% increase in the global price since late 2022. It continued to scale new heights despite factors that traditionally make gold a comparatively less appealing investment: higher interest rates and a strong US dollar. Last month, gold prices vaulted higher even after the US Federal Reserve signalled that it would keep higher interest rates for longer. And it has continued to appreciate even as the dollar has risen against almost every major currency in the world this year.Prices have pulled back to around $2,300 per ounce, but there is a growing sentiment that the gold market is governed no longer by economic factors but by the whims of Chinese buyers and investors. ""China is unquestionably driving the price of gold,"" said Ross Norman, CEO of MetalsDaily, a precious-metals information platform based in London. Gold consumption in the country rose 6% in the first quarter from a year earlier, as per China Gold Association. It came on the heels of a 9% rise last year.Gold investing became more alluring as traditional investments turned lackluster. China's real estate sector remains in crisis. With few better alternatives, money flowed into Chinese funds that traded in gold, and many young people took to collecting beans in tiny quantities as an affordable investment. Another major buyer of gold in China is the country's central bank. In March, the People's Bank of China added to its gold reserves for a 17th straight month. Last year, the bank bought more gold than any other central bank in the world, adding more to its reserves than it had in nearly 50 years. Beijing is buying up gold to diversify its reserve funds and reduce its dependence on USD. China has been reducing its US treasury holdings for more than a decade. As of March, China had about $775 billion worth of US debt, down from about $1.1 trillion in 2021.When China increased its gold holdings in the past, it bought domestically using yuan, said Guan Tao, global chief economist at BOC International in Beijing. But this time, he said, the bank is using foreign currencies to buy gold - effectively reducing its exposure to the USD and other currencies. Many central banks, including China, started acquiring gold after the US took the rare step of freezing Russia's dollar holdings under sanctions imposed on Moscow. Other US allies have imposed similar curbs.Although Beijing has been buying up gold, the metal accounts for only 4.6% of China's foreign exchange reserves. In percentage terms, India holds nearly twice as much of its reserves in gold.","Gold has soared in price in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the war in Gaza.

Russian women prisoners get $2k/mth offer to fight Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russian-women-prisoners-get-2k/mth-offer-to-fight-ukraine/articleshow/109849745.cms,"Berlin: The Russian army is expanding the role of women as it seeks to balance President Vladimir Putin 's promotion of traditional family roles with the need for new recruits for the war in Ukraine .The military's stepped-up appeal to women includes efforts to recruit female inmates in prisons, replicating on a much smaller scale a strategy that has swelled its ranks with male convicts.Recruiters in military uniforms toured Russian jails for women in the fall of 2023, offering inmates a pardon and $2,000 a month - 10 times the national minimum wage - in return for serving in front-line roles for a year, according to six current and former inmates of three prisons in different regions of Russia.Dozens of inmates just from those prisons have signed military contracts or applied to enlist, the women said, a sampling that - along with local media reports about recruitment in other regions - suggests a broader effort to enlist female convicts.It's not just convicts. Women now feature in Russian military recruitment advertisements across the country.A pro-Kremlin paramilitary unit fighting in Ukraine also recruits women. ""Combat experience and military specialties are not required,"" read an advertisement aimed at women that was posted in March in Russia's Tatarstan region. It offered training and a sign-up bonus equivalent to $4,000. ""We have one goal - victory!""Putin has placed women at the core of this vision, portraying them as child-bearers, mothers and wives guarding the nation's social harmony. ""The most important thing for every women, no matter what profession she has chosen and what heights she has reached, is the family,"" Putin said in a speech March 8. These clashing military and social priorities have resulted in contradictory policies that seek to recruit women to the military to fill a need but send conflicting signals about the roles women can assume there.""I have gotten used to the fact that I am often looked at like a monkey - like, 'Wow, she's in fatigues!'"" said Ksenia Shkoda, a native of central Ukraine who has fought for pro-Russian forces since 2014.Some female volunteers do not make it to Ukraine. The convicts who enlisted in late 2023 have yet to be sent to fight, the six former and current inmates said.

Amazon and Google suspend US green card applications for immigrants amid tech layoffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/amazon-and-google-suspend-us-green-card-applications-for-immigrants-amid-tech-layoffs/articleshow/109815272.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amazon and Google have halted US green card applications for immigrants for the year 2024, a decision made against the backdrop of recent tech industry layoffs , including those at Microsoft. The intensifying competition is making conditions increasingly challenging for foreign workers, the Daily Guardian reported.The suspension of the green card application process may exacerbate the difficulties faced by overseas candidates seeking employment in the US, particularly within the tech sector.Both Amazon and Google have paused PERM applications until the following year.PERM, administered by the US Department of Labor, is a procedure aimed at securing permanent labor certification. Its primary objective is to safeguard job opportunities, wages, and working conditions for American workers while admitting foreign workers. Often, PERM serves as the initial stage in the green card acquisition process.Amazon made an internal announcement earlier this year stating its decision to halt all PERM filings through 2024 due to operational constraints. Google similarly suspended its PERM applications in January 2023, coinciding with the layoff of 12,000 employees. Employees were informed that the PERM process would not resume until the first quarter of 2025.Ava Benach, founding partner of Benach Collopy, a distinguished immigration law firm in Washington DC, commented that tech companies are following Google's strategy due to its significant influence in the industry.Collopy said that, “With more US workers available for open positions, the labor market test fails and so the process becomes a waste of time and money for these tech companies.” Collopy explained.“If tech companies have done layoffs relatively recently, they also have to notify laid off workers of new positions that may be going to foreign workers. If some of these people say ‘yes, I’m interested,’ then you’re out of luck with the green card application,” she added, according to the Daily Guardian.","Both Amazon and Google have paused PERM applications until the following year.

California is so competent” he said.Musk, on the other hand, simply posted a sad, crying emoji to convey his sentiments about the boondoggle, which is reportedly at risk of being scrapped.This is happening even though $11 billion of taxpayers' money have already been invested in the high-speed rail project connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco.This sum includes expenses for the bridge and other developments invested in the first phase of the high-speed route, which spans from Bakersfield, north of Los Angeles, to Merced, approximately 80 miles from the Bay Area.The critics were responding to an earlier post by the rail authority, in which they proudly announced that the Fresno River Viaduct in Madera County is one of the “first completed high-speed rail structures.”The authority in a post on X said, “At nearly 1,600 feet long, high-speed trains will travel over the riverbed and will run parallel with the BNSF Railroad.”In response to reports estimating the total cost of completing the rail line at around $100 billion, Markus fired back, saying, “wow so impressive, can’t wait until year 2400 for this to finish for 700 quadrillion dollars.”According to New York Post, Venture Capitalist Patrick Blumenthal suggested that the authority should refrain from self-praise, sharing a detailed breakdown highlighting the lack of progress made by the rail-line project.“0.3 miles completed.

It has the capacity to accommodate up to seven individuals, although Nasa crews typically consist of four members. The capsule's name, chosen nearly a decade ago, is a nod to Boeing's earlier Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner aircraft.Retired Navy captains and veteran Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have spent months aboard the space station in the past, will be at the helm of this test flight. They stepped in after the original crew had to withdraw due to the mounting delays.Wilmore, 61, hails from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and is a former combat pilot, while Williams, 58, from Needham, Massachusetts, is a helicopter pilot.

However, there seems to be an element of hesitancy within the government to engage fully in the investigation, the report noted.A source within the PML-N revealed Nawaz Sharif 's insistence on robust action against the perpetrators, regardless of their political influence. However, there's a noticeable lack of enthusiasm from the current government to involve bodies such as the NAB or FIA in the investigation, despite suggestions, according to Dawn.Information Minister Attaullah Tarar's dismissal of engaging the NAB or FIA raises eyebrows, especially given the magnitude of the alleged scam, which surpasses PKR 500 million, warranting their involvement according to new laws. The government's cautious approach, attributed to the involvement of the former caretaker government, reflects a reluctance to tread on contentious ground.Reports suggesting substantial wheat imports under Shehbaz Sharif's administration post-elections have added another layer to the controversy, the report noted. Denials from government officials contradict the allegations, further complicating the situation. Blame for the wheat crisis is shifted to the caretaker government, distancing the current administration from any culpability.Adding to the confusion are reports of the summoning of former caretaker officials by the fact-finding committee, which were swiftly denied by its head, Kamran Ali Afzal.Tensions continue to escalate within the PML-N, with Hanif Abbasi confronting former caretaker premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar over the wheat scandal. Kakar's veiled threats hint at underlying political manoeuvring, adding intrigue to the unfolding drama. The PTI seized the opportunity to push for a judicial commission, capitalising on the discord within the opposition camp.Amidst the chaos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strived to reassure farmers of his unwavering support.His formation of a committee to address farmers' grievances demonstrates a proactive stance, aiming to alleviate concerns regarding wheat procurement, Dawn reported.","The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive.

From spring offensive to charm offensive: The Taliban are working to woo tourists to Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/from-spring-offensive-to-charm-offensive-the-taliban-are-working-to-woo-tourists-to-afghanistan/articleshow/109713887.cms,"KABUL: Around 30 men are crammed into a Kabul classroom, part of the debut student cohort at a Taliban-run institute training tourism and hospitality professionals.It's a motley crew. One student is a model. Another is 17 and has no job history.The students vary in age, education level and professional experience. They're all men - Afghan women are banned from studying beyond sixth grade - and they don't know anything about tourism or hospitality.But they are all eager to promote a different side of Afghanistan . And the Taliban are happy to help.Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife.And yet, foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence, increased flight connections with hubs like Dubai, and the bragging rights that come with vacationing in an unusual destination. The numbers aren't huge - they never were - but there's a buzz around Afghan tourism.In 2021, there were 691 foreign tourists . In 2022, that figure rose to 2,300. Last year, there were 7,000.Mohammad Saeed, the head of the Tourism Directorate in Kabul, said the biggest foreign visitor market is China because of its proximity and large population. Afghanistan also has advantages over some of its neighbors.""They've told me they don't want to go to Pakistan because it's dangerous and they get attacked. The Japanese have said this to me also,"" Saeed said. ""This is good for us.""But there are disadvantages, too.Visas are difficult and expensive to access. Many countries severed ties with Afghanistan after the Taliban returned to power, and no country recognizes them as the legitimate rulers of the country.Afghan embassies either closed or suspended their operations. There's an ongoing power struggle between Afghanistan's embassies and consulates staffed by people from the former Western-backed administration, and those under the Taliban administration's full control.Saeed concedes there are obstacles for Afghan tourism to develop but said he was working with ministries to overcome them.His ultimate aim is to have a visa on arrival for tourists, but that could be years away. There are problems with the road network, which is half-paved or non-existent in some parts of the country, and airlines largely avoid Afghan airspace.The capital Kabul has the most international flights, but no Afghan airport has direct routes with major tourist markets like China, Europe, or India.Despite the challenges, Saeed wants Afghanistan to become a tourism powerhouse, an ambition that appears to be backed by the Taliban's top leaders.""I have been sent to this department on the instructions of the elders (ministers). They must trust me because they've sent me to this important place.""The students also have aspirations. The model, Ahmed Massoud Talash, wants to learn about Afghanistan's picturesque spots for Instagram posts and its history for media appearances.Business school graduate Samir Ahmadzai wants to open a hotel but thinks he should know more about tourism and hospitality first.""They hear that Afghanistan is backwards, poverty and all about war,"" said Ahmadzai. ""We have 5,000 years of history. There should be a new page of Afghanistan.""Classes include Afghan handicrafts and anthropology basics.An unofficial subject is how to interact with foreign women and how their behavior or habits could clash with local customs and edicts. Examples might be women smoking or eating in public, to mixing freely with men who are not related to them by blood or marriage.The Taliban have imposed a dress code for women and requirements for them to have a male guardian, or mahram, when they travel. Dining alone, traveling alone, and socializing with other women in public have become harder. With gyms closed to women and beauty salons banned, there are fewer places where they can meet outside the home.In a sign that the country is preparing for more overseas visitors, the country's only five-star hotel, the Serena, has reopened its women's spa and salon for foreign females after a monthslong closure.Foreigners must show their passport to access services. Women with ""born in Afghanistan"" on their ID are barred.The restrictions on Afghan women and girls weigh on overseas travel companies, who say they try to focus on the positive aspect of cultural interactions by making donations, supporting local projects or only visiting family-run businesses.Shane Horan, the founder of Rocky Road Travel, said visiting Afghanistan should not be seen as an endorsement of any particular government or political regime.""Ultimately, the goal should be to support responsible tourism practices that contribute positively to the local economy and foster mutual respect and understanding, while also remaining cognizant of the broader political context in Afghanistan.""He said there was no input from authorities about what tour groups saw or did, and that the company worked closely with a women's rights organization in Afghanistan. A percentage of the tour cost went into supporting this organization's programs, Horan added.There are no women at the Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management. The students don't mention it. But an official at the Tourism Directorate does.""It's a heartbreaking situation,"" said the official, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. ""Even female family members ask if they can study here. But there was a change in policy with the change in government. The women who were studying before (the takeover) never came back. They never graduated.""","Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls.

But foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109714068,imgsize-1602274,width-400,resizemode-4/109714068.jpg"

On the day of Harry's event, Charles has a busy schedule, including his weekly audience with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and attending the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season, pending medical advice, according to the Telegraph.Harry and Markle are set to travel to Nigeria later this month for a tour related to the Invictus Games.

Their itinerary includes visits to military rehabilitation centers and sports facilities, as well as meetings with local organizations supporting veterans' welfare. The Nigerian government is reportedly covering the cost of their security during the trip.","Prince Harry has invited his family members to attend the Invictus Games 10th anniversary celebration. However, it is unlikely that any senior members of the royal family will be present at the event.

UK PM Rishi Sunak under pressure amid dire local election results for his party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-rishi-sunak-under-pressure-amid-dire-local-election-results-for-his-party/articleshow/109822902.cms,"LONDON: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's leadership is under severe pressure on Friday as the results of local elections and a crucial by-election poured in overnight, delivering what is being characterised as one of the worst poll outcomes for the governing Conservative Party in 40 years. In a sliver of hope, Tory Mayor Ben Houchen was re-elected for a third term in Tees Valley and gave his party leader something to cheer about amid results Sunak admitted have been ""disappointing"".But rebels from within his party are expected to renew their attacks on the British Indian leader after the Opposition Labour Party made definitive gains, including overturning the Tory majority in the Blackpool South by-election which was necessitated following a resignation amid a lobbying row. Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer declared the result as a ""seismic"" victory and an overall poll verdict in favour of the party as it comes on the eve of a general election, expected later this year.""Blackpool speaks for the whole country...This is the one contest where voters had the chance to send a message to Rishi Sunak's Conservatives directly, and that message is an overwhelming vote for change,"" said Starmer of the by-election.""The message to Rishi Sunak is clear. It's time for change, it's time for a general election,"" he said.The Labour candidate in Blackpool South, Chris Webb, defeated Conservative David Jones in the constituency which the Tories had won from Labour under former prime minister Boris Johnson in 2019. The swing of 26 per cent from the Tories to Labour has been characterised as the third biggest in a by-election since 1945.""We're probably looking at certainly one of the worst, if not the worst, Conservative performance in local government elections for the last 40 years,"" eminent pollster Professor John Curtice told the BBC.The by-election took place alongside local elections around England and Wales, in which voters elected their local councillors who manage day to day issues such as waste collection, roads and local infrastructure as well as crime fighting.""I know that come with the general election they're (voters) going to stick with us because they don't want to be taken for granted. They know that it's you and the Conservatives that are building a brighter future for Teesside and a brighter future for Britain,"" said Sunak as he joined the victorious Mayor Ben Houchen in Tees Valley, northern England.The results will continue to pour in over the weekend, with the overall picture expected to be clear by Sunday. But the early indications are that Labour has taken control of a number of local authorities in the regions that had turned away from the party in favour of the Tories over its anti-Brexit stance.Meanwhile, Tories look set to lose hundreds of seats, with the far-right Reform UK also making some impact. This will also worry the Conservatives for the general election if traditional Tory voters are seen to be drawn to this new avatar of the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party (UKIP). In another trend likely to continue to resonate during a general election, there is evidence in areas with a significant Muslim population that Labour's stance to not strongly condemn Israel in the Gaza conflict is hurting the party.Most of the mayoral results are expected over the weekend, with London's Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan hoping to be re-elected for a third term. He was challenged by British Indian businessman Tarun Ghulati, who thanked voters for the support he received in the campaign.""I had overwhelming support from India and all over the world and want to thank everyone for the support and blessings,"" he said.Among the other mayoral polls, the Tory Mayor of the West Midlands is hoping to hold on to his seats. There other mayoral contests taking place include Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region, with the East Midlands, the North East, and York and North Yorkshire electing mayors for the first time. Besides councillors and mayors, around 37 police and crime commissioners are also being elected in some parts of England and Wales.","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's leadership is under severe pressure.

Mishcon De Reya said its claim filed in the Commercial Court relates to actions taken by the US-headquartered ride-hailing company dating back to 2012 under the private hire vehicle licence granted by Transport for London ( TfL ).It is claimed their operating system did not comply with the requirements of the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1988.

Poll reveals majority of Americans view TikTok as a tool of Chinese influence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/poll-reveals-majority-of-americans-view-tiktok-as-a-tool-of-chinese-influence/articleshow/109782105.cms,"NEW DELHI: A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has highlighted a growing perception among Americans that TikTok is being used by China to manipulate US public opinion. According to the poll, 58% of respondents believe that the Chinese government uses the popular short-video app to influence American views , while only 13% disagreed with this assertion.Amid these concerns, the US government is moving closer to possibly banning TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance.The debate intensified last week when President Joe Biden signed a law mandating ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations within 270 days or face a prohibition. This legislation reflects bipartisan apprehension about the app's potential as a vehicle for foreign influence and data security threats.""TikTok has spent more than $1.5 billion on data security efforts and would not share data on its 170 million US users with the Chinese government,"" the company said, denying any promotion or removal of content at Beijing's request. TikTok further declared its intention to challenge any ban as a breach of free speech rights under the US Constitution, noting past legal successes where a judge in Montana blocked a state-level ban on the app citing free speech concerns.Despite TikTok's assurances, the poll indicates that half of the American adults surveyed support a ban, while 32% are opposed, and the remainder are undecided. The support for a ban is stronger among Americans aged 40 and older, with about 60% in favor, compared to roughly 40% of younger adults aged between 18 and 39.Moreover, 46% of respondents also concurred with the view that China uses TikTok for espionage activities on ordinary Americans, a claim repeatedly denied by Beijing.The app's pervasive influence in America is evident, with even Biden's re-election campaign utilizing it as a strategic tool to engage voters for the upcoming presidential election. The issue has created a split among political figures, including former President Donald Trump, who criticized the potential ban despite owning a competing platform, Truth Social.As the January 19 deadline for TikTok’s sale approaches—one day before Biden's term could end—the future of the app in the US remains uncertain, with potential legal and political battles ahead.",A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has highlighted a growing perception among Americans that TikTok is being used by China to manipulate US public opinion. 58% of respondents believe that the Chinese government uses the popular short-video app to influence American views.

Why many Chinese are upset about Labor Day holiday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/why-many-chinese-are-upset-about-labor-day-holiday/articleshow/109753504.cms,"NEW DELHI: As millions in China brace for the Labor Day holiday , the enthusiasm that typically accompanies the break is notably absent this year. Hao Zeyu, an algorithm engineer, encapsulates the general sentiment as he faces a compressed holiday schedule—out of the five days off, only one counts as a genuine break due to the adjustment of working days around weekends.As per a CNN report, the practice known as ""tiaoxiu"" or adjusted rest, although designed to boost consumption during holidays since its introduction in 1999, is now under scrutiny.This year, the economic backdrop is starkly different; with a post-Covid economic slump gripping the nation, workers are more concerned about job security than holiday spending. The adjustment of workdays has sparked substantial online debate and dissatisfaction, as seen in social media uproar, with hashtags criticizing the tiaoxiu policy amassing over 560 million views.The discontent stems from heightened work demands and economic pressures—issues like a lingering property crisis, faltering foreign investment, and tepid consumer spending are exacerbating the strain on workers. This has transformed the Labor Day holiday from a time of relaxation to a source of stress, with many feeling that the restructured break offers little respite from the relentless work schedule, the CNN report said.Christian Yao, a senior lecturer, notes that these are ""very bumpy years"" for China as it transitions from a manufacturing-focused to a knowledge-based economy . Workers fear job loss and doubt whether alternative employment could offer better compensation, making them reluctant to complain or take additional leave, the CNN report said.Meanwhile, companies like Yum China offer a glimpse of flexibility, not requiring employees to work during designated ""special working days."" In contrast, other companies, especially in the tech sector known for the grueling ""996"" work culture, are seeing a pushback against overwork.","The practice known as ""tiaoxiu"" or adjusted rest, although designed to boost consumption during holidays, is now under scrutiny.
