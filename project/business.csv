Novo's India GGC is the secret sauce behind Ozempic's success,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/novos-india-ggc-is-the-secret-sauce-behind-ozempics-success/articleshow/110752300.cms,"BENGALURU: The secret sauce behind Novo Nordisk 's blockbuster drug, Ozempic , is the Danish pharmaceutical company 's India team, which played a key role in the meteoric rise of the semaglutide-based drug for treating diabetes The success of Ozempic and Wegovy, another semaglutide-based drug for weight management , has not only boosted Denmark ’s economy but also led to Novo Nordisk's market cap surpassing that of Tesla.John Dawber, corporate VP and managing director of global business services at Novo Nordisk, said, ""Medicalized obesity has exploded over the last couple of years, and everybody's interested in it. But Novo Nordisk's research journey started about two decades ago."" The company's research into new treatments for diabetes led to the discovery of benefits of weight management, prompting a separate research programme. Dawber said the demand for these products has surprised the company.The teams in Novo Nordisk Global Business Services (GBS) based in Bengaluru have collaborated with the global teams to contribute towards the Ozempic programme. Dawber said the Bengaluru team collaborates closely with the headquarters on the semaglutide drug, working on clinical trials, biostatistics, data management, pharmacovigilance, and global safety. Currently, it employs 4,000 employees.Dr. Prasanna Kumar T S, VP of global safety in Novo Nordisk GBS, said the role of the biostatistics unit in Bengaluru, which conducts all statistical analysis and reporting for Ozempic. “Our trial statisticians and clinical data scientists engage with the trial squad right from protocol development until the submission of a trial/product to regulatory authorities."" Biostatistics applies statistical methods to health data.Biostatistics, Dawber said, is a highly technical area and something that traditionally the pharma companies keep very close to the headquarters. ""We have a team of 150 biostatistics experts in Bengaluru. The vice president who heads that function also heads the biostatistics team in Denmark and in the US. Something very highly technical like biostats, we have the global leadership sitting here, and they manage teams here and in other geographies,” he said.Kumar said the global medical affairs (GMA) team played a pivotal role in the development of Semaglutide. The global medical affairs team has also been instrumental in generating evidence and understanding semaglutide through investigator-initiated studies. He said the global safety team in Bengaluru is responsible for safety monitoring of Ozempic, analyzing and reporting adverse events. They contribute to producing safety update reports, investigator brochure updates, clinical risk management plans, publications, dossiers, and manuscripts.Novo Nordisk is hiring doctors, pharmacists, statisticians, data engineers, AI experts, and health economists in India, with plans to hire 1,400 people over the next two years. Dawber noted that the company's attrition rates have dropped significantly, from 16% to 18% to just over 7%, indicating that most of the hiring is for new positions rather than replacements. Despite the success of Ozempic, Dawber does not expect the drug to be available in India this year or the next. “The dilemma we face is that the demand for the product currently exceeds our ability to supply, which is frustrating for us and, of course, frustrating for patients. However, we propose to manage this by carefully staging the launches, ensuring we never launch in a country and then find that the demand is too great, forcing us to stop. Such a scenario would be a huge tragedy for the patients and would damage our reputation. While India is a phenomenal market for Novo Nordisk, accounting for about 4% or 5% of our global sales and being the third biggest market in the Asia-Pacific, we will not launch in India until we can be sure that we can guarantee supply,” Dawber added.","Ozempic is a semaglutide-based drug for treating diabetes.

Rupee gains 16p to 83.37 against dollar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rupee-gains-16p-to-83-37-against-dollar/articleshow/110752096.cms,"MUMBAI: The rupee gained 16 paise to close at 83.37 on Wednesday after it seemed more likely that there would be continuity at the Centre with a BJP-led coalition forming govt for the third time.

As election results become clearer after the count, rupee volatility is expected to persist within the range of 83.2-83.6,” said Jateen Trivedi, VP research analyst, LKP Securities.

"‘If tough reforms stall, higher growth potential may be hit’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-tough-reforms-stall-higher-growth-potential-may-be-hit/articleshow/110751761.cms,"Mumbai: The fractured mandate delivered by the 2024 Lok Sabha election will not impinge on the ability of a weaker NDA govt to continue with easy reforms on infrastructure and the public capex push. Economists and ratings agencies , however, say potential higher growth could be dampened if govt is unable to implement the tougher labour and capital reforms.According to Pranjul Bhandari, chief economist at HSBC, govt can opt for easy-to-undertake reforms such as public capex push and support for hightech and newly emerging sectors and still stick to the path of fiscal consolidation. However, hard reforms, which include farm, labour, and land reforms, as well as rationalisation of food and fertiliser subsidies, would be difficult.“If new govt’s focus is on the easy-to-moderate reforms buckets, we believe medium-term annual growth could be on track to reach 6.5%. But if reforms in the moderate-to-hard bucket are done, growth could be 7.5% or more,” said Bhandari.Tanvee Gupta Jain, economist with UBS, places the base case for govt to stick to a medi um-term fiscal consolidation roadmap but with a populist bias. “The higher-than-expected RBI dividend transfer to govt would create fiscal leeway to increase populist spending to support consumption for lower income strata such as cash transfers, higher rural spending, income tax rationalisation, affordable housing, while continuing its thrust to boost public capex,” she said.Jain feels that the implementation of labour laws could still occur as these have already been cleared by both ho uses of Parliament. Govt has consolidated 29 central labour laws out of 44 existing central laws into four labour codes. “We think the next set of reforms in land and capital that markets were hoping for will likely disappoint as political capital is lower vis-a-vis 2019 and 2014 elections,” she added.Christian de Guzman, senior VP with rating agency Moodys, expects policy continuity, especially with regard to govt’s focus on infrastructure. However, the lack of a majority could delay far-reaching economic and fiscal reforms, which could impede progress on fiscal consolidation. Rating agency Fitch also feels that passing contentious reforms could prove more difficult for new govt.",The fractured mandate delivered by the 2024 Lok Sabha election will not impinge on the ability of a weaker NDA govt to continue with easy reforms.

Karnataka HC gives murder convict 30-day parole to carry out conjugal duties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-hc-gives-murder-convict-30-day-parole-to-carry-out-conjugal-duties/articleshow/110748354.cms,"BENGALURU: Karnataka high court recently directed that a murder convict be released on 30 days’ parole , acceding to a petition filed by his wife citing her right to progeny.Neetha G , a resident of Kolar, had sought the release of her husband, Anand, who is incarcerated in Central Prison, Bengaluru. “He shall mark his attendance in the jurisdictional police station, weekly once. It will be the responsibility of police to take him to gaol if the convict evades going back after parole,” Justice SR Krishna Kumar said. Neetha and Anand had fallen in love before he was arrested in the murder case. Anand was sentenced to life imprisonment but the HC later commuted it to 10 years.They married in April last year when he was released on 15 days’ parole to enable him to wed. Neetha sought 90 days’ parole for her husband on the grounds that he has been a life convict for over five years and a month. She pleaded that she lives with her mother-in-law and is deprived of her right to progeny. She said her mother-in-law suffers from various ailments and wishes to spend time with her grandchildren and, therefore, she desires that her husband be with her.The court noted that the authorities can stipulate strict conditions to ensure the convict returns to prison at the end of parole.Liberty is reserved to seek extension of parole, which should be considered based on his conduct while he is out, the judge added.","Neetha G had sought the release of her husband, Anand, who is incarcerated in Central Prison, Bengaluru.

Crucial appointments await new government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crucial-appointments-await-new-government/articleshow/110747619.cms,"NEW DELHI: With a new govt expected to take office over the weekend, all eyes are on several crucial appointments that have been in the pipeline with the list extending from a new Army chief to the cabinet secretary and home secretary.Besides, several agencies, including the Directorate of Enforcement and the ministry of statistics are working without full-time bosses, while Central Board of Direct Taxes chairman Nitin Gupta is on extension, with the budget due to be presented in just over a month.There are other crucial appointments to be made in the coming months — RBI governor Shaktikanta Das’s second three-year term is due to end in Dec, while two of his deputies M D Patra and T Rabi Shankar are on extension.Besides, govt also has to decide on a new State Bank of India chairman since Dinesh Khara’s 10-month extension is due to end in Aug. Last month’s selection board meeting, where three managing directors were to appear, was cancelled at the last moment, raising speculation that the retirement age for SBI and LIC chairmen may be raised to 65 years.Civil servants are keeping tabs on cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba’s next move. The officer is among the contenders seen to be shifting to the PMO, provided PM Modi decides to shuffle the pack. Principal secretary P K Mishra, who has worked with Modi since his days as Gujarat CM, is seen as a close aide.Finance secretary T V Somanathan is seen to be among candidates who could replace either Gauba, if a vacancy arises, or move to RBI.

Since then, Rahul Navin, an IRS officer, has been functioning as acting director. A director will get a two-year term. A coalition govt may not like to keep a sensitive position vacant for too long given that ED is probing several high-profile laundering cases, including against top politicians.","All eyes are on several crucial appointments that have been in the pipeline.

The brave soldiers live for the country and die for the country.

After he went missing, his parents lodged a missing person’s report and started receiving ordinary family pension but in 2020, received a communication from the dept that “due to non-availability of death certificate, special family pension and other arrears could not be paid to them”.

She comes with over two-decades of experience at drugmaker Eli Lilly .Ashkenazi’s tenure as CFO will commence on July 31, with Porat maintaining her CFO responsibilities until then, including the period covering the second-quarter financial results.Following the announcement, Alphabet’s stock saw a slight uptick of 0.8% in premarket activity, while Eli Lilly experienced a marginal decline of 0.3%.Earlier in the day, Eli Lilly disclosed Ashkenazi’s impending exit. Since joining the company in 2001, Ashkenazi has climbed the ranks, eventually becoming CFO in February 2021. Under her financial leadership, Lilly’s stock value soared, quadrupling and surpassing the S&P 500’s 39% increase. This growth spurt coincided with the launch of several new medical treatments, including the widely acclaimed diabetes drug Mounjaro, which doubles as a weight loss medication.Ashkenazi will maintain her CFO duties at Eli Lilly and remain on the executive committee until July 2024. Meanwhile, the search for her successor is in progress, with candidates being considered from both within and outside the company.Despite Alphabet’s robust earnings in the first quarter, driven by AI advancements in cloud computing, the escalating expenses associated with these innovations have raised eyebrows among some investors and market watchers.Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s CEO, expressed enthusiasm about the potential of AI, stating, “The AI era offers an extraordinary chance for broad innovation within our main offerings. Anat’s partnership will be instrumental as we make judicious investments to fuel our upcoming expansion phase.”This executive shift occurs at a pivotal juncture for Alphabet, as the company pours significant resources into artificial intelligence (AI) development, aiming to rival Microsoft and carve out a niche in what’s anticipated to be the tech sector’s next major growth area.","Anat Ashkenazi will replace Ruth Porat, who is transitioning to become Alphabet’s investment chief.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

WHO confirms first fatal human case of H5N2 bird flu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/who-confirms-first-fatal-human-case-of-h5n2-bird-flu/articleshow/110751897.cms,"A 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico has died from bird flu in the first confirmed case of a human infected with the H5N2 variant , the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday. The patient passed away on April 24 after experiencing fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and nausea. Despite having no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, the individual had multiple underlying medical conditions, including chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, according to a statement from Mexico's health ministry.The WHO reported that the patient, who had been bedridden for three weeks prior to developing acute symptoms, was hospitalized in Mexico City and succumbed to the illness the same day. This case marks the first laboratory-confirmed human infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus globally and the first avian H5 virus reported in a person in Mexico.""Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,"" the WHO said. Mexican health authorities conducted laboratory tests and reported the confirmed case to the UN health body on May 23.In March, H5N2 cases were detected in a backyard poultry farm in Michoacan state, with other outbreaks identified in the State of Mexico. However, establishing a link between the human case and the poultry infections has been challenging. The WHO estimates the risk to the general population as ""low.""The Mexican health ministry emphasized that there is no risk of contagion for the population, noting that all samples from identified contacts of the patient have tested negative. Authorities are closely monitoring farms near the victim's home and have set up a permanent monitoring system to detect other cases in wildlife in the area.Andrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University, highlighted the complexity of the situation, saying, ""How this individual got infected is a big question mark that at least this initial report doesn't really address thoroughly.""The WHO and Mexican health officials continue to investigate the source of the infection. Bird flu has been known to infect various mammals, including seals, raccoons, bears, and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds. Scientists remain vigilant for changes in the virus that could signal its adaptation to spread more easily among humans.In the United States, a different variant of bird flu, H5N1, has been spreading among dairy cow herds, with a small number of human cases reported. However, none of these cases involved human-to-human transmission.Australia also reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, with no signs of transmission, while noting more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.Pekosz added, ""Since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus. So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans.""(With inputs from agencies)","A 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico has died from bird flu in the first confirmed case of a human infected with the H5N2 variant.

New Yorkers who dreaded $15 congestion fee cheer Kathy Hochul’s shock decision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-yorkers-who-dreaded-15-congestion-fee-cheer-kathy-hochuls-shock-decision/articleshow/110752541.cms,"Brooklynites and Manhattanites. Democrats and Republicans. Drivers and subway riders. Especially Staten Islanders. New Yorkers of all stripes are cheering over the halt of a $15 fee.They’re celebrating Governor Kathy Hochul ’s stunning decision to suspend a plan to charge people driving into Manhattan beginning June 30. The toll was aimed at reducing traffic, improving air quality and raising $1 billion a year to repair public transportation.It was a measure 17 years in the making, and would have been the first of its type in the US. But with inflation supercharging the cost of living in New York over the past couple of years, the prospect of having to pay the fee irked too many of the city’s residents.“I’m thrilled it’s stalled,” said Susan Switzer, a business consultant who lives in Midtown. “We can’t afford to take our car out a few days a week.” She drives to Queens a few times a week and said the toll shouldn’t have applied for Manhattan residents, because she believes they already pay high taxes and parking fees.The timing of Hochul’s shock suspension is raising speculation about its reasons. She said Wednesday her decision was driven by the goal of shielding the working class from inflation. But price increases in everything from groceries to housing and insurance have been squeezing New Yorkers — and Americans across the nation — for well over a year.Hochul was concerned that implementation of the unpopular plan risked affecting Democrats’ chances in upcoming House races across the state this November, according to a person with knowledge of her thinking. The contests are expected to be competitive, with power over Congress hanging in the balance.Hochul also faced pointed criticism in 2022 for New York Democrats’ losses in swing districts, which effectively handed control of the House to the GOP.But the pricing plan had also raised concerns among outer borough Democrats, who feared the impact on less-wealthy residents who live in New York’s farthest reaches, often long distances from mass transit. Some of those officials supported Hochul’s decision to delay.“I want to express my appreciation to Governor Kathy Hochul for listening to the concerns of New Yorkers and pausing the launch of congestion pricing,” said Queens City Council Member Nantasha Williams, a Democrat whose district in southeastern Queens has fewer mass transit options than other parts of the city.The fee was predicted to generate resources to help revamp a more than 100-year old transit system that has been ravaged by heavy rain and severe flooding. Subway-signal upgrades to curb train delays, new electric buses and the extension of the Second Avenue subway to Harlem were all meant to be funded with the money.But Withlin Ward, a stylist who lives in Brooklyn, is skeptical of these goals. “They always say that and nothing happens,” he said, noting that subway fares were raised only recently.Xavier Walker, who fixes fire alarms for MTA contractor High Rise Fire and Security, said the $15 toll was too high, and would only have gone up, hurting people’s already stretched budgets. “It would be good to help make MTA accessibility easier,” he said. “But these guys have already generated money” by raising subway fares, he said.Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, also a Democrat, said he has long supported congestion pricing but had previously spoken with Hochul and testified before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority about his concerns over the program’s details — specifically the amount of the toll, which posed a potential hardship to middle class Queens residents who live far from mass transit and who drive to and through Manhattan for work.“I have spoken to the governor about the price scheme,” Richards said. “We relayed $15 certainly being a very steep price.”Richards also faulted the MTA’s messaging, particularly to outer borough residents who would feel the impact of congestion pricing most acutely.The MTA “never told the public what they’re gonna get out of it,” Richards said, pointing out that officials couldn’t pinpoint mass transit improvements the program would fund that specifically benefited eastern and southeastern Queens residents.“There really wasn’t a strategic vision laid out for residents in the outer reaches of the city on what does this mean, how does this benefit them?” Richards said.Still, not everyone was supportive of Hochul’s decision. Some lawmakers and good government groups criticized the governor, questioning how the state would now fund the MTA’s capital needs.“The Governor’s reckless decision to effectively kill congestion pricing in New York City — and every other city in America that is considering following New York’s example — is a staggering error,” said State Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat who represents parts of Midtown and Manhattan’s Upper East Side.“On top of the financial crisis she is creating, this is simply a terrible policy decision, full stop,” Krueger said.Democratic Queens State Senator Jessica Ramos called the delay “a slap in the face to our neighbors who rely on a functioning public transportation system.”In Albany, a group of lawmakers questioned Hochul’s reasoning.Transportation activists like Elizabeth Adams, executive director for public affairs at Transportation Alternatives, were particularly incensed.“The next time your train is late, your bus is trapped in traffic, your subway station is still missing an elevator, you know who to blame: Governor Kathy Hochul,” Adams said.Nonetheless, Hochul drew support from a broad range of political interests, whose concerns rarely align: the United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew, who had joined a lawsuit in an effort to stop the program’s implementation, the New York Taxi Workers’ Alliance President Bhairavi Desai, and Harry Nespoli, chair of the Municipal Labor Committee, which represents hundreds of thousands of municipal employees.“We need to address congestion in the central business district, but another surcharge on struggling yellow taxi drivers was never the right solution,” Desai said.Republican Congress member Nicole Malliotakis, whose district covers Staten Island and some parts of Brooklyn, was also pleased.","New Yorkers of all stripes are cheering over the halt of a $15 fee.

"On hiking trip during summer vacay, 3 US kids discover rare T. rex fossils",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/on-hiking-trip-during-summer-vacay-3-us-kids-discover-rare-t-rex-fossils/articleshow/110751996.cms,"WASHINGTON: What did you do for summer vacation? Three pre-teen dinosaur aficionados have the answer of a lifetime: they discovered the remains of a rare juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex in the North Dakota dirt.Scientists and filmmakers announced Tuesday that brothers Liam and Jessin Fisher, age seven and 10 at the time of the find, and their nine-year-old cousin Kaiden Madsen, were walking in the Hell Creek formation of the Badlands in July 2022 when they found a large fossilised leg bone. “Dad asked ‘What is this?’ and Jessin said, ‘That’s a dinosaur!’” exclaimed young Liam on a video call with his brother, cousin, father Sam Fisher, dinosaur experts and reporters. They snapped a pic and sent it to a family friend, vertebrate paleontologist Tyler Lyson, as per a statement.When Lyson eventually arrived at the site, he brushed off a tooth and quickly realised the enormity of what the fossil hunters uncovered: an “extremely rare” juvenile T. rex specimen that lived 67 million years ago — and could offer critical clues about how the king of dinosaurs grew up. “It still gives me goosebumps,” Lyson recalled on the call. Kaiden’s reaction to learning it was a T. rex? “This is pretty cool.”The fossilised bones were excavated , placed in giant plaster jackets and lifted by Black Hawk helicopter onto a truck. They were taken to the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, where the public can soon follow progress on the fossil’s preparation in a new discovery lab. Rather remarkably, the saga is only emerging now, after a documentary crew and renowned scientists coordinated in secret over nearly two years with top natural history museums to present the kids’ discovery.Paleontologists estimate the “Teen Rex” weighed about 1,630kg, measured 25 feet from nose to tail, and stood about 10 feet tall — some two-thirds the size of a full grown adult. It was believed to be 13-15 years old when it died. “It’s remarkable to consider how T. rex might have grown from a kitten-sized hatchling into the 40-foot, 8,000-pound adult predator we are familiar with,” Thomas Holtz,a renowned T. rex authority, said.As for the kids, Liam and cousin Kaiden said they’ll remain amateur dinosaur sleuths, combing the Badlands for new discoveries. But Jessin is looking to become a full-time paleontologist. “It’s been a lifelong dream of mine — probably because I’ve seen Jurassic Park film, and finding this” T. rex fossil, he said. Meanwhile, Jessin offered sage advice for fellow kids: “Put down their electronics and just go out hiking.”","Brothers Liam and Jessin Fisher, age seven and 10 at the time of the find, and their nine-year-old cousin Kaiden Madsen, were walking in the Hell Creek formation of the Badlands.

Transplanted pig kidney is removed from patient,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/transplanted-pig-kidney-is-removed-from-patient/articleshow/110751947.cms,"AP photo

NEW YORK: Surgeons removed the kidney of a genetically engineered pig from a critically ill patient last week after the organ was damaged by inadequate blood flow related to a heart pump that the woman had also received, according to officials at NYU Langone Transplant Institute.

The patient, Lisa Pisano , 54, who is still hospitalised, went back on kidney dialysis after the pig’s organ was removed. She lived with the transplanted organ for 47 days, Dr Robert Montgomery, director of the institute, said. The kidney showed no signs of organ rejection . “Lisa is in stable condition, and her left ventricular assist device is still functioning,” Montgomery said, referring to the heart pump.

In April, Pisano became the second person to receive a kidney transplanted from a genetically modified pig. Hers was an especially complicated case: She has heart failure and kidney failure, and received the organ just eight days after receiving a mechanical heart pump . She is the first patient with a heart pump known to have received an organ transplant of any kind, NYU Langone Health officials said.

The first patient to receive a kidney from a genetically engineered pig was Richard Slayman, 62, who underwent the procedure in March in Boston. He suffered from complex medical problems and died within two months.

WASHINGTON: Boeing ’s new Starliner astronaut capsule was launched from Florida on Wednesday in a much-delayed first test flight carrying a crew, a milestone in the aerospace giant’s ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk ’s SpaceX . The CST-100 Starliner, with Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Indian-origin Sunita Williams aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance.The gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS), following years of technical problems, delays and a 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard.Last-minute issues had nixed the Starliner’s first two crewed launch attempts. But on Wednesday, the Atlas V’s engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapour as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into sunny skies from Florida’s Atlantic Coast.The rocket’s upper stage separated from its lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner’s separation from the second stage. Now on its own, the spacecraft fired its onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that will kick off its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, the orbiting research outpost some 400 km above Earth. Starliner will need to execute precise maneouvers to dock with ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for eight days, then safely return the two astronauts.Boeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been Nasa’s only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.The inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran astronauts: Wilmore, 61, a retired US navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft. They have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each.Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. Williams made history as the first woman to embark on such a mission. And it won’t be her first entry in the history books. In 2012, during a prior trip to the ISS, Williams became the first person to finish a triathlon in space, during which she simulated swimming using a weight-lifting machine and ran on a treadmill while strapped in by a harness so she wouldn’t float away. That came after she ran the Boston Marathon from the space station in 2007.","Boeing's new Starliner astronaut capsule was launched from Florida on Wednesday in a much-delayed first test flight carrying a crew.

When Donald Trump said an indicted President shouldn’t be allowed to run,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/when-donald-trump-said-an-indicted-president-shouldnt-be-allowed-to-run/articleshow/110740171.cms,"Donald Trump will be the first major presidential candidate who has been indicted to run for President and might even do so from prison (though legal experts say that’s unlikely). If that does happen, Trump will the first major Presidential candidate to campaign from prison since socialist Eugene Debs. While there has been a lot of debate on whether a Presidential candidate who has been indicted ought to be President, Donald Trump should perhaps listen to his own views on the matter.In 2016, speaking about his rival Hillary Clinton , Trump had argued that she shouldn’t be allowed to run. He had said: “If Clinton were charged criminally and became president it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis and grind the government to a halt. Folks, folks, folks, she shouldn't be allowed to run. Okay?”Trump made similar statements at several rallies when Clinton was being probed for handling classified emails on a private email server. He had also claimed: “We need a government that can work and work well from day one for the American people. That will be impossible with Hillary Clinton, the prime suspect in a massive far-reaching criminal investigation.”He had said: “Her current scandals and controversies will continue throughout her presidency and will make it virtually impossible for her to govern or lead our country.”Donald Trump faced Republican voters for the first time as a convicted felon on Tuesday during the final state primaries for the 2024 presidential nomination , where he continued to sweep up votes.The ex-president has already locked up the Republican nomination to run against PresidentJoe Biden , making the votes in Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota formalities. However, some political observers had wondered if Republican voters might sour on Trump's divisive candidacy after he was found guilty last week of falsifying business records in a conspiracy to unlawfully influence the 2016 election.Though Trump steamrolled over other Republican presidential hopefuls, he faced a hiccup at a guaranteed-win primary earlier this year. In May, two months after the last Republican rival standing, Nikki Haley, abandoned her campaign, she still won nearly 22 percent of the votes in the Indiana primary. Trump on Tuesday picked up 85 percent of the vote in New Mexico, with Haley picking up nine percent after more than 95 percent of ballots were in. In Montana, where Haley was not on the ballot, Trump picked up nearly 91 percent, while nine percent selected no preference, with 83 percent of the votes in.","Donald Trump will be the first major presidential candidate who has been indicted to run for President and might even do so from prison.

"A Song of Ice and Fire: How Phoenix, America's hottest city, is treating heatstroke victims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-song-of-ice-and-fire-how-phoenix-americas-hottest-city-is-treating-heatstroke-victims/articleshow/110734146.cms,"PHOENIX - The season's first heat wave is already baking the Southwest with triple-digit temperatures as firefighters in Phoenix - America's hottest big city - employ new tactics in hopes of saving more lives in a county that saw 645 heat-related deaths last year.Starting this season, the Phoenix Fire Department is immersing heatstroke victims in ice on the way to area hospitals. The medical technique, known as cold water immersion, is familiar to marathon runners and military service members and has also recently been adopted by Phoenix hospitals as a go-to protocol, said Fire Capt. John Prato.Prato demonstrated the method earlier this week outside the emergency department of Valleywise Health Medical Center in Phoenix, packing ice cubes inside an impermeable blue bag around a medical dummy representing a patient. He said the technique could dramatically lower body temperature in minutes.""Just last week we had a critical patient that we were able to bring back before we walked through the emergency room doors,"" Prato said. ""That's our goal - to improve patient survivability.""The heatstroke treatment has made ice and human-sized immersion bags standard equipment on all Phoenix fire department emergency vehicles. It is among measures the city adopted this year as temperatures and their human toll soar ever higher. Phoenix for the first time is also keeping two cooling stations open overnight this season.Emergency responders in much of an area stretching from southeast California to central Arizona are preparing for what the National Weather Service said would be ""easily their hottest"" weather since last September.Excessive heat warnings were issued for Wednesday morning through Friday evening for parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, with highs expected to top 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 Celsius) in Las Vegas and Phoenix. The unseasonably hot weather was expected to spread northward and make its way into parts of the Pacific Northwest by the weekend.Officials in Maricopa County were stunned earlier this year when final numbers showed 645 heat-related deaths in Arizona's largest county, a majority of them in Phoenix. The most brutal period was a heat wave with 31 subsequent days of temperatures of 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.4 Celsius) or higher, which claimed more than 400 lives.""We've been seeing a severe uptick in the past three years in cases of severe heat illness,"" said Dr. Paul Pugsley, medical director of emergency medicine with Valleywise Health. Of those, about 40% do not survive.Cooling down patients long before they get to the emergency department could change the equation, he said.The technique ""is not very widely spread in non-military hospitals in the U.S., nor in the prehospital setting among fire departments or first responders,"" Pugsley said. He said part of that may be a longstanding perception that the technique's use for all cases of heatstroke by first responders or even hospitals was impractical or impossible.Pugsley said he was aware of limited use of the technique in some places in California, including Stanford Medical Center in Palo Alto and Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno, and by the San Antonio Fire Department in Texas.Banner University Medical Center in Phoenix embraced the protocol last summer, said Dr. Aneesh Narang, assistant medical director of emergency medicine there.""This cold water immersion therapy is really the standard of care to treat heatstroke patients,"" he said.","The Phoenix Fire Department is immersing heatstroke victims in ice on the way to area hospitals.

Pakistan: People encounter massive load-shedding suffer as severe heatwave grips nation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-people-encounter-massive-load-shedding-suffer-as-severe-heatwave-grips-nation/articleshow/110617725.cms,"KARACHI: The general public of Pakistan 's Karachi currently suffer from severe effects of heatwave. Amid the ongoing summer season, the people of Karachi suffer from massive load-shedding and severe power cuts , which have been a problem for the general public's survival in the scorching heat.As the heatwave worsens in Karachi, people still have a slim chance and hope of comfort, as some individuals from the business community in the city have come together with initiatives like water camps to help the people.Muhammad Iqbal a daily wage worker working at one such water camp said, ""This has been an initiative of the people to quench the thirst of the people. We are only requesting the government to stop load shedding and organize such camps. So that the people can survive in the heat.""When asked about how the children have been falling ill due to the scorching heat of the summer ""Only the government can do something in this case, we are trying to do our best to help the people. The government must make some committees and do surveys to actually assess the bad situation and then take serious action over the matter, as the condition grows worse by the day"".Nasir Khan a rickshaw puller stated ""Our locality has been suffering a lot, it has been almost 20 days since we have received water supply in our area. Even the electricity is not supplied for more than 16 hours a day, so we have no possibility of relief in that matter also. I believe that the government is not taking the matter so seriously. The government has closed state-run schools, but private school students are still going to school in high temperatures. And these kids are not able to come back home and get relief because there are 16-hour-long powercuts, and this has been the real situation of the people of Karachi.""Muneeb, another citizen of Karachi, stated that ""although the scorching heat is a disaster of nature, the government is also not that helpful. I think this is the worst possible scenario for us, as the electricity department is not having any mercy on the general public. People have been paying bills of thousands and lakhs of rupees but I don't know why, there is still no electricity in our houses. We have been suffering for over 12 hours of load shedding in this high heat, while they sit in the air-conditioned offices.""""They will not be able to tolerate any heat if the roles are reversed. And I believe that there is a lot of water but the entire problem is because of rampant corruption and other misconducts. The Tanker Mafia has been stealing the water which should be given to the people and selling it to rich people, whereas we are left here to suffer in the heat,"" Muneeb added.","The general public of Pakistan's Karachi currently suffer from severe effects of heatwave.

Authorities are urging people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.“Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,” said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.“Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,” Fadil said. ""We need the private sector to play a bigger role as public sector resources will not be enough. This is everybody’s business.”","UNICEF says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.

Climate change threatens Pakistan's mango harvest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/climate-change-threatens-pakistans-mango-harvest/articleshow/110585002.cms,"TANDO ALLAHYAR: Pakistan 's mangoes are normally a source of national pride and much-needed income, but farmers are blaming climate change for the parasites and extreme weather ruining much of this season's crop.A white and orange scarf wrapped around his head in the scorching heat, farmer Muhammad Yusuf lamented the erratic weather.An abnormally long winter was followed by the wettest April in decades, while the country is now experiencing a heatwave with temperatures hitting up to 52 degrees Celsius (126 degrees Fahrenheit).""Buds didn't flower on time, many buds just died. Those that started growing were infected with (parasite) black hopper,"" said Yusuf, who has worked half his life growing mangoes.Now over 60 years old, Yusuf said ""climate change has wreaked havoc"" in his village of Tando Allahyar, around 200 kilometres (124 miles) northeast of economic hub Karachi.Pakistan is the world's fourth-largest mango producer and agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of its GDP .Further south in Tando Ghulam Ali , Arsalan, who manages a 900-acre mango orchard, noticed the damage as soon as the harvest started this week.""We have production losses of 15 to 20 percent, and the picking has only just started so this figure will surely increase,"" said the 32-year-old.Exports will be slashed as a result warned Arsalan, who goes by one name.""The mangoes turn yellow from the outside but remain underripe or overripe inside,"" he explained.Ziaul Haq, a mango grower and exporter from Tando Ghulam Ali, said the ""many attacks on fruit"" by pests were unprecedented.""This, in our history, has never happened before,"" he told AFP.The proliferation of parasites has led to an explosion in spending on pesticides.This uptick was confirmed by several farmers in Sindh province, where Tando Allahyar and Tando Ghulam Ali are located, as well as those in the leading agricultural province of Punjab further north.They told that chemicals are now used six to seven times per year, compared to just twice three years ago.Farmers in Sindh said they have been struggling since 2022 when a series of severe heatwaves were followed by unprecedented flooding, while those in Punjab said the declining crops yields date back several years more.""The losses in Punjab reached 35 to 50 percent and in Sindh, 15 to 20 percent"" compared to last year, said Waheed Ahmed, head of the Pakistan Federation of Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association (PFVA).Speaking to local media, he said that last year Pakistan had only managed to export 1,00,000 of the 1,25,000 tonnes of mangoes it planned to sell abroad.Pakistan's 20 varieties of mangoes come second only to oranges as the most-produced fruit in the country.The income loss from a poor harvest could have a significant impact on the country, which is in talks to secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Mashooq Ali, a 30-year-old labourer in Tando Ghulam Ali, wants the government to help farmers cope.""Landowners will earn less this year,"" said Ali, whose wife has started trading clothes to earn extra cash.""And even if they paid us as much as last year, with inflation, we won't be able to feed our families.""",Pakistan is the world's fourth-largest mango producer and agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of its GDP.

The tobacco industry 's targeting of youth is rampant across our member states. As a result, we have a very worrying 11 million adolescents using various tobacco products. Coupled with the approximate 411 million adult tobacco users, our region, unfortunately, has the highest number of adolescent and adult users globally,"" Wazed said in a statement.The tobacco industry lures youths by aggressively introducing new nicotine and tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products, which are becoming increasingly popular among the youths in the region, she said.This multibillion-dollar industry recruits new tobacco users to reward their investors with even more profits. To achieve this, it preys on children and adolescents through marketing tactics, targeting them with new products, Wazed stated.""It is worrying that children and adolescents are regularly exposed to the digital marketing of tobacco products. This is despite having policies and regulations in place to prevent this,"" she said.""This situation is likely to get worse, as youngsters spend more time on social media and other similar platforms,"" Wazed said, highlighting that personalised and targeted advertising by the industry appears to dominate here, exposing them to harm.This year's theme for World No Tobacco Day is 'Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference'.The tobacco industry is fast to launch new products, using every means to expand market share before the regulations can catch up, she said.It continues to oppose evidence-based measures, such as increases in excise taxes, and comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorships. The companies even threaten legal action against governments that try to protect the health of their citizens, the WHO regional director added.Wazed pointed out that the response from governments and institutions lags in the matter.""Our efforts are complicated by the rapid changes in the marketing strategies of the tobacco industry,"" she said, emphasising that the relevant provisions of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) '? including Article 5.3 '? should be implemented in letter and spirit.Also, necessary tools and support are urgently needed to facilitate monitoring and implementation of the WHO FCTC recommendations in 'online' settings, she added.""Our goal for our youth is clear. We want to prevent and reduce tobacco consumption, nicotine addiction, and exposure to new tobacco products. To do this, we need a multi-stakeholder approach to frame and implement legislation, policies, regulations and administrative measures,"" the WHO's South-East Asia director said.""This approach needs to cast a wide net. We should engage with all relevant government departments, UN and intergovernmental organisations, civil society, the private sector, academia, and the community, including students, teachers and parents,"" she added.A generational tobacco ban, leading to a ""tobacco-free generation"" would be a huge step forward for the region, Wazed stressed, adding, ""For this to happen, the WHO FCTC must be recognized as a legally binding international instrument by all our member states.

The ongoing challenges and the need for a balanced family life are becoming more of a priority for her.""Kate Middleton, known for her grace and dedication to various charitable causes , has noticeably reduced her public appearances in recent months. This shift comes amid growing speculation about her personal well-being and the strain of her royal responsibilities.The source added, ""While she remains deeply committed to her family and her charitable work, the toll of royal life is undeniable. There is a possibility that she may choose to focus more on her children and personal projects .""The royal family has not officially commented on these claims, leaving room for further speculation about the future of the Princess of Wales within the monarchy. As the public awaits any official statements, the potential change in Kate Middleton's role marks a significant moment for the royal family and its future.Kate's reduced presence at public engagements has been noticeable, with Prince William often attending events solo or with other senior royals. This change has led to numerous discussions among royal watchers and the media about the reasons behind her absence.One possible factor is the couple's desire to provide a more stable and private upbringing for their three children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. The royal couple has always emphasized the importance of shielding their children from the relentless media attention that comes with their status.Additionally, there are reports suggesting that Kate Middleton is keen to pursue her personal interests and charitable endeavors without the constraints of her royal duties. Over the years, she has championed various causes, particularly those related to mental health, early childhood development, and the arts. Stepping back from her formal role could allow her to dedicate more time and resources to these passions, the Daily Mail report said.Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams commented on the situation, saying, ""The royal family is evolving, and so are the roles of its members.

'Rishi Sunak's new policies help Tories narrow gap with Labour',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunaks-new-policies-help-tories-narrow-gap-with-labour/articleshow/110541235.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: In a sudden turn of events, the Conservative Party , led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak , has significantly narrowed the gap with the Labour Party ahead of the upcoming General Election . According to a new poll conducted by JL Partners, Labour's lead over the Conservatives has decreased from 18 points in April to just 12 points. This shift in public opinion marks a critical moment for both parties as they gear up for what promises to be a closely contested election.Prime Minister Sunak's recent policy initiatives appear to be resonating with voters, contributing to the narrowing of the gap. The new policies, aimed at addressing key issues such as the cost of living, healthcare, and national security, have bolstered the Conservative Party's standing in the polls. Sunak's focus on economic stability and pragmatic governance has been a central theme of his campaign, a Daily Mail report said.One of the key factors in this shift has been the public's response to the government's handling of economic challenges. Sunak has emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility while promising targeted support for those most affected by rising living costs. His policies have included measures to reduce inflation, support small businesses, and ensure that public services are adequately funded.Labour leader Keir Starmer, who had been enjoying a comfortable lead for several months, now faces increased pressure to maintain his party's advantage. Starmer's campaign has focused on issues such as social justice, public health, and education reform. However, the recent poll suggests that some voters may be reconsidering their support in light of the Conservative Party's renewed efforts.The tightening race reflects the dynamic and unpredictable nature of British politics. As both parties ramp up their campaigns, they are likely to intensify their efforts to sway undecided voters and solidify their bases. The Labour Party will need to reinforce its message and address any vulnerabilities that may have contributed to the narrowing gap.Political analysts suggest that the upcoming weeks will be crucial for both parties. The Conservatives will aim to continue their momentum by highlighting their recent policy successes and outlining their vision for the future. Meanwhile, Labour will need to counteract this by emphasizing their commitment to addressing inequality and improving public services.The public's perception of the leaders' performances will also play a significant role in the election outcome. Sunak's leadership style, characterized by his economic expertise and calm demeanor, contrasts with Starmer's focus on social issues and reform. Voters' evaluations of these contrasting approaches will be critical in determining the final result, the Daily Mail report said.As the election date approaches, both parties will be keenly aware of the importance of maintaining voter engagement and addressing the key concerns of the electorate. The race is expected to be highly competitive, with each party striving to gain the upper hand.The poll results have injected a new sense of urgency into the campaigns, underscoring the high stakes of the upcoming election. With the gap between the parties narrowing, the outcome remains uncertain, and both Sunak and Starmer will need to navigate the complexities of the political landscape to secure a victory.",The Conservative Party has significantly narrowed the gap with the Labour Party ahead of the upcoming General Election.

McDonald’s loses chicken ‘Big Mac’ EU trademark fight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/mcdonalds-loses-chicken-big-mac-eu-trademark-fight/articleshow/110752012.cms,"A top European Union court said Wednesday that McDonald’s has lost its Big Mac trademark in the 27-nation bloc, ruling in favour of Irish fast food rival Supermac in a longrunning legal battle . The EU General Court said in its judgement that the US fast food giant failed to prove that it was genuinely using the Big Mac name over a five-year period for chicken sandwiches, poultry products or restaurants.The Big Mac is a hamburger made of two beef patties, cheese, lettuce, onions, pickles and Big Mac sauce, according to the company’s website. The decision is about more than burger names. It opens the door for Galway-based Supermac’s expansion into other EU countries. The dispute erupted when Supermac’s applied to register its company name in the EU as it drew up its expansion plans. McDonald’s objected, saying consumers would be confused because it already trademarked the Big Mac name. Supermac’s portrayed the decision as a David and Goliath-style victory. Managing Director Pat McDonagh accused McDonald’s of “trademark bullying to stifle competition”.McDonald’s was unfazed by the ruling, which can be appealed to the European Court of Justice, the bloc’s highest court. “The decision does not affect our right to use the ‘BIG MAC’ trademark,” it said.",The EU General Court said in its judgement that the US fast food giant failed to prove that it was genuinely using the Big Mac name.

Oil producers led by Saudis extended supply cuts amid slack prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/oil-producers-led-by-saudis-extended-supply-cuts-amid-slack-prices/articleshow/110644873.cms,"FRANKFURT: Saudi Arabia and allied oil producing countries on Sunday extended output cuts through next year, a move aimed at supporting slack prices that haven't risen even amid turmoil in the middle east and the start of the summer travel season.The Opec+ alliance, made up of members of the producers cartel and allied countries including Russia, extended three different sets of cuts totaling 5.8 million barrels a day.International benchmark Brent has loitered in the $81-$83 per barrel range for the past month. Even the war in Gaza and attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels in Yemen have not pushed prices up toward the $100 per barrel level last seen in September 2022. Reasons include higher interest rates, concerns about demand due to slower than desired economic growth in Europe and China, and rising non-Opec supply including from US shale producers,Yet the Saudis need higher oil prices to fund ambitious plans by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the country's economy away from fossil fuel exports. Higher oil prices would also help Russia maintain economic growth and stability as it spends heavily on its war against Ukraine.Analysts say the cuts could push oil prices higher in coming months, but much depends on demand for oil going forward. The summer usually sees a spike in demand through the July-September quarter, but uncertainty about demand grows after that.US motorists have benefitted from weaker oil prices. Gasoline prices have been quiescent recently, averaging $3.56 per gallon last week, a penny less than a year ago. That is down from a record national average high of $5 per gallon in June 2022. US prices can vary by region and Western states have been paying more, with gas hitting an average $5.05 per gallon in California.US gas prices rise along with crude because the price of oil makes up half the cost of a gallon of gasoline. The price swings are much smaller in Europe because there taxes make up a bigger proportion of the price of fuel.The cuts that are being extended break down as follows: 2 billion barrels a day agreed among all 23 Opec+ members were extended through the end of 2025, according to an Opec statement.Then, voluntary reductions of 1.65 million barrels a day by a smaller group of members was extended until end 2025 as well, according to a report on the official Saudi Press Agency.And another 2.2 million barrels a day in voluntary cuts, due to expire at the end of this month, were extended until September but would then be gradually reduced month by month until they are eliminated by September 2025.","International benchmark Brent has loitered in the $81-$83 per barrel range for the past month.

Reasons include higher interest rates, concerns about demand due to slower than desired economic growth in Europe and China.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110644865,imgsize-1012568,width-400,resizemode-4/110644865.jpg"

Qatar Airways, Boeing and Airbus did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Bloomberg had reported in March that Qatar Airways was in early talks with Boeing and Airbus, to order 100 to 150 widebody jets to expand and renew its fleet.

The North Korean missile researcher who became a South Korean lawmaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-north-korean-missile-researcher-who-became-a-south-korean-lawmaker/articleshow/110752750.cms,"SEOUL: Park Choong-kwon was once a member of an elite North Korean unit that developed long-range missiles. Now, as a lawmaker in the South, he is sounding the alarm over Kim Jong Un 's weapons.As a teenager in the North, Park was plucked from his regular classroom and sent to a school for gifted kids, from where he quickly progressed to the country's National Defense University .But he disliked the military discipline and was disillusioned by high-level corruption, eventually deciding to defect to the South, where the 38-year-old was sworn in as a lawmaker last month.Set up in the 1960s, Park's alma mater is a key part of the nuclear-armed North's banned weapons programmes -- it takes the country's top brains and uses them to further Kim's quest for bigger and better missiles, satellites and nuclear warheads.The university ""was created with the main goal of making intercontinental ballistic missiles"", said Park, who studied there from 2003 to 2007.Under Kim Jong Un -- who took over from his late father in 2011 -- the university has been expanded, with new departments for hypersonics, satellites and nuclear, and the pace of weapons development is more advanced than many outsiders understand, he said.""The North started publicly rolling out its new weapons lineups in 2017, including hypersonic missiles, strategic surface to surface missiles... and hydrogen bombs,"" he said.""But the development of these weapons was already 80 to 90 percent complete when I escaped in 2009.""North Korea's attempt to put a second spy satellite into orbit last week may have ended in a mid-air explosion, but Park says even failure shows how advanced the country's programmes really are.""They are trying a new engine test even when they are capable of putting one satellite into orbit with an existing engine,"" said Park, who was born and raised in the eastern coastal city of Hamhung, and is the fourth defector to become an MP in the South.- Hacking unit -The only institution in North Korea that got to choose its students ahead of the National Defense University was the hacking unit, Park told AFP.""The top two students in my class were recruited to the hacking unit,"" he said.North Korea's cyber-programme dates back to at least the mid-1990s, but has grown to a 6,000-strong cyberwarfare unit, known as Bureau 121, that operates from several countries including Belarus, China, India, Malaysia and Russia, according to a 2020 US military report.Park told AFP the North puts meticulous care into nurturing hackers, who have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets in recent years, industry data shows. They are a key source of revenue for Kim's government as sanctions continue to bite.Park himself majored in chemical engineering, and quickly became involved in making long-range missiles designed to hit targets on the US mainland.But despite his elite status within North Korean society, he became disillusioned with the system.Forced to study key texts in which former leader Kim Jong Il refuted attacks on Korean-style socialism, Park found ""the criticisms made more sense to me"".Then, in his final year at the university, he discovered that to get a good work placement after graduation, he would need to pay.""Bribing officials $3,000 would land you a job in Pyongyang,"" he said, adding that the country's ruling Rodong party was ""corrupt to its core"".""After that I began to see the suffering of the people. The last hopes and dreams I had for the system all faded away. There was nothing I could do to change from within,"" he said.""So I decided to defect.""In 2009, after meticulously planning his escape so as not to put his remaining family at risk, he crossed the Tumen river to China, and then made his way to the South.- Forever enemy -Once safely in Seoul, Park decided to study for his doctorate at the top Seoul National University, before going to work at Hyundai Steel.Last year, the ruling People Power Party, which advocates a tough line on North Korea, recruited him to run for parliament -- and he won office in April legislative elections.Park says he plans to work on North Korea issues during his term, but not exclusively, as he has other interests and areas of expertise, as an engineer for example.Getting information from the outside world to people in tightly controlled North Korea is key to changing the situation, he said.""North Korea employs a two-track strategy of maintaining the regime's power: designating an outside enemy to stir a sense of crisis among its people and showcasing new weapons to give a sense of pride,"" Park told AFP.But if the North Korean public ""awaken"", this strategy will stop working, he said, meaning that the endless cycle of ""provocation"" can end.","Park Choong-kwon was once a member of an elite North Korean unit that developed long-range missiles.

Feeling flush: Japan's high-tech toilets go global,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/feeling-flush-japans-high-tech-toilets-go-global/articleshow/110649653.cms,"'Smartest toilet'

'Does it hurt?'

KITAKYUSHU: As Japan plays host to a record influx of tourists, one of the country's more private attractions -- the high-tech toilet -- is becoming a must-have in luxury bathrooms worldwide.With their warm seats and precision spray technology, bidet toilets are the norm in Japan, where more than 80 percent of homes have one, according to a government survey.Now sales are surging abroad and especially in the United States, led by A-list bidet fans such as Drake, the Kardashians and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Japanese company TOTO , which pioneered the electric bidets it claims have sparked ""a global revolution from wiping to washing"", says overseas revenue for toilets has roughly doubled from 100 billion yen ($673 million) in 2012.The pandemic was a key driver, bringing a home-renovation boom but also germ-conscious consumers desperate for an alternative to toilet paper after shelves were cleared by panic-buyers.Senior TOTO executive Shinya Tamura, who oversees international business, told AFP the brand's growth has been a word-of-mouth success.When people first learn how the toilets' water jets work, with pressure and temperature controls, ""there's an image that it's not pleasant"".But ""we can't explain how good it is with words. You need to experience it"", Tamura said.""After a while, most users can't live without it.""The company's international net sales for housing equipment are currently less than a third of those in Japan.It wants to boost sales in the Americas by 19 percent over two years to ""establish a solid position"" there and offset less urgent demand in China.But with more people in the market for a squeaky clean bum, US competitors are challenging TOTO and its Japanese rivals such as Panasonic and LIXIL for their throne.At a major tech fair in Las Vegas this year, the marketing manager of US brand Kohler called its Numi 2.0 -- which takes spoken instructions via an in-built Amazon Alexa -- ""the smartest toilet that exists"".Just like top-end Japanese models, the Numi 2.0 has an automatic deodoriser and a motion-activated lid that opens when you enter the bathroom and closes when you leave.Its spray wand has pulsating and oscillating functions, and users can adjust the warm-air dryer in minute detail.But such pampering comes at a price: around $8,500 to $10,000, compared to around $500 for more basic bidet seats.Americans who travel to Japan are often inspired to upgrade their toilet, a salesman at Ardy's Bath Collection in Beverly Hills told AFP.""They see it in the airport, and they see it in public restrooms, and they use it, and they're like, 'wow, this is great,'"" he said.Bidets are ""popular everywhere"" but it's still a ""private experience"" and ""weird to talk about"" for some customers.Although fancy Japanese-style toilets are fast becoming a status symbol, TOTO's executives have long fought prudishness when trying to expand abroad.After the US launch of its Washlet bidet in 1986, the firm struggled to place advertisements, and its pop-up event was kicked out of a high-end mall because other stores complained.","Japanese company TOTO says overseas revenue for toilets has roughly doubled from 100 billion yen ($673 million) in 2012.

How a 'rich young Chinese looking for love' cost a senior citizen his life’s savings in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-a-rich-young-chinese-looking-for-love-cost-a-senior-citizen-his-lifes-savings-in-us/articleshow/110651877.cms,"Pig butchering

Building trust

Financial manipulation

In a heartbreaking story, a 75-year-old professional from the American Midwest fell victim to an online scam known as ""pig butchering."" The ordeal began with an innocent LinkedIn message. The scammer, posing as a wealthy young Chinese woman, praised the man’s professional achievements and suggested moving their conversation to WhatsApp for more privacy. This marked the beginning of a sophisticated fraud known as "" pig butchering ,"" where scammers build a romantic rapport with their victims to gain their trust and access their finances.The scammers often masquerade as beautiful young women with abundant wealth and few worries, convincing their victims that they share a special, clandestine bond. In reality, they are frequently men contacting their targets from dystopian compounds operated by Chinese criminal syndicates in parts of Southeast Asia and West Africa. These ""scam dens"" are notorious for abuse. Many scammers are trafficked in, given scripts and smartphones preloaded with fake profiles, and coerced into committing fraud under threat of violence.As per a Wall Street Journal report, the scammer, who introduced herself as Violaine Chen , claimed to be a successful gold futures trader living in San Francisco. She shared pictures of a luxurious lifestyle and engaged the victim in daily conversations about her meals, workouts, and charitable activities. The victim, captivated by her seemingly genuine personality and shared interests, began to trust her implicitly.“She hooked me,” the victim said, reflecting on how deeply he was drawn into the scam.As their relationship deepened, Violaine introduced the idea of investing together on a trading platform called FX6, which she claimed was owned by her uncle. She guided the man through the process of setting up an account on a related app called Fuex and convinced him to make his first deposit of $1,500. The two began to plan a romantic future together, discussing a road trip in an RV and the possibility of the man retiring early.Despite red flags, such as warnings from his bank and the occasional strange message from Violaine, the man continued to invest more money at her urging. He sold stocks and mutual funds, ultimately depositing over $300,000 into the Fuex account. The app appeared to show their combined investments growing to nearly $1.5 million, the WSJ report said.However, when the man attempted to withdraw funds for a down payment on a house Violaine's uncle wanted them to buy, his request was blocked. Fuex customer service agents, who were actually part of the scam, informed him that his account was frozen and demanded additional fees to release his funds. Desperate, the man paid the fees using his remaining investments, a bank loan, and a home-equity loan.In the end, the man had lost $716,212 and was left with no money, no family, and no soul mate. Violaine blamed him for the situation and eventually stopped responding to most of his messages. The man reported the crime to the FBI but has had no luck tracing where his money has gone. He continues to try accessing his locked Fuex account every day, hoping for a resolution that may never come, the WSJ report said.He continues to grapple with the emotional and financial fallout of the scam, hoping his story will raise awareness and prevent others from falling prey to similar schemes.“Please answer me. I need to know what’s going on here,” he pleaded in one of his last messages to Violaine, a woman he now understands never truly existed.","A 75-year-old professional from the American Midwest fell victim to an online scam known as ""pig butchering"" The scammer, posing as a wealthy young Chinese woman, praised the man’s professional achievements and suggested moving their conversation to WhatsApp for more privacy.

"'911 S5': Chinese national arrested, FBI takes down huge global army of zombie computer devices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/911-s5-chinese-national-arrested-fbi-takes-down-massive-global-army-of-zombie-computer-devices/articleshow/110548700.cms,"The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely.

What was the ""911 S5"" botnet?

The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, it was ""likely the world's largest"" and facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and access to child exploitation materials.

Who was behind the botnet?

Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang was arrested in Singapore on May 24. He allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers.

How did the botnet operate?

The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely. Cybercriminals purchased access to these compromised computers, using them to carry out various illegal activities.

What kind of crimes were committed using the botnet?

Criminals used the botnet for a staggering array of crimes. These included identity theft, financial fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and cyberattacks. The botnet was also involved in defrauding financial institutions and federal lending programs, including pandemic relief scams. US Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that the criminals were responsible for over $5.9 billion in estimated losses from relief program fraud.

What assets were seized during the operation?

Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods valued at $4 million, and about $30 million in real estate. These assets were located in various countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, and others. Additionally, 22 domains associated with the botnet were also seized.

How did the law enforcement operation unfold?

The operation, named Operation Tunnel Rat, involved executing multiple search warrants and conducting interviews in Singapore and Thailand. The FBI, along with international partners, dismantled the botnet's infrastructure and arrested Wang. Authorities are also looking into the possibility of additional arrests.

How did the public get involved in this operation?

The FBI has set up a web page where individuals can check if their IP address was among those compromised by the botnet. This helps potential victims identify and mitigate any security issues stemming from the infection.

What happens next for Yunhe Wang?

The US is currently awaiting Wang's extradition from Singapore. Brett Leatherman, deputy assistant director with the FBI’s Cyber Division, emphasized the urgency of the extradition, stating, “We want him, you know, as soon as possible.”

An international law enforcement team has made a significant breakthrough in the fight against cybercrime, arresting a Chinese national and dismantling a massive botnet that has been operational for nearly a decade. This botnet, known as "" 911 S5 ,"" was responsible for various illegal activities, including identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud . The takedown involved cooperation between authorities in multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of cybercrime and the necessity of international collaboration to combat it.The botnet, managed by Yunhe Wang , infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This network of compromised machines, often referred to as ""zombie"" computers, was used by criminals to carry out a wide array of illicit activities. The US Department of Justice and the FBI have been instrumental in this operation, which has led to significant financial and operational seizures, including millions in cryptocurrency and luxury assets.Here is all you need to know:(With inputs from agencies)","The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries.

The protest, dubbed a mass "" defecation flashmob ,"" is scheduled to take place on the day President Emmanuel Macron and Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo are set to swim in the river to promote its cleanliness, as reported by The Metro.The hashtag #JeChieDansLaSeineLe23Juin, which translates to 'I sh*t in the Seine on June 23', gained traction on X last week following the announcement of the swim date. A website with the same name was created, allowing participants to enter their planned defecation locations. The campaign's slogan reads, 'Because after putting us in sh*t it is up to them to bathe in our sh*t.'Social media has been inundated with memes, including an AI-generated image depicting toilets installed along the Seine's banks by 'the City of Paris' to counter the operation, and a fake picture showing the French president standing on a bridge over the feces-covered river.The protest comes amidst ongoing efforts to clean up the Seine for swimming, as was the case during the 1900 Paris Olympics. However, a sewer problem in the summer of 2023 led to the cancellation of a pre-Olympics swimming event. When asked if he would swim in the Seine, Macron said, 'You bet I will,' but refrained from disclosing the date to avoid attracting attention.Olympic open water and triathlon events are planned to take place in the river during the Paris 2024 Games. However, the French nonprofit Surfrider suggests that more work may be necessary to make certain sections of the Seine swimmable by July, as campaigners have found 'concentrations of enterococci and E. coli' in the river.Dr Leon Davis, senior lecturer in marketing and events management at Teesside University in Middlesbrough, England, told Metro.co.uk that the Seine will be the biggest challenge for the games, especially as the opening ceremony will break tradition by not being held at the stadium.",French citizens are planning a protest against the government's £1.2 billion state-backed plan to clean up the Seine River in Paris for the 2024 Olympic Games.
