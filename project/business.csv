NEW DELHI/JALANDHAR: In a goodwill gesture to followers of Guru Ravidas, whose Dalit followers are a sizeable presence in Punjab, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said his govt was continuously making efforts to promote the saint’s ideals and work in accordance with them.Modi addressed the followers at Dera Sachkhand Ballan soon after naming Adampur airport after the social reformer on his birth anniversary, lauding his message of equality. “I am confident that we will continue to strengthen the roots of our society with these efforts,” he said in a message of unity to the poet-saint’s followers. His inclusion of Ravidas in the saffron tent of its lodestars, where Lord Ram sits alongside revered saints, is being seen as his effort to deepen BJP’s connect and broaden its cultural appeal.His gesture of helping the spiritual head of Dera Sachkhand Ballan, the biggest dera of Ravidassia community, climb down the stairs from the dais and help him walk along by holding his hand touched a chord among followers as well. “Hum hain na! Kam padenge kya? (I am there. Will it not be enough),” he told someone who offered to lend a land, drawing admiration.In his speech, he spoke of Ravidas’s promotion of equality among people to emphasise it was an inspiration behind his govt’s effort to build a country where everybody got respect and opportunity.Ravidas’s birth anniversary is now commemorated at a national level and many states too have recognised it, he told the gathering, drawing attention to his govt’s work to build memorials to the saint, including at his birthplace in Varanasi, Modi’s parliamentary constituency.Modi’s outreach to the Ravidassia community, who are in large numbers in Punjab while the saint enjoys following among other Dalit and disadvantaged communities in the state and outside as well, is being seen as part of his continuing efforts to deepen BJP’s bond with SCs. Dalits make up 32% of voters in Punjab, more than any other state, and are especially influential with 42% share in Doaba, the region where the dera is situated.Dera’s spiritual head Niranjan Dass was recently awarded with Padma Shri Modi said 600 years ago, Ravidas spoke for equality and helped grow a new consciousness in society, which acknowledged its weaknesses and worked to remove them, an apparent reference to social discrimination against lower castes. Modi added his govt named the airport in Ayodhya after saint Valmiki, another spiritual figure worshipped by sections of Dalits.In his speech, Modi cited the budget’s focus on sports, textile industry and MSME sectors and said Punjab will specially benefit from them due to its strong association with these fields. India’s trade deals, especially with the European Union representing 27 countries, would open up new avenues for sports goods, textiles and processed foods from the state, Modi said.",Modi addressed the followers at Dera Sachkhand Ballan soon after naming Adampur airport after the social reformer on his birth anniversary.

Budget 2026 expectations: Will gold and silver import duties be hiked?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-will-gold-and-silver-import-duties-be-hiked/articleshow/127822182.cms,"Why gold and silver imports worry policymakers



Why markets expect a duty hike



Why demand has held up despite record prices



Will higher duties curb demand?



Why silver is also under scrutiny



India’s gold and silver imports surged to record levels in 2025, ringing alarm bells in government and policy circles as soaring precious metal prices threaten to widen the trade deficit and add fresh pressure on the rupee. With limited policy tools available, officials and market participants told Reuters raising import duties is once again emerging as a key option under consideration.Any move to raise import duties may be signalled through the Union Budget 2026, either via changes in the customs duty structure or through an enabling provision allowing the government flexibility to act if external pressures intensify.Gold imports rose 1.6% year-on-year to $58.9 billion in 2025, while silver imports jumped sharply by 44% to $9.2 billion, even as global prices of both metals hit historic highs. Together, gold and silver accounted for nearly a tenth of India’s total foreign exchange reserves last year, a share that could rise further in 2026 if prices continue to climb.India is the world’s second-largest consumer of gold and the largest market for silver, but it depends almost entirely on imports to meet domestic demand for gold and more than 80% of its silver requirements. The surge in imports has widened the trade deficit and contributed to weakness in the rupee, which touched a record low earlier this month.While silver has extensive industrial uses—from solar power to electronics—gold is largely consumed for jewellery and investment. Policymakers have long viewed gold demand as non-essential and a drain on foreign exchange, prompting repeated attempts to curb imports through higher duties.With gold and silver prices at record highs, even stable import volumes translate into a sharply higher import bill. Trade and industry officials say this could prompt the government to consider raising duties in the coming weeks to contain external imbalances.India has a precedent. In 2012–13, New Delhi sharply increased gold import duties to stabilise the rupee during a period of currency stress. Traders now speculate a similar move could be on the cards, potentially reversing the 2024 duty cuts, when import taxes on both metals were slashed to 6% from 15% to curb smuggling.Reflecting these expectations, gold and silver in India are already trading at a premium to global benchmarks as markets price in the risk of higher duties.Gold prices in international markets have surged 98% since the start of 2025, dampening jewellery demand. Yet overall consumption has remained resilient due to a sharp rise in investment demand.While jewellery accounted for over three-fourths of India’s gold demand until 2023, investment now makes up more than 40% of total consumption. Investors have increasingly turned to gold coins, bars and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to benefit from the rally.ETF inflows jumped 283% in 2025 to a record Rs 429.6 billion ($4.69 billion), cushioning the impact of weaker jewellery buying and keeping imports elevated.Past experience suggests duty hikes may have limited impact. When India raised gold import tax to 10% in 2013 from 2%, demand remained largely unchanged. Domestic gold prices have climbed from about Rs 8,000 per 10 grams in 2006 to around Rs 1.62 lakh now, yet annual demand has not seen a sustained decline.Analysts say a fresh duty hike of 4–6 percentage points is unlikely to deter buyers, who absorbed a 76.5% price jump in 2025. Instead, higher duties could lift investor returns and risk reviving smuggling.Silver prices have risen even faster than gold, sharply inflating India’s import bill. While industrial demand was the main driver earlier, investment demand has gained traction in recent months.Silver ETF inflows surged to Rs 234.7 billion in 2025, up from Rs 85.69 billion a year earlier. The growing popularity of silver as an investment suggests imports could rise further if the price rally persists.--- just after peg-- Need 1-2 lines on how this change may be announced in the Budget","Gold imports rose 1.6% year-on-year to $58.9 billion in 2025.

What do salaried taxpayers, middle class, and the common man want from

Union Budget 2026

on the income tax front? We take a look at the top 5 expectations.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

Income Tax Slabs FY 2026-27 & Rebate Under Section 87A

Income up to Rs 4 lakh is exempt from tax - so the basic exemption limit is Rs 4 lakh. There is an ask among taxpayers that this limit be hiked further to reduce compliance burden.

Income in the Rs 4 lakh to Rs 8 lakh bracket attracts a 5% tax.

Income in the Rs 8 lakh to Rs 12 lakh bracket attracts a 10% tax.

Income ranging from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 16 lakh is taxed at 15%, rising to 20% for income between Rs 16 lakh and Rs 20 lakh. Those earning between Rs 20 lakh and rs 24 lakh are taxed at 25%.

Any income above Rs 24 lakh is taxed at the highest slab rate of 30%. Salaried taxpayers want FM Sitharaman to raise the income threshold for 30% tax bracket to Rs 30 lakh.

At present income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers) is tax free after availing rebate under Section 87A. Tax experts suggest that this limit can be hiked to Rs 15 lakh.

Standard Deduction

Home Loan Interest

self-occupied residential property

Section 80C

Tax Filing Compliance

Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Like every year, salaried taxpayers, middle class and common man will listen to FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget speech in the hope of more tax relief. Last year, FM Sitharaman announced major changes in the new income tax regime, and while tax experts believe that there is little fiscal room in Budget 2026 for any big tax income tweaks, there is also a hope that some changes may be brought about to further boost consumption.At present the income tax slabs under the new tax regime are:Several taxpayers continue to file tax returns under the old income tax regime. They want the government to reduce tax rates and hike basic exemption limit under that regime as well.Standard deduction limits under the old and the new income tax regimes differ. Those filing tax under the old income tax regime get the benefit of Rs 50,000 standard deduction, while those under the new income tax regime can avail a higher standard deduction of Rs 75,000. Tax experts are of the view that there is a case to hike the standard deduction limit, especially under the new tax regime which offers very few deductions and exemptions.Individual taxpayers can avail tax deduction on the interest paid on a home loan under the old income tax regime. The interest you pay on a home loan for yourcan be deducted from your taxable income up to ₹2 lakh per year (or actual interest paid if less). Tax experts are of the view that to encourage housing sector, this benefit should also be available under the new tax regime.Section 80C is a popular exemption available under the old income tax regime, but its limit of Rs 1.5 lakh has remained unchanged for many years now. The exemption is for investments made in Provident Fund, Public Provident Fund (PPF), mutual funds and other popular investment options. Tax experts believe that to incentivise savings, there is a case to not only hike this limit, but also include this exemption benefit under the new income tax regime to encourage adoption.The government has been focusing on ease of income tax return filing, but taxpayers believe that e-filing of returns still needs to be made easier. The tax compliance mechanism, grievance redressal system, and tax queries related to mismatches in the Annual Information Statement (AIS), Form 16, Form 26AS needs to be made less complicated, say tax experts.","Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Like every year, salaried taxpayers, middle class and common man will listen to FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget speech in the hope of more tax relief.

NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark indices slumped sharply on Budget day on Sunday, with both the Sensex and Nifty50 ending more than 2% lower as markets reacted negatively to the fine print of the Union Budget.The BSE Sensex plunged 1,843 points, or 2.23%, to close at 80,722.94, while the NSE Nifty50 fell 593 points, or 2.33%, to 24,825.45, wiping out early gains as selling pressure intensified through the session.At 12:30, BSE Sensex was trading at 81,119, trimming 1,150 points or 1.40% while NSE Nifty50 reached 24,790, down 530 points or 2.09%.The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) had issued separate circulars confirming that trading will proceed as usual on Budget day.Both exchanges said market hours will remain unchanged, following the standard schedule for a regular trading session.Gold and silver prices tumbled on Sunday, hitting lower circuit levels in futures trade ahead of the Union Budget 2026–27 presentation. Gold futures for April 2, 2026, delivery dropped Rs 9,140, or 6%, to Rs 1,43,205 per 10 grams, while silver futures for March 5, 2026, delivery fell Rs 17,515, or 6%, to Rs 2,74,410 per kg.The steep fall extended to MCX shares, which slipped 10% to hit the lower circuit at Rs 2,145.25. Analysts attributed the selloff to profit-booking following Friday’s historic crash, which saw both metals post their sharpest single-day declines. Market participants are closely watching how the Union Budget and global cues influence the recovery of precious metals in the coming sessions.Also read: Gold, silver prices crash on Budget 2026 day; hit lower circuit levels in futures trade - what’s causing the slide? The BSE added that while key segments such as equity, futures and options, and commodity derivatives will operate normally, certain specialised sessions will be suspended. “Trading Members may note that trading in the T+0 Settlement Session and Auction Session for settlement default will not be conducted on Sunday, February 01, 2026,” the exchange said.Trading on a Sunday is uncommon for Dalal Street, as both exchanges typically remain shut on weekends and designated public holidays. February 1 will therefore be among the rare Sundays when markets are open for regular trading.Talking about investor expectations, Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited said, “Investors don’t have expectations of any major tax reliefs in this Budget since the 2025 Budget delivered huge income tax reliefs. Some tweaking of certain taxes is likely. If there is an increase in exemption for long-term capital gains tax from Rs 1.25 lakhs presently to a higher limit that would be a positive. From the market perspective, a fiscally prudent, growth-oriented Budget is desirable. There are rumours of exemption from long-term capital gains tax for certain categories of FIIs. If this happens, it can trigger a rally in the market.”Further mentioning sectors that’ll be in focus, he added, “Higher allocation for defense is a given and, therefore, defense stocks will continue to be in focus. A thrust area of the Budget can be exports, particularly manufacturing exports which the Economic Survey harps on. Therefore, export segments are likely to be on the radar of investors. Announcements relating to PSU bank mergers; disinvestment in PSUs will be keenly watched. Aside from the Budget, the crash in precious metal prices may bring investors back into equity.""A look at market trends over the past decade shows that Budgets have sparked strong rallies, but many have led to muted moves or even declines.Markets generally respond well when the Budget emphasises growth, infrastructure spending and tax stability. In 2017, for instance, then finance minister Arun Jaitley avoided major tax hikes and offered relief to the middle class. Investors welcomed the approach, with the Sensex rising about 1.7% and the Nifty gaining nearly 1.8% , one of the stronger Budget Day performances of that period.Another standout came in 2021, when Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Budget in the wake of the Covid-19 shock. With a clear push towards economic recovery, higher capital expenditure, healthcare and infrastructure, markets rallied sharply. The Sensex jumped over 2% and the Nifty climbed almost 2.7%, marking one of the best Budget Day gains in recent years.But not every Budget has cheered investors. In 2016, higher dividend taxation dampened sentiment, and the Sensex ended the day in the red. In 2018, the introduction of long-term capital gains tax on listed equities and equity mutual funds caught markets off guard. Although indices slipped only modestly on the day, they fell around 6.8% over the following sessions. The 2023 Budget triggered a largely flat reaction, as it maintained fiscal discipline but lacked big-bang reforms to excite traders.The July 2024 Budget also drew a cautious response. Changes related to capital gains taxation surprised some investors. While the reaction was not severe, both the Sensex and Nifty ended slightly lower, underscoring how unexpected tax measures can weigh on sentiment even when the broader macro picture is stable.Also historically, volatility after the Budget has been common, and one-month returns have often been mixed.As the nation heads into the Union Budget 2026, market conditions are already unsettled. Equity indices have pulled back from recent highs, foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers, and global factors such as interest rates, geopolitical tensions and trade policies continue to influence sentiment. In this backdrop, sharp moves on Budget Day are almost inevitable.","BSE Sensex plunged 1,843 points, or 2.23%, to close at 80,722.94. NSE Nifty50 fell 593 points,or 2.33%, to 24,825.45.

Parliament Budget Session

: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget 2026 in Parliament on February 1, 2026.The Union Budget 2026 will mark FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s ninth consecutive Budget presentation, making her the first finance minister in India to achieve this milestone. She will also become the first finance minister to present a Union Budget on a Sunday, adding to the historic significance of the occasion.In 1999, when February 28 fell on a Sunday, then finance minister Yashwant Sinha presented the Union Budget a day earlier, on Saturday, February 27. Nirmala Sitharaman has previously presented Budgets on Saturdays as well — on February 1, 2020, shortly before the Covid-19 lockdown, and again on February 1, 2025.Until 1999, the Union Budget was presented at 5 pm, a colonial-era practice aligned with British working hours. That convention was changed by then finance minister Yashwant Sinha, who shifted the Budget presentation to 11 am, a practice that continues to this day. Later, in 2017, former finance minister Arun Jaitley introduced another reform by advancing the Budget presentation to February 1 from the end of the month.The Budget 2026 will be delivered during the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament and will lay out the government’s fiscal roadmap for the 2026–27 financial year. The Budget speech is scheduled for February 1, 2026, with the Finance Minister expected to begin her address at 11:00 am.The Union Budget is generally presented on February 1 to allow ministries and departments adequate time to implement proposals from the start of the new financial year on April 1.Viewers can watch the Union Budget 2026 speech live through multiple official and media platforms:The full Budget documents will be made available online soon after the speech, along with explanatory statements and annexures.The Budget Session of Parliament commenced with President Droupadi Murmu addressing members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on January 28. The first phase of the session is scheduled from January 28 to February 13, while the second phase will run from March 9 to April 2, with the session comprising 30 sittings.The Union Budget is a key annual policy statement that outlines government spending, taxation proposals and fiscal strategy for the coming year, and the 2026 presentation will be closely tracked across sectors, markets and households.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget 2026 in Parliament on February 1, 2026.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

Focus shifts to improving existing cities, says expert privy to 16th FC

New Delhi: With just two months to go for the award of the 15th Finance Commission (FC) to end (March 31), the Rs 8,000 crore allocated for a performance-based challenge fund to develop eight new cities has remained unutilised for the last five years. Similarly, there has been little progress on checking air pollution in cities with a million-plus population.After the 15th Finance Commission headed by NK Singh recommended the challenge fund to incubate new cities as a pilot to promote planned urbanisation and ease pressure on existing cities, the housing and urban affairs ministry invited proposals and received 28 of them from 23 states. But it has so far not finalised even a single city for the purpose, having failed to complete the evaluation exercise.""This is one of the areas where the desired targets have not been met,"" said an expert.We have understood well that we need to improve our existing cities and urban areas rather than creating new ones. Naya Raipur is a live example for all of us,” said the expert privy to the deliberations of the 16th Finance Commission, led by Arvind Panagariya, whose recommendations will be tabled in Parliament on Sunday.The award of the 16th FC will cover the period from 2026-27 to 2030-31.The 15th FC had also designated the housing and urban affairs ministry as the nodal entity for grants to million-plus population cities for initiating measures to check air pollution by using mechanical sweeping machines, promoting non-motorised transport (pedestrian and bicycle) and paving side flanks of roads with facility for water percolation. The outcome of this exercise is awaited, with a report likely to be tabled in Parliament.Similarly, six years after the announcement to launch a new scheme to improve city bus availability, not a single bus has been deployed under the scheme yet. In Feb 2020, govt had announced that the Rs 18,000 crore scheme would facilitate deployment of innovative PPP models to enable private sector players to finance, acquire, operate and maintain over 20,000 buses.The Economic Survey presented in Parliament this week mentioned that govt has launched PM e-Bus Sewa to strengthen city bus operations with 10,000 e-buses on a PPP model.It said, “Official status notes for FY25 report 7,293 e-buses approved across 14 states and four UTs, Rs 983.75 crore sanctioned for depots and behind-the-meter power infrastructure and Rs 437.5 crore already disbursed.” The report said that despite these measures, gaps in mass transit services persist. It added that housing and urban affairs ministry has recommended 40-60 buses per one lakh population; yet, many cities have far fewer buses. “Nationally, only about 47,650 buses serve its urban residents. Nearly 61% of these are concentrated in just nine megacities. Due to the layout of urban roads, low bus availability combined with high private vehicle use reduces person throughput per lane kilometre, leading to congestion and longer door-to-door travel times,” the survey said.","The Rs 8,000 crore allocated for a performance-based challenge fund to develop eight new cities has remained unutilised for the last five years.

In effect, therefore, conversion to NRI gives those with low scores in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Postgraduate) but deep pockets a shot at getting seats in high demand clinical disciplines.The 811 candidates found to be eligible for conversion to NRI quota include two categories - those who actually are NRIs or children of NRIs and a second category of those who can show themselves to be wards of first degree or second degree relatives who are NRIs.There are 113 candidates in the first group and 698 in the second group.The lowest score among non-resident Indians in the first category is 82 out of 800, or just over 10%, while it is 28 (3.5%) in the second category.In the first category, 75 (66%) candidates scored less than 215, which means their rank is below 1.5 lakh.Over 60% (422) of 698 candidates in the second category of non-resident Indian are below 1.5 lakh rank.But with deep pockets, these candidates can afford the NRI quota fees for any specialty.Annual fees for NRI quota PG seats in a clinical specialty could be as high as Rs 45 lakh to Rs 95 lakh per year, depending on the specialty, state and on whether the medical college is a deemed university.If courts and the govt did not allow conversion of Indians to NRIs, many of the NRI quota seats would remain unfilled and would have to be converted into management seats where the fees would be much less.However, with even courts accepting the argument that private medical colleges cannot afford any financial loss, definition of NRIs has been expanded to allow candidates who don't have NRI parents or siblings to show themselves as a ward of near relatives, including NRI uncles, aunts or grandparents, who can sponsor them.","Seats in NRI quota are the most expensive but that also means competition is less, with cut-offs lower than even for management quota.

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman may not have opened the purse strings for poll-bound states in Union Budget 2026 but she made them a part of many ambitious development initiatives like the rare earth corridor, dedicated freight passage and the proposed high-speed rail networks.Assembly elections are scheduled in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry later this year. With the BJP going all out to wrest Bengal from Mamata's Trinamool Congress and make inroads in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, there were expectations that Nirmala Sitharaman would announce a slew of proposals with these states in focus like many times in the past. While the Budget did not make big-ticket state-specific announcements, there was something to cheer for all the poll-bound states.So, while Tamil Nadu got a high-speed rail link for Chennai, ecologically sustainable mountain trail in Podhigai Malai in the Western Ghats and a rare earth corridor in the Budget, poll-bound Bengal featured in many infrastructure, logistics, rail and tourism initiatives. Kerala found mention in the context of rare earths and the turtle trail.A key announcement for West Bengal was the proposal to develop a new dedicated freight corridor from Dankuni in West Bengal to Surat in Gujarat, aimed at promoting environmentally sustainable and efficient movement of cargo.The corridor is expected to significantly reduce logistics costs for industries in eastern India, and improve connectivity between the eastern and western markets.In another major push, Sitharaman said the Centre will develop an Integrated East Coast Industrial Corridor, with a well-connected industrial node at Durgapur, a key manufacturing hub in West Bengal. The project is expected to strengthen the state's role in the Centre's 'Purvodaya' vision for accelerating industrial growth in eastern India.The Budget also proposed the creation of five tourism destinations across the five 'Purvodaya' states, including West Bengal, to boost employment and regional development. To support sustainable urban mobility in these regions, the government also said it will make a provision for 4,000 electric buses.To boost rail connectivity, Sitharaman announced plans to develop seven high-speed rail corridors across the country, with one of the proposed routes linking Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and Siliguri in northern West Bengal. The corridor is expected to significantly cut travel time, and enhance economic and strategic integration of north Bengal with the rest of the country.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee described the Union Budget for 2026-27 as a “directionless and visionless Humpty Dumpty”, claiming that it had nothing to offer to the common man and her state. “This Budget is directionless, visionless, actionless and anti-people. It is also anti-women, anti-farmer, anti-education and against the SC, ST and OBC... There is nothing on offer for Bengal... in the Humpty Dumpty budget,"" she said.“For West Bengal, what have they given (in the Budget)? Nothing. They talk big, but offer nothing,” Mamata added.Tamil Nadu got a high-speed rail link for Chennai, ecologically sustainable mountain trail in Podhigai Malai in the Western Ghats and a rare earth corridor. Bird watching trails along the Pulikat lake and development of the archaeological site of Adichanallur into a vibrant, experiential cultural destinations were among the other announcements for the poll-bound state.In Adichanallur, excavated landscapes will be opened to the public through curated walkways. Immersive storytelling skills and technologies will be introduced to help conservation labs, interpretation centres, and guides.Sitharaman also announced that Hyderabad-Chennai and Chennai-Bengaluru will be part of the seven high-speed rail corridors between cities as growth connectors.Tamil Nadu is also one of the key states that will be part of the dedicated rare earth corridor to promote mining, processing, research and manufacturing. The Centre had in November 2025 launched a scheme for Rare Earth Permanent Magnets. The proposed corridor is an extension of that effort.India has the potential and opportunity to offer world-class trekking and hiking experience. Ecologically sustainable mountain trail will be developed in Podhigai Malai in the Western Ghats. Also, bird watching trails will be developed along the Pulikat lake which covers both Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in her speech.Tamil Nadu, which is home to thousands of temples and pilgrimage centres like Rameswaram and has several temple-towns including Madurai, Kancheepuram and Kumbakonam, will also benefit from the initiatives announced in the Budget.Kerala will be part of ""rare earth corridors"" and ""Turtle Trails"" announced in Budget 2026. The ""Turtle Trails"" would be established along key nesting sites in coastal regions aimed at conservation and eco-tourism. The dedicated Rare Earth Corridors aim to boost mining, processing, research and manufacturing in the sector.The state found little else to cheer, with several long-anticipated projects missing from Centre's plans. The state was not included in the proposed high-speed rail corridors, while neighbouring Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana featured in the network expansion.Kerala's ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) criticised Budget 2026, saying it left the state largely sidelined.Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor said ""There was a reference to an All India Institute of Ayurveda being established, but not any indication as to where. Kerala would imagine that, as a major centre of Ayurveda, it should be a logical place, but they haven't promised us that.""""Even when coconuts and cashews were talked about, the state wasn't mentioned. So, I am assuming that some of these subheadings she spoke about will translate into concrete projects and programmes for us....but where details came, we had reason for disappointment, for example, ship repair for inland waterways, they are parking them in Varanasi and Patna despite Kerala having so many rivers and inland waterways,"" he added.Assam hopes to benefit from the Union Budget's thrust on infrastructure development of Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, as well as the announcement of Buddhist Circuits. The focus on MSMEs will be advantageous for the poll-bound state, which has a large number of small and medium enterprises, said officials.The proposal for setting up a Buddhist Circuit in the region, including Assam, also features in the Union Budget for 2026-27. The scheme will cover preservation of temples and monasteries, pilgrimage interpretation centers, connectivity and pilgrim amenities.""The North-Eastern Region is a civilisational confluence of Theravada and Mahayana/Vajrayana traditions. I propose to launch a scheme for development of Buddhist Circuits in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Assam, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura,"" Sitharaman said.The Budget also proposes creation of five tourism destinations in the five 'Purvodaya' states and proposes to upgrade the National Mental Health Institutes in Tezpur as a Regional Apex Institution.In a series of X posts, Assam chief minsiter Himanta Biswa Sarma listed out several points from the Union Budget and asserted that the state is going to gain in many aspects.""The announcement of Self-Help Marts (SHE-Marts) will further strengthen Assam's efforts towards building a robust ecosystem of Lakhpati Didis under #MMUA,"" Sarma said.The chief minister maintained that the emphasis on skilling in the Budget aligns with Assam's vision to emerge as a trusted hub for skilled professionals in healthcare, AI and other allied sectors. ""This Budget provides Rs 2 lakh crore under the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment, which will accelerate infrastructure activities in Assam,"" he added.","West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry will hold assembly elections later this year. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman made them a part of many ambitious development initiatives. Bengal featured in many infrastructure, logistics, rail and tourism initiatives. Kerala found mention in the context of rare earths and the turtle trail.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127841613,imgsize-1153884,width-400,resizemode-4/127841613.jpg"
Farmers left empty-handed despite Budget hopes: BKU Charuni,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farmers-left-empty-handed-despite-budget-hopes-bku-charuni/articleshow/127843325.cms,"Photo credit: ANI

KURUKSHETRA:

Subsidies, Jobs, AI Tool: FM Sitharaman Unveils Big Budget Boost For Agri Sector To Help Farmers

The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Charuni has strongly criticised the Union Budget 2026–27 presented by the Central Government on Sunday, terming it anti-farmer, disappointing and far removed from ground realities. The farmers’ body said millions of farmers across the country had high expectations from the budget, but once again those hopes were dashed.In a statement issued after the budget presentation, the BKU (Charuni) media in-charge Rakesh Kumar Bains said the government focused heavily on technology, artificial intelligence, digital platforms and futuristic plans in its budget speech, while completely ignoring the immediate and pressing issues faced by farmers.The farm union pointed out that the budget remained silent on several key demands, including a legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, the continuously rising cost of farming, sharp increases in prices of diesel, fertilisers, seeds and pesticides, and comprehensive loan waivers for debt-burdened farmers. It also criticised the absence of concrete measures for adequate compensation for crop losses caused by natural disasters and the failure to enhance the amount under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme.According to the BKU (Charuni), the annual assistance of Rs 6,000 provided under PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme has become inadequate in the present economic conditions and has effectively turned into a “mockery” for farmers. Despite repeated assurances by the government, no firm announcement was made in the budget to increase this amount. Similarly, the farm union expressed strong disappointment over the government’s continued silence on granting a legal guarantee to MSP, calling it a betrayal of farmers’ trust.The farmers’ union alleged that while the budget provides relief to corporates and promotes policies on paper, it fails to address the concerns of farmers who toil in the fields. “Farmers do not need Apps or speeches; they need fair prices, security and dignity,” the statement said.The BKU (Charuni) has demanded that the government immediately provide a legal guarantee for MSP, increase the PM-Kisan assistance to at least Rs 12,000 per year, implement loan waivers along with affordable credit facilities for farmers, and reform the crop insurance scheme to make it simpler, transparent and farmer-friendly.Warning of future action, BKU Charuni said that if the government continues to ignore farmers’ issues, it will not hesitate to adopt agitational measures to protect farmers’ interests.","The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Charuni has strongly criticised the Union Budget 2026–27 presented by the Central Government on Sunday.

PM Modi Calls Budget 2026 Historic As Reforms Empower Youth Women And India’s Growth Push

LUCKNOW: The Union Budget 2026-27 on Sunday drew mixed reactions from the top echelons of Uttar Pradesh politics, with chief minister Yogi Adityanath terming it a welfare-oriented blueprint for building a 'Viksit Bharat', and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav rebuking it as an ""invisible ledger"" of the BJP's corruption.In a post on X in Hindi, Adityanath said, ""On the auspicious occasion of Maghi Purnima and the birth anniversary of Sadguru Ravidas Ji Maharaj, the Union Budget 2026-27, presented today by the Hon'ble Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman under the visionary guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is an inspiring blueprint for building a 'Viksit Bharat'.""This Budget will provide opportunities to the youth, security to farmers, encouragement to entrepreneurs, relief to the middle class, and respect to the labourers.""This was the third Budget of the BJP-led NDA government in its third term in office.The chief minister said the Budget announcements would give a new impetus to innovation, manufacturing and employment, while strengthening agriculture, rural development, infrastructure, tourism, culture and the country's knowledge traditions, ""thus realising the mantra of 'Development with Heritage'"".""Under the guidance of the prime minister, the foundation for an ' Aatmanirbhar Bharat ' has been further strengthened by supporting MSMEs, startups and indigenous production.We are confident that this Budget, through social justice, inclusive development and good governance, will pave the way for the India of today and tomorrow,"" Adityanath said, thanking the prime minister and the finance minister for a ""visionary"" ""welfare-oriented"" Budget.Samajwadi Party chief president Akhilesh Yadav, however, launched a sharp attack on the Centre, saying the Budget is meant to aid the BJP's own people and commissions, calling it an ""invisible ledger"" of its corruption.Taking to X, Yadav said, ""The result of the BJP's Budget is out - the stock market has crashed. We already said that the question was not whether the stock market would open on Sunday, but how much more it would fall.""Reiterating that there was no reason to expect anything positive from the Budget, the former chief minister said, ""When there is no hope from the BJP government, what can be expected from its Budget?""Yadav also said the Samajwadi Party considers every BJP budget as a ""1/20th Budget"" as it caters to only 5 per cent of the population.""The BJP's Budget is meant for its own people and commissions. It is an invisible ledger of its corruption,"" he alleged.Yadav also said the Budget neither mentioned nor cared for the common people, flagging the ""failure"" to provide tax relief to the public despite soaring inflation as ""tax exploitation"".In a lengthy post, Yadav claimed that while multiple concessions have been given to the businesses and leisure activities of the rich, the plate of expectations of those struggling with joblessness and unemployment remained empty.""This is a disappointing and condemnable Budget,"" he claimed.Reacting to the Budget, Uttar Pradesh Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said, ""It focuses on youth and women empowerment, job creation, and strengthening education and healthcare. With sound policies and a results-oriented vision, the Budget firmly propels us towards the goal of a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047.""""From manufacturing to infrastructure, healthcare to tourism, rural economy to AI, sports to pilgrimage - the Budget opens up vast opportunities in every sector.""The allocation of two crucial high-speed rail corridors to Uttar Pradesh - Varanasi-Delhi and Varanasi-Siliguri - out of the seven planned corridors, will give a new direction to the state's connectivity, investment and development,"" Maurya said.","The Union Budget 2026-27 drew mixed reactions from the top echelons of Uttar Pradesh politics.

MCC adds 49 Hamdard postgraduate seats to round III after Supreme Court order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mcc-adds-49-hamdard-postgraduate-seats-to-round-iii-after-supreme-court-order/articleshow/127836690.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Acting on the Supreme Court’s directions in a petition filed by affected candidates, the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) has added 49 postgraduate medical seats of the Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (HIMSR) to the Round III seat matrix, enabling students to exercise choices immediately.The admissions will be conducted through centralised All India Quota counselling, making candidates from across states eligible. While the bulk of the seats are located in Delhi, where HIMSR is based, the national counselling process allows applicants from all parts of the country to compete for them.The Supreme Court permitted counselling for the 2025–26 academic year despite the consent of affiliation from Jamia Hamdard Deemed to be University not having been issued, noting that procedural delays should not result in students losing an academic year.The 49 seats span multiple clinical and non-clinical disciplines, including general medicine, general surgery, paediatrics, orthopaedics, obstetrics and gynaecology, anaesthesiology, radiodiagnosis, pathology, pharmacology and microbiology, and are spread across minority, self-financed and NRI categories.Following the court’s order, MCC issued a formal notice confirming that the seats have been incorporated into the Round III counselling matrix and that candidates can now lock their preferences, even as the affiliation issue remains unresolved.The case once again highlights recurring friction between regulatory approvals, university affiliations and counselling timelines, with courts stepping in to protect student interests when administrative processes threaten to derail an academic session.","The Supreme Court permitted counselling for the 2025–26 academic year despite the consent of affiliation from Jamia Hamdard Deemed to be University not having been issued.

NEW DELHI: February is likely to be warmer than usual with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday predicting ‘above normal’ monthly minimum (night) and maximum (day) temperatures over most parts of the country during the month and ‘below normal’ cold wave days over several parts of northwest India, including Delhi-NCR, and adjoining central India. The Met department also issued advisories, noting how dry and higher-than-normal temperatures during the month may adversely impact farm and allied sectors in terms of yield reduction.The IMD, while releasing a monthly weather outlook for February, also predicted ‘below normal’ rainfall over most parts of the country, except some areas of northwest and east-central India.The less rainfall situation during the month may impact the standing Rabi (winter sown) crops in terms of increasing irrigation cost, whereas the ‘above normal’ temperatures in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan could lead to “forced maturity” of crops like wheat and barley, leading to sterile spikelets and chaffy grains, resulting in yield reduction.“The crop advisories and impacts have been prepared by us in association with the department of agriculture, for which farmers need to be prepared,” said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra while sharing the likely impact of ‘above normal’ temperatures on agriculture.He said, “Oilseeds and pulses such as mustard, chickpea, lentil, and field pea may show early flowering and premature maturity, resulting in poor pod development, reduced seed size and lower yields.”Warmer conditions may also favour rapid multiplication of aphids and othersucking pests, impacting standing crops. Vegetable crops such as potato, onion, garlic, tomato, cauliflower, cabbage, and peas may also be adversely affected during critical stages like tuber initiation, bulb development, flowering, and fruit setting.IMD shared that the elevated temperatures can induce bolting in onion and garlic, reduce tuber bulking in potato, cause flower drop in tomato, and deteriorate cole crops, thereby lowering yield and market value.“Horticultural crops such as mango, citrus, banana, and grapes may experience earlyflowering, uneven fruit set and increased fruit drop. ‘Above normal’ temperatures may also reduce chilling accumulation in temperate fruits like apple, pear and peach, leading to irregular flowering and poor fruit development,” said the Met department in its Agromet advisory.It also underlined the impact on livestock and poultry, saying they may experience heat stress, resulting in reduced feed intake, decline in milk yield and egg production, and increased susceptibility to diseases if adequate cooling and hydration measures are not adopted.","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday predicted ‘above normal’ monthly minimum (night) and maximum (day) temperatures over most parts of the country during the month. ‘below normal” cold wave days over several parts of northwest India, including Delhi-NCR, and adjoining central India.

NEW DELHI: Even after sharp observations from the Supreme Court and repeated reminders from the Union health ministry, the National Medical Commission has failed to enforce its own directions on payment of stipends to medical interns, with 65 medical colleges still yet to submit required details, according to an RTI reply.On October 28, 2025, the Supreme Court of India took note of a public notice issued earlier by the NMC on July 11, directing medical colleges to upload details of stipend payments to interns within seven days. The court observed that although the regulator had sought the information, it appeared to be “dragging its feet”, as no action seemed to have been taken against non-compliant institutions. The bench expressed hope that the NMC would act on its own warning at least by the next date of hearing.Following the court’s observations, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare wrote to the NMC on November 3, asking it to examine the matter and take appropriate action. With no response forthcoming, the ministry sent a reminder on December 16.Earlier, in its July 11 public notice, the NMC had warned that failure to comply with directions on stipend disclosure would attract regulatory action, including show-cause notices, financial penalties, withdrawal of course recognition and suspension of admissions.Responding to queries, NMC officials said that out of 764 medical colleges in the country, 595 are eligible to train interns and are required to pay stipends. Around 560 colleges have submitted stipend details, while about 35 remain in default. Officials said the commission has issued multiple reminders, filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court on November 11, 2025, and issued a show-cause notice on November 3, 2025, warning of action under the NMC Act. They added that responses from defaulting colleges are being examined and a final list will be placed before the Undergraduate Medical Education Board for action as per rules.However, the RTI reply dated January 19 stated that about 65 medical colleges were yet to furnish stipend details. The reply did not clarify whether this higher number reflected an earlier stage of data compilation or included institutions not eligible to train interns.RTI activist Dr Babu KV, however, said the RTI response does not indicate that any regulatory action has been initiated so far against defaulting colleges, despite the Supreme Court’s observations and repeated communications from the health ministry.","The National Medical Commission has failed to enforce its own directions on payment of stipends to medical interns. 65 medical colleges are still yet to submit required details, according to an RTI reply.

India Can Be Pivotal In Peace And Two-State Solution, Says Palestine Ambassador

New Delhi: PM Narendra Modi met the Palestinian foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian, and reiterated India’s continued support for the people of Palestine and welcomed ongoing peace efforts, including the Gaza peace plan.The minister met the PM as a member of a delegation of the foreign ministers of Arab countries who are in India for the second India-Arab Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. The meeting saw external affairs minister S Jaishankar asserting that the countries targeted by terrorism have the right to defend themselves.According to an Indian readout, Modi conveyed his appreciation for the important role played by the Arab League in supporting efforts towards regional peace and stability.“The Arab world is a part of India’s extended neighbourhood, linked by deep civilisational bonds, vibrant people-to-people connections and enduring brotherly ties, as well as a shared commitment to peace, progress and stability. Confident that enhanced cooperation in technology, energy, trade and innovation will unlock new opportunities and take the partnership to new heights,” said Modi in a post on X.Highlighting the “humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza”, the Palestinian minister told Modi Palestine values India’s principled support for Palestinian rights under international law.According to external affairs ministry, the PM outlined his vision for the India-Arab partnership in the years ahead and reaffirmed India’s commitment to further deepen cooperation in trade and investment, energy, technology, healthcare and other priority areas, for the mutual benefit of our peoples.“India has been a long-standing development partner for Palestine. This has been rendered both bilaterally and through UN agencies. India has so far given assistance worth USD 170 million. Of these, projects worth USD 40 million are under implementation,” said a source.In the foreign ministers’ meeting, Jaishankar strongly raised the issue of cross-border terrorism saying it’s particularly unacceptable because it violates the basic principles of international relations and diplomacy. He also told the Arab foreign ministers societies targeted by terrorism have the right to defend themselves and will understandably exercise it. “It is essential that we strengthen international cooperation to combat what is a global scourge. Zero-tolerance for terrorism must be an uncompromising universal norm,” he said.He also said the changing landscape in West Asia has implications for India’s relations with the Arab world as well and taking forward the comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict was a widely shared priority.“Various countries have made policy declarations on the peace plan, individually or collectively. This is the larger context in which we deliberate on the region’s challenges and prospects,” said the minister.","PM Narendra Modi met the Palestinian foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian.

New Delhi: Days after India and European Union clinched what has been termed as ‘mother of all trade deals’, CJI Surya Kant on Saturday wooed French industrialists and businessmen to invest in India by hard-selling Supreme Court–backed trade-friendly legal system in the country. Referring to the uncertain business atmosphere in the world, apparently because of arbitrary import tariffs imposed by the US on various countries, CJI Kant said, “Today, we face a world transformed by uncertainty.”“The forces of disruption and geopolitical tension threaten to destabilise the very framework of international cooperation. In such a world, France-India partnership is not a luxury, it is a lifeline.”Addressing the Indo-French Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Paris Bar Association, the CJI said that for foreign enterprises engaging with their Indian counterparts, India’s legal ecosystem offers clarity. “All that one would have to do is draft well-defined arbitration clauses, select reputable institutions or neutral seats if appropriate and trust that India’s courts will respect the sanctity of arbitral agreements and awards,” he said.CJI Kant said SC provides a safety net against any biased arbitral awards that may adversely impact foreign companies operating in India. “SC has made it clear that while arbitral autonomy must be respected, the judiciary cannot relinquish its supervisory role when natural justice is at stake.” “In this context, SC has adopted a calibrated approach of minimal judicial intervention in its role as guardian of credibility, where, for instance, domestic awards may be set aside if bias, corruption or serious procedural deficiencies are proven,” he said.Indian laws encourage pre-litigation mediation. “This approach reflects global best practice: to resolve differences before they ripen into full-fledged litigation, preserving business relationships and reducing strain on judicial systems,” he said.",CJI Surya Kant wooed French industrialists and businessmen to invest in India by hard-selling Supreme Court–backed trade-friendly legal system.

New Delhi: Supreme Court has slammed the income tax department and a former revenue secretary, who now is the governor of RBI, for systematically harassing an Army officer turned Indian Revenue Services bureaucrat for over a decade and imposed a cost of Rs 5 lakh on the authorities.Pramod Bajaj was commissioned as an officer in the Army in 1980 but was released because of disability he suffered as Captain during an operation. He cracked the tough civil services examination and was appointed to Indian Revenue Services in 1990 and rose to became Commissioner of Income Tax in Jan 2012.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said, “Notwithstanding his promotion to post of Commissioner of Income Tax and imminent probability for further promotion, a trumped-up memorandum was issued to him, which was ultimately dropped.However, taking shelter behind this subterfuge, the petitioner was compulsorily retired.”“The order of compulsory retirement was ultimately set aside by this Court in an earlier round of litigation vide the judgment dated March, 3, 2023, recording strong observations on the high-handed and mala fide manner in which the departmental action had been undertaken.”Referring to the former revenue secretary, now RBI governor , as ‘the Officer’ without taking his name, the bench said, “Though considering the fact that ‘the Officer’ now holds a sensitive position, we refrain from making any observations on his role in the entire sequence of events leading to the present litigation.”The bench imposed a cost of Rs 5 lakh on authorities payable to Bajaj. It also directed fresh selection of members of ITAT from among candidates that would include Bajaj.Bajaj’s troubles with the I-T department began in 2014 when he applied for appointment to the post of Member (Accountant) of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The Search Cum Selection Committee (SCSC) headed by a sitting SC judge placed him at All India Rank One. But the department did not appoint him to the post, citing his litigation with his estranged wife.On the directions of the Central Administrative Tribunal, the department’s objections were placed before SCSC, which rejected them and maintained his All India Rank One. Appeal against the CAT order was dismissed by Allahabad HC and then SC. Undeterred and adamant, the department initiated a vigilance inquiry against Bajaj and put him in the list of officers with suspected integrity.This move too was set aside by the CAT. Appeal against this order was dismissed by the HC. Later the department initiated departmental proceedings and compulsorily retired him despite he being empanelled by ACC for the post of joint secretary.The apex court in a hard hitting judgment on March 3, 2023 quashed the proceedings against Bajaj and set aside order of compulsory retirement.Bajaj moved a contempt petition against the revenue secretary in 2024 and the court summoned him for deliberate defiance of SC orders. The revenue secretary tendered unconditional apology on Aug 4, 2024 and the court directed release of all consequential benefits to Bajaj.He was not appointed as an ITAT member but was called for a fresh interview before SCSC headed by a sitting SC judge.",Pramod Bajaj was commissioned as an officer in the Army in 1980 but was released because of disability he suffered as Captain during an operation.

Malik

is still explaining pain. To hospitals, courts, and a system that moves at its own pace. Malik, now 42, walked into the

Supreme Court

in Dec with a PIL to flag a blind spot in Indian law that leaves a small but acutely vulnerable group of acid attack survivors — those forced to ingest acid — without support. The hearing took an unexpected turn when the Chief Justice sought details of her trial, and called the delay a ‘national shame’. This week, the SC advocated tougher deterrents like attaching the accused’s assets to compensate victims. Malik spoke to

Mohua Das

about long waits for justice, patchy safeguards, and why survival demands more stamina than most people have.

Through your Brave Souls Foundation, you've seen how attackers face few consequences. Do you think these proposed measures can change that?

You went to court for

victims of forceful acid ingestion (VFAI)

, but the Chief Justice pulled up your own 16-year-old case and data from across states. Does it feel like justice is finally catching up or is it a reminder of what it takes to wake the system?

The law mandates free treatment to acid attack victims by both govt and private hospitals, and refusal is a punishable offence. Why does this still fail on the ground?

Is this free treatment meant to cover only emergency care, or does it extend to long-term and reconstructive treatment?

When did you realise that survivors forced to ingest acid were being completely excluded from the system, and why did it lead to this PIL?

Forceful acid ingestion is rarely discussed. How devastating is it for the body?

NCRB data shows cases rising again. Why do you think that is?

Acid sales are meant to be regulated. How easy is it to access acid even today?

What the Chief Justice said felt absolutely necessary. There should be punishment so people are afraid of committing such crimes. Right now, the accused roam freely. They get bail easily and face no real consequences. It has to be made difficult and painful. But saying it is one thing. Real achievement will be when this actually starts getting implemented. That is when conditions will truly start improving.The court could have limited itself to giving me relief only on the disability issue. Instead, it expanded the scope and raised larger questions around trials and deterrence. That gives me hope. Our judiciary should function like this consistently. We will keep filing PILs for survivors, but after CJI’s mandate, there should be clear directions on speedy trials, timelines, rehabilitation policies. That’s when change will actually happen.There’s absolutely no clarity. No private hospital gives free treatment to acid attack survivors, and frankly, they don’t want to.There’s no nodal officer, no coordination mechanism. The law simply says free treatment should be given, but when survivors go to hospitals, it’s outright refused. After that begins a long process. Once we approach the high court, the hospital suddenly says it is ready to give treatment “on humanitarian grounds”, but in reality, it is because of a court order. Even after that discrimination doesn’t stop. Survivors are made to wait for long hours, told beds aren’t available, even in big hospitals. Now imagine survivors without NGOs or lawyers. Who will actually get free treatment? Almost no one.In Parivartan vs Union of India in 2015, the court clearly said “full free medical treatment”. But that’s not how it works in reality. Govt hospitals are interested only in life-saving surgery. There are long queues, hygiene issues, and waiting periods of six months for a single surgery. If someone needs 40 surgeries, then 20 years of their life will pass. I myself have had 25. My left side still needs lifelong treatment but I’m tired. I don’t want any more surgeries.It was after the establishment of Brave Souls Foundation in 2021 that we were approached by VFAI survivors. When I began assisting these survivors with compensation and medical treatment, it became clear that the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act entirely leaves out survivors who are forced to ingest acid. Their pleas for enhanced compensation are dodged and their disability is not recognised. That is why it became necessary to approach the court. If criminal law recognises this violence, beneficial laws must also recognise the resulting disability.This form of violence is rare but extremely brutal, often used as a method of torture, coercion or abuse, especially within domestic violence. The ingestion of acid causes immediate severe burns to the mouth, throat, oesophagus and stomach. Survivors experience extreme pain, difficulty swallowing, vomiting blood and swelling of the airway. Internal scarring can narrow the oesophagus, and require repeated surgeries. Many survivors cannot eat or drink normally and need feeding tubes.Most attacks are committed by jilted lovers or as a form of domestic violence. Many arise from family disputes or personal enmity. More cases are now being reported because people are beginning to speak up. But many acid attacks still go unreported.In Laxmi Aggarwal vs Union of India, the SC said acid sale must be regulated. But implementation on ground is zero. We have filed many RTIs most of which returned with NIL or NO as replies. Acid is very easy to procure and extremely cheap. It’s sold as bathroom or floor cleaner and shopkeepers rarely ask why it is being bought. Rs 20 worth of acid can destroy an entire life. That is what makes it such a dangerous weapon. At the very least, acid should be banned at retail shops. Even today, vendors sell it openly in residential areas including my own street.After a Delhi court acquitted the accused in your case citing lack of evidence, and after years of working with survivors, where do you see the system failing most?Poor investigation was a major reason my case collapsed. When the foundation of a case is weak, justice collapses. Besides that, the biggest gaps are lack of sensitivity and strict punishment. These are not ordinary crimes, but are treated like normal cases. Because of visible scars, survivors face discrimination in jobs, housing and social life. Many go blind and remain confined to their homes for years. Only three states—Karnataka, Haryana and Punjab—provide pensions. Even DLSA compensation, meant to be given within three months, is delayed for years. Survivors get exhausted and give up, or settle for a measly amount. Not everyone has 16 years or the resources to keep fighting.","Shaheen Malik, 42, was left blind in one eye and with a lifetime of surgeries.

New Delhi: Noting that Centre itself had framed General Provident Fund (Central Service) Rules in 1960, which entitled a valid nominee of GPF account to receive the amount lying in it, Supreme Court has said that the nominee does not need to produce a succession certificate to withdraw the amount.A bench of Justices Manoj Misra and Manmohan rejected an appeal filed by Centre which said that in case the account has more than Rs 5,000, a nominee has to produce a succession certificate. The Centre’s plea was earlier rejected by Central Administrative Tribunal and Calcutta high court on the same ground that Rule 33(ii) allows a nominee to withdraw the amount.“This Court declines to entertain the present Special Leave Petition as Rule 33(ii) of the Rules, 1960 has been framed by the Central Govt and the same cannot be and has not been challenged by the petitioners...ThisCourt is of the view that if the submission of Govt of India is accepted, then the purpose of having a nomination would be lost. After all, the process of nomination has a sanctity attached to it,” the court said.It said that if a succession certificate is required in all eventualities, then it would render otiose all nominations made under the Provident Fund Act, 1925, read with the Rules, 1960.“This Court further finds that the basis of cases (where amount is more than Rs 5,000 in a/c) falling in Section 4(1)(b) and 4(1)(c)(i) is stated to be the amount standing to the credit of the depositor.While the basis of classification, namely, the amount of Rs 5,000 may have been substantial and reasonable in the year 1925, i.e., when the Act was passed, however, the same has ceased to be of any relevance a century later due to inflationary market forces. Recognising this ground level reality, the govt itself in the Rules framed thirty-five (35) years later stipulated that in cases of nomination, irrespective of the amount of money lying in the account, the same shall be released to the nominee,” it said.",The Supreme Court has said that the nominee does not need to produce a succession certificate to withdraw the amount.

New Delhi: Forty-nine districts across eight states - Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, UP and West Bengal - contribute a major share of construction workers engaged in highway projects across the country, according to a mapping of labour origins carried out by the National Highways Authority of India.In a first-of-its-kind exercise, NHAI has collated details up to the village level from where workers travel to highway construction sites, in a move to provide targeted skill training to these labourers. ""This will enhance their employability. Trained manpower in highway projects will help ensure timely completion and better quality of work. Training of people working at project sites is crucial,"" said an official.Officials said PM Modi recently directed the road transport ministry to undertake a focused skill development drive for labourers and supervisory staff by launching dedicated training courses.TOI has learned that a detailed framework is being prepared to train workers from these identified localities, and prominent ITIs, diploma colleges and engineering institutes have been shortlisted for the purpose. NHAI will sign MoUs with the institutes for training.It will also work closely with highway developers to implement the programme.People involved in the plan said while NHAI will provide a seed fund, highway builders are expected to contribute through their CSR funds. Trainees will receive a stipend during the training period to offset any loss of daily wages. ""Workers with 7-8 years of experience will be upskilled and developed as master trainers to train fresh manpower. The local NHAI project director will be in charge of implementation to ensure effective execution,"" an official said.He added that once trained, the workers will be able to get works anywhere and a better wage as well.Meanwhile, the highways authority is also preparing video training capsules on 50-60 topics that can be used to train workers.",National Highways Authority of India has collated details up to the village level from where workers travel to highway construction sites.

Can parents inherit dead son's frozen semen? Govt challenges Delhi HC order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-parents-inherit-dead-sons-frozen-semen-govt-challenges-delhi-hc-order/articleshow/127827961.cms,".

New Delhi: The Union health ministry has challenged in Delhi high court its ruling asking Sir Gangaram Hospital to release the frozen semen of an unmarried dead man to his parents.The ministry's appeal asked two main questions: Can judges create new heirs, other than a spouse, for children conceived after death, and can gametes/sperm be treated like inheritable property that can be passed on to legal heirs, other than a spouse, without a written consent.In Oct 2024, a single judge held that there is no prohibition on posthumous reproduction if the consent of a sperm or egg owner can be demonstrated and directed the hospital to release frozen gametes of a deceased man to his parents.The hospital did not yet release the preserved semen to the parents, whose son, aware of his terminal condition, left his semen in a cryopreserved state.Posthumous reproduction refers to the process of conceiving a child using assisted reproductive technology after the death of 1 or both biological parents.""Under the prevailing Indian law, there is no prohibition against posthumous reproduction if the consent of the sperm owner or egg owner can be demonstrated.If the deceased was married and had a spouse, the issues would not have been as complex,"" the judge noted. Contesting the ruling, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's Department of Health Research last week argued that the verdict ""rewrites statutory definitions to judicially create a new beneficiary class (""intending grandparents"") and treats cryopreserved semen as inheritable property devolving to legal heirs. ""A bench of Chief Justice DK Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia told the Centre's standing counsel, Radhika Bishwajit Dubey that the govt will first have to explain the long delay in filing the appeal before deciding if it should be heard.The ministry contended that the single judge relied on foreign jurisprudence where explicit written consent was present, ""an element entirely absent in the present case"", and underlined that the dead man was unmarried and ""left no written informed consent for utilisation of his preserved semen sample.""""A child conceived through posthumous reproduction at the instance of grandparents would have no legally recognised parentage under the Acts, which contradicts the foundational legislative objective of protecting child welfare and ensuring certainty of parentage prior to conception,"" the ministry submitted in the appeal, arraying, apart from the parents of the dead man, the private hospital and Delhi govt as parties in the matter.""The ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) Act and the SRA (Surrogacy Regulation Act), constitute a complete code and limit eligibility strictly to commissioning couples/woman and intending couples/intending woman respectively, and within prescribed age limits. Parents do not fall within the statutory definition,"" the plea insisted, urging the HC to set aside the 2024 verdict, adding that the judge ""improperly elevated emotional considerations and subjective capability into enforceable legal rights. ""The 2024 order said that, in the absence of a spouse, there is no prohibition on posthumous reproduction, and directed the hospital to release to the parents the frozen sperm of their deceased unmarried son for surrogacy to continue his legacy.","The Union health ministry has challenged in Delhi high court its ruling asking Sir Gangaram Hospital to release the frozen semen of an unmarried dead man to his parents.

2-year central stint must for IPS for IG empanelment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-year-central-stint-must-for-ips-for-ig-empanelment/articleshow/127827920.cms,".

New Delhi: The Union home ministry has made it mandatory for Indian Police Service (IPS) officers to serve a minimum two-year central stint as superintendent of police (SP) or deputy inspector general (DIG), to be eligible for posting as inspector general of police (IGP) in the Union govt.The rule will apply to IPS officers from 2011 batch onwards. The home ministry, in a letter sent to all state chief secretaries on Jan 28, directed that ""a minimum 2 years of central experience at SP/DIG or equivalent level shall be mandatory for empanelment of IPS officers at IG/equivalent level at the Centre from 2011 batch onwards"".The modified guidelines for empanelment of IPS officers for an IG-level or equivalent post at the Centre, are in line with existing guidelines for IAS officers. The latter make it compulsory for IAS officers to serve at the Centre for two years as deputy secretary, director or under-secretary, before they are empanelled for a joint secretary-level post in the Union govt.Apart from making available IPS officers allocated to different states cadres for filling up vacant posts in the central armed police forces (CAPFs) and central police organisations (CPOs) such as CBI, NIA and Intelligence Bureau, the new empanelment guidelines will ensure that IPS officers have a varied experience of having served both in their parent cadre and at the Centre early and mid-career, before they aspire for an IG-level deputation with the Union govt.As per the vacancy position in CAPFs and CPOs on Dec 23, 2025, 104 of the sanctioned 229 SP-level posts and 69 of the 256 sanctioned posts at the DIG level, are vacant.The last IPS batch allocated to various state cadres, to be empanelled for post of IG or equivalent, was 2007. The 2011 batch may be due for empanelment in the next three years or so, which gives them time to serve at the SP and DIG level at the Centre if they haven't served outside their parent cadre yet.Some states already experiencing shortage of SP and DIG-level officers may however find it difficult to spare more officers at this level, to fulfil the new eligibility criteria for empanelment as IG or equivalent at the Centre.","The rule will apply to IPS officers from 2011 batch onwards.

Bigger operations signify a bigger footprint, says SC

New Delhi: In a significant departure from one-size-fits-all penalty approach, the SC has said bigger companies bear higher responsibility towards protection of environment and it would be justifiable to impose higher penalties on mega firms for environment damage caused by them, reports Dhananjay MahapatraThis decision by Justices Dipankar Datta and Vijay Vishnoi was given while dismissing appeals against orders of NGT imposing Rs 5cr penalty on Rhythm Country and Rs 4.47cr on Key Stone Properties for constructing residential and commercial projects without green clearance in Pune.Justice Datta rejected the arguments of the two realtors that the penalty imposed was disproportionate.The court also rejected the arguments that NGT did not have the jurisdiction or power to arbitrarily impose such high environmental damage compensation charges.Justice Datta said through the NGT Act the legislature has deliberately given the tribunal discretion to grant relief based on the seriousness of environmental harm.The core of appellant’s arguments was that turnover or project cost cannot be taken as a metric for determination of environmental compensation. “We are unable to accede to such a submission. Neither NGT Act nor the jurisprudence of this court calls for the adoption of a uniform formula for the quantification of environmental compensation,” the bench said.The Supreme Court further said that: “In cases relating to protection of environment, linking a company’s scale of operations (like turnover, production volume, or revenue generation) to the environmental harm can be a powerful factor for determining compensation.”“Bigger operations signify a bigger footprint. Larger scale means more resource use, more emissions, more waste leading to more environmental stress. If a company profits more from its scale, it is logical that it bears more responsibility for the environmental costs. Linking scale to impact sends a message that bigger players need to play by greener rules,” it said.",Supreme Court said bigger companies bear higher responsibility towards protection of environment. Justices Dipankar Datta and Vijay Vishnoi dismissed appeals against orders of NGT imposing Rs 5cr penalty on Rhythm Country and Rs 4.47cr on Key Stone Properties for constructing residential and commercial projects without green clearance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127827726,imgsize-42646,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-07-15-152225.jpg"

Budget 2026 Signals Infra First Strategy With Public Capital Expenditure Raised To ₹12.2 Lakh Crore

Railway Budget 2026: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced seven new high-speed, bullet train corridors spanning the Indian Railways network across the country as part of her Union Budget speech. This is the first time that the Budget is being presented on a Sunday.""In order to promote environmentally sustainable passenger systems, we will develop seven high speed rail corridors between cities as growth collectors,"" FM Sitharaman announced. The seven routes are:At present India does not have any functional high-speed or bullet train corridor. The first bullet train project is currently under construction between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.The first phase of this bullet train corridor within Gujarat is expected to be operational by 2027.Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, Senior Director & Global Head, Consulting, Crisil Intelligence says, “The Finance Minister’s announcement of seven high-speed transport corridors is critical not just for capacity creation, but for enabling technology adoption through advanced signalling, traffic management and higher-spec rolling stock.These corridors will significantly reduce inter-city travel times and support seamless multimodal people movement by integrating rail, road, metro, bus and aviation networks. Given their long gestation, success will hinge on access to long-term financing and appropriately structured moratoriums.”Sitharaman said to promote environmentally-sustainable movement of cargo, she proposed to establish a new dedicated freight corridor connecting Dankuni in the east to Surat in the west.Talking about infrastructure, FM Sitharaman said, “During this past decade, our government has undertaken several initiatives for large scale enhancement of public infrastructure, including through new financing instruments such as infrastructure investment trust. We shall continue to focus on developing infrastructure in cities with over five lakh population that is tier two, tier three cities, which have expanded to become growth centers. ”Indian Railways has been given a total allocation of Rs 2.78 lakh crore. Union Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Sunday said the Union Budget presented in Parliament outlines a clear roadmap for Vikas Bharat, adding that the ₹2.78 lakh crore allocation for Railways reflects that vision.Speaking to ANI, Vaishnaw said the announcement of seven new high-speed rail corridors would sharply cut travel time and lead to a transformative change in the daily lives of people across regions.The minister, who also holds the portfolios of Information and Broadcasting and Electronics and Information Technology, said the Budget reflects a strong commitment to the country, with a special focus on youth and women.“Today's budget is dedicated to the youth of our country. It's dedicated to women's power in our country. And it is inspired by the sense of duty, duty towards our nation, making sure that 'sabka saath, sabka vikas,' the inclusive growth happens in our country. The budget also lays down the roadmap for Vikas Bharat. Today's railway budget of Rs 2,78,000 crore is clearly a step in that direction... Seven new high-speed corridors have been announced today. These high-speed corridors will significantly reduce travel time, bringing about a major change in people's lives,” he said.Highlighting the impact on southern India, Vaishnaw said the Chennai–Bengaluru–Hyderabad triangle would act as a powerful growth engine for Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka, calling it a significant boost for all five states.He further said the planned 4,000 kilometres of high-speed corridors are expected to attract investments worth ₹16 lakh crore.Vaishnaw added that cities such as Mumbai, Pune, and Hyderabad will also emerge as major economic corridors, while in northern India, the Delhi–Varanasi–Siliguri corridor will connect Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal. According to him, this will substantially alter travel patterns while driving tourism and economic activity across these regions.Indian Railways has been getting record capital expenditure allocation for some years now. In the last five years, railway budget allocations have grown exponentially, as the government focused on infrastructure as a driver of economic growth.Till 2017, the Railway Budget was presented separately. Suresh Prabhu was the last Railway Minister to present a separate railway budget in 2016. Since then railway allocations find space in the Finance Minister’s speech, but there is no separate speech or list of new trains announced. The Budget speech around railways tends to center around upcoming projects and long-term vision on passenger services, freight, and safety.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced seven new high-speed, bullet train corridors spanning the Indian Railways network across the country.

When is Union budget speech today: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2026 at 11am in the Lok Sabha today, marking a historic moment in India’s parliamentary and economic calendar. The presentation forms part of the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament and will outline the government’s fiscal roadmap for the financial year 2026–27.Sitharaman was seen leaving Kartavya Bhavan for Rashtrapati Bhavan carrying her trademark red ‘bahi-khata’ style tablet folder bearing the national emblem. She becomes the first to present a full Union Budget on a Sunday.The Lok Sabha’s List of Business confirms that the House will assemble at 11am, when the finance minister begins her address.The 11am Budget speech is now standard practice, but this was not always the case.Until 1999, the Union Budget was presented at 5 pm, a colonial-era practice aligned with British working hours. That changed when then finance minister Yashwant Sinha shifted the presentation to the morning, making it more suited to Indian administrative and market timings.Another key reform came in 2017, when Arun Jaitley advanced the Budget date to February 1 from the end of the month. The move gave ministries more time to roll out schemes and spending from the start of the financial year on April 1.Today’s speech continues both these traditions — a February 1 presentation at 11 am — while adding a new footnote: a Sunday Budget. In 1999, when February 28 fell on a Sunday, the Budget was presented a day earlier. Sitharaman, however, proceeds on the scheduled date.During her speech, the Finance Minister will lay out the estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of India for 2026–27. She will also table key documents required under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003.She will then seek leave to introduce the Finance Bill, 2026, which gives legal effect to the government’s taxation and financial proposals.Senior officials, including Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, Chief Economic Adviser Dr V Anantha Nageswaran, CBDT Chairman Ravi Agrawal and other Finance Ministry officials, were seen accompanying her.The Budget follows the tabling of the Economic Survey 2025–26, the government’s annual assessment of the economy. Prepared by the Economic Division under the Chief Economic Adviser, the survey reviews performance over the past year and frames the context for fiscal decisions.Union minister Piyush Goyal pointed to the Survey’s First Advance Estimates projecting real GDP growth of 7.4% for FY 2025–26. He said this keeps India as the fastest-growing major economy for the fourth consecutive year. He also cited inflation of 1.7% between April and December 2025, crediting lower food prices and what he described as effective inflation management.The Survey also highlighted a policy push in manufacturing, with the government framing its strategy as moving from “Swadeshi” to “Strategic Resilience” and now “Strategic Indispensability”.",Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2026 at 11am in the Lok Sabha today.

A Chance to Build a Future-Ready Indirect Tax System

India’s growth aspirations demand a tax environment that is simpler, more predictable and aligned with modern business realities. While GST and Customs digitalisation have undeniably transformed the landscape, companies continue to face operational bottlenecks that slow down activity, tie up working capital and drive up compliance costs. These factors directly affect the country’s ease of doing business.In this backdrop, the 56th GST Council meeting marked significant progress by tackling several long-standing pain points. Union Budget 2026 now has an opportunity to build on this momentum and deliver a tax ecosystem that is faster, more consistent and easier for businesses to navigate.A key long pending ask and expectation from the upcoming Budget is a more flexible and business-friendly input tax credit (ITC) system. Companies have long argued that credits representing taxes genuinely paid and used in business operations should be freely available or refunded.Two specific asks remain critical:Allowing smoother credit flow across GST registrations would also unlock meaningful liquidity for enterprises.The recent GST Council decision to treat intermediary services as exports (therefore removing the GST levy) is a welcome step and industry now awaits its formal implementation as a part of the budget process.Businesses are also expecting similar clarity for R&D and testing services, which currently attract 18% GST because place-of-performance rules prevent them from being classified as exports. A consistent and globally aligned export definition would boost India’s competitiveness in high-value service segments.Compliance complexity remains a major concern with an expectation that multiplicity of proceedings would be addressed. A single, centralised audit and faceless assessment system, similar to the efficient model used under the erstwhile service tax regime, would give pan India businesses one point of engagement, reduce repetitive scrutiny and minimise conflicting interpretations across States.Large taxpayers would particularly benefit from a centralized single point of contact approach by way of:A uniform, risk-based audit framework would further enhance consistency and limit unnecessary scrutiny. Equally important is a more calibrated enforcement approach; one that acts firmly against evasion but avoids punitive measures such as asset attachments or frequent detention of goods in cases involving interpretational differences or procedural lapses. A clearer differentiation between wilful violations and good-faith positions will go a long way in restoring business confidence.For India’s smallest enterprises, current GST registration thresholds (₹20 lakh for services and ₹40 lakh for goods) no longer reflect today’s cost structures. Near-decade-high inflation has pushed many micro-businesses into the GST net perhaps far earlier than intended. Raising the threshold to reflect current realities would preserve working capital and support MSME viability.On the Customs side, businesses continue to face prolonged timelines in dispute resolution, with legacy cases stretching for years and delaying investment decisions. A time-bound settlement mechanism, similar to earlier dispute-resolution schemes, would help clear the backlog and allow both industry and the department to focus on priority matters.Businesses are also seeking greater certainty through longer-validity advance rulings and simpler renewals, so long-term projects are not disrupted by tax disputes merely on account of lapse of time.Operational friction also remains a day-to-day challenge at the border. Even after goods are cleared, companies often face manual processes to pay differential duties or correct documents for host of reasons including price variation, corrections. Allowing digital payments and online amendments, and ensuring such payments qualify for GST credit, would reduce compliance effort and minimise cash-flow disruptions.Cross-border businesses are also looking for clearer, time-bound guidelines around Special Valuation Branch (SVB) proceedings. While scrutiny of related-party pricing is necessary, inconsistent practices often create uncertainty for global supply chains. Predictable timelines and uniform standards are essential if India is to position itself as a reliable global hub.Special Economic Zone (SEZ) units seeking to sell into the domestic market face a structural disadvantage, as duties are levied without fully recognising that these units often use domestic inputs. Aligning duty calculations to reflect only the imported content, and/ or extending select benefits available under free trade agreements, would improve capacity utilisation and offer SEZs a more level playing field vis-à-vis foreign suppliers.Budget 2026 offers an opportunity not just for incremental fixes but for meaningful reform that strengthens India’s indirect tax architecture. The foundation laid by GST and recent digitalisation efforts is robust. What businesses now need is a system that is simpler, more consistent and aligned with the needs of a rapidly expanding economy.If India gets this right, indirect tax reform can become a catalyst not only for smoother compliance, but for accelerating the country’s growth trajectory.","India’s growth aspirations demand a tax environment that is simpler, more predictable and aligned with modern business realities.

Union Budget 2026 Bets Big On Rare Earths, Chips & Orange Economy: Nirmala Sitharaman's Full Speech

Silver Prices in Free Fall

Gold Remains Volatile

Gold, silver prices continue to decline! Gold and silver prices have been crashing in the last two trading sessions, plunging drastically from record highs, raising questions about whether the bull run is over and if the volatility is here to stay.Silver prices have dropped by 26,273 per kg, or 9%, dragging the metal down to around Rs 2.65 lakh per kg, while gold slipped about 3% to Rs 1.47 lakh per 10 grams. Sharp drops were seen in gold and silver prices in trading during Sunday’s special session as investors continued to book profits after the recent surge to record levels.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), silver futures for March delivery crashed by Rs 26,273, hitting the lower circuit limit and settling at Rs 2,65,652 per kg.In the previous trading session, the metal had already suffered a steep fall of Rs 1,07,968, or 27%, closing at Rs 2,91,925 per kg, where it had also touched the lower circuit.Over the last two sessions, silver has declined by a cumulative Rs 1,34,241, translating into a fall of 33.6%. On a weekly basis, the metal has dropped by nearly 21%, or Rs 69,047, from its level of Rs 3,34,699 per kg recorded on January 23.Gold futures also remained highly volatile during Sunday’s trade.The April contract initially slid as much as 9% to Rs 1,38,634 per 10 grams, hitting the lower circuit on the MCX in early deals. Prices later recovered part of the losses to settle at Rs 1,48,104 per 10 grams, still down Rs 4,241, or 3%, for the day.In the previous session on Friday, gold had plunged Rs 31,617, or 17.2%, to Rs 1,52,345 per 10 grams, after touching a record high of Rs 1,93,096 per 10 grams on Thursday.Commenting on the sharp correction, Pranav Mer, Vice President, EBG – Commodity & Currency Research at JM Financial Services Ltd, said, “Overspeeding leads to a crash and that's what we saw in Bullion prices.”“Gold has declined about 20%, while silver has fallen nearly 37% from their respective record highs in the domestic market, with selling pressure continuing on Sunday,” he added.Global futures markets were shut on Sunday due to a holiday, but the previous session saw sharper losses in international bullion markets compared with domestic ones. On Friday, Comex gold futures for April delivery slid by $612, or 11.39%, to settle at $4,763.10 per ounce, after touching a new lifetime high of $5,626.8 per ounce on Thursday.Silver futures on the Comex, for March delivery, also witnessed a steep fall, plunging $35.89, or 31.37%, to close at $78.53 per ounce on Friday, after having scaled a record high of $121.78 per ounce a day earlier.Market analysts attributed the sharp correction in bullion prices to a firmer US dollar, following comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that suggested interest rate cuts were unlikely in the near term.Adding to the developments, US President Donald Trump named former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as his nominee for the next Fed Chair. Warsh has traditionally been viewed as a monetary policy hawk, favouring higher real interest rates and a restrained balance sheet. However, analysts noted that he has recently shown greater alignment with Trump’s preference for lower borrowing costs, which may have influenced his nomination.“Profit booking and long liquidation were also evident ahead of the near-month futures expiry in both international and domestic markets,” Mer said, adding that global commodity exchanges have raised margin requirements for gold and silver, a move that could increase price volatility.Looking ahead, he said, “We may see more corrective moves in the next couple of trading sessions, after which prices may see some recovery and consolidate.”","Silver prices have dropped by 26,273 per kg, or 9%, dragging the metal down to around Rs 2.65 lakh per kg.
