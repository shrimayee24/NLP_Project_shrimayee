NEW DELHI: Indian students on Thursday protested outside the Oxford Union in the United Kingdom over a debate titled 'this house believes in the independent state of Kashmir.'The debate, hosted by the Oxford Union, Oxford University's debating society, contested the political status of Kashmir, a region historically disputed by India and Pakistan.The protest was held against the Oxford Union's selection of panelists. The panel for the motion included Dr. Muzzamil Ayyub Thakur, a Kashmiri leading the Justice Foundation and the Kashmir Freedom Movement, who opposed Indian control of Kashmir, Professor Zafar Khan, chairman of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) Diplomatic Bureau.Speakers against the motion were Prem Shankar Jha, former media advisor to former Prime Minister V P Jha with experience at the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Hindustan Times, Yusuf Kundgol and Siddhant Nagrath.The Oxford Union, in an Instagram post, wrote, ""The Kashmir question, a parting gift of British colonial rule, has troubled the subcontinent since 1947 resulting in multiple wars. The continued push for Kashmiri independence has sustained a long-standing struggle, rooted in the region’s quest for self-determination and autonomy. This has led to persistent unrest, human rights concerns, and renewed demand for autonomy among the Kashmiris. While nuclear-armed neighbours vie for control and geopolitical influence, the desire for peace among the population remains strong. Could an independent Kashmir be the answer to this enduring crisis?""INSIGHT UK, a British Hindu group, formally objected to the debate. In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), they wrote, “We have sent a formal letter to Oxford Union expressing deep concerns over their decision to host the debate. The invitation of speakers with alleged links to terrorism is particularly alarming and raises serious questions about the integrity of this debate.”","Indian students protest outside Oxford Union over debate titled 'this house believes in the independent state of Kashmir' The debate contested the political status of Kashmir, a region historically disputed by India and Pakistan.

Cash-starved civic bodies struggle to take up public works; generate only 32% revenue from own sources: CAG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cash-starved-civic-bodies-struggle-to-take-up-public-works-generate-only-32-revenue-from-own-sources-cag/articleshow/115319029.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Multiple audits by the Comptroller and Auditor General have revealed that urban local bodies (ULBs) across states are struggling with weak financial management, generating only 32% of their revenue from internal sources. This heavy reliance on Union and state govt funding has left ULBs in a state of persistent financial crisis. On average, only 29% of current expenditures by ULBs is allocated to development works and implementation of civic programmes.These findings have been highlighted in the Compendium of Performance Audits on the implementation of the 74th Constitutional Amendment by the CAG in 393 ULBs across 18 states, including Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu between 2014 and 2021. The landmark amendment of 1992 gave constitutional status to these self-govt entities and had laid down the provisions for devolution of 18 functions — including urban planning, regulation of land use and construction, water supply, planning for economic and social development and public health — to the urban local bodies.The auditor has highlighted that the states had shown weak compliance with the “in-spirit reading” of the amendment and only four of the functions devolved to urban local bodies were with “complete autonomy” even 30 years after the law came into force.As per the compendium, which was released this week, the federal auditor observed unrealistic budgeting across the ULBs in 13 states, with maximum budget variance of 403% in receipts and a high 274% budget variance in expenditure in Himachal Pradesh. The other states that have high variance include Odisha, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana.The CAG has also found that in 11 states, civic bodies were facing a 42% gap between their own revenue and expenditure. It said the ULBs are largely dependent on grants as they are unable to generate adequate funds. On average, grants constituted about 56% of the total revenue of the 17 states analysed by the CAG. It found that the share of grants to the total municipal revenue of states such as Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Tripura has been more than 85%. “A higher share of municipal own revenue can make a significant impact on the financial sustainability of ULSGs (read ULBs),” it said.As per the report though property tax on land and buildings is the mainstay of ULBs own revenue, the audit observed that while municipal laws have authorised these entities to collect taxes like property tax, powers pertaining to the fixation of rates and revision, the procedure of collection, method of assessment, exemptions and concessions are vested with state govts. They also have limited autonomy over profession tax, water charge, solid waste management cess/ charge and entertainment tax.“The lack of complete autonomy for ULSGs with respect to taxes and user charges limits their ability to adequately raise revenues commensurate with the cost of operations and maintenance,” it said.The report mentioned that limited financial autonomy and weak financial management of UBLs appear to result in low fund utilisation and on average, ULBs in 11 states have utilised only 61% of the funds made available to them, potentially impacting municipal service delivery.“The CAG’s compendium is a very timely reminder to us of the urgency to strengthen urban local governments. Hopefully these audit reports which have been placed in state legislative assemblies will finally make the agenda of decentralisation politically salient, in a positive way. Our cities cannot be effectively governed by state governments and parastatals alone. ULSGs are our first mile govt. Globally too, no city in the world offers ease of living and ease of doing business without autonomy and empowerment,” said Srikanth Viswanathan, CEO of Janaagraha, an NGO working on urban governance.","Only 29% of current expenditures by ULBs is allocated to development works.

"‘When seen from space, there’s a sense that Earth is everything we have’: Booker winner",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-seen-from-space-theres-a-sense-that-earth-is-everything-we-have-booker-winner/articleshow/115318703.cms,"Samantha Harvey

Our lives here are inexpressibly trivial and momentous at once, it seems he’s about to wake up and say. Both repetitive and unprecedented. We matter greatly and not at all.”Thus goes one of the lines in Samantha Harvey ’s Booker Prize winning novel ‘Orbital’, a fictional story about six astronauts in the International Space Station (ISS) that is peppered with hope and wonder for our home planet, along with solemn takes on conflicts and human-led struggles for power. In a conversation with Jaya Bhattacharji Rose for the TOI Bookmark podcast, the British author spoke about the process of stringing together the prose, which almost appears to be an ode to life on earth.“When you look at the Earth from low Earth orbit, you can’t see the entirety of the Earth. You can just see a flank of it. You can see the atmosphere and the stars… There seems to be a kind of tenderness somehow about the view of it from low Earth orbit. There’s a sense that this is our home, this is everything we have, that it’s real, and it’s something to be protected,” Harvey said.The writer, who has previously been shortlisted for the James State Black Award, the Women’s Prize, the Guardian First Book Award, and the Walter Scott Prize, also highlighted the research that went into adding the visual details about Earth as seen by the astronauts. From following immersive ISS’ live transits of the Earth to pouring over images captured by lunar astronauts — all were key to building a fictional world that almost seems like a painting. Bringing together different aspects of science and engineering, including astronomy and physics, didn’t come easy, Harvey admitted, adding that she began to feel confident once the process of “alchemising” them all into prose began.Was it disorienting to juggle these images, and then come back to the physical reality of her surroundings? In response to the question, Harvey highlighted the symbiotic link between the two. “You look at these images for hours and then you look out of your window at the garden and it’s a strange jolt of reality… it seems that the continents themselves are gardens,” she said. Interestingly, Harvey has no social media accounts, and has admitted in the past that she doesn’t own a mobile phone either.Harvey, a student of philosophy, has often drawn from her the field to dwell upon questions about human existence — both big and small — in her fiction. Her debut novel, ‘The Wilderness’, is written from the point of view of a man struggling to hold on to his personal memories as Alzheimer’s takes over, while her second novel, ‘All Is Song’, deals with themes of moral and filial duty, and about the choice between questioning and conforming. ‘Orbital’, on the other hand, deals with themes of how miniscule human-made conflicts can appear in the larger scheme of things, albeit from a perspective that’s centred miles away. One of the discoveries that fascinated her the most, the author said, was the existence of a well-lit border between India and Pakistan, one of the few that can be sighted from space at night.“During day time, you can’t see any borders at all, except natural borders of land and sea. But by night, the border between these two countries can be seen. Even then, the filigree of those lights is delicate and seems so harmless… That is the friendliness of the planet. It’s quite difficult to reconcile the knowledge of the conflict with the fact of what you’re seeing.”","Samantha Harvey has won the Booker Prize for her novel ‘Orbital’ It is a fictional story about six astronauts in the International Space Station.

More than a year after the National Dental Commission Act was passed in Aug 2023 and nearly eight months after the rules for implementing it were notified in March 2024, the commission itself is yet to be constituted. The Dental Council of India (DCI) has written to the health ministry seeking its intervention as the tenures of the council’s president and vice president are coming to an end.The letter to the health secretary dated Nov 13 pointed out that the DCI was still working as per the Dentists Act, 1948 to regulate dental education in the country. The council regulates 323 dental colleges with over 27,600 BDS seats and over 280 colleges with 7,000 post graduate seats.The current president of the DCI, Dr Dibyendu Mazumder, will complete his five-year membership term on Nov 28 and that of the current vice-president, Dr Satheesh Kumar Reddy is set to expire on Dec 10. As per the existing law, the two will continue on an extended term of six months from the date of completion of their membership term.The letter pointed out that “as per the directives of the ministry vide its letter dated Dec 26, 2023, the Council has been restrained from entertaining any new membership and accordingly a circular was issued to all constituencies to not nominate/elect new members under section 3 of the Dentists Act, 1948”.“The executive committee of the DCI under chairmanship of president is the main technical body which looks after the primary work of the council to evaluate proposals and applications of dental colleges and make appropriate recommendations to the central govt. The DCI Regulations, 1956 provides various key administrative powers to the president of the council for smooth functioning of the council,” stated the letter.The letter stated that the DCI office would soon become headless on completion of tenure of the president and that it would not be possible to run the office smoothly. It urged the central govt to entrust the charge of president to any DCI member until the commission is formed or give the necessary directions to ensure uninterrupted functioning of the DCI during the transition period.","The Dental Council of India (DCI) has written to the health ministry seeking its intervention.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday will set off the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Birsa Munda from a public outreach programme in Bihar’s Jamui, days ahead of the Nov 20 second phase of assembly polls in the tribal hero’s home state, Jharkhand.Munda’s birth anniversary on Nov 15 is marked as Janjatiya Gaurav Divas since 2021 to recognise contributions of all tribal heroes and tribal communities, especially in India’s freedom struggle.During the programme in Jamui, which comes amid model code of conduct being in effect in Jharkhand, preventing announcements and launches, the PM will also be inaugurating and laying foundation stone of development projects worth Rs 6,640 crore focused on infrastructure, healthcare, education, and livelihood generation in tribal regions.Last year, PM Modi had visited Munda’s birthplace — Ulihatu village in Jharkhand’s Khunti — & launched Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyay Maha Abhiyan for particularly vulnerable tribal communities and set off Viksit Bharat Abhiyan.Meanwhile, in her message for Janjatiya Gaurav Divas, Prez Droupadi Murmu said she has observed that a new consciousness is being spread across country for tribal pride and the ideals of the Constitution. “This consciousness is being transformed into action. This spirit will become the foundation of the bright future of the country, including the tribal society,” she said.Opportunities for economic development are increasing for tribal communities and the present govt is taking forward the journey of tribal development and welfare at a fast pace, she added. “Our country will become truly developed only when our tribal people also become developed. Fast-paced progress of people of tribal communities is our national priority,” she said.","Munda’s birth anniversary on Nov 15 is marked as Janjatiya Gaurav Divas since 2021 to recognise contributions of all tribal heroes and tribal communities.

BAKU: Giving much needed talking points around nature and quality of new post-2025 climate finance at UN climate conference, an independent high-level expert group on the issue on Thursday suggested that negotiations should be focused on mobilising $1 trillion per year by 2030 in “external (public and private) finance from all sources” for investments in emerging market and developing countries (EMDCs), other than China, and about $1.3 trillion by 2035 to deliver the Paris Agreement goals . It also argued that private finance can meet about half of these needs given the changing nature of investment opportunities.Simply put, the investment needed from external sources for climate action would just be 1% of annual global GDP ($100 trillion) and only half of global defence spending ($2.4 trillion). Observers, who are following the negotiations, believe that the post-2025 climate finance goal will probably be around that figure as it likely matches the annual figure of $1.3 trillion calculated by developing countries. The share of public and private finance in the overall bouquet will, however, be a big sticking point.The 33-member independent group, tasked by the presidencies to help develop and put forward policy options and recommendations to encourage and enable the public and private investment and finance necessary for delivery of the commitments and targets of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, also pitched for mobilising the finance at the earliest to save costs.One of the lead authors of the expert group report and its co-chair, Amar Bhattacharya, however, emphasised that bulk of investment for climate action would, in any case, be domestic finance. “Different kinds of investment need different kinds of finance... Largest in terms of amount is for energy transition. It is also clear that a lot of that investment would come from the private sector,” said Bhattacharya.The report, released on sidelines of COP29 Thursday, estimates that global projected investment (both external and domestic) requirement for climate action is around $6.3–6.7 trillion per year by 2030, of which $2.7–2.8 trillion is in advanced economies, $1.3-$1.4 trillion in China, and $2.3-2.5 trillion in EMDCs other than China.""For 2035, we estimate global investment requirements for climate action to be around $7–8.1 trillion per year, with advanced economies needing $2.6–3.1 trillion, China $1.3–1.5 trillion, and EMDCs other than China requiring $3.1–3.5 trillion. These needs are our estimations of what is required for delivery on the Paris Agreement, and the investments will also make a vital contribution to sustainable growth and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,"" said the authors in the report.They said, ""External finance from all sources, international public and private, along with others, will need to cover $1 trillion per year of the total investment needed by 2030 and around $1.3 trillion by 2035. We argue that cross-border private finance can meet about half of these needs given the changing nature of investment opportunities.”","An independent high-level expert group on the issue on Thursday suggested that negotiations should be focused on mobilising $1 trillion per year by 2030.

NEW DELHI: Delhi residents awoke to dense smog on Thursday morning, causing a sharp drop in visibility and pushing air quality into the 'severe' category.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the city’s average Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 432. Anand Vihar recorded an AQI of 473, IGI Airport (T3) 435, and ITO 421, AIIMS at 438, based on CPCB data at 7am.A school student Raunak said that he had been coughing continuously due to the excessive pollution around.""I go for running daily. However these days with the increase in pollution, I have been coughing continuously which could also affect my lungs. If there is a controlled use of pollution and more of CNG based vehicles, the problem could be solved. However there is no cooperation by the people,"" Raunak said.Prateek, another local said that the visibility had reduced, and people had started feeling suffocated.""The pollution level has increased a lot. The visibility on the roads have reduced, there is barely any visibility, our eyes burn and we have started feeling suffocated. The government needs to do something on this,"" Prateek said.Delhi's AQI has consistently stayed in the ""very poor"" range since October 30. Wednesday marked the first instance this season where it reached the ""severe"" category.The smog, which had been lingering over parts of Punjab and eastern Pakistan for several days, extended to large areas of northern India by early Wednesday.It quickly combined with local pollutants, creating a dense, toxic haze across the NCR. Delhi’s average AQI rose to 418, the worst in the country. The last time Delhi recorded a higher AQI was on January 14, at 447.Despite the high AQI, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) described it as an ""episodic event"" and opted not to implement restrictive measures under Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).The CAQM stated that AQI levels were likely to improve to the ""very poor"" range by Friday due to anticipated strong winds.The CPCB classifies AQI as follows: 0-50 as ""good,"" 51-100 ""satisfactory,"" 101-200 ""moderate,"" 201-300 ""poor,"" 301-400 ""very poor,"" 401-450 ""severe,"" and above 450 as ""severe plus.""","Delhi residents awoke to dense smog on Thursday morning, causing a sharp drop in visibility and pushing air quality into the'severe' category.

5.6 lakh Indians migrated to rich OECD countries in 2022,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-6-lakh-indians-migrated-to-rich-oecd-countries-in-2022/articleshow/115315069.cms,"Representative photo

Citizenship Trends:

MUMBAI: Each year, Indians continue their journey overseas, with many drawn to rich nations like the US, UK, and Canada — countries within the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that have historically opened doors to them. Whether as new immigrants, international students, or those acquiring citizenship, Indians dominate the charts in immigration flows to OECD nations. However, recent protectionist policies hint that the open path may be narrowing.2022 proved to be a landmark year — a record 5.6 lakh Indians moved to OECD countries — a substantial 35% jump over the previous year. India maintained its lead as the top source of new migrants, with China following at 3.2 lakh. Indians made up 6.4% of all new immigrants to OECD countries, while China contributed 3.8%.A notable shift was Russia’s rise in the migration ranks. With 2.6 lakh Russians migrating to OECD nations in 2022, Russia surged from 18th place to displace Romania.The International Migration Outlook 2024, released on Thursday in Paris, detailed these shifts. In 2022, the UK welcomed 1.12 lakh Indians, nearly double the figure from 2021, while 1.25 lakh Indians migrated to the US, marking a 35% increase. Canada, however, saw a dip with 1.18 lakh Indians, an 8% decline from the previous year. In these countries, Indians predominantly migrated through labour pathways, often as principal applicants or as accompanied family members.China, too, resumed significant migration following two years of Covid-related restrictions. In 2022, over three lakh Chinese immigrants to OECD member countries, up 13% from the previous year. Particularly in the US, migration flows from China jumped by 37%, returning to pre-pandemic levels with 68,000 new arrivals.Russia and Romania, which contributed 2.7 lakh new immigrants each, were the next top origin countries. Meanwhile, Türkiye, Israel, and Germany emerged as the primary OECD destinations for Russian migrants. Romanians, on the other hand, largely headed to Germany, Spain, and Italy.Yet, the welcome for new immigrants is visibly less enthusiastic. Under the incoming Trump administration, immigration to the US may face tighter scrutiny, including on work visas. Canada, too, recently announced a planned cut in immigration targets for the next three years, and the UK has introduced protectionist policies, such as raising wage thresholds and reducing the list of shortage occupations.In 2022, over 1.9 lakh Indians took the nationality of an OECD country, marking a 40% increase and securing India’s place as the top origin country for new OECD citizens. This record was largely driven by a threefold increase in Indians acquiring Canadian citizenship, totalling 60,000. The report anticipates a further rise in 2023.Syria ranked second in 2022, with 1.34 lakh nationals gaining OECD citizenship—a 28% increase from 2021—followed by Morocco, with 1.21 lakh Moroccan nationals becoming citizens in Spain, Italy, and France. Mexicans largely acquired American citizenship, in 2022 their numbers dipped slightly.","2022 proved to be a landmark year — a record 5.6 lakh Indians moved to OECD countries.

NEW DELHI: Delhi HC set aside the Centre’s order cancelling the Overseas Citizen of India card of a professor residing in the US on the allegation of being involved in “anti-India activities”, saying the notice lacked specific details or evidence supporting these claims.HC said it deprived the petitioner of a fair chance to present an effective defence, while allowing the plea of 80-year-old Khalid Jahangir Qazi .

NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has announced the implementation of GRAP 3 (Graded Response Action Plan) in Delhi NCR starting tomorrow from 8am as air quality deteriorates to the 'severe' category.The central body said that unfavorable meteorological conditions, including dense fog condition and North-Westerly winds moving the pollutants to Delhi are the major causes for sudden spike in AQI.The GRAP comprises specific measures to tackle deteriorating air quality in Delhi and NCR regions. GRAP is announced when Air Quality Index (AQI) reaches 'severe' category, implementing various limitations on activities that contribute to pollution in addition to the restrictions implemented under GRAP 1 and 2.1. A complete halt on construction and demolition activities, along with suspension of non-essential mining operations.2. Restrictions on interstate buses that are not electric, CNG-powered or BS-VI diesel compliant.3. Educational institutions at primary level will shift to virtual learning platforms.4.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has dismissed a plea by a man challenging his arrest and prosecution in a case related to the March 2023 protests by Khalistani groups at the Indian high commission in London. The protesters had shouted anti-India and pro-Khalistani slogans, and pulled down the Indian flag, with some trying to tear it.Inder Pal Singh Gaba of Hounslow in UK was arrested by National Investigation Agency (NIA) on April 25 this year while entering India through the Attari border in Punjab. Booked under the stringent UAPA and other laws, Gaba had contended in his plea he was not given a copy of the FIR, making his arrest unlawful.HC found no infirmity in the trial court’s remand orders allowing NIA Gaba’s custody. “The contention of the counsel for the petitioner (Gaba) that non-furnishing of the FIR would be fatal cannot be accepted because, as rightly pointed out by the additional solicitor-general (ASG), CrPC and UAPA do not mandate a copy of the FIR to be supplied by the investigating officer to any other person other than the complainant,” said Justice Subramonium Prasad.The HC said Gaba was arrested and produced before a magistrate the same day. A copy of the remand application was supplied to him, containing both the reasons and grounds of arrest.“The safeguard enshrined under Article 22(1) of the Constitution has been followed and the impugned remand orders do not contain any infirmity,” the HC said.The Indian flag was targeted in the protests on March 19. NIA said audio-video evidence showed Gaba’s presence and active involvement in the protests on March 22. He was seen raising anti-India slogans , associating with key protest organisers, and engaging in activities that undermined the sovereignty of India. A lookout circular was issued against Gaba on Dec 9 last year. Attari immigration officials had detained him and seized his passport, subsequently handing him over to NIA.","Inder Pal Singh Gaba of Hounslow in UK was arrested by National Investigation Agency (NIA) on April 25 this year while entering India through the Attari border in Punjab.

BENGALURU: Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy emphasised Thursday need for India to reclaim its historical prominence in scientific innovation , saying invaders and colonisers scuttled Indian science for almost a thousand years from 1000 to 1947 and youths were “held back in pursuits” of critical & analytical thinking, invention and innovation.Murthy made the observation during a virtual address at the announcement ceremony for 2024 Infosys Science Prizes . “In Israel, we learned to appreciate our greatest national advantage: Our minds. Through creativity and innovation, we transformed barren deserts into flourishing fields and pioneered new frontiers in science and technology,” Murthy quoted the late Shimon Peres from Israel, adding “such is the power of groundbreaking ideas for every nation”.“History tells us India was a leading nation leveraging the power of ideas in mathematics, astronomy, engineering, medicine, and surgery from Vedic times until multiple invasions of our country by tribal leaders from Afghanistan and Uzbekistan during 700 AD to 1520 AD, followed later by arrival of British colonists.”Murthy said rulers from Afghanistan and Uzbekistan did not have much appreciation for science, medicine, & math, while British sporadically encouraged Indians to pursue ambitious and imaginative work. “But our progress was slow. Thus, youth were held back in their pursuits of these areas, including observation of nature, curiosity, inferencing, critical and analytical thinking, invention and innovation, and problem definition & problem-solving.”He said the drive to revive power of STEM to solve the nation’s problems began after Independence, though the task remains a significant challenge.",Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy emphasised the need for India to reclaim its historical prominence in scientific innovation.

NEW DELHI: Within weeks of the Madras high court validating the Enforcement Directorate ’s money laundering probe against India’s biggest political donor Santiago Martin , better known as ‘lottery king’, the agency on Thursday carried out searches at 20 premises of the accused and his associates across Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Haryana and Punjab.Martin and his company had donated Rs 1,368 crore of electoral bonds to different political parties.The searches were carried out at the premises of Martin and his close family members in Chennai and Coimbatore and at other associates in Faridabad, Ludhiana and Kolkata as the agency probes the ‘proceeds of crime’ generated from illegal distribution and sale of lotteries.The money laundering probe had come to a halt after the Tamil Nadu police withdrew its FIR, which was the basis for the ED to register its investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The Supreme Court, too, had later ruled that though the ED is free to challenge the withdrawal of the FIR, but in absence of a predicate offence, the PMLA probe cannot be continued against the accused.The agency then moved the Madras HC, which in an Oct 28 judgement ruled that the withdrawal of the corruption case , “predicate offence” in ED’s parlance, was illegal and validated ED’s case under the PMLA while also asking the state authorities to revive the corruption case.Martin and his Future Gaming and Hotel Services (P) Ltd are accused of committing fraud in distribution of lotteries in Sikkim. After a search operation in Chennai and Coimbatore in May last year, the anti-money laundering agency had claimed that Santiago Martin and his family allegedly made “unlawful gain” of more than Rs 900 crore, which was a loss to the Sikkim government.Soon after the last year’s searches, the ED had seized assets and bank deposits of the accused worth Rs 457 crore in connection with the lottery scam during the 2009-10 period. The agency had then said that Martin’s Coimbatore-based Future Gaming, the master distributor of Sikkim Lotteries in Kerala, made illegal gains by allegedly inflating the prize-winning tickets. The seized assets included Rs 158 crore in fixed deposits and mutual funds, and Rs 299 crore worth of properties.","Martin and his company had donated Rs 1,368 crore of electoral bonds to different political parties.

Canada declined India’s July 2023 request to arrest Dalla, says MEA

NEW DELHI: With Canada reported to have arrested the de-facto chief of Khalistan Tiger Force , Arsh Singh Gill alias Arsh Dalla , the Indian govt said Thursday it will pursue his extradition and expressed hope he will be deported to face justice in India.Dalla, apparently an aide of slain Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar , is among the 27 individuals whose extradition had been sought by India. Ottawa has blamed Indian govt agents for the killing of Nijjar.Canada’s CTV News reported on Wednesday that India-designated terrorist Dalla along with an associate had been arrested and charged in connection with a recent shooting in Ontario. He’s said to be awaiting a bail hearing. “In view of the recent arrest, our agencies will be following up on an extradition request,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Given Arsh Dalla’s criminal record in India and his involvement in similar illegal activities in Canada, it is expected that he will be extradited or deported to face justice in India,” said ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, acknowledging media reports circulating since Nov 10 about the Dalla’s arrest in Canada.Canadian print and television media have widely reported the arrest and the Ontario court has also listed the case for hearing. The Canadian govt had earlier refused to act on India’s request for his arrest.India has repeatedly stated that its main issue with Canada is the impunity enjoyed by Khalistan separatists targeting Indian interests. The official said that Dalla is a proclaimed offender in over 50 cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion and terrorist acts, including terror financing .“In May 2022, a red corner notice was issued against him. Dalla was designated in India as an individual terrorist in 2023. In July 2023, Govt of India had requested the Canadian govt for his provisional arrest. This was declined. Additional information was provided in this case,” he said.According to MEA, a separate request was also sent to Canada under Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) to verify Dalla’s suspected residential address, his financial transactions to India, moveable/immovable properties, details of mobile numbers, etc — all of which were provided to Canadian authorities in Jan 2023.“In Dec 2023, the Department of Justice of Canada sought additional information on the case. A reply to these queries was sent in March this year,” said Jaiswal. India had sought Dalla’s extradition in Jan 23.","Canada declined India’s July 2023 request to arrest Dalla, says MEA.

Centre reimposes AFSPA in 6 ‘volatile’ Manipur areas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-reimposes-afspa-in-6-volatile-manipur-areas/articleshow/115317450.cms,"Centre reimposes AFSPA

First expansion of area under Afspa during Modi’s tenure

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Thursday restored the ‘disturbed area’ status of six police stations across Manipur’s five districts — Imphal West, Imphal East, Jiribam, Kangpokpi and Bishnupur — under the controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, amid the recent spurt in ethnic strife in these areas.The grounds cited were continuing “volatile situation” and “ongoing ethnic violence” in the state and “intermittent firing... with several instances of active participation of insurgent groups in heinous acts of violence”.The move to withdraw Afspa from Sekmai and Lamsang in Imphal West district; Lamlai in Imphal East district; Jiribam in Jiribam district; Leimakhong in Kangpokpi district; and Moirang in Bishnupur district is unusual in many ways.Firstly, this is the first time since Modi govt assumed office in 2014 that the area under Afspa within a state is being expanded; in fact, the area in the North-East under Afspa has remarkably shrunk over the past decade. Secondly, rather than Manipur govt which has been regularly issuing Afspa extension orders for the state, Centre chose this time to revisit the state govt’s notification.A home ministry official explained that Afspa grants concurrent powers to Centre and state govt to do so; and it helps that BJP is in office at both levels. Interestingly, all the areas where Afspa has been brought back are in the Valley, which is dominated by Meiteis. The move to reimpose Afspa in jurisdiction of six PS is also unusual as it comes midway through validity of the last notification, which was effective from Oct 1, 2024 to March 30, 2025. An officer said that a detailed assessment regarding Afspa applicability in Manipur, despite recurrent ethnic violence since May last year that has claimed around 230 lives so far, was not made earlier due to preoccupation of security agencies with restoring peace.“But with the ethnic violence failing to resolve, there was no option but to bring back Afspa in violence-prone areas to facilitate coordinated operations by the security forces, including the Army, and rein in armed miscreants active in ‘fringe’ areas,” an officer told TOI.",The Centre on Thursday restored the ‘disturbed area’ status of six police stations across Manipur’s five districts.

Midnight bullock cart races drive chaos across highways in western UP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/midnight-bullock-cart-races-drive-chaos-across-highways-in-western-up/articleshow/115317237.cms,"HIGH STAKES: Organisers set cash prizes up to Rs 2.5 lakh fuelling rivalries

MEERUT : As the midnight hour casts shadows across the state highway to Garh Mukteshwar, an ancient tradition pushes modern boundaries, escalating from celebration to confrontation. Bullock cart races , held to celebrate Kartik Purnima , see rival villages from across the region clash in a frenzy of speed and pride. By day, the fairgrounds are teeming with pilgrims; by night, they’re punctuated by drumbeat of hooves and roars of bikes as bullock carts charge through the state highway — illegally, and often fatally.Despite a police ban, these races surge forward, drawing crowds and disrupting traffic on what would otherwise be a sleepy road. Here, bullocks are forced to race up to 40km at speeds as high as 80kmph, goaded with sharp rods and pointed sticks that inflict pain to propel them to peak pace. The stakes are high: organisers set cash prizes up to Rs 2.5 lakh, fuelling fierce rivalries. For some, it’s about preserving village pride; for others, the prize money is worth the risk to life and limb — both human and animal.“These races have been around for generations, but the aggression was never this extreme,” says Madan Pal from Naanpur near Meerut. “In the past, they used wooden rods; now, pointed sticks and spurs drive the animals. Earlier, link roads in rural belt were used; now, they have spilled over to state roads.” The consequences are tragic, with exhausted bulls collapsing mid-race and overturned carts injuring bystanders who gather to cheer their village champions.For animal rights advocates , the spectacle is an appalling display of cruelty. “Pointed rods jabbed at sensitive areas cause unbearable pain, pushing animals to run harder,” says Anshumali Vashishth of Animal Care Society. “The constant running shoots up their blood pressure to dangerous levels. Often, we get calls to rescue animals, but the aggression on these roads makes it hard even to pass with an ambulance.”Meanwhile, the police remain on high alert, though enforcement is no easy task. “We urge villagers to stop these races and have taken action against violators with a larger force deployed this year and continuous patrolling,” says IG (Meerut Range) Nachiketa Jha. “Our vigilance is all that keeps things from spiralling. Over the years, we’ve managed to curb this menace to a large extent,” adds Jha.Villagers, however, see the races as a test of endurance and honour, with organisers setting routes, pooling prize money, and readying the animals for months ahead. “Our 28km race from Meerut to Hapur, which we completed in 1 hour, 28 minutes, was a matter of pride for village,” says Kale Naval, whose village emerged victorious in this year’s most intense competition. “It was a huge event, with over a thousand bikes riding alongside.”And in Bulandshahr, the passion takes on a more personal pride. Villagers feed their bulls a rich diet of ghee, milk, and gram, preparing them for the gruelling contest, even outfitting them with horseshoes for traction. Pauli Singh, a proud owner of a champion bull, boasts, “Raja is our village’s honour. No other bull can match his speed.”","Rival villages from across the region clash in a frenzy of speed and pride.

GUWAHATI: Gaonburha & Pori became proud parents on Nov 7, and Guwahati zoo got its first baby rhino in a decade. For those who can’t get enough of the ball of wrinkled grey joy toddling around on stumpy legs, there’s now a call to help select a name for the playful calf.The name game, on Assam CM Himanta Sarma’s call, has sparked excitement and a variety of suggestions online — including Ratan, after industrialist-philanthropist Ratan Tata. Others making the rounds include Durga, Prachand, Priya, Bella, Goldie, a hip-hoppy “R-Zoo”, and one that has a streak of black humour running through it: “Nibonuwa” (meaning unemployed in Assamese). Officials said the name will be drawn through a lottery.Born to Gaonburha (meaning “village head”) and Pori (fairy), the calf represents a major milestone for the zoo’s conservation and breeding efforts. It is the third rhino born at the zoo’s breeding centre. Gaonburha, a slow-moving male, was rescued and brought to Guwahati from the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation at Kaziranga National Park in 2017. Thrilled by the new addition, zoo authorities underscored the challenges in breeding rhinos, including the unavailability of “breedable” pairs at the same time.“Before planning the birth of a rhino, bloodline of the parents has to be checked as mating within families is not possible,” said DFO Ashwini Kumar. “Also, the potential breeder rhinos might not be ready for mating at the same time. Keeping them together for a long time can be dangerous as it increases the risk of fights that can turn fatal. All these reasons have delayed the birth.” The zoo’s breeding centre first saw the birth of Pori in 2002, followed by Sanatan in 2013. The current birth, they hope, will continue to boost conservation efforts for the vulnerable species.Zoo veterinarian Dr Panchami Sharma described the care given to breeding pairs, ensuring they are provided a natural environment, complete with water bodies, grasslands, herbs, shrubs, and artificial showers. “The pairs are kept away from zoo visitors,” Sharma added.","Guwahati zoo got its first baby rhino in a decade on Nov 7.

NEW DELHI: In a move that could affect eye banks across India, government issued a directive making it mandatory for institutions responsible for collecting and processing donor corneas to have a minimum 100 collections in a year or they could risk losing licence to operate.India has 726 registered eye banks but, sources said, only 200 are operational. “Many eye banks are opened for govt aid or as a prerequisite to start PG courses in ophthalmology . But they aren’t maintained optimally,” the source added.The directive by National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation, the nodal agency for distribution of organs and tissues in the country, said state authorities should examine data on eye/cornea collection annually by registered eye banks and in case of less performance, they can consider issuing a warning notice to the eye bank for augmenting their eye donation activities.“... otherwise in case of under-performance their renewal may not be considered for the next term,” the order says.Cornea is the transparent tissue that covers the eye. It allows light to enter and performs two-thirds of the focusing tasks. For people suffering from vision loss due to irreparable damage of the tissue, transplant is the only option.","India has 726 registered eye banks but, sources said, only 200 are operational.

NEW DELHI: Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) is set to significantly bolster social science research in India through expanded funding and inclusivity. With a projected budget of Rs 235 crore for the current financial year (excluding UG and PG research projects), ICSSR plans to support studies focused on vulnerable indigenous tribes, women-led research initiatives , and college and university student-led projects. The selected projects are expected to be announced by Jan next year.Under Centre’s new directive, ICSSR will take a multi-pronged approach, including research on particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs) in India, longitudinal studies, and projects specifically for women scholars. PVTG studies, scheduled to begin early next year, aim to create a detailed database to inform research and policy and to document social, cultural, and environmental practices unique to these communities. This initiative will also investigate economic and social vulnerabilities faced by PVTGs.ICSSR member secretary Prof Dhananjay Singh said, research will prioritise understanding cultural practices, sustainable living techniques, & climate adaptation strategies of these communities, which hold insights relevant to modern challenges of equity, social harmony, & environmental sustainability.ICSSR’s focus on PVTGs reflects a growing governmental interest in data collection on marginalised groups. The research, open to faculty and researchers across India, especially those near tribal populations, will include surveys, interviews, & case studies to develop comprehensive datasets, which are lacking.In addition to PVTG studies, ICSSR will introduce a research initiative for UG and PG students, aligning with National Education Policy (NEP) 2020’s emphasis on early-stage research. Expected to launch in Feb 2025, this programme will allow up to 500 students to conduct independent research on topics like development, health, agriculture, technology, and culture, supported by ICSSR funding.Another key initiative is ICSSR’s women-specific research project, which aims to increase women’s participation in India’s research ecosystem, particularly for those from marginalised backgrounds. With a funding range of up to Rs 30 lakh for major projects and Rs 15 lakh for minor projects, the council plans to support 150–200 women-led research projects, in alignment with PM Modi’s vision of an inclusive India.Finally, it will expand its longitudinal studies programme, following success of its initial round earlier this year. These studies, spanning five years with funding up to Rs 3 crore per project, address critical policy and development areas like disaster management, climate change, agri-tech, and social health.","ICSSR plans to support studies focused on vulnerable indigenous tribes, women- led research initiatives, and college and university student-led projects. Under Centre’s new directive, ICSSR will take a multi-pronged approach, including research on particularly vulnerable tribal groups.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115313913,imgsize-37466,width-400,resizemode-4/115313913.jpg"

RANCHI/NEW DELHI: Former Union minister and MP from Hamirpur, Anurag Thakur , on Thursday said the JMM-Congress-RJD govt have fostered “love jihad” and “land jihad”, thereby altering the demographic and land balance in Jharkhand.Thakur said the people of Jharkhand are voting for change this time around, as the state has seen more “jihad welfare” than public welfare, and only BJP stands committed to safeguarding Jharkhand’s interests.“Congress has stooped so low that under Rahul Gandhi’s influence, Jharkhand Congress in-charge Gulam Ahmed Mir has promised gas cylinders at Rs 450 to infiltrators,” Thakur told reporters.This, according to Thakur, reflects Congress’s policy of appeasement, which undermines the rights of tribals and Jharkhand’s residents.He accused the state govt of looting water, forests, and land, altering demographics, and ignoring the tribal rights , with all this happening under the nose of CM Hemant Soren.He further hit out at the govt for its failures, pointing out rampant corruption, unemployment, lawlessness, and neglect of tribal welfare. Thakur cited instances like the seizure of over Rs 350 crore from Congress MP Dheeraj Sahu’s premises by the income tax department as evidence of corruption.He slammed the govt for not fulfilling promises on jobs, unemployment benefits, pensions for women, and gold coins for newlyweds, saying all the vows were forgotten once the alliance was voted to office.Thakur compared the scenario to his home state, Himachal, where he said the Congress govt has become synonymous with misgovernance and unfulfilled promises.",Former Union minister Anurag Thakur said the JMM-Congress-RJD govt have fostered “love jihad” and “land jihad’ He said the state has seen more “jihad welfare” than public welfare.

‘Executive’s abuse of power can’t be tolerated by courts’

NEW DELHI: Imposing a pan-India ban on instant ‘ bulldozer justice ’, Supreme Court on Wednesday said demolition of a citizen's house merely because he is an accused or even a convict, that too without following the due process as prescribed by law, will be “totally unconstitutional”. It laid down a lengthy process for razing illegal structures and ruled that a state cannot breach a family’s right to shelter by demolishing their house only because one of its members is accused of a heinous crime.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan, which had taken suo motu cognisance of demolition of houses and properties belonging to families of accused in many states, especially in Uttar Pradesh, ordered strict compliance of the SC-laid down procedure for removal of illegal structures and warned of serious consequences for officers indulging in wanton demolition of private properties.“Violation of any of the directions would lead to initiation of contempt proceedings in addition to prosecution of officers. If demolition is found to be in violation of orders of this court, the officers would be held responsible for restitution of the demolished property at his/their cost in addition to payment of damages,” the bench said.Beginning the 95-page judgment by quoting famous Hindi poet Pradeep to illuminate the importance of shelter for a family, Justice Gavai said, “The chilling sight of a bulldozer demolishing a building, when authorities have failed to follow the basic principles of natural justice and have acted without adhering to the principle of due process, reminds one of a lawless state of affairs, where ‘might was right’.”Justice Gavai pointed out that mere registration of an FIR naming a person, even in a heinous crime, did not erase his right embodied in the concept of ‘innocent till proven guilty in a court of law’. “The executive cannot pre-judge the guilt of an accused and pronounce a disproportionate punishment, that too demolition of a house,” he said.“In our Constitution, which rests on the foundation of ‘the rule of law’, such high-handed and arbitrary actions have no place. Such excesses at the hands of the executive will have to be dealt with by the heavy hand of the law. Our constitutional ethos and values would not permit any such abuse of power, and such misadventures cannot be tolerated by the court of law,” Justice Gavai said.The instant deployment of bulldozers to raze an accused person’s house, co-owned and inhabited by other members of the family who are innocent, amounted to “inflicting collective punishment on them without reason”, the apex court said and underlined that right to shelter is part of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.The bench raised several questions on the practice of bringing down of an accused person’s house.“Can the family be penalised by demolishing the property without them even being involved in any crime only based on them being related to an alleged accused person? What is their mistake if their relative is arrayed as an accused in some complaint or FIR?” it asked.“As is well known, a pious father may have a recalcitrant son and vice versa. Punishing such persons who have no connection with the crime by demolishing the house where they live in, or properties owned by them, is nothing but an anarchy and would amount to a violation of the right to life guaranteed under the Constitution,” it added.Justices Gavai and Viswanathan said under India’s constitutional scheme and criminal jurisprudence, it was impermissible to demolish a house belonging to a family merely because one of its members was involved in a crime because it amounted to “inflicting a collective punishment on the entire family or the families residing in such structure”.When solicitor general Tushar Mehta said every demolition has to be carried out in strict adherence to the procedure laid down, the bench said it has come to light that authorities have adopted a “pick and choose” attitude towards illegal structures, singling out those belonging to the accused while sparing similar ones in the vicinity. “When a particular structure is chosen all of a sudden for demolition and the rest of the similarly situated structures in the same vicinity are not even being touched, mala fide may loom large,” the bench said.“In such cases, where the authorities indulge in arbitrary pick and choose of structures and it is established that soon before initiation of such an action an occupant of the structure was found to be involved in a criminal case, a presumption could be drawn that the real motive for such demolition proceedings was not the illegal structure but an action of penalising the accused without even trying him before the court of law,” it said.“No doubt, such a presumption could be rebuttable. The authorities will have to satisfy the court that it did not intend to penalise a person accused of demolishing the structure,” the bench added.","Justices Gavai and Viswanathan said under India’s constitutional scheme and criminal jurisprudence, it was impermissible to demolish a house belonging to a family merely because one of its members was involved in a crime. “The executive cannot pre-judge the guilt of an accused and pronounce a disproportionate punishment, that too demolition of a house,” the bench said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115273260,imgsize-215380,width-400,resizemode-4/115273260.jpg"

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents on Wednesday morning searched the Manhattan, New York City, US, apartment of Shayne Coplan , founder and CEO of the prediction market platform Polymarket . The search was part of a criminal investigation by the FBI and the US attorney's office for the southern district of New York, according to a New York Times report.FBI agents arrived at Coplan's SoHo apartment at 6 am and seized several electronic devices, including his phone.The investigation focuses on whether Coplan, 26, operated Polymarket as an unlicensed commodities exchange.

Indian nationals, who hold a significant portion of H-1B visas, may face several challenges due to Miller’s restrictive stance:

Increased Visa Denials: Stricter eligibility criteria could result in higher rejection rates for applications from Indian professionals.

Stephen Miller: Controversies



President-elect Donald Trump has appointed longtime adviser Stephen Miller , known for his strong stance on immigration, as the deputy chief of policy for his new administration. Vice President-elect JD Vance confirmed the appointment on Monday, congratulating Miller on X, calling him “another fantastic pick by the president.” Miller has been one of Trump’s closest aides since his first presidential campaign and was a senior adviser during Trump’s first term. He has played a central role in many policy decisions, particularly on immigration, including the 2018 family separation policy.Additionally, on Sunday, Trump announced that former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director Tom Homan would serve as the administration’s “Border Czar.” In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump shared that Homan would oversee border security , including the Southern and Northern Borders, as well as maritime and aviation security. Homan, a longtime ally of Trump, is also being considered for the role of Secretary of Homeland Security. Trump praised Homan’s expertise in border control, stating he would also oversee deportation policies.Miller is expected to continue his advocacy for restrictive immigration policies, including limits on H-1B visas. According to a Forbes report, the Trump administration’s stance has often been at odds with economic consensus, which suggests that high-skilled immigrants and international students benefit the US economy. The administration worked to decouple study in the US from work opportunities, particularly through H-1B visa restrictions, making it more challenging for high-skilled foreign nationals to stay and work in the U.S. after graduation. The Cruz-Sessions bill, which reflects Miller’s influence, proposed significant barriers for H-1B visa holders, requiring them to work abroad for 10 years before qualifying to work in the U.S., and setting a high minimum salary of $110,000. The bill also sought to restrict Optional Practical Training (OPT) for international students, a policy that was nearly eliminated by a Trump administration regulation.Homan and Miller are anticipated to work closely in the upcoming administration to implement these restrictive immigration measures, with Homan overseeing border control and deportation, as well as maritime and aviation security.Miller argues that the H-1B program can lead to American worker displacement and wage suppression. During Trump’s first term, policies were introduced under Miller’s influence to tighten H-1B regulations, including raising denial rates and narrowing the definition of “specialty occupation,” reducing the positions eligible for H-1B workers.These potential changes may discourage U.S. companies from hiring Indian tech talent, limiting opportunities for those seeking employment in the US.Stephen Miller, born on August 23, 1985, in Santa Monica, California, was raised in a Jewish family with a conservative ideology that influenced his early political views and career choices.Miller attended Duke University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. At Duke, he became a prominent conservative voice on campus, frequently contributing to publications and engaging in political debates. His early career included positions as a press secretary for U.S. Representatives Michele Bachmann and John Shadegg, where he developed a strong foundation in political communication.In 2016, Miller joined Donald Trump’s presidential campaign as a senior policy advisor. After Trump’s election, he took on the role of senior advisor for policy and White House director of speechwriting from 2017 to 2021. Miller played a significant role in crafting Trump’s major speeches, including the inaugural address, and was instrumental in shaping the administration’s stringent immigration policies. He was one of the chief architects of the travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries and the family separation policy aimed at deterring illegal immigration at the U.S. border.Following Trump’s first term, Miller founded America First Legal , an organization dedicated to advancing conservative legal principles and challenging policies of the Biden administration. Through this platform, Miller continued to impact public policy, focusing on immigration and national security, key areas of his earlier work.In November 2024, after Donald Trump’s re-election, Miller was appointed as Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy in the White House. In this role, he is expected to oversee the administration’s policy agenda, especially concerning immigration and national security.Miller is married to Katie Waldman, former press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence. The couple has three children. Throughout his career, Miller has been a divisive figure, gaining praise from supporters for his unwavering conservative principles and facing criticism from opponents for his hardline stance on immigration and involvement in controversial policies.Miller’s career has been marked by several controversies. In 2019, leaked emails revealed that he had promoted articles from white nationalist sources, sparking public criticism and calls for his resignation. Despite these incidents, Miller has retained significant influence within conservative political circles.","President-elect Donald Trump has appointed longtime adviser Stephen Miller as the deputy chief of policy for his new administration.

India capitalof untreated diabetics: Lancet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-capitalof-untreated-diabetics-lancet/articleshow/115274307.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: India has the highest number of persons with untreated diabetes, claims a new study published in The Lancet medical journal.According to the study, an estimated 828 million adults (aged 18 years and older) had diabetes in 2022. Of these, over a quarter (212 million) lived in India, followed by 148 million in China, 42 million in the US, 36 million in Pakistan, 25 million in Indonesia, and 22 million in Brazil.The study was carried out by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) — a global network of health scientists that provides rigorous and timely data on risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) for 200 countries and territories, in collaboration with WHO.Senior author professor Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London, said the study highlights widening global inequalities in diabetes, with treatment rates stagnating in many low- and middle-income countries where numbers of adults with diabetes are drastically increasing.“This is especially concerning as people with diabetes tend to be younger in low-income countries and, in the absence of effective treatment, are at risk of life-long complications — including amputation, heart disease, kidney damage or vision loss — or in some cases, premature death,” Ezzati said.According to the study, global diabetes rates doubled in men (6.8% to 14.3%) and women (6.9% to 13.9%) between 1990 and 2022. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), experienced the largest increases while some higher-income countries, such as Japan, Canada and some countries in western Europe (eg. France, Spain and Denmark), saw no change or even a small decrease in diabetes rate over the past three decades.In India, the researchers pointed out, the diabetes rate nearly doubled in women and men. In women, it went up from 11.9% in 1990 to 24% in 2022. In men, it went up from 11.3% to 21.4% in the corresponding period. In comparison, the treatment coverage increased only marginally for both genders; 21.6% to 27.8% in women between 1990 and 2022 and 25.3% to 29.3% in men in the same period.Dr Sachin Kumar Jain , professor and HOD, department of endocrinology at Amrita Hospital, Faridabad, said India’s status is a sobering reality and highlights a pressing public health challenge. “The reasons behind this situation are multifactorial — limited access to healthcare facilities, socio-economic constraints, cultural perceptions and lack of awareness about diabetes,” he said,“From my experience as an endocrinologist, early detection and continuous care can drastically alter diabetes outcomes. Collaborative efforts between govt bodies, healthcare professionals, and community organisations are vital to mitigate the burden of untreated diabetes in India, improve health literacy, and deliver timely, equitable care across all geographies.”Dr Anoop Misra, chairman Fortis C-Doc, told TOI untreated diabetes is a serious problem. However, he added, that treatment coverage is unlikely to be less than 30%, as reflected in the Lancet study. “Many people opt for alternative therapies, some self-medicate and there are many others who try to deal with the condition by lifestyle modification until the condition worsens. All this is true and requires urgent action,” he said.","An estimated 828 million adults (aged 18 years and older) had diabetes in 2022.

American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy on Wednesday said that ""massive downsizing"" is the only effective way to amend the unlawful behavior of the administrative state. His statement came after US President-elect Donald Trump announced that Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Ramaswamy would lead the "" Department of Government Efficiency "" ( DOGE ).Trump released an official statement on Musk and Ramaswamy leading DOGE on the social media platform X.""I am pleased to announce that the great Elon Musk, working in conjunction with American patriot Vivek Ramaswamy, will lead the Department of Government Efficiency (""DOGE"").

But slapping the bureaucracy on the wrist won’t solve the problem; the only right answer is massive downsizing,"" Ramaswamy said on X.Trump said that he looked forward to Elon and Vivek making changes to the federal bureaucracy with a focus on efficiency, while also improving life for all Americans. He stressed that they would work to eliminate the massive waste and fraud present in the annual $6.5 trillion of government spending.""Importantly, we will drive out the massive waste and fraud which exists throughout our annual $6.5 trillion of government spending.

I am confident they will succeed!"" Trump said in a statement on X.Elon Musk, on the other hand, said that all actions of the Department of Government Efficiency would be posted online for maximum transparency. He encouraged the public to notify them if they believed something important was being cut or something wasteful was being overlooked.""All actions of the Department of Government Efficiency will be posted online for maximum transparency.

On Kashmir: 'A complex situation'

On her Hindu identity

On Bhagavad Gita

Condemnation of religious violence in Bangladesh

US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Tulsi Gabbard , the ex-Democratic congresswoman and newly minted Republican, as Director of National Intelligence. Known for her scepticism of American foreign policy and a background rooted in Hindu tradition, Gabbard brings a unique perspective to US-India relations . A lieutenant colonel with combat experience in Iraq, Gabbard's role as intelligence chief underscores Trump’s shift towards foreign policy sceptics and voices that question traditional American military interventions.Tulsi Gabbard made history as the first Hindu to be elected to Congress. A lifelong vegetarian, she took her oath of office on the Bhagavad Gita , a sacred Hindu text. She was raised as a Hindu by her mother, who had embraced the faith after being born on the US mainland.Representing Hawaii, Gabbard became not only the first Hindu member of the House but also the first American Samoan to serve in Congress.In 2014, Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu-American Congresswoman, pledged to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi's initiative to establish an International Yoga Day. In a statement, Gabbard expressed her commitment to lead the effort in Congress, saying, ""I promised to take the lead in passing a resolution to support Prime Minister Modi’s call to the UN."" Both Gabbard and Modi agreed that yoga transcends physical exercise, serving as ""a lifestyle consciousness and worldview"" that can improve health, promote peace, and offer solutions to global challenges. Gabbard also noted, ""The West would be surprised by the vast knowledge the ancient Vedic texts offer the modern world."" Their meeting in New York included discussions on shared priorities, such as combating extremism and fostering US-India cooperation.She gifted Prime Minister Modi a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, a personal memento she had cherished since childhood. Gabbard also voiced her strong support for Modi's proposal to establish an International Yoga Day.In her remarks on Kashmir, Gabbard expressed that the situation is far from straightforward, highlighting the region's historical and cultural complexities. She noted that understanding Kashmir requires recognising its past and the experiences of those who were displaced.""It’s important as outsiders to understand the complex history of Kashmir,"" she said, adding that many families fled from their homes and still cannot return. She reflected on how the region's policies historically limited rights, particularly those of women. According to her, recent changes have sparked both hope and concern, particularly regarding human rights and civil liberties. However, Gabbard emphasised that the ultimate resolution must come from within India, stating, ""this is a situation…in a sovereign country that must be worked out by all sides who have a stake in their own future there.""As a Hindu in US politics, Gabbard has faced unique challenges and frequent allegations of being a ""Hindu nationalist."" In an op-ed for ReligionNews, she shared her frustration with this stereotype and condemned what she called “religious bigotry” in American society. She argued that her support from people of diverse faiths — Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists — is a testament to her inclusive approach.“Today it’s the profiling and targeting of Hindu Americans…tomorrow will it be Muslim or Jewish Americans?” she questioned, suggesting a dangerous precedent in racial and religious profiling. She pointed out that her political opponents have often stoked fear based on her faith, recalling statements made by her Republican challengers during past elections who argued that Hinduism was incompatible with the US Constitution. Gabbard warned against such divisive rhetoric, asserting, “Religious bigotry and attempts to foment fear of Hindus and other minority religions persist.”On Janmashtami, she described the Gita as a ""transcendental lifeline"" that provides hope and wisdom in times of uncertainty. Reflecting on the challenging year of 2020, she urged others to draw strength from the Gita, saying that the scripture offers a way to remain grounded amid life’s turbulent “strong winds of change.”Gabbard has shared how the Gita guided her through difficult times, including her military deployment. “The Bhagavad Gita offers us guidance and hope,” she noted, emphasising the scripture's timeless relevance and its role in providing a spiritual perspective that transcends day-to-day struggles.In 2021, violent mobs targeting Hindu communities erupted across Bangladesh during the Durga Puja festival Gabbard shared her concerns about religious tolerance extending beyond India to neighbouring Bangladesh. In a video statement, she condemned the violence directed at Hindu worshippers by Islamist extremists, stating that such acts reflect a profound misunderstanding of religious values. “It broke my heart to see such hate and violence,” she said, urging Bangladesh’s government to protect its religious minorities, including Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists, from “the jihadist forces of hate.”According to Gabbard, these acts of violence betray the fundamental principles of faith, stating, “God is love and his true servants embody and manifest that love in the world.” Her comments reflect her broader call for respect and protection for religious minorities globally.","US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence.

Appeal for change in Pitchiguntla name ignored: Community leaders

HYDERABAD: Having carried the stigma attached to their community's distorted name far too long, Pitchiguntla community has asked Telangana Backward Caste Commission to enumerate them as ""Vamsharaj"" and reclassify their caste category.The community's resentment stems from the fact that in common parlance, people often say 'pichakuntla' in Telugu which means 'crackpot or mad'.Classified under 'BC-A' category (that includes nomadic, semi-nomadic and denotified tribes), community members are seeking to be recognised and restored to what was previously known as 'Vamsharaj' community.With the caste survey questionnaire referring to them as ""Pitchiguntla/Vamsharaj"", members of the community feel offended when enumerators come knocking on their doors.Pleas to change their community name to 'Vamsharaj' have fallen on deaf ears, say members of the Pitchiguntla community.Making a renewed effort, former state president of Vamsharaj community welfare association O Narender, said, ""To refer to our community using the Telugu equivalent of crackpot is an insult. In 1995, we were recognised as Vamsharaj community. But by 2008, authorities reverted to calling us Pitchiguntla community. Our appeals have consistently been ignored by successive govts.""A senior official said renaming a community is not a complex process and that it can be done with a gazette notification.Narender added, ""As per records, we are classified under BC-A-18 category, but we are listed as BC-A-17 in the survey.

We are requesting the govt to remove others from our group, reclassify us with other nomadic, semi-nomadic and denotified communities.""AP BSP state coordinator and former DG of Telangana Anti-Corruption Bureau J Purnachandra Rao bemoaned the poor depiction of communities, especially in Telugu films. ""The derogatory portrayal of communities and their depiction in an indecent manner is a significant aspect of our popular culture, particularly in cinema.We have seen references to Pitchiguntla community in a disparaging manner in our films. The name of another community 'Uppara' is often mocked by the filmmakers. This trend dangerously normalises hierarchical behaviour,"" he told TOI.Vamsharaj/Pitchiguntla community resides in the erstwhile districts of Khammam, Nalgonda, Karimnagar, Rangareddy, Medak and Warangal.

Those in rural areas work as agricultural labourers.Inukonda Thirumali, a former professor of history in Delhi University and member of the community, providing insights into the community's historical evolution, said, ""The roots of our community can be traced back to the 1800s and an era even before that.""He said the community's main source of income used to come from reciting 'Kula Puranams' (texts on various castes) and telling stories of village communities, which made them rely on others for their livelihood.

'Rs 2,000 cr to improve power network in Telangana'

HYDERABAD: While the winter chill has just set in, power consumption - surprisingly - is on the rise, especially in the surrounding areas of Hyderabad where new colonies have mushroomed thanks to rapid expansion of the metropolitan area.In recent times, the power demand is up by 23% across the city. Generally, it goes up by 12% every year and the peak power demand is seen during the summer. However, this time, the month of Nov is witnessing a huge power demand in Greater Hyderabad due to the prevailing weather conditions.As per the Telangana Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TGPSDCL) data, power consumption is up by 33% in the Cyber City division of the discom and witnessed a 31% rise in Medchal division when compared to last year. The Cyber City circle covers Gachibowli, Kondapur, Kokapet, Mokila, Narsingi, Moinabad and Chevella areas. Officials said power usage recorded a 20% increase in Medchal, Rajendranagar, Hyderabad South circle and towards Shamshabad airport areas.Discom officials said the maximum power demand reached 3,756 MW in Greater Hyderabad last year, which rose to 4,352 MW this year.In terms of consumption, power usage increased from 79 million units to 90 MU, recording 15% growth.In November last year, demand in Greater Hyderabad limits was 2,764 MW and this Nov 12, it soared to 3,280 MW, an official said.""The reasons for the rise in power demand are fresh connections in the new residential colonies in the surrounding areas of Hyderabad. Plus, new commercial establishments and offices have seen an exponential growth in these areas and power usage has also gone up tremendously,"" a director of TGSPDCL told TOI.Apart from areas such as Gachibowli, Kokapet and Gopanpally in the western corridor, the power usage trend is more or less the same in eastern parts of the city such as Koheda, Tatti Annaram, Mansanpally, Abdullapurmet, Uppal Bhagayath, in north Hyderabad areas such as Medchal, Dundigal and Kompally and the southern corridor consisting of Kandukur, Kachavani Singaram and other areas.To meet the increasing power demand, the state govt has directed the discoms to augment the infrastructure for quality supply.""We are enhancing the capacity of 168 power transformers, that exist in the sub-stations.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
