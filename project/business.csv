Rs 2k crore scam during Covid in Rajasthan noon meal scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-2k-crore-scam-during-covid-in-rajasthan-noon-meal-scheme/articleshow/126425449.cms,".

JAIPUR: Rajasthan’s anticorruption bureau (ACB) Thursday registered a case in an alleged Rs 2,000-crore scam linked to state govt’s midday meal scheme during the Covid-19 pandemic.ACB officers said the FIR names 21 accused, including officials of Rajasthan State Cooperative Consumer Federation Ltd (Confed), representatives of private firms and suppliers, who have been booked on charges of criminal conspiracy, forgery and misuse of govt funds.According to ACB, when schools were closed during the pandemic, a decision was taken that packs containing pulses, oil, spices and other essentials would be supplied through Confed under the midday meal scheme. The material was to be supplied in accordance with FSSAI and Agmark standards, with doorstep delivery to students across the state.Following complaints of large-scale irregularities in 2020-21, ACB registered a preliminary inquiry. Officers said it revealed officials conspired to rig the tender process by tweaking the eligibility norms. As a result, qualified firms were kept out of the bidding process, ensuring contracts were cornered by favoured companies.These firms allegedly further sublet the work to shell entities, creating a fake supply chain of non-existent suppliers and transporters, with little or no actual procurement or delivery.The investigation also found that in several cases, fake bills were generated and submitted without any actual purchase or supply, and govt payments obtained on the basis of bogus and inflated invoicing. In many cases, it is suspected substandard materials were supplied, but falsely certified as meeting prescribed quality and safety norms.A financial loss of about Rs 2,000 crore was estimated to have been caused to the state exchequer, ACB said. Based on the findings, an FIR was registered against Confed officials, central warehouse staff, private individuals and firms involved.","Rajasthan's anticorruption bureau (ACB) Thursday registered a case in an alleged Rs 2,000-crore scam linked to state govt’s midday meal scheme during the Covid-19 pandemic.

DU bids adieu to wall of democracy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/du-bids-adieu-to-wall-of-democracy/articleshow/126424902.cms,".

NEW DELHI: 'Bol ke lab azaad hain tere,' scribbled across a yellow chart paper, fought for space alongside a poster exhorting freshers to join the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. During the high-decibel Delhi University Students' Union (DUSU) polls in Sept, the walls of democracy at North Campus gave opposing student parties the opportunity to stand neck-and-neck-at least on paper-and more.On Wednesday evening, however, when two women students affiliated with the Students' Federation of India (SFI) attempted to paste posters opposing the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill near St. Stephen's College, they were shocked to learn that the walls no longer 'existed'.A video shows at least seven security staff stopping the duo.Only five months ago, Delhi University (DU) had notified guidelines against defacement of walls, especially during the student election season. It also asked departments and colleges to increase the size of these walls of democracy as much as possible at two notified locations.DU's North and South Campuses have several such walls, typically marked with a university-installed board reading 'Wall of Democracy' for easy identification.Walls adjacent to St. Stephen's College, near the Faculty of Arts, and opposite Daulat Ram College were among those officially designated.During student elections, anti-defacement committees were set up to ensure that posters were pasted only on these walls. Outside election periods, students have also used them to display posters related to protests, meetings and political or social issues.In a social media post, the student body alleged that the guards tore down the posters and verbally informed them of the university's decision. Students also claimed that the boards identifying these walls were removed without prior notice.DU proctor Manoj Kumar on Thursday confirmed that the walls had been denotified. He, however, did not provide any reason for the decision or indicate whether it had been communicated to students. He also did not clarify whether colleges had been asked to follow suit. A college principal said no one had asked them to follow in the university's footsteps, so far.The organisation submitted a complaint to the proctor's office on Thursday, demanding the immediate reinstatement of the walls.In its complaint, the SFI said the removal was carried out without any consultation with students or student organisations. It added that the walls have historically served as an important democratic space for students to express opinions and engage in political and social dialogue within the university.Calling the move an attempt to stifle democratic expression, students said the shrinking of such spaces undermines the democratic character of DU.","DU's North and South Campuses have several such walls, typically marked with a university-installed board reading 'Wall of Democracy' for easy identification.

Khawaja Asif says Pakistan may not need IMF loans soon — what's behind the claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/khawaja-asif-says-pakistan-may-not-need-imf-loans-soon-whats-behind-the-claim/articleshow/126406990.cms,"Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

500% tariffs ahead for India & China? Trump clears Russia sanctions bill; what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/500-tariffs-ahead-for-india-china-trump-clears-russia-sanctions-bill-what-it-means/articleshow/126405011.cms,"Trump Clears Russia Sanctions Bill, 500% Tariff Threat Looms As India Reworks Oil Import Strategy

Also read:

Also read:

US President Donald Trump has approved a new bill that allows massive duties on countries that import Russian petroleum products. The bill, 'Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025' threatens at least 500% tariffs on countries that ""knowingly engage in the exchange. "" US senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill, which is now headed for bipartisan approval aims to punish nations “who buy cheap Russian oil,” a move that could directly impact India’s energy imports and further strain its trade ties with Washington.The proposed legislation sets out sweeping punitive measures that would be triggered if the US President finds that Russian government or a person acting at Russia's direction refuses to negotiate a peace agreement with Ukraine. The measures will also be revoked in case a negotiated peace agreement is violated, another invasion of Ukraine or involved with overthrowing is initiated, dismantling, or seeking to subvert the Ukrainian government.The bill states that Trump ""must increase the rate of duty on all goods and services imported into the United States from countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products to at least 500% relative to the value of such goods and services.""In his post on X, Graham said, ""After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others."" Explaining the crucial timing of the bill, the executive further added, ""Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent.""""This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries who buy cheap Russian oil fueling Putin’s war machine. This bill would give President Trump tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil that provides the financing for Putin’s bloodbath against Ukraine.""Earlier this week, Graham said that India was urging Washington to roll back steep tariffs imposed in August 2025, over the same issue. Graham claimed that India’s ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, met him last month to highlight New Delhi’s reduced purchases of Russian oil and to seek relief from the additional 25% duties.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One alongside Trump, the senator said, “I was at the Indian Ambassador's house a month ago, and all he wanted to talk about was how India is buying less Russian oil. And he asked me to tell the President to relieve the 25% tariff.” The tariffs were imposed in August, with the US arguing that India’s energy trade with Russia was indirectly supporting Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine. With the extra levy, total duties on certain Indian goods rose to 50%.Trump has openly acknowledged that the tariffs have strained ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Addressing the House GOP Member Retreat, he said PM Modi was unhappy with the trade measures but pointed to a reduction in oil imports from Russia. “He’s not that happy with me because, you know, they’re paying a lot of tariffs now because they’re not doing the oil, but they are — they’ve now reduced it very substantially, as you know, from Russia,” Trump said.The US President has repeatedly warned India that tariffs could be increased further if it does not “help on the Russian oil issue,” directly linking trade pressure to the Russia–Ukraine conflict. He has argued that India’s purchases of discounted Russian crude fuel Moscow's war machine in Ukraine.India, however, has maintained a firm stance, rejecting Trump’s earlier claim that PM Modi had assured him New Delhi would stop buying Russian oil, clarifying that no such conversation took place. As Washington moves closer to advancing the sanctions bill, the proposed legislation could raise fresh uncertainty for India.At the same time, Trump has positioned himself as a potential broker in the Russia–Ukraine war, holding talks with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though without any concrete breakthrough so far.","US President Donald Trump has approved a new bill that allows massive duties on countries that import Russian petroleum products.

Key symptoms of lung cancer you must pay attention to

NEW DELHI: India's lung cancer burden is projected to rise sharply by 2030, with the North-East emerging as the worst-affected region and women recording the fastest increase in cases, a national study published in Indian Journal of Medical Research has found.Data from 57 populations across six regions show lung cancer incidence to be highest in the North-East, where rates for women are now close to those for men - an unusual pattern in India. Aizawl recorded the highest burden, with age-standardised incidence at 35.9 per lakh among men and 33.7 per lakh among women, along with the highest mortality.Although extremely high tobacco use - over 68% among men and 54% among women - continues to drive the region's burden, doctors say the disease profile is shifting. ""We are seeing more lung cancer cases among non-smoking women, linked to indoor air pollution, biomass fuel use, second-hand smoke and occupational exposure,"" said Dr Saurabh Mittal of AIIMS's pulmonology department.The shift is also reflected in tumour patterns nationwide. Adenocarcinoma has replaced smoking-linked squamous-cell carcinoma as the dominant subtype. In Bengaluru, it now accounts for over half of lung cancer cases among women, while Delhi has seen a sharp rise in large-cell carcinoma.Southern districts such as Kannur, Kasargod and Kollam reported high incidence among men despite relatively low tobacco and alcohol use, pointing to non-tobacco risk factors. Among women, Hyderabad and Bengaluru recorded the highest incidence in the south. In the north, Srinagar showed elevated lung cancer rates among men, while women in Srinagar and Pulwama also reported higher incidence despite low substance use.Trend analysis shows lung cancer incidence climbing by up to 6.7% annually among women and 4.3% among men in some regions. Thiruvananthapuram recorded the sharpest rise among women, while Dindigul saw the steepest increase among men. With tobacco use among women still below 10% nationwide, researchers point to worsening air quality and household exposures as key drivers.Projections suggest that by 2030, lung cancer incidence among men could exceed 33 per lakh in parts of Kerala, while among women it could rise to over 8 per lakh in cities like Bengaluru. Low mortality-to-incidence ratios in several regions also point to gaps in death reporting, potentially masking the true toll.",India's lung cancer burden is projected to rise sharply by 2030.

Rs 58 crore digital arrest fraudsters opened 10k mule accounts: Cops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-58-crore-digital-arrest-fraudsters-opened-10k-mule-accounts-cops/articleshow/126421857.cms,".

MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Nodal Cyber Police on Wednesday filed a 2,500-page chargesheet in a Rs 58-crore 'digital arrest' con naming 32 arrested persons and 41 wanted accused, who not only impersonated Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) officers, but also created a multi-layered web of mule bank accounts to move money across states and eventually overseas.According to the chargesheet, the investigation uncovered over 10,000 mule accounts, many opened in the names of fictitious companies using forged KYC documents and fake SIM cards. The funds allegedly travelled through 13 layers of accounts, including at least 27 active mule accounts in Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, before being diverted abroad. The masterminds are suspected to be operating from Cambodia and Dubai, with one Vijay Khanna emerging as a key handler believed to be outside India.The fraud began in Aug 2025, when a pharmaceutical businessman and his wife were allegedly terrorised through calls and video interactions by persons posing as CBI and ED officials. The couple was told that their bank accounts had received ""suspicious"" funds attracting money-laundering provisions and were shown fake video calls and staged clips depicting police stations, CBI and ED offices, and even mock courtrooms with actors posing as judges, officers, and lawyers.Under the guise of investigation, the couple was coerced to transfer their entire savings of over Rs 58.1 crore, with assurances the money would be returned after clearance.Investigators said arrested Gujarat businessman Jayeshbhai Dapa's firm, Jai Bhavani Mechanical, allegedly received nearly Rs 15.3 crore, which was then routed to multiple accounts for monetary consideration. Accounts in the names of Meghdoot Trading, owned by Sakalkumar Sahu, Jacky Explorer owned by Chirag Sharma, and entities such as SBV Foundation and M-Stak Innovation allegedly received major sums, ranging from Rs 1.9 crore to Rs 2.4 crore.Devendranath Raut, a resident of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, allegedly received Rs 2.1 crore in the name of Sainath Enterprises and stated, during interrogation, that he transferred funds at the behest of a wanted accused, Shratik. Investigators have also tracked Rs 3.4 crore allegedly transferred to accounts linked with wanted accused Vijay Gaikwad, Abhijit Jamble, and Ratnadeep.The chargesheet alleged that AVB Foundation, owned by Akshay Meena of Bhilwara, received Rs 30 lakh, while Maybank Indonesia accounts linked to Technomist Softwares and Arkit Solutions and opened by Devendra alias Sunny and Mukesh Bhatia received Rs 50 lakh. Accused Katunga Raju Samuel Prasad from Andhra Pradesh allegedly received Rs 2.4 crore through an account in the name of a religious trust.","The Maharashtra Nodal Cyber Police on Wednesday filed a 2,500-page chargesheet in a Rs 58-crore 'digital arrest' con naming 32 arrested persons and 41 wanted accused.

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report

NEW DELHI: The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) is not fully satisfied with X's initial response to its notice on the alleged misuse of AI chatbot Grok and is likely to seek clearer, step-by-step details on corrective measures the platform plans to implement, govt sources said on Thursday.Officials said X's reply to the Jan 2 notice had relied on broad assurances of policy enforcement and user liability but fell short of spelling out specific technological and operational safeguards to prevent generation of obscene and non-consensual content, including sexualised images of women and minors. ""The response is generic in nature. The ministry is going to ask for specific steps - what changes will be made, how quickly and how they will be enforced,"" a source said.The development comes after X sought more days beyond the 72-hour deadline set by MeitY to submit a detailed action taken report"". A govt official had earlier told TOI the platform requested additional time and govt remained ""hopeful of a positive outcome"" given X's global footprint.The issue escalated after a viral ""bikini"" trend, which saw users allegedly using Grok to generate sexualised or manipulated images by feeding publicly available photos into the chatbot. A Reuters report last week said the platform was flooded with such content, raising concerns over AI-enabled abuse.Amid the scrutiny, X owner Elon Musk warned that users generating illegal content through Grok would face consequences. MeitY has said failure to comply with directives could lead to the withdrawal of safe-harbour protections.","The issue escalated after a viral ""bikini"" trend, which saw users allegedly using Grok to generate sexualised or manipulated images.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Taking in what it called an important step towards environmental governance and reducing dependence on foreign certification systems, India has set up the world's second National Environmental Standard Laboratory (NESL) here at the CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (NPL) that will develop testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment in the country.Currently, most of the instruments used in India for air pollution monitoring are imported. These imported instruments, however, come with production certification from international agencies based on the environmental conditions of the certificate issuing countries in Europe or the US.Since environmental conditions of those countries are very different from the conditions prevalent in India, it affects the quality of measurements by the instrument operating for a long time in Indian conditions, CSIR-NPL scientists explained. At present, only the UK has such a laboratory.The NESL, inaugurated by Union science & technology minister Jitendra Singh on 80th Foundation Day celebrations of CSIR-NPL - the apex institution for metrology and custodian of India's national standards - Monday, will now not only deal with the anomaly arising out of different environmental conditions but also help in manufacturing of standardised monitoring equipment.The difference in temperature, humidity, pollution mix and high dust load due to difference in environmental or weather conditions of certifying countries often affected the long-term reliability and transparency of the data generated in India.The NESL will, however, allow manufacturers, industries, and municipal agencies to validate performance within the country, ensuring credible data for the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), industrial emission audits, and smart-city monitoring networks.","India has set up the world's second National Environmental Standard Laboratory (NESL) The NESL will develop testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment.

No red lights in Kota: When cities try out signal-free roads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-red-lights-in-kota-when-cities-try-out-signal-free-roads/articleshow/126424548.cms,".

Signal-free roads have led to drop in accidents and fatalities, say police

At a junction on Anna Salai in Chennai, a car edges past the spot where a traffic light once hung, slows down, curves into a U-turn and merges back without stopping. Almost 1700km away, in Bokaro, drivers approach roundabouts that have never needed signals at all, easing off instinctively. In Kota, the same idea of uninterrupted flow often collapses into peak-hour gridlock, forced detours and sudden bottlenecks.India's experiments with signal-free roads may not have succeeded universally but have left deeper lessons on traffic management and human behaviour.Kota's attempt was the most sweeping. Under the Smart City Project, it dismantled traffic signals in Dec 2022, spending over Rs 2,000cr from the Rs 5,000cr programme to build more than two dozen overbridges, as many underpasses and multiple slip lanes. At least 12 major junctions were widened and redesigned to eliminate stopping altogether. The redesign drew attention beyond the city too, with industrialist Anand Mahindra among those who appreciated the concept - an endorsement residents now cite as proof the idea was never dismissed as impractical, only difficult to execute at scale.""It's the only traffic signal-free city of nearly 15 lakh people,"" said RD Meena, former officer on special duty of then Kota Urban Improvement Trust, now Kota Development Authority, who supervised the project.RD Meena, former officer on special duty of then Kota Urban Improvement Trust and now Kota Development Authority who supervised the project, said the overhaul was completed in three years despite time and financial constraints, and that ""the changes were made with public consensus"".Immediately, long waits at major circles eased, and 10-15 minute snarls at places like Commerce College Road, Gumanpura and Sabzi Mandi thinned out. But the city's ""no-stop"" layout also produced new stresses. Trips that once required a simple right turn now involve longer loops. During peak hours, congestion resurfaces at redesigned junctions, while drivers cut through narrow link roads to save time, increasing side-swipes and wrong-side conflicts.The strain is most visible along the Commerce College-Airport Road stretch, where ambulances and vehicles parked outside private hospitals routinely narrow down moving lanes. What is designed as free flow breaks down when stationary traffic intrudes.""Travel time hasn't really come down,"" said Sujeet Swami, a Kota-based advocate. ""At peak hours, congestion becomes unbearable at Commerce College Circle, Kotdi, Antaghar, Chawani, Gumanpura and Keshavpura. Without signals or cops managing the rush, jams just stack up.""Traffic police counter with enforcement data. Deputy SP (Traffic) Ashok Meena said the city adopted a 'no-stop' policy for violators, moving away from roadside confrontations that happened when drivers were stopped on the road. Instead, officials moved to digital monitoring using night-vision laser speed guns, interceptor vehicles and static cameras linked to Abhay Command Centre. Till Nov 2025, over 8,000 speed violations and more than 1,000 cases of wrong-side driving were recorded digitally. A black-spot audit improved 57 of the 76 accident-prone locations.""Accidents have dropped from 556 in 2023 to 358 by late 2025. Fatalities are down about 20%,"" Meena said, adding the model could work in other cities under right conditions. Police data shows that in 2023, Kota recorded 556 road mishaps, with 103 deaths and 604 injured; in 2024, mishaps fell to 458, with 104 deaths and 494 injured; and till Nov 30, 2025, mishaps stood at 358, with 83 deaths and 417 injured.As of July 31, 2025, Kota had over 7 lakh registered vehicles - including around 5.2 lakh two-wheelers - policed by a traffic force of just over 100 personnel, supported by 30 home guards. Urban planners point out that the city's mixed results reflect a tightening equation between road width and vehicle load, one that becomes harder to balance as traffic grows.Bokaro presents a quieter contrast. Developed in the 1970s as a planned township, Bokaro Steel City has functioned without traffic signals, surveillance cameras or constant policing for years. Wide roads and three-arm roundabouts keep movement predictable, and the city's largest junction, Birsa Chowk, is the only four-way intersection - also signal-free. ""Driving here feels easy,"" said Kirti Kumari, a college student who rides a scooty daily. ""There's space, no pressure, and no sudden stops.""Deputy commissioner Ajay Nath Jha said the township's road design shaped behaviour as much as enforcement. ""There's a unique and effective traffic culture. Wide roads, roundabouts and road bumps play an important role in making driving safer,"" he said. ""We are moving Bokaro towards a 'zero accident' goal, and all departments concerned work with seriousness, sensitivity and strong coordination.""Roads inside the township are maintained by Bokaro Steel Plant. ""The layout was planned from the start - wide carriageways, roundabouts, regular upkeep,"" said Manikant Dhan, the PSU's chief of communication. ""That reduces congestion and accidents.""Down south, Chennai's signal-free experiment occupies a narrower, more controlled space. In mid-2023, Greater Chennai Traffic Police removed signals at six junctions along Anna Salai, including Nandanam, Spencer's and Teynampet, replacing right turns with straight movement, designated U-turns and left turns. Average delays fell from over 12 minutes to under five, while speeds on the six-km stretch between Saidapet and Spencer's Signal rose from about 10 kmph in 2022 to around 14 kmph.Instead of permanent concrete channelisers, Chennai used removable barricades, allowing quick corrections. Some motorists complained that barricades ate into up to two-and-a-half lanes on four-lane roads, affecting opposing traffic. Police said designs were reviewed and adjusted.Chennai also adopted a corridor approach rather than isolated junction fixes. On 100 Feet Road between Koyambedu and Vadapalani, three signals were shut together and replaced with two double U-turns, enabling continuous movement along the stretch. The model has since extended to EVR Periyar Salai, Old Mahabalipuram Road and the CPT junction. Chennai now has nearly 36 such U-turns, deployed selectively rather than citywide.Across the three cities, the pattern is hard to miss. Signal-free roads work when space, design and behaviour align, or when interventions are limited, data-driven and reversible. Where those conditions thin out, uninterrupted movement becomes another source of friction. The red light was never the real constraint. The city itself was.","India's experiments with signal-free roads have left deeper lessons on traffic management and human behaviour. In Kota, the same idea of uninterrupted flow often collapses into peak-hour gridlock, forced detours and sudden bottlenecks. In Bokaro, drivers approach roundabouts that have never needed signals at all, easing off instinctively.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126424546,imgsize-615300,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-18.jpg"

Delhi: 5 Cops Injured, 10 Detained As Anti-Encroachment Drive Near Mosque Turns Violent

MEERUT: After razing at least 17 mosques and other structures in Sambhal, the district administration has escalated its crackdown on ""illegal"" encroachments by imposing heavy financial penalties on the structures built on government and pond land.On Thursday, tehsildar Dhirendra Pratap Singh announced that violators would face a fine exceeding Rs 75 lakh for six properties including a mosque and madrassa, following the recent demolition drives in Asmoli area.Sambhal DM Rajendra Pensiya told TOI, ""Measures taken to impose the penalty will continue. It is being imposed for years of encroachment and losses to the ecological system. In the past one year, we recovered dozens of ponds on which constructions were made. The water-table of these blocks got alarmingly depleted. After reviving these water bodies, we're seeing a positive change.""Notably, significant penalties have been levied against several committees and individuals. Madina Mosque management faced a fine of Rs 9 lakh, while a staggering Rs 51 lakh was charged against a panel for operating an illegal madrassa.In Raya Buzurg, Gosul Barra Mosque committee was fined Rs 6 lakh for ""encroaching on pond land"", and a marriage hall operator faced a Rs 6.4 lakh penalty.Additionally, individuals who built private houses on protected land had to pay over Rs 1 lakh.Authorities have warned that ""if the fines are not paid within the stipulated time frame, recovery certificates will be issued, potentially leading to property seizure or imprisonment."" The tehsildar said that action against such illegal structures is being taken mainly in Salempur Salar (Hajipur) and Raya Buzurg villages.","Sambhal district administration has imposed heavy financial penalties on structures built on government and pond land.

Donald Trump Pulls US Out Of India-Led Solar Alliance In Sweeping Exit From 66 Global Agencies

US move coincides with call for defence budget rise





In a sweeping overhaul of America's global footprint, President Donald Trump has authorised the withdrawal of US from 66 international organisations, marking one of the most significant retreats from multilateralism in modern history.The pullout is from all major climate-linked global bodies, including India-headquartered International Solar Alliance and UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Though the withdrawal from ISA, a collaborative initiative of India and France to increase solar footprints globally, will not affect the alliance's key goal, the move came as a surprise as the Trump administration had never hinted at it after withdrawing from the Paris agreement on climate change.The withdrawal, announced on Jan 7 via a presidential memorandum, affects 31 United Nations entities and 35 non-UN groups, including key bodies focused on health and education. This action coincides with Trump's call for a $1.5 trillion defence budget in fiscal year 2027, a staggering 50% increase over current levels, fuelling debates about a shift towards a ""Fortress America"" doctrine that prioritises domestic strength, protectionism over global engagement.The withdrawals build on an executive order issued shortly after Trump's inauguration in Jan 2025, which directed a review of US participation in international bodies deemed contrary to national interests. Prominent targets include Unesco, which the US had briefly rejoined under the previous administration; and potentially WHO, echoing Trump's first-term defunding over alleged biases toward China.Other entities span trade, human rights, and environmental forums, with the state department citing a total of 66 as ""wasteful, ineffective, or harmful"". In some cases, Washington has formally withdrawn; in others, it has suspended funding, reduced diplomatic engagement or signalled an intention to exit when legal timelines allow.Administration officials say these organisations ""no longer serve American interests"" and often promote policies seen as hostile or inefficient. For instance, climate-related bodies are criticised for imposing undue burdens on US business and industry without reciprocal commitments from ""major emitters"" like China and India, even though their per capita emission is a fraction of American emissions. Unesco and similar groups face accusations of waste and mismanagement, with secretary of state Marco Rubio highlighting redundancy and a lack of tangible benefits for US taxpayers.Trump himself has framed the decisions as part of his ""America First"" agenda, arguing that funds previously allocated to these entities - estimated at billions annually - should be redirected domestically to address border security, infrastructure, and economic recovery. Supporters, including Republican lawmakers, applaud the move as a correction to decades of overcommitment, freeing resources amid a national debt heading towards $40 trillion.Foreign policy experts point to the Dec 2025 National Security Strategy, which critiques US allies in Europe and Asia for insufficient burden-sharing while prioritising unilateral actions. The document, released under Trump's direction, describes an ""America First"" framework that sceptics label as neo-isolationist, though administration officials insist it avoids outright withdrawal from core alliances like Nato, which is also under siege from Washington over the Greenland issue.This approach is straining US ties across the globe: European leaders have decried the US exits as a blow to collective security, while adversaries like Russia and China are relishing the perceived vacuum. Partners like India, Japan, and Australia have been hung out to dry. Analysts argue the policy fosters adversity by undermining multilateralism, with some of them warning that Trump's strategy risks damaging US power, economy, and security through hostility toward global cooperation.The proposed $1.5 trillion defence budget, unveiled on Jan 7, underscores this pivot. Trump justified the hike - up from the current $1 trillion - as essential for building a ""dream military"", with allocations for nuclear modernisation, missile defence, and cyber capabilities.","US withdraws from 66 international organisations, including UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and International Solar Alliance.

500% Tariff Shock? Trump Okays 'Graham-Blumenthal Bill', Clashes With China Amid Tensions

Sanctions bill has significant bipartisan backing in Congress

: With no end in sight for Washington's tariff tangle with India, more trouble appears to be looming for New Delhi after US President Donald Trump green-lit Wednesday a sweeping bipartisan legislation that will authorise him to slap primary and secondary sanctions as well as punitive tariffs up to 500% on Moscow and countries that still buy oil from Russia.The proposed Sanctioning Russia Act, simply called the Graham-Blumenthal Bill after the senators sponsoring it, would significantly raise pressure on Russia and countries such as China, India and Brazil, all part of Brics, which have so far withstood current US sanctions and tariffs.By legislatively empowering Trump beyond his current executive authority, lawmakers, in conjunction with White House, are also trying to get ahead of a US Supreme Court ruling in the tariff case - likely this month - that is widely expected to go against the administration.""This bill will allow President Trump to punish countries who buy cheap Russian oil fuelling Putin's war machine... give him tremendous leverage against... China, India and Brazil to incentivise them to stop buying the oil that provides finance for Putin's bloodbath against Ukraine,"" Senator Lindsey Graham posted on X after a meeting where he said Trump green-lit passage of the legislation.Graham said there could be “a strong bipartisan vote, hopefully as early as next week”.The legislation grew out of mounting frustration in the White House and Congress that existing sanctions have failed to change the Kremlin’s behaviour.Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, long among the Senate’s most outspoken advocates for Ukraine, argue that Russia has adapted to earlier measures by rerouting energy exports to willing buyers at discounted prices. By targeting those buyers directly with even higher tariffs and sanctions, they say, Washington can close the loopholes that have allowed Moscow to keep financing its war.The bill enjoys significant bipartisan backing in Congress. Introduced in Sept 2025, it advanced through the senate foreign relations committee in Oct 2025 by a strong vote, signalling broad consensus. By Dec, with 85 co-sponsors in the Senate alone, it spurred companion legislation in the House even as the Trump tariffs, imposed through executive power, were challenged and rejected in lower courts before the matter reached the Supreme Court.Trump, who was initially reluctant to back the legislation, believing he had enough executive authority, appears to have changed course after the judicial setbacks. In comments during a golf outing with Graham in late 2025, he had expressed support for tougher sanctions but urged caution to avoid derailing negotiations with Putin. He reportedly insisted on reviewing the final text of the legislation, emphasising that it should not “tank the global economy” while targeting Russia’s oil revenues.Trump’s endorsement marks a shift from earlier ambivalence, where he prioritised diplomacy over escalation. While concerns remain about potential economic fallout of the legislation on the US itself, including solidifying the Brics bloc and accelerating its de-dollarisation efforts, the momentum behind the bill reflects a rare convergence of Republican and Democratic views on Russia.","US President Donald Trump green-lit bipartisan legislation that will authorise him to slap primary and secondary sanctions as well as punitive tariffs up to 500% on Moscow.

'Naughty, Nasty HM': Mamata Slams Amit Shah After ED Raids TMC Leader Amid SIR Row

LUCKNOW: Stirred by the deletion of 2.89 crore voters from Uttar Pradesh's draft electoral roll following the SIR exercise, BJP's state unit has decided to launch a campaign to trace the ""absent"" and ""transferred"" voters ahead of the 2027 assembly polls.The announcement comes in the wake of CM Yogi Adityanath's assertion that the majority of ""missing"" voters are primarily BJP supporters. As per an estimate, UP's electoral roll should have over 15 crore voters.A senior party functionary said the campaign will focus on three fonts: tracing the absent and transferred voters, re-enrolling voters whose names got deleted due to documentation gaps, and tapping first-time voters, especially youth. Party MPs, MLAs and MLCs at the local level will be involved in the campaign. The district units have been alerted to carry out the drive aggressively.A special focus will be on filling in Form 6, the primary application used by Indian citizens to get registered as a new voter or to get their registration transferred while moving to a different constituency. Experts said the focus on Form 6 indicates that BJP seeks to align its cadre network closely with EC procedures, keeping the effort formally within legal bounds.","BJP's state unit has decided to launch a campaign to trace the ""absent"" and ""transferred"" voters ahead of the 2027 assembly polls.

NEW DELHI: After introducing biometric verification through Facial Recognition System (FRS) for beneficiaries registered with anganwadis who receive ‘take home rations’ (THR), the Ministry of Women and Child Development (WCD) is working on a module to “universalise” FRS by extending it to ‘hot cooked meals’ served to children who visit these centres.Under FRS, photo capturing of beneficiaries and e-KYC based on Aadhaar system during registration is done. For children, a parent or any guardian undergoes the process and not the child since Bal-Aadhaar (age 0-5 years) does not have biometrics. A fresh photo at THR distribution stage is matched with the already stored verified image of the beneficiary.According to a statement from the ministry, as of Dec 31, 2025, out of 4.73 crore beneficiaries eligible for THR, a total of 4.51 crore (91.38%) have completed their eKYC and face matching. In Dec, 2.79 crore (52.68%) eligible beneficiaries received THR using FRS.FRS-based verification to ensure last-mile tracking of THR delivery in anganwadis was made mandatory for existing beneficiaries from July 1 last year. The ministry, in a communication to states, had also said that FRS would be introduced at the stage of registration of all new beneficiaries under the supplementary nutrition programme from Aug 1 last year.WCD minister Annapurna Devi on Thursday said that overall Aadhaar verification of around 99% beneficiaries registered on the Poshan Tracker has been done. Mandatory biometric verification through facial authentication was also introduced from May last year for all new enrolments under Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana.“To ensure that actual genuine beneficiaries get the benefits, we are planning to universalise Facial Recognition System-based verification and will extend it to hot cooked meals at anganwadis. We have collected data and are working on implementing FRS in the entire supplementary nutrition programme (THR and HCM),” WCD secretary Anil Malik said.Under the Supplementary Nutrition Programme (SNP) that aims to fill the gap in nutrition amongst children under six years of age as well as pregnant, lactating women and adolescent girls, the supplementary diet is delivered through two modalities – ‘Hot-Cooked Meal’ and ‘Take-Home Ration’ (THR), delivered in the form of raw ingredients or pre-cooked packets.The FRS-based verification being made mandatory has been criticised by anganwadi unions and civil society organisations who have raised fears of many genuine beneficiaries getting excluded.","Ministry of Women and Child Development is working on a module to ‘universalise’ FRS.

ISRO Launches Heaviest-Ever Satellite BlueBird Block-2 Onboard LVM3 Rocket

NEW DELHI: Isro will usher in the new year with the first launch of 2026 — PSLV C62 mission — on Monday (January 12) at 10.17 am from the first launchpad at the Sriharikota spaceport. The rocket will launch an advanced earth observation satellite EOS-N1 (codenamed ‘Anvesha’), another ‘eye in the sky’ that will boost India’s surveillance powers from space. Besides the primary payload EOS-N1, PSLV will also be carrying an European demonstrator satellite and 17 other satellites belonging to Indian and foreign agencies.EOS-N1 is a hyperspectral imaging satellite developed primarily for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). It is capable of “seeing” in hundreds of wavelengths to identify materials on the ground—making it a high-priority asset for national security and surveillance. It will help India secure its borders because of its advanced remote sensing capabilities and will also be used in various fields such as agriculture, urban mapping and environmental observation.Besides EOS-N1, 18 secondary payloads, including Europe’s Kestrel Initial Demonstrator (KID), will piggyback on the primary satellite and will be placed in space. The KID mission will feature an experimental re-entry of a small capsule in collaboration with a Spanish startup, with a planned splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean.Other secondary payloads are cubesats from Indian startups and universities, including OrbitAID's AayulSAT, CV Raman Global University's CGUSAT-1, Dhruva Space’s DA-1, Space Kidz India’s SR-2, Assam Don Bosco University’s Lachit-1, Akshath Aerospace’s Solaras-S4 and Dayanand Sagar University’s DSAT-1.Bengaluru-based space startup OrbitAID Aerospace is set to make history with AayulSAT, India’s first on-orbit satellite refuelling payload. AayulSAT aims to extend satellite lifespans by enabling refuelling and servicing in orbit, addressing space debris and sustainability challenges.The upcoming PSLVC62 mission is also seen as a comeback for the PSLV programme following the earlier setback with PSLV-C61 in May 2025. The earlier PSLV-C61 mission had failed to launch EOS-09 earth observation satellite due to a technical issue in the rocket's third stage, specifically a drop in chamber pressure, preventing the satellite from reaching its intended sun-synchronous polar orbit. While the first two stages performed normally, the anomaly in the third stage led to the mission failure.","Isro will usher in the new year with the first launch of 2026 — PSLV C62 mission. The rocket will launch an advanced earth observation satellite EOS-N1 (codenamed ‘Anvesha’), another ‘eye in the sky’ that will boost India’s surveillance powers from space. PSLV will also be carrying 17 other satellites belonging to Indian and foreign agencies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126405806,imgsize-712306,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2026-01-08t084557524.jpg"

Nearly 3cr voters struck off as UP draft rolls published; those left out have till Feb 6 to file objection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nearly-3cr-voters-struck-off-as-up-draft-rolls-published-those-left-out-have-till-feb-6-to-file-objection/articleshow/126384323.cms,"Owaisi Calls SIR a ‘Backdoor NRC’ in Lok Sabha, Warns of Selective Religious Disenfranchisement

NEW DELHI: About 2.9 crore electors, making up 18.7% of Uttar Pradesh’s 15.4 crore electorate as it stood at the launch of special intensive revision (SIR) in the state on Oct 27, 2025, have been struck off the state’s draft electoral roll published on Tuesday.UP’s draft electoral roll published following the enumeration phase of SIR-Phase 2 lists over 12.5 crore electors; while deleting 46.2 lakh (2.99%) on account of being deceased; 2.17 crore (14.1%) for having permanently shifted or found untraceable or absent during visits by the booth level officers (BLOs); and 25.5 lakh (1.6%) for being enrolled at multiple places.Sources further indicated that while the percentage of electors found permanently shifted from their polling areas in UP is around 8.4%, those marked as untraceable or absent are over 5.1%. An official said the higher rate of permanently shifted electors in UP (8.4%), as compared to Bihar (4.6%) may not be surprising, citing a Down to Earth survey from 2021 that put the overall migration rate for UP at around 28.4% as against 14.2% for Bihar. District-wise draft electoral rolls published on Tuesday show that Lucknow recorded the highest rate of deletions of permanently shifted electors (13.4%), followed by Ghaziabad (12.7%) and Meerut (11.6%).As per district-wise draft voter lists, the percentage of overall deletions in 22 of UP's 75 districts exceeds the state's average 18.7% deletions. These districts include Lucknow (with over 30% deletions), Ghaziabad (28.8%), Balrampur (almost 26%) and Kanpur Nagar (25.5%); the exclusions in the four districts amount to more than one-fourth of their total electorate as it stood on Oct 27, 2025. Meerut has recorded the least deletions at 9.9%, followed by Hamirpur at 10.8%. A study of deletions however shows no pattern on lines like the religious composition of districts or proximity to the international border.A statement put out by the UP chief electoral officer (CEO) on Tuesday explained that the BLOs did not find the ‘deleted’ electors or did not get back their enumeration forms because they “have shifted permanently to somewhere else from their previous place of residence; were found missing or absent from the concerned polling area, or somehow did not submit the form, till Dec 26, 2025”.The statement however added that genuine electors excluded from the draft roll can still be added back during the claims and objection period from Jan 6 to Feb 6, 2026 by filling up Form-6 along with the declaration form and submitting relevant documents to prove their eligibility.“The name of the electors found enrolled at multiple places in electoral rolls will be retained only at one place,” said the UP CEO.The notice period, covering hearings and verification, will stretch from Jan 6 to Feb 27, 2026, followed by publication of the final electoral roll of the state on March 6, 2026.Electors wanting to check the names in UP draft electoral roll may refer to the copy available with local BLO or visit the ECINet app or website of the UP CEO or ECI.Meanwhile, young electors who have attained 18 years of age on or before 01.01.2026 are being encouraged to apply through Form-6 along with the prescribed declaration form and relevant documents. So far 15.8 lakh Form 6 (with or without declaration) have been collected across UP for inclusion of new electors.Booth-level lists of electors reported as deceased, permanently migrated, untraceable, or whose forms were not received have already been shared with the parties’ booth level agents (BLAs) for verification. Printed and digital booth-wise copies have been provided to all recognised parties and also made available on the CEO’s website.The entire election machinery, supported by volunteers, is assisting electors, particularly senior citizens, persons with disabilities and vulnerable groups.As per Para 5(b) of SIR guidelines, no name shall be deleted from the draft roll without notice and a speaking order by the electoral registration officer (ERO)/Assistant ERO. Any aggrieved elector may seek redressal through a two-stage appeal process, first by approaching the district magistrate and finally the state CEO.EC on Tuesday reiterated “its firm commitment to a transparent, participative and inclusive revision process, ensuring that no eligible elector is left out and no ineligible name remains in the electoral roll”.EC is undertaking SIR exercise in UP, along with others 11 states/UTs covered in Phase 2. ""with full transparency at every stage of the process,” said a spokesperson.A total of 12.5 crore of UP’s 15.4 crore of electors submitted their enumeration forms till the last date of enumeration period i.e., 26.12.2025 “reflecting an overwhelming participation in the first leg of SIR,” UP CEO office said on Tuesday.It attributed the successful completion of enumeration phase to the coordinated efforts of district election officers (DEOs) of all 75 districts, 403 EROs, 2,042 AEROs (AEROs) and BLOs deployed at over 1.6 lakh polling booths, supported by volunteers. Field representatives of all recognised political parties, including their district presidents and 5.7 lakh BLAs, also played their part.To ensure universal awareness and participation during the enumeration period, the state CEO, DEOs and EROs conducted extensive awareness campaigns and held multiple meetings with political parties to explain the process and share the progress updates. BLOs conducted booth-level meetings with BLAs, who were allowed to file up to 50 enumeration forms per day to ensure their active involvement in SIR.BLOs carried out house-to-house visits to all electors whose names were in the electoral roll as on 27.10.2025 to distribute enumeration forms, followed by at least three visits for collection.",UP’s draft electoral roll published following the enumeration phase of SIR-Phase 2 lists over 12.5 crore electors.

A year ago, the rate stood significantly higher at 6.93%, Freddie Mac said.Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, often favoured by homeowners refinancing their loans, also moved up marginally to 5.46% from 5.44% a week earlier. The rate averaged 6.14% during the same period last year.Mortgage rates are shaped by a range of factors, including Federal Reserve policy signals, inflation expectations and movements in the bond market. They tend to track the 10-year US Treasury yield, which was at 4.17% around midday on Thursday.Rates have largely stabilised in recent weeks after easing from late October, when the 30-year mortgage rate dipped to 6.17%, then its lowest level in over a year. The decline followed expectations of US Federal Reserve rate cuts, which began in September and continued last month.Although the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its interest rate decisions can influence investor behaviour. Rate cuts often signal slowing growth or easing inflation, prompting demand for US government bonds and pushing down long-term yields, which in turn can lower mortgage rates.Overall, the average 30-year mortgage rate ended last year nearly a percentage point lower than at the start of 2025, helping improve purchasing power for some buyers toward the end of the year. Sales of previously owned US homes rose month-on-month in September, October and November.However, November sales were lower than a year earlier — the first such decline since May — and the market is on track to finish the year below 2024 levels. Data on December existing home sales are due next week.Lower mortgage rates have offered some relief to buyers who can afford current prices. The median monthly US housing payment fell to $2,365 in the four weeks ended January 4, down 4.7% from a year earlier, according to Redfin.Despite this, housing affordability remains a major hurdle, especially for first-time buyers, due to years of rising home prices and modest wage growth. Economic and job market uncertainty has also kept many potential buyers on the sidelines.Economists broadly expect the average 30-year mortgage rate to hover slightly above 6% through the year, suggesting borrowing costs are unlikely to fall sharply in the near term.","The average long-term mortgage rate rose to 6.16% this week from 6.15% last week.

Trump tariff trial: What happens if US duties are struck down? Traders 'worried' for $150 billion refunds possibility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-tariff-trial-what-happens-if-us-duties-are-struck-down-traders-worried-for-150-billion-refunds-possibility/articleshow/126426102.cms,"Trump Clears Russia Sanctions Bill, 500% Tariff Threat Looms As India Reworks Oil Import Strategy

What tariff refunds are the stakeholders expecting?

'Not guaranteed a refund'

The ongoing Supreme Court trial on US President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose global tariffs has left companies, customs brokers and trade lawyers preparing for a potentially prolonged battle over refunds that could total close to $150 billion.The court is expected to issue rulings on Friday, though it has not specified which cases will be decided. The challenge revolces around Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, a statute historically used to sanction foreign adversaries or freeze assets, to levy tariffs, according to Reuters. Trump is the first US president to apply the law for this purpose.Scepticism among both conservative and liberal justices during November’s oral arguments has fuelled expectations that the tariffs may be struck down, with questions raised over whether IEEPA grants the authority to impose such duties.Between February 4 and December 14, tariffs imposed under the emergency law generated an estimated $133.5 billion in collections, based on US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data. Using average daily collections from late September to mid-December, Reuters estimated the total has since climbed towards $150 billion.Customs officials have made a recent technical change that has raised cautious optimism among importers.On January 2, CBP announced that tariff refunds would move entirely to electronic distribution through its ACE portal from February 6. While this stops short of a fully automated system, it suggests administrative readiness.“It does kind of signal that Customs is fully prepared to move forward with refunds, if the Supreme Court does, in fact, rule that way,” said Angela Lewis, global head of customs at logistics firm Flexport.CBP did not respond to questions on how it would handle an adverse ruling but said eliminating paper cheques would speed up payments and reduce fraud and errors. The US Treasury, which routinely processes hundreds of billions of dollars in tax refunds annually, also declined to comment on how tariff refunds would be managed.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the outcome of the case could be unclear but indicated that any loss of tariff revenue could be offset through other legal authorities. Speaking in Minneapolis, he said a ruling against Trump’s tariffs would mean “the president loses flexibility to use tariffs, both for national security, for negotiating leverage.”Trump introduced the IEEPA tariffs through two separate actions. In April, he announced “reciprocal” tariffs on imports from most US trading partners, citing a national emergency linked to trade deficits. Earlier, in February and March, tariffs were imposed on China, Canada and Mexico over fentanyl trafficking and illicit drugs, according to Reuters.Legal experts say the refund process will depend heavily on whether the Supreme Court provides explicit instructions or sends the issue back to a lower court, most likely the Court of International Trade. Under US rules, importers typically have 314 days to amend entries before they are “liquidated”, after which refunds are barred, a deadline that has already passed for some Chinese imports affected in February 2025.Despite the scale of potential repayments, companies fear that even a ruling against the tariffs will not automatically translate into refunds.“It's not in the government's DNA to give back money. And Trump would not want to give back money,” said Jim Estill, chief executive of Danby Appliances. The Canadian firm sells refrigerators, microwaves and laundry equipment through major US retailers, including Home Depot, and sources products from China and other Asian countries affected by the tariffs. Estill said Danby has paid about $7 million in duties and warned that recovering the money could trigger disputes further down the supply chain. “It's just going to be a dog's breakfast,” he said.To protect their positions, several companies have taken pre-emptive legal action against CBP. Costco said in court filings that even if the tariffs are ruled unlawful, importers “are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs” without judicial intervention. Similar lawsuits have been filed by Bumble Bee Foods, Revlon, EssilorLuxottica, Kawasaki Motors and Yokohama Tire, Reuters reported.Some smaller businesses are opting out of the wait entirely, selling their refund claims to hedge funds at steep discounts in a fast-growing secondary market. Toymaker Kids2 said it received 23 cents on the dollar for reciprocal tariffs and just nine cents for those tied to fentanyl-related duties.Jay Foreman, chief executive of Basic Fun!, which sells Tonka trucks, Care Bears and K’Nex toys, said he doubts the company will recover the $6 million it paid in tariffs ahead of the Christmas sales season. He expects the administration to “obfuscate or delay” payments even if refunds are ordered. While he has not sold the claim, he said he would consider it if it meant faster repayment.“The last thing the American public wants to know is a bunch of slick Wall Street or predatory-lender types will come and make a fortune off all this,” Foreman said.Advisers are urging companies to act quickly and keep detailed documentation. Pete Mento, a trade advisory director at Baker Tilly, said firms will likely need to demonstrate they paid IEEPA-based duties before any refund is issued. “The people that get their claims in early and have them done correctly are the ones who are going to reap the benefits the fastest,” he said. “And, knowing the way the processes work in Washington, it could be years before you see that money. ”","Supreme Court trial on US President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose global tariffs has left companies, customs brokers and trade lawyers preparing for a potentially prolonged battle.

When Amazon founder Jeff Bezos agreed that AI is in an 'industrial bubble' with investors who ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-agreed-that-ai-is-in-an-industrial-bubble-with-investors-who-/articleshow/126354742.cms,"‘AI is for real’



Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ However, he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

Gold February futures on MCX are trading near ₹1,37,800 after a sharp pullback from higher levels. The recent recovery attempt appears corrective in nature, with price facing strong resistance near the previous breakdown zone. Technical indicators suggest that upside momentum is losing steam, making higher levels vulnerable to fresh selling pressure. The intraday setup favors a sell-on-rise approach in the ₹1,37,800–₹1,38,000 range.Prices are trading below the short-term EMA cluster, with EMA 8 failing to sustain above EMA 21. This indicates weak short-term structure and suggests that rallies are likely to be sold into rather than extended.Gold has moved back toward the mid-Bollinger band after testing lower levels, but the upper band near ₹1,38,000 continues to act as a firm resistance. This positioning supports the view of capped upside in the near term.• Resistance Zone: ₹1,37,800 – ₹1,38,000• Support Levels: ₹1,36,800 followed by ₹1,36,400Failure to sustain above pivot resistance keeps the intraday bias tilted to the downside.RSI is around 60, indicating a short-term recovery but not strong enough to confirm trend reversal. This level often precedes consolidation or pullback when price approaches resistance.MACD has shown a brief positive crossover, but histogram bars are flattening, signaling waning bullish momentum. This increases the probability of a rollover from higher levels.The recovery has been accompanied by moderate volume, while open interest remains soft, hinting that the move lacks strong long buildup and is prone to reversal.• Strategy: Sell on rise• Sell Zone: ₹1,37,800 – ₹1,38,000• Stop-Loss: ₹1,39,100• Downside Target: ₹1,36,400• Bias: Bearish below ₹1,38,000; strength only above ₹1,39,100.Gold’s intraday technical structure remains vulnerable as prices trade below key moving averages and momentum indicators fail to confirm sustained strength. The resistance band near ₹1,38,000 is likely to attract selling pressure. Traders are advised to sell on rise around ₹1,37,800–₹1,38,000, keep a strict stop-loss at ₹1,39,100, and look for a move toward ₹1,36,400 during the session.","Gold price rally appears to be losing steam for now, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

Q. When does the ETA requirement become compulsory?

Q. What should UK visa holders using physical documents or expired BRP cards do?

Q. What must travellers with an existing e-visa do before travelling?





Planning a trip to the United Kingdom from the UAE will soon require more than just a passport and ticket. Emirates has warned travellers that the UK is rolling out major changes to its immigration system, and missing a new digital requirement could mean being denied boarding altogether.Dubai-based Emirates has issued an official advisory for UAE residents traveling to the United Kingdom, urging them to familiarize themselves with new British entry requirements as the country transitions to a fully digital immigration system.According to the airline, the UK authorities are replacing physical immigration documents with electronic visas, known as e-visas, and introducing the Electronic Travel Authorisation, or ETA. The ETA is a digital permission to travel and will be mandatory for certain visitors who previously did not require a visa.These changes apply across multiple traveller categories and are being phased in ahead of a firm enforcement deadline.Emirates clarified that travellers who do not need a visa for short stays in the UK of up to six months will now need to obtain an Electronic Travel Authorisation.Passengers can check whether they need an ETA and apply through the official UK government website at www.gov.uk/electronic-travel-authorisation.The airline highlighted a critical date tied to this requirement. From February 25, 2026, eligible visitors who do not hold a valid ETA will not be allowed to board their transport and will not be able to legally travel to the United Kingdom.Emirates strongly advised customers to apply well in advance of their flight date to avoid disruptions at the airport.The advisory also targets travellers who already hold UK visas but rely on physical documents to prove their immigration status.According to Emirates, passengers who use paper immigration documents, or those who have an expired biometric residence permit (BRP) or biometric residence card (BCP), must take immediate steps to access their digital immigration status.These travellers are required to create an account with UK Visas and Immigration to convert their status to an eVisa.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Seoul, in particular, hit several record highs this week, driven by optimism in the tech sector and corporate earnings.Attention is now focused on the US non-farm payrolls report, due later in the day, which could influence the Federal Reserve’s next policy move. The central bank had indicated last month that it might pause its rate-cutting cycle after three consecutive reductions. Analysts have said that a sharp miss to the downside could revive speculation of another cut, while a larger-than-expected gain could reduce such expectations.Wall Street ended Thursday mixed, with traders seemingly shifting focus from technology, which led last year’s rally to multiple record highs, to smaller-cap stocks.Investors are also closely watching the Supreme Court case examining the legality of Trump’s sweeping tariffs. The court is set to decide whether the White House could implement the measures under economic emergency powers and, if not, whether companies should be reimbursed for duties paid. A ruling against the government could have major implications for its economic and fiscal plans.Meanwhile, oil prices extended gains following a more than three percent rally on Thursday. Markets reacted to Trump’s warning that Iran would be hit ""very hard"" if it targeted protesters amid ongoing civil unrest tied to an economic crisis.

BENGALURU: Bengaluru retained its No. 1 position as the top city for women in India, reaffirming its leadership in creating a balanced ecosystem across social and industrial dimensions. Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad and Mumbai completed the top 5, workplace consulting firm Avtar's Top Cities for Women in India (TCWI) 2025 report showed.Gurugram stood out among the top 10, climbing to No. 6 from No. 9 last year, driven largely by gains in industrial inclusion. The 2025 edition of TCWI covered 125 cities and drew comparisons with previous editions since the year 2022.The report tracked women's inclusion across Indian cities through a longitudinal index covering participation, safety and career continuity. Cities were ranked based on the City Inclusion Score (CIS), derived from two parameters: Social Inclusion Score (SIS) and Industrial Inclusion Score (IIS). The SIS measured a city's liveability, safety, women's representation in employment, and broader indicators of women's empowerment. The IIS evaluated the extent to which organisations across industries were inclusive of women, reflecting workplace participation and representation, the presence of women-friendly industries, and career enablers provided by employers.Bengaluru led with a CIS of 53.2, driven by sustained strength in industrial inclusion and career enablement. Chennai ranked second with a CIS of 49.8, continuing to excel in social inclusion, particularly in safety, public services, mobility, and access to health and education. Pune (46.2), Hyderabad (46), and Mumbai (44.4) completed the top 5, showing consistent performance across both social and industrial parameters. The report said that Bengaluru's ease of living for women is driven by an employment-first design supported by strong safety and skilling infrastructure.Women help desks, tech-enabled and community policing reduced response times, lowering risks linked to commuting and late working hours, while NGO-led street-lighting audits improved public space safety.Key Findings of the Top Cities for Women in India 2025 report:- Bengaluru retains its position as the top city for women in India in 2025, with a City Inclusion Score of 53.29, reflecting sustained strength in Industrial Inclusion and career enablement.- Chennai follows in second position with a City Inclusion Score of 49.86, while continuing to lead on social inclusion parameters such as safety mechanisms, public services, mobility initiatives and access to health and education.- Pune (46.27), Hyderabad (46.04), and Mumbai (44.49) complete the top five, demonstrating consistent performance across both social and industrial inclusion indicators.- Gurugram records one of the most notable upward movements, strengthening its position in 2025 compared to 2024, supported by rapid industrial growth and strong corporate presence (Rank no. 6 in 2025 compared to No. 9 in 2024).- Delhi, Gurugram, and Noida perform strongly on industrial inclusion but lag on social indicators such as safety, affordability, and mobility, reinforcing that industrial growth alone does not ensure inclusive urban environments.- Thiruvananthapuram, Shimla and Tiruchirappalli demonstrate strong social inclusion outcomes but limited industrial depth, pointing to constraints in local economic mobility for women and limitations in large-scale formal employment opportunities for women despite strong social foundations.- Hyderabad, Kolkata and Pune stand out for fairly balanced inclusion profiles, with strong alignment between social inclusion and industrial ecosystems, enabling sustained workforce participation for women.- Mumbai shows strong industrial inclusion (with an IIS of 69.00) but relatively weaker social inclusion (with a SIS of 38.44), highlighting challenges around affordability and access to infrastructure despite abundant employment opportunities.- The 2025 TCWI rankings show increased representation of Tier-2 cities among higher ranks, indicating decentralisation of women-friendly urban ecosystems.- The Southern region emerges as the most inclusive, recording the highest scores across all three indices, with a regional average CIS of 21.60, SIS of 27.81, and an IIS of 11.61, reflecting a more integrated approach to social infrastructure, safety, health, education, and industrial participation for women.- The Western region follows closely, demonstrating consistently strong performance with a regional average CIS of 20.00, SIS of 25.47, and the highest IIS among regions at 12.01, indicating relatively mature industrial ecosystems supported by enabling social conditions.- Central and Eastern regions trail across both inclusion dimensions - social and industrial - especially industrial inclusion, with regional average IIS scores of 4.96 and 4.40, respectively.Across 2022-2025, cities achieving convergence between Industrial Inclusion (IIS) and Social Inclusion (SIS) consistently rank higher on overall City Inclusion (CIS), reinforcing that industrial growth is most effective when supported by safe, accessible, and equitable urban environments.","Bengaluru retained its No. 1 position as the top city for women in India.

Stock market today: Indian equity benchmarks, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , rose in trade on Friday after days of fall. While Nifty50 was above 25,900, BSE Sensex was up almost 150 points. At 9:17 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,922.45, up 46 points or 0.18%. BSE Sensex was at 84,327.52, up 147 points or 0.17%.Analysts believe that Indian equities are likely to face continued pressure in the near term as investors remain wary of potential tariff actions by the Donald Trump administration, persistent geopolitical risks and subdued cues from global markets.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “After the sharp correction yesterday triggered by the possibility of about 500 % tariff on India under the provisions of the Russia Sanctioning Act approved by President Trump, the market will be focused on the verdict expected today from the US Supreme Court on the legality of Trump tariffs. There is a high probability of the verdict going against Trump. But the details are significant: that is, whether it would be a partial striking down of the tariffs or completely declaring the tariffs illegal. The market reaction would depend on the details. If the Supreme Court declares Trump tariffs illegal, there would be a rally in India since India has been the worst affected by the 50% tariffs.”“In the sharp market pull back this week even stocks which will not be impacted by any draconian action by Trump have been affected.Segments like financials, consumer discretionary and industrials that have corrected due to the overall market weakness can be accumulated now for long-term investment.""Overnight, US stocks closed on a mixed note. Technology shares, including Nvidia, came under selling pressure, while defence stocks advanced after President Donald Trump called for a significantly higher military budget of $1.5 trillion.Asian markets opened marginally higher on Friday, recovering after a two-day decline, as investors positioned themselves ahead of the US non-farm payrolls data and awaited a possible Supreme Court ruling related to President Donald Trump’s tariff measures.Investor flows reflected caution, with foreign portfolio investors selling equities worth Rs 3,367 crore on Thursday, according to provisional data. Domestic institutional investors, however, provided support by purchasing shares worth Rs 3,701 crore.","Nifty50 was above 25,900, BSE Sensex was up almost 150 points.
