PM Modi takes oath for 3rd time: Politics behind the Cabinet picks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-takes-oath-for-3rd-time-politics-behind-the-cabinet-picks/articleshow/110857733.cms,"1. BJP is boss:

NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi was, on Sunday, sworn in as prime minister for the third time, equalling Jawaharlal Nehru ’s record of three straight terms in the top office. With 72 members including him, Modi’s latest team is bigger than the previous two, and, contrary to speculation, he had little difficulty in putting together the council of ministers despite leading a coalition govt. TDP and JD (U), in particular, chose not to haggle, as was generally expected after voters denied BJP an absolute majority.Key messages from Modi’s first coalition government :Short of a majority, needing allies , Modi chose to signal the new govt is still his govt, not one created by bargain-hunting allies. Not just the top cabinet jobs — home, ﬁnance, defence, foreign affairs — BJP will likely retain most heavyweight ministries.One reason TDP and JDU didn’t push a hard bargain was that Naidu and Nitish decided ﬁghts with BJP over ministries weren’t worth it if in return they can extract more govt cash for their states, even if Bihar, Andhra don’t get special category status.At least to begin with, allies going along with BJP’s dominance of key jobs means the govt can function without too many disruptions and policy reversals typical of other coalition regimes.Of course, PMO will call the shots. But the inclusion of six former chief ministers will bring administrative and policymaking experience to the council of ministers, especially since several of them have helmed big, complicated states.Three states —Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand — face polls this year. Ministers from Haryana signal BJP intends to stay with the same social engineering formula that helped it build a non-Jat coalition. That Praful Patel’s comments on not taking up a ministerial post were made in the presence of BJP netas reﬂects NDA’s keenness to keep the Maharashtra alliance intact. And picks from Jharkhand point to BJP’s strategy of shoring up non-tribal groups.Modi’s third govt will begin with not a single Muslim minister. This may change later. But as of now, a council of ministers without any Muslims may be read by some in the context of the community’s near-total support for the opposition in the elections.That Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani were both among invitees shows Modi isn’t keeping these billionaires away just because the opposition made ‘crony capitalism’ a big campaign theme. And the sizeable presence of Hindu civil society groups means concessions, if any, on BJP’s core Hindutva agenda will be minor.","With 72 members including him, Modi’s latest team is bigger than the previous two.

Kerala had lowest at 6.6%.When it comes to percentage share of rice in total consumption of cereals, Assam was at 95.9%, followed by Andhra Pradesh and Chattisgarh at 92.2%, Telangana at 92.1% and Odisha at 90.7%.

""As incomes go up, cereal consumption goes down and more of proteins milk, meat and eggs and fruits and vegetables are consumed,"" said Ashok Gulati, Infosys chair professor of agriculture at economic think tank ICRIER, highlighting the steady rise in incomes over the years which has helped income inequality to dip across the country.For wheat the highest consumption was Haryana at 88.6%, Punjab 87.5% and Rajasthan at 84.8%. The lowest was in Assam at 4%, followed by Telangana at 5%, Tamil Nadu at 7.2%, Chhattisgarh at 7.8% and Odisha at 8.4%.

This measure serves as an indicator of the household's level of living.The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) has been conducting household surveys across the country on consumption expenditure at regular intervals as part of its rounds, normally of one-year duration.Information in the survey was collected from 8,723 villages and 6,115 urban blocks spread over the entire country covering 2,61,746 households (1,55,014 in rural areas and 1,06,732 in urban areas) and it is useful for understanding the consumption pattern, standard of living and hence, well-being of the households.","The share of cereals in total expenditure in rural India varies from 3% in Haryana, Kerala and Punjab to 7% in Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.

67 students scoring a perfect 720 in NEET-UG 2024 raises doubts; six have seat numbers from same sequence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/67-students-scoring-a-perfect-720-in-neet-ug-2024-raises-doubts-six-have-seat-numbers-from-same-sequence/articleshow/110752235.cms,"MUMBAI: The NEET-UG 2024 results, announced on Tuesday, have taken several students by surprise. A day after, students and parents have raised objections over an unprecedented numbers of students, 67, bagging the perfect score - 720 out of 720 - also other discrepancies in the statement issued by the agency.Of the total students bagging full marks, six have seat numbers from the same sequence and are from Haryana, indicating the chance of them being from a same centre.Parents, in letters to the National Testing Agency ( NTA ), are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results before the counselling commences.Scorecards of students scoring 718 and 719 are also being circulated on social media, which parents claim is impossible to achieve in the paper, when each NEET question carries four marks and one mark each is given for negative marking.The NTA, in a statement, said that they received few representations and court cases from NEET candidates raising concerns of loss of time during the exam held on May 5.""Such cases/representations were considered by NTA and the normalisation formula, which has been devised and adopted by the apex court in a judgement from 2018, to address the loss of time faced by candidates. The loss of time was ascertained and such candidates were compensated with grace marks. So their marks can be 718 or 719 too,"" said the statement.Parent representative Ruiee Kapoor said that the explanation provided by the NTA is not satisfactory as a score of 718 or 719 is technically improbable. ""Also 67 students scoring full marks is unprecedented in NEET-UG and highly unusual. There is also bunching of students with higher marks, which has led to a major discrepancy in the marks and their corresponding marks. At the same scores, the corresponding ranks have gone up by three to four times. While the overall cut-off has also risen from 137 to 164, students even with 720 marks will find it difficult to get a seat in AIIMS Delhi-a sought-after institute,"" said Kapoor, adding that MBBS admissions closed at rank 57 in the open merit last year in the institute.An NTA official said that more students scored higher marks due to the normalisation process and also because the physics and chemistry sections were relatively easier and as per NCERT books. This was done to address equity and also to discourage coaching mafia, said the official.Another parent claimed that the provision of grace marks due to waste of time should have been specified in the information brochure, as students could have utilised it in the past. Sachin Bangad, a parent representative, said, the exam was ""managed"".""How is that six students who scored full 720 marks are from the same exam centre in Faridabad, Haryana,"" he asked. A senior NTA official reasoned this to the fact that in this particular exam centre in Haryana, ""there was incorrect distribution of papers and they lost 45 minutes. When it was corrected, a formula as per previous court order was used in a few cities including this.""Experts including faculty doctors have demanded an explanation of the normalization criteria of NEET results at how many centers was the normalization applied. Parents said the significantly high cut-off have put off many candidates who were aspiring for joining government medical colleges.""Students scoring less than 660 marks now have a very poor chance of securing admission to government medical colleges,"" said Bangad. This is in contrast to the previous year, where students with 600 marks were able to secure seats in government colleges.","Parents are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results.

IndiGo plane hits runway even as Air India aircraft was taking off; DGCA orders probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/indigo-plane-hits-runway-even-as-air-india-aircraft-was-taking-off-dgca-orders-probe/articleshow/110854061.cms,"MUMBAI: In a close call at Mumbai airport on Saturday, an IndiGo aircraft descended on the runway, touching down even as an Air India flight was taking off, breaching the safety margin. The Air India plane lifted off a split second before the IndiGo jet touched down about 2,100 feet behind, said sources.At the busy Mumbai airport, which operates with one runway, the norm is that the aircraft taking off should lift off and cross the end of the strip before the aircraft landing can cross the beginning and proceed to touch down.The incident, captured by plane spotters, showed the two aircraft, one behind the other, on the runway. On Sunday, the footage went viral on social media, prompting DGCA to initiate an investigation. From the angle the footage was recorded, the aircraft appeared dangerously close.The investigation will primarily look into the sequence of events that led to the breach of separation, the safety margin, between the two A320Neo aircraft, one operated by AI as AI-657 from Mumbai to Thiruvananthapuram and the other, an IndiGo flight 6E5053 from Indore to Mumbai.The runway meet-up of both these flights occurred around 6.20am. The air traffic controller concerned has been derostered from duty to allow for the investigation.""The AI aircraft was cleared by the air traffic control (ATC) to enter the runway and subsequently cleared for take-off. The AI aircraft continued with the take-off movement in accordance with laid down procedures,"" said AI in a statement.The IndiGo flight from Indore was given landing clearance by ATC, a spokesman for the airline said. ""The pilot in command continued the approach and landing and followed ATC instructions,"" IndiGo said.Though both airlines said their commanders merely followed ATC instructions, pilots and controllers TOI spoke to highlighted the role played by pilots and the system that forces them to operate in a constrained space in heavy traffic.""The domino was triggered by the AI aircraft,"" said air safety expert capt Amit Singh, based on data gathered from Flightradar24. Given the heavy air traffic on the lone runway, aircraft land or take off in a tight, choreographic sequence. The series of events that led to the incident occurred in the 90 seconds after an Iraqi Airways flight took off and the AI aircraft entered the runway for take-off. ""The AI aircraft was slow to take-off after it received the line-up clearance, assuming they received immediate take-off clearance,"" he said. They should have informed ATC, who would have cancelled their take-off clearance.According to the Mumbai airport Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), ""when an aircraft is issued with a take-off clearance after lining up on the runway it shall commence take-off immediately. If the controller observes a delay in aircraft commencing take-off, the take-off clearance will be cancelled and the aircraft shall be instructed to vacate the runway immediately at the nearest taxiway.""The AI aircraft had not lifted off when the IndiGo aircraft crossed the beginning of the runway (runway threshold with piano key markings is further down the line). AIP also provides rules for landings. ""Aircraft shall not land on an occupied runway even if landing clearance is received,"" says the AIP, listing a commander's responsibility. ""Pilot should not hesitate to ask ATC about traffic on the runway. If pilots perceive at any point that it is not safe to continue approach, they must initiate go around,"" it adds.Captain Singh said: ""The question is the degree of responsibility on each of them, the controller and the two pilots and most importantly, the runway infrastructure constraints at the Mumbai airport which puts the controllers and pilots in such situations.,"" he added.","Air India plane lifted off a split second before the IndiGo jet touched down about 2,100 feet behind.

Rail jobs scam: HC orders medical test of Lalu aide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rail-jobs-scam-hc-orders-medical-test-of-lalu-aide/articleshow/110854690.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has ordered the setting up of a medical board to evaluate the condition of RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s close aide Amit Katyal , who sought interim bail on medical grounds in a money laundering case linked to the alleged land-for-jobs scam in the Indian Railways.

HC said while the report from the jail did not indicate any “underlying medical condition,” the accused recently had a bariatric surgery. It, therefore, asked the AIIMS director to constitute a team of doctors from minimum three different specialties to ascertain the nature of ailments Katyal is suffering from.

The court added that after the evaluation of medical records and examination of the accused, the medical board shall furnish a report on or before June 14.

Gen Z teens 'coming out' younger with stronger family support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gen-z-teens-coming-out-younger-with-stronger-family-support/articleshow/110854590.cms,"*Names changed for privacy

Manav* was a typical 14-year-old boy-moody, defiant, with hormones in overdrive and attitude on the rise, when he decided to add the declaration of - ""I'm bisexual "" - to the mix. Initially his parents were taken aback. ""Although my parents are aware of queerness and supportive of the community, it did come as a shock. I used to be moody during those days and they knew something was up but hadn't quite predicted it was going to be this."" Yet, despite their initial confusion and apprehensions, they rallied around him. ""They've been supportive and more careful with their comments now.""For many queer individuals in India, the social pressure of 'coming out' - a metaphor used by LGBTQ+ persons to disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity to friends and family - is already daunting. But Manav's decision to open up to his parents at 14 is just one example of a growing phenomenon of teenagers bravely owning their identities as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender while still a middle grader. What is remarkable is how families and schools are stepping up to guide them through this phase and find acceptance in ways that were once unthinkable.Now 16, Manav's realisation of his queer identity began as he entered his teens. ""I was around 13 or 14 when I started getting drawn to queer literature,"" he recalls. ""The more I read, the more I could relate to queer love stories than heteronormative ones.""A family vacation to Turkey further intensified his feelings. It was June, and the street was buzzing with a Pride Parade. ""Seeing the parade and a subsequent police crackdown was a reality check,"" recalls Manav. ""I felt solidarity with the community."" He says it ""sparked deeper introspection"" and a need to share his truth.Back at home, Manav summoned the courage to come out to his parents and a year later, to most of his friends at school. ""My parents had some questions at first,"" he recounts. ""There were misunderstandings, too, mainly because they weren't fully informed. They also worried about how others would react. But it's been a positive transition for both of us since then."" Coming out to friends had its challenges - ""I faced online bullying, with anonymous hateful comments on my Instagram stories which I learned to shrug off"" - but brought unexpected rewards. ""I've made new friends and moved into new social circles because of my gender identity."" While concrete data on whether kids are self-identifying earlier is scarce, speaking to schools, counsellors, and support groups reveals that teens and, in many cases, preteens as young as six are expressing their gender identity without being dismissed by parents or ridiculed at school.Several social factors may be contributing to this early expression, educators believe. Positive queer portrayals in popular culture have made it safer for young students to open up about their feelings, points out Aachal Jain, pastoral care coordinator at Mumbai's Aditya Birla World Academy (ABWA). ""Students often explore their identities online or through creative outlets before coming out. They can also find a wealth of resources on the subject today, which likely leads them to self-identify and come out earlier,"" she explains.""It's no longer a taboo subject at home, nor in school. I know many like me who felt safe and comfortable coming out to their friends and family at 14 or 15,"" adds Manav, who found solace in his school environment, at Delhi's Tagore International School particularly through Breaking Barriers, a club and support group for the LGBTQ community.Priyanka Randhawa, the project director at Tagore International, knows that discussing identity with family isn't always smooth sailing. ""Sometimes, it's during our outreach activities that they feel comfortable opening up,"" she shares. She encourages students to reflect on what feels right for them personally. ""When students want to dive deeper into their identities, we connect them with LGBTQ support groups and counsellors to ensure their journey is genuine, not just about fitting in or being 'trendy'.""As counsellor and founder of ABWA's Rainbow Club, Jain challenges the idea that coming out as queer is about fitting in or being cool. ""It comes with a lot of backlash and bullying,"" she explains. ""Teenagers may not always have the words to define their feelings, but they know when they're different and are very aware of how the world sees them. It takes real courage to attach a label to themselves.""Jain has observed more 15 and 16-year-olds opening up during their sessions, confidently identifying as gay, demigirl, or pansexual. ""We also had a student who, at 13, revealed herself as bi and later identified as asexual when she was passing out of school. That's how fluid these identities can be,"" Jain explains. ""The key is acceptance - recognising that whatever they're feeling is valid.""Stressing the importance of early parental support, Jain shares a recent case of a six-year-old boy whose parents reached out to her. He wanted to wear lipstick and skirts, and his parents sought advice-not to ""fix"" him, but to create a more gender-neutral environment at home. ""They wanted to help him explore his identity without facing bullying and without negating his feelings,"" she explains. ""Parents making these efforts marks a positive shift.""","A growing number of teens in India are coming out as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.

HC rejects terror convict’s plea for 2 sentences to run together,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-rejects-terror-convicts-plea-for-2-sentences-to-run-together/articleshow/110854349.cms,"NEW DELHI: Noting that terrorism must be dealt with sternly, Delhi HC has rejected the plea of a terror convict seeking merging of two sentences in two different cases.The petitioner pleaded that since he had voluntarily pleaded guilty in both cases, HC should allow his seven-year sentence in a UAPA case for conspiring to establish an IS base in India run “concurrently” with the sentence imposed upon him in another case, wherein he conspired to carry out an attack in Haridwar during the Ardh Kumbh Mela and raised funds for the same. The petitioner said he was a young, poor and illiterate man who had a genuine desire to reform himself, obtain an education and become a productive member of society.Dismissing the petition, Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma emphasised that the offence committed by petitioner Mohsin Ibrahim Sayyed was grave and had impacted national security and communal harmony. “Terrorism not only threatens the national security of the country but also the very fabric of society by targeting innocent civilians and institutions indiscriminately, with an aim to instil fear among the common and innocent citizens of a country,” the court noted in a recent order. “They also result in loss of innocent lives, destruction of property and destabilisation of regions. These impacts are often long-lasting. Thus, the gravity of such crimes lies in their potential to cause widespread harm, both physically and psychologically, and their challenge to fundamental values of peace, tolerance and coexistence in a nation,” it stated.“Since a lenient view has already been taken by trial courts at the stage of sentencing , no further leniency can be granted to the petitioner by allowing concurrent running of sentences... ,” it concluded.","Delhi HC rejects plea of terror convict seeking merging of two sentences in two different cases.

Chief secretary Neerab Kumar made a surprise visit to Amaravati on Sunday and said CM-designate N Chandrababu Naidu had given instructions to fast-track the projects. Amaravati had been a signature initiative of Naidu in his previous term till he was unseated by YSRCP in 2018.

The plan took a further hit after outgoing CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy announced in 2019 a proposal to develop three capitals, puncturing the euphoria around Amaravati and leaving projects idle.He said works would start after the swearing-in ceremony expected later this week.

"India, Pakistan may hold Indus talks this month",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-pak-may-hold-indus-talks-this-month/articleshow/110854226.cms,"NEW DELHI: India may host a Pakistan delegation this month for a meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC) that looks to resolve bilateral issues through dialogue under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan was a notable omission, along with Myanmar, in the Modi 3.0 inauguration guest list that included most other immediate neighbours but the World Bank-backed Indus talks remain ring-fenced from the turbulent nature of ties which have been bereft of any substantive diplomatic engagement in the past 8 years.The 2 countries are currently in touch to finalise the dates for the proposed visit in the third week of this month. Under the 1960 IWT, the 2 sides are required to meet at least once every year, alternately in India and Pakistan. India refuses to engage Pakistan otherwise because of the latter’s support to cross-border terrorism .If the visit happens, the delegation may also travel to J&K for talks related to IWT, which provides a framework for irrigation and hydropower development, allocating the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) to Pakistan and the eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej) to India. As the World Bank says, the Treaty also allows each country certain uses of the rivers allocated to the other.There was a renewed interest in IWT talks last year after India gave a notice to Pakistan for a modification of the Treaty because of the latter’s “intransigence and unilateral actions” on the issue of Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects in J&K. India was upset that despite the World Bank asking both countries to find a mutually agreeable way, instead of seeking separate processes, to address Pakistan's objections to the projects, Islamabad had unilaterally sought a parallel process to address the issue.The World Bank, which is also a signatory to IWT, in October 2022 appointed not just a neutral expert to examine the issue but also, at Pakistan's insistence, a Court of Arbitration chairman, despite acknowledging India's concern that carrying out the two processes concurrently posed practical and legal challenges. The court, which Pakistan claims has been set up under IWT provisions, has been hearing the case in The Hague but India hasn’t participated in it saying this court was illegally constituted.India has instead focused on the meetings convened by the Neutral Expert appointed on India’s request under the aegis of the Treaty.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has reportedly marked Feb 19 to March 9 as the 20-day window for the return of Champions Trophy next year, according to a report on Cricbuzz.

The tournament, which features the eight top teams in ICC's rankings for one-day internationals, was last played in 2017 when Pakistan lifted the trophy beating India in the final.

The report further states that the ICC member boards have been intimated about the proposed dates.

Pakistan is officially the host of the tournament, but the Indian government's reluctance to allow its team to travel to Pakistan for the Champions trophy may turn the event into a hybrid model, similar to the last Asia Cup when India played all their matches in Sri Lanka.

Pakistan, however, have reportedly marked Lahore as the venue for all India matches to cut down on the Indian team's travel and to make it easier for the fans to visit Pakistan from the Wagah border near Amritsar.

A clarity on the Indian government and BCCI 's stance is expected in July when the ICC annual conference will be held in Colombo.

6-time North Goa MP Shripad Naik once again inducted into Union Cabinet as MoS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/6-time-n-goa-mp-shripad-once-again-inducted-into-union-cabinet-as-mos/articleshow/110854196.cms,"s

PANAJI: BJP ’six-time North Goa MP Shripad Naik was sworn in on Sunday as a minister for state in PM Narendra Modi ’s govt. Naik has been a minister in the BJP-led NDA govt since 1999, the year he was first elected as an MP. Naik said that while serving the people of the country, he will give priority to Goa.He is one of the few MPs who has served as a minister both in Modi govt and the previous NDA govt, which was led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee as PM.After being inducted in Modi govt as minister, Naik said the PM has given suggestions on how to function as minister. He said that Goa is always on the mind of PM Modi.“I have got this opportunity because of the blessings of North Goa voters and people of Goa. While I will serve the people of the country, I will also give priority to Goa. Whatever ministry I get, I will work for the country and the state. This is an opportunity to continue to serve the people of the country,” the minister said.Naik won the 2024 Lok Sabha elections with the highest margin of his career, 1.2 lakh votes. Previously, he had the highest winning margin of 1 lakh votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.Naik, known as “bhau” and Bhandari Samaj leader, has become part of political history in Goa by winning six consecutive terms as Lok Sabha MP.He was one of the four BJP candidates who opened the party's account in Goa in the assembly elections in 1994.Naik broke the record jointly held by him and Eduardo Faleiro of five consecutive terms. Faleiro had won the South Goa seat for five terms for Congress. Naik is also one among the five MPs in the current Lok Sabha who have been winning elections for six consecutive terms.Naik who comes from RSS background started his political career in the 1980s. He won his first panchayat election in 1984 and was the sarpanch of Adpai from 1985 to 1994. Naik contested his first assembly election in 1981 from Cumbharjua constituency and lost.

Naik saw the closest fight for Lok Sabha elections in 2009 when he was about to make a hat-trick.All the opposition parties united to defeat Naik, but due to strong organisational support he secured a third term.In his four and half decade political career, Naik served three terms as BJP state president. He was BJP president for two consecutive terms between 1990 to 1995 and his third term was between 2007 to 2009.Chief minister Pramod Sawant along with cabinet colleagues attended the swearing-in ceremony in Delhi.“I congratulate Naik for being inducted as Union minister for state in Union govt and it will benefit the state to a large extent.

Gujarat, with its gleaming skyline and humming factories, is on a relentless journey of urbanization and industrialization. But what’s the fuel propelling this remarkable growth? None other than uninterrupted and affordable power, a non-negotiable cornerstone of progress.A powerhouse of entrepreneurial spirit and innovation, Gujarat is celebrated worldwide for its dynamic manufacturing sector.

Of this, the active capacity is 49,261.8MW, including monitored and online capacities, whereas 5,685.02MW is currently under maintenance.A powerhouse of entrepreneurial spirit and innovation, Gujarat is celebrated worldwide for its dynamic manufacturing sector. At the heart of this bustling hub of industry lies the electric pulse of the state – the power sector. As of June 4, 2024, Gujarat boasts an installed capacity of generating 53,258.39 megawatts (MW) of power, according to data from the National Power Portal. Of this, the active capacity is 49,261.8MW, including monitored and online capacities, whereas 5,685.02MW is currently under maintenance.“The total power demand in Gujarat was 120 billion units in 2023- 24,” the official said. “Industrial power demand is increasing by 8-10% annually while domestic demand grows by about 5% yearly. Agricultural demand has nearly plateaued, expanding at around 2% due to new connections and higher power use. To keep pace with this rising demand, we are planning to boost our power generation capacity,” the official explained.Based on these trends, Gujarat’s energy needs are expected to climb by 7.8 billion units by the end of the 2024-25 fiscal year. Gujarat is capit a l i z i n g o n i t s well-established network of power equipment manufacturers and generation and distribution companies to tackle its expanding energy requirements. The state is also making significant progress in the renewable energy sector, positioning itself to meet future demands efficiently and sustainably.Despite efforts to boost power generation, Gujarat still buys energy, particularly in summer, purchasing 1,000-1,500MW daily from the India Energy Exchange Limited (IEX). This highlights the need to use existing projects better and create new ones.Compared to other Indian states, Gujarat, in fact, is taking the lead in adding renewable energy (RE) capacities. This is clear with the world’s largest RE park coming up in the Khavda area of Kutch, which will see 30,000 MW of fresh green power generation capacities.10GW of renewable energy projects under the Renewable Energy Policy 2023. These include 5GW of solar projects and 5GW of wind and wind-solar hybrid projects, according to the Gujarat Energy Development Agency (GEDA).The state has introduced policies to attract green energy investments and plans to establish 36GW of solar and 143GW of wind energy capacities soon. Gujarat aims to generate 50% of its power from renewable sources by 2030, reflecting its commitment to sustainable energy.Gujarat isn’t just a leader in power generation, it’s also a powerhouse in manufacturing power equipment. The state produces 63% of India’s cables, conductors, transmission towers, and transformers — essential components in the power supply chain. Major manufacturing hubs like Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot, and Valsad are vital players, producing significant amounts of bushings and insulators.Recently, Gujarat’s power equipment sector has seen remarkable growth. “The sector was growing at about 7% until three years ago, but the last three years have witnessed a CAGR of around 15%,” said a power sector expert. Several govt initiatives drive this surge. The Rs 23,200 crore robust scheme aims to lay underground cables over five years to mitigate annual cyclone-related losses estimated at Rs 3,000 crore. States like Odisha and Tamil Nadu, along with Gujarat, are benefiting from this scheme, resulting in substantial orders for Gujarat-based companies.Additionally, the Centre’s revamped distribution sector scheme (RDSS) aims to reduce power loss and strengthen the power distribution network.This initiative, along with the Smart City project, which replaces overhead cables with underground ones in about 675 cities nationwide, promises sustained high demand for power equipment. Over the next five years, Gujarat’s manufacturers are set to benefit significantly from these initiatives.According to a leading cable manufacturer, the Indian wires and cables market reached nearly Rs 1,083.71 billion in 2023. It’s projected to grow at a CAGR of 14.5%, potentially reaching Rs 3,655.81 billion by 2032.Industry estimates indicate that India accounts for 15% of the global transmission tower market. By 2025, India is expected to consume 1.8 trillion units of electricity. The CII reports that Indian govt’s vision for a $5 trillion economy will necessitate an estimated Rs 5 trillion investment in the transmission sector over the coming years. The National Infrastructure Pipeline forecasts a capital expenditure of Rs 3,040 billion in the transmission segment from 2020 to 2025. The transmission tower market, valued at over $17 billion in 2021, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4% from 2022 to 2028, reaching $24 billion by 2028, according to Global Market Insights (GMI).The expansion of the power and infrastructure sectors has driven the market for cables and conductors. As per the Indian Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers’ Association, during 2022- 23, conductor imports stood at Rs 7.97 billion, much lower than exports, which were Rs 55.04 billion during the same period. From 2023-24 (up to June 2023), conductor imports were Rs 1.91 billion, while exports were Rs 15.11 billion.Kavish Shah, vice-president of Diamond Power Infrastructure Ltd, said, “India has seen the fastest infrastructure growth in the last decade. Factors include rapid urbanization, smart cities, policy reforms in the power sector, and growing demand for renewable energy. Innovations in AI and new local data centres will further increase energy demand. Power cables are essential for transmitting and distributing electricity from generators (thermal, solar, and wind-solar plants) to substations and end-user segments such as residential, commercial (airports, metro, hospitals), and industrial units.“This high demand has driven exponential growth in India’s electrical wire and cable industry. Order books are full, and demand will continue to rise in coming quarters.”","As of June 4, 2024, Gujarat boasts an installed capacity of generating 53,258.39 megawatts (MW) Of this, the active capacity is 49,261.8MW, including monitored and online capacities, whereas 5,685.02MW is currently under maintenance.

""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Watch: Sunita Williams dances upon reaching International Space Station after Starliner mission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-sunita-williams-dances-upon-reaching-international-space-station-after-starliner-mission/articleshow/110781478.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Boeing Starliner , piloted by Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore, successfully docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Thursday. This mission marks a historic milestone as Williams becomes the first woman to pilot and test a new crewed spacecraft on its maiden voyage.Upon arrival, Williams celebrated her third trip to the ISS with a joyful dance, a gesture of her excitement and happiness. She was warmly welcomed by the seven astronauts aboard the station, who greeted her and Wilmore with the traditional ringing of a bell. Describing the crew as ""another family,"" Williams expressed her gratitude for the warm reception.After launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, the spacecraft docked with the ISS 26 hours later, despite a one-hour delay due to minor technical issues such as helium leaks. The mission's primary objective was to validate the Boeing Starliner as a viable alternative to the SpaceX Crew Module for ferrying astronauts under NASA's commercial crew program.The astronauts monitored the Starliner as it autonomously navigated a series of maneuvers to dock with the ISS. They also completed crucial tests, including manually flying the spacecraft for the first time in space. During their week-long stay, Williams and Wilmore will assist with tests and conduct scientific experiments.Reflecting on the mission, Williams said, ""It feels like going back home."" She is known for previously carrying an idol of Lord Ganesh and the Bhagavad Gita to space. Before liftoff, Williams, who helped design the Starliner, admitted to some pre-launch nerves but expressed excitement about the spacecraft she had named ""Calypso"" after the ship of the famed French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau.The astronauts' return journey will conclude with a landing on solid ground, unlike previous missions that ended with ocean landings.","The Boeing Starliner successfully docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Thursday.

This groundbreaking find is crucial for understanding how climate change has shaped the landscape over millions of years.The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the University of Arizona , led by geoscientist Dr Stewart Jamieson. ""The Rio Grande is unlike anything we have seen in Antarctica,"" Dr Jamieson said. ""This river system was buried under ice for millions of years and offers a unique window into the past.""The Rio Grande, which rivals some of the world's largest rivers, was identified through satellite imagery and radar data. The river's channels stretch over 680 miles, and it likely played a significant role in transporting water and sediment across the continent during a warmer period in Earth's history, a Newsweek report.The presence of the Rio Grande suggests that Antarctica once had a much milder climate, with conditions that could support flowing water. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the continent's glacial history and indicates that parts of Antarctica may have been ice-free during certain periods.""The implications of this discovery are profound,"" said Dr Jamieson. ""It changes our understanding of the Antarctic ice sheet and its stability. Knowing that such a large river system existed implies that the ice sheet was much smaller than we thought.""The research team plans to conduct further studies to determine the age of the river system and the climatic conditions that allowed it to form. These investigations could provide valuable data for predicting future changes in the Antarctic ice sheet in response toglobal warming .The discovery of the Rio Grande also raises questions about the potential for similar hidden river systems in other parts of Antarctica. ""We are just scratching the surface,"" Dr Jamieson noted. ""There could be other river systems buried beneath the ice, waiting to be discovered.""As climate change continues to impact the polar regions, understanding the history of Antarctica's ice and water systems becomes increasingly important. The findings from the Rio Grande will help scientists develop more accurate models of ice sheet dynamics and sea-level rise.This discovery highlights the importance of continued exploration and research in Antarctica. It underscores the need for international collaboration to uncover the secrets of this remote and largely unexplored continent.","The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the University of Arizona.

US Fed likely to remain on pause and pare back rate cut expectations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-fed-likely-to-remain-on-pause-and-pare-back-rate-cut-expectations/articleshow/110831023.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged this week, but could pare back the number of cuts it has penciled in for this year, as policymakers digest a mixed bag of economic data .Stalled progress against inflation and a robust labor market have pushed many analysts to predict that the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) will not cut interest rates from their current 23-year high before September at the earliest.A September start to cuts would likely increase the gap between the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB), which began easing monetary policy rates last week.""Data released since the last meeting indicate that the threat of price re-acceleration due to strong economic activity has diminished somewhat,"" Wells Fargo economists wrote in a recent note to clients.""However, we share the universal expectation that the FOMC will keep its target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25%-5.50% at the conclusion of its policy meeting on June 12,"" they said.- From three to two? -After two days of debate, the Fed will publish its interest rate decision on Wednesday afternoon and will also update its economic forecasts from March.Most analysts expect the data since March will cause the FOMC's 19 members to lower the number of cuts they expect this year, bringing the median number down from three to two.""At the June FOMC meeting, we see the Fed revising its outlook in favor of slower growth and firmer inflation,"" Bank of America economists wrote in an investor note published Friday.""It should project two rate cuts this year and a cutting cycle that begins in September,"" they said, adding that the FOMC would likely need to see more evidence of disinflation before beginning to cut interest rates.Fed chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly insisted that the Fed is ""data-dependent"" and will not be swayed by politics.Nevertheless, a September start to rate cuts would thrust the Fed into the middle of a fractious presidential campaign between President Joe Biden and his Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has previously questioned the US central bank's independence.- Cutting back -Futures traders see almost no chance of a rate cut before September, according to data from CME Group.In recent days, they have also sharply lowered their expectations of a September cut, assigning a probability of around 50 percent on Friday that the Fed would not start easing monetary policy before November.This marks a dramatic shift from late last year, when the financial markets were pricing in as many as six interest rate cuts for 2024, with the first of them coming as early as March.""At this juncture, there is little reason to think that the FOMC will prioritize downside risks to employment over the much more salient risk of sustained high inflation,"" economists at Barclays wrote in a recent investor note.""As such, this should keep rates on hold for the next few meetings as the FOMC awaits evidence that (will) restore its confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target,"" they said, adding they still expect the Fed to make just one rate cut this year, most likely in December.With the Fed almost certain to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, analysts will closely scrutinize chair Powell's press conference after the decision is announced for any indication of when the first cut could come.But with the data still painting a mixed picture, he is unlikely to rock the boat too much this week, according to Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet.""Powell will stick with the Fed's mantra that monetary policy is flexible and will respond as appropriate,"" he wrote in a recent investor note. ""Therefore, it would be surprising if his presser altered our subjective odds of a cut in September.""","US Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged this week, but could pare back the number of cuts it has penciled in for this year.

Pakistan and IMF disagree over new income tax rates that will burden salaried class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-and-imf-disagree-over-new-income-tax-rates-that-will-burden-salaried-class/articleshow/110836835.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons and the imposition of a standard 18 per cent sales tax on agriculture and health sector goods, according to a media report on Sunday.On Friday, Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) authorities discussed the outstanding issues related to taxation and the energy sector.Citing sources, the Express Tribune newspaper reported that both sides could not resolve their differences on the income tax threshold, the merger of salaried and non-salaried rates and the maximum income tax rate for individuals.Discussions are revolving around whether to charge a new backbreaking 45 per cent income tax from salaried and non-salaried individuals on a monthly income of just over Pakistani Rs 4,67,000, sources said.At present, the maximum rate of 35 per cent applies to a monthly income of over Pakistani Rs 5,00,000.However, both sides have converged on the issue of increasing the income tax burden on exporters in the next budget who paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 86 billion this year, which is 280 per cent less than the taxes paid by the salaried people.Pakistan also showed a willingness to tax pensions beyond a certain income threshold.In the latest talks, the international money lender insisted on merging the slabs related to salaried, non-salaried and other incomes.On the government's proposal of increasing the annual threshold of taxable income to Pakistani Rs 9,00,000, the IMF is asking for the maximum income tax rate to be increased from 35 per cent to 45 per cent.However, the government is unwilling to increase the maximum rate for salaried individuals to 45 per cent but showed flexibility to keep the taxable income threshold at the current Pakistani Rs 6,00,000.It is also asking to keep the salaried and non-salaried slabs separate but is willing to increase the highest tax rate for non-salaried persons to 45 per cent, said the sources.The non-salaried business individuals pay tax after excluding expenses while the salaried persons pay tax on their gross income without excluding the expenses.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is until now unwilling to increase the burden on the salaried class .According to a proposal, if the taxable income threshold is increased to Pakistani Rs 900,000 per annum, the income tax rate can be up to 7.5 per cent on a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 100,000. The current rate is 2.5 per cent for this category.For the next slab, if the monthly income is up to Pakistani Rs 133,000, the under-discussion tax rate is 20 per cent. The current rate is 12.5 per cent, that too for up to a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 200,000.The IMF wants a higher rate at the lower income level. This slab will directly hit Pakistan's middle-income group.At present, on an income of over Pakistani Rs 500,000, a 35 per cent tax rate is charged. The salaried class has until now paid Pakistani Rs 325 billion in income tax in 11 months, which is expected to rise to around Pakistani Rs 360 billion at the end of the current fiscal year.If the revised income tax rates are accepted, the tax contribution of the salaried class will jump to Pakistani Rs 540 billion in the next fiscal year, said the sources. To absorb this increase in the tax rates, even a 30 per cent pay hike will not be sufficient.Sources said that the IMF had asked Pakistan to share alternative proposals, in case it was unwilling to increase the tax burden on the salaried class. Another round of discussions is expected soon.Sources said that an understanding had been reached between Pakistan and the IMF on changing the tax regime for the richest exporters.As against the existing one per cent final income tax on exporters, it has been proposed that from the next fiscal year, the one per cent rate should be treated as a minimum, according to government sources.Pakistan's taxation system promotes inequality and puts a higher burden on people who have little capacity to bear it. The IMF has asked Pakistan to end all special tax regimes, like the low-income tax on gains made by investing in the stock market and bank deposits.The global lender has recommended treating these gains as part of normal income. The IMF is pushing Pakistan to increase the burden on the salaried class until the country recovers higher taxes from the non-salaried business individuals.During the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the exporters paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 85.5 billion in taxes, which was Pakistani Rs 241 billion, or 280 per cent, less than the amount paid by the salaried class.During July-May FY24, the salaried class paid Pakistani Rs 326 billion in taxes, higher by 40 per cent, or Pakistani Rs 93 billion, compared to the same period last year.The record Pakistani Rs 326 billion in tax payments by the salaried class is also 223 per cent more than the combined tax paid by the rich exporters and influential retailers.Sources said that there was also no consensus on slapping the standard 18 per cent sales tax on fertiliser, pesticides and seeds – the crucial inputs for the agriculture sector.The government was also unwilling to impose an 18 per cent sales tax on medicines, solar panels and medical and surgical equipment. In case, the 18 per cent tax is imposed on medicines, there will be an additional collection of Pakistani Rs 130 billion in the next fiscal year.Similarly, taxing the medical and health-related supplies will generate another Pakistani Rs 100 billion, according to the paper.Pakistan urgently needs a new loan from the IMF to keep the fear of default at bay. The government is eager to ink the agreement before the end of June when the fiscal year ends.","Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons. The IMF is asking for the maximum income tax rate to be increased from 35 per cent to 45 per cent. However, the government is unwilling to increase the maximum rate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110839031,imgsize-60334,width-400,resizemode-4/110839031.jpg"

However, after 10 days, the child developed bilateral lower limb weakness, which progressively worsened and eventually affected the upper limbs, as reported by Dawn.He was subsequently admitted to the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) in Karachi, where he was diagnosed with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). Despite medical efforts, the child succumbed to the illness on May 22.Samples collected from three contacts of the victim revealed the presence of the wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in one of the siblings and a cousin residing in the same household. Importantly, there was no history of recent travel to other districts prior to the onset of paralysis, indicating local transmission.Investigations are underway to determine whether the case resulted from vaccine refusal, although records indicate that the child had received five doses of vaccine during supplementary immunisation activities.Malik Mukhtar Bharath, the prime minister's coordinator on national health services, emphasised that until Pakistan achieves polio eradication, children remain vulnerable to this debilitating disease.Muhammad Anwarul Haq, coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, highlighted the ongoing efforts to investigate the source of the virus and identify gaps in vaccination coverage . This includes targeting populations that may have missed out on polio immunisation to prevent further outbreaks.","The case, which occurred on April 29 and was confirmed on June 8, highlights a significant delay of six weeks in diagnosis.

Nepal Parliament approves ratification for framework agreement related to International Solar Alliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-parliament-approves-ratification-for-framework-agreement-related-to-international-solar-alliance/articleshow/110819158.cms,"File Photo (Picture Credit: ANI)

KATHMANDU: Nepal's House of Representatives has passed a proposal seeking ratification of a framework agreement related to the membership of the International Solar Alliance that will help the Himalayan nation increase usage of solar power in its effort to combat the impact due to changing climate. The House of Representatives (HoR), or the Lower House on Thursday endorsed the proposal tabled by minister for energy, water resources and irrigation, Shakti Bahadur Basnet through a majority vote.

The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was conceived as a joint effort by India and France to mobilise efforts against climate change through the deployment of solar energy solutions and announced on the sidelines of the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Paris in 2015.

With the amendment of its Framework Agreement in 2020, all member states of the United Nations are eligible to join the ISA. At present, 119 countries, including Nepal, are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement, of which 98 countries have submitted the necessary instruments of ratification to become full members of the ISA.

Responding to queries raised by lawmakers from various political parties, Basnet said that the agreement was tabled in keeping with the national interest of the country as clean energy is essential for minimising the impacts of climate change.

""The installation of solar energy will be important for Nepal's development,"" he pointed out and informed the House that the government has already moved the process for the generation of 1,000 MW through solar power in the next couple of years.

A competitive bidding for Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) has already started for the same and bidding for PPA of 800 MW has already opened, he added.

Rajendra Khatrichhetri, a lawmaker belonging to opposition Nepali Congress, welcomed the government's move as he said, ""This is a good proposal as it will provide cheap and affordable energy to the general public and also helps to minimise the impacts of climate change.""

Currently, Nepal has 13 projects generating 68.38 MW of solar power, according to Nepal's Energy Development Department. In September 2023, Nepal announced that it plans to develop 30,000 MW of electricity by 2035 and would club hydropower and solar power.","Nepal's House of Representatives has passed a proposal seeking ratification of a framework agreement related to the International Solar Alliance.

LONDON: Global payments processors visa and mastercard must face a new set of lawsuits over fees charged to retailers , after a London tribunal ruled on Friday that collective cases brought on behalf of merchants can proceed.

The two firms already face a long list of lawsuits in London over multilateral interchange fees, which retailers pay when consumers use a card to shop.

Visa and Mastercard are each being sued by hundreds of claimants at London's competition appeal tribunal , which is managing the various cases together.

Special purpose vehicle commercial and interregional card claims brought another set of lawsuits against visa and mastercard in 2022, seeking damages on behalf of merchants who were allegedly overcharged.

The tribunal initially refused to certify its cases under the United Kingdom 's collective proceedings' regime, which is similar to class actions in the United States.

However, the tribunal ruled on Friday that the cases would be certified, subject to any representations by other parties who might have an interest in the cases.

Leicester's Diwali festival under threat as council can't afford the costs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/leicesters-diwali-festival-under-threat-as-council-cant-afford-the-costs/articleshow/110776008.cms,"LONDON: Leicester’s Diwali celebrations — considered to be the largest outside India — could get cancelled as the city council which funds them can no longer afford the massive costs .

The two-day event, which consists of a spectacular switch-on of 6,000 LED lights shaped as diyas, on the Golden Mile and stage performances, fair rides and fireworks two weeks before Diwali, and then another event, including live music and a lantern procession on Diwali Day, costs Leicester city council £250,000 (Rs 2.6 crore).

Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby now says the £250,000 price tag is “unsustainable”. This has triggered Conservative Leicester East candidate Shivani Raja and former MP Keith Vaz to start petitions to the council calling for the celebrations, which attract over 40,000 people and benefit local businesses, to be saved.

A city council spokesperson said: “We recently met with members of the Leicester Hindu Festival Council and local ward councillors to advise them that funding for all of the council’s festivals and events is under review, owing to huge pressures on the council’s finances. Having announced last Sep that funding two events for Diwali was no longer sustainable, we’re now reviewing whether we can support even one event – which would cost £130k — without significant funding from elsewhere. It’s important to emphasise that no decisions have yet been made, but we wanted to be open with our partners while there’s still time to explore possible sources of alternative funding.”

Labour candidate for Leicester East Rajesh Agrawal said the issue was getting raised on the doorsteps during canvassing.“The council is under huge financial pressure ,” he said, “and the future of these celebrations is uncertain. We need more sources of funding. Having been deputy mayor of London, I know how important such events are to promote a city. I am determined to save them.”
