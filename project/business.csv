Infirmities in anti-graft law clause that shields babus: SC; but bench split on nixing it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/infirmities-in-anti-graft-law-clause-that-shields-babus-sc-but-bench-split-on-nixing-it/articleshow/126515844.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday held that Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, which bars police and agencies from probing corruption complaints against public servants without prior govt approval, suffered from infirmities. But an SC division bench differed on its implication - while one judge declared it outrightly illegal, saying the provision will protect corrupt officials, the other judge said striking it down would amount to ""throwing the baby out with the bathwater"" and the defect could be cured by roping in Lokpal/Lokayukta to take a decision on sanction.The split verdict was pronounced by a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan on a PIL challenging the validity of Section 17A.The split verdict by the Supreme Court bench came on a PIL challenging the validity of Section 17A that was introduced in 2018 in the PC Act after a similar provision of Section 6A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act was struck down by SC in 2014.Terming Section 17A a ""resurrection"" of the quashed Section 6A of the DSPE Act and saying that ""it is old wine in a new bottle"", Justice B V Nagarathna held that Section 17A has to be struck down for being contrary to the judgments of the larger bench and constitution bench of this court.Justice K V Viswanathan, however, was of the view that there is deficiency in the provision as it does not provide an independent mechanism to impartial examination of corruption complaints against public servants and the task cannot be entrusted to the govt department of the official concerned. He said Section 17A is constitutionally valid, subject to the condition that grant or refusal or the approval by the competent authority mentioned therein will depend on the recommendation of Lokpal or Lokayukta in case of states. In view of divergent opinion, the bench directed the registry to place the case before the CJI for constituting of an appropriate bench to consider afresh the issues which arise in this matter.Emphasising that ""throwing the baby out with the bathwater"" is not an option, Justice Viswanathan said, ""The panacea of striking down will turn out to be worse than the disease.""He said there was a need to protect honest officers in discharging their duties without fear of frivolous complaint against them and that object is sub-served by Section 17A, but the only aspect missing expressly from the statute is the provision for an independent screening mechanism.""Civil servants should have the necessary freedom to take administrative decisions and express their views fearlessly without any threat of frivolous or vexatious complaints, for if they were to be exposed to such complaints in the future, there will be a chilling effect on them and their hands will be shackled. The net result will be a policy paralysis. It will be the tendency of every civil servant then to play it safe by taking no decision at all,"" Justice Viswanathan said. The judge agreed with the Law Commission's 254th report, which also suggested involving Lokpal/Lokayukta in the process under Section 17A.Emphasising that there should be zero tolerance towards corruption, Justice Nagarathna said the provision would protect a corrupt official as mandatory prior sanction would embolden officials to toe the line of their superior to make themselves safe. ""In all the above circumstances, prior approval under Section 17A of the Act may not be granted by the department even when public servants have to ideally be inquired/enquired/investigated within the meaning of Section 17A of the PC Act. This means the mechanism of a prior approval would be used to protect public servants who would align and against those who do not fall in line by a threat of commencing an inquiry/investigation against them,"" she said.She said there is need for an independent and autonomous person or body, who or which has nothing to do with the formulation and implementation of departmental policies or in the making of a recommendation or taking of a decision, to consider a request under Section 17A of the PC Act. ""Such a body within the govt as per the said provision is conspicuous by its absence inasmuch as the same is not spelt out in the provision,"" Justice Nagarathna said, adding there is ""lack of objectivity, neutrality and fairness"" in the provision.""In my view, there ought to have been an independent body which is not controlled by the govt to consider a case for grant of prior approval to conduct an inquiry/enquiry/investigation by a police officer. In the absence of such an independent and autonomous body which can make an impartial consideration with objectivity, Section 17A of the PC Act would be effectively frustrated for being vague and lacking in any guidance,"" Justice Nagarathna said.Justice Viswanathan said if Section 17A is invalidated on the ground that prior approval should not exist at all, the immediate consequence would be that any complaint alleging corruption in official decision-making could straightaway result in a police inquiry or investigation.""This would permit immediate registration of FIRs, commencement of investigation and resort to coercive steps in cases involving recommendations and decisions in discharge of duty, regardless of whether the complaint is frivolous, motivated or based on hindsight. Such a result would be regressive,"" he said.","Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act bars police and agencies from probing corruption complaints against public servants without prior govt approval. But an SC division bench differed on its implication. One judge declared it outrightly illegal, saying the provision will protect corrupt officials.

Indian Army Intensifies Anti-Terror Ops In J&K To Flush Out Pak Terrorists Amid Chillai Kalan

NEW DELHI: Jammu & Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha on Tuesday ordered the termination of five J&K govt staffers over alleged links with terror outfits and their Pakistan-based commanders working with ISI to plot and execute terror attacks in India.Among the employees dismissed under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution are laboratory technician Tariq Ahmad Rah and forest field worker Farooq Ahmad Bhat, both from Anantnag. The two, along with ex-MLA Gul Mohammad Akhoon, are accused in a case taken over by the J&K state investigation agency (SIA) in Sept 2023, facing charges of a criminal conspiracy to extend logistical support to Hizbul Mujahideen (Hizb) divisional commander Mohammad Amin Baba alias Aabid and facilitate his escape to Pakistan in 2005 via the Attari-Wagah border. Amin Baba was Tariq’s uncle and divisional commander of Hizb from 1998 to 2005. Farooq, who was then informally working as a personal assistant to Akhoon, helped Tariq plan Amin Baba’s escape. Farooq used his government identity card to avoid security checks at nakas and dropped Amin Baba at the international border. Ex-MLA Akhoon provided a government Gypsy vehicle, with his personal security officers and driver, to transport Amin Baba to the international border.“Amin Baba is currently operating from Islamabad and attends regular meetings with ISI, LeT and Jaish operatives, to plot terrorist activities in India. He trains HM cadres in PoJK terror camps and recruits Kashmiri youths for terror,” sources shared.Both Tariq and Farooq were arrested in 2024 but later got bail. Inputs suggest they have since resumed their terror activities.Others sacked on Monday include school teacher Mohd Ishfaq who was arrested in 2022 before he could execute a Lashker e Taiba plot to kill a police officer in Doda; and driver Mohd Yousf who, on the direction of Pakistan-based HM terrorist Bashir Ahmad Bhat, was procuring arms and transporting terror funds in Ganderbal area. Also fired was assistant lineman Bashir Ahmad Mir for having provided shelter to two LeT terrorists before they were neutralised by the security forces in his house in September 2021.With the latest set of dismissals, the total number of J&K govt employees terminated by the Manoj Sinha administration so far has risen to 85. ""Since 2021, the LG has decisively removed terrorists and their enablers from government service, while simultaneously extending opportunities and dignity to the genuine victims of terror by providing them employment,"" a J&K govt official told TOI.As per the dossiers on the five sacked J&K govt staffers accessed by TOI, Mohd Ishfaq was working for LeT and was in regular contact with Pakistan-based LeT commander Mohd Amin alias Abu Khubaib, designated by India as an individual terrorist. Ishfaq was put under surveillance and arrested in April 2022 before he could execute an LeT plan to kill a police officer in Doda. Investigators found he was misusing his position as a teacher to influence youth to join terror groups.Bashir Ahmed Mir was found to be operating as an overground worker of LeT in Gurez area of Bandipora. “He was guiding the movement of terrorists, providing them logistical support and sharing information on movement of security forces. His role came to light in Sept 2021 when anti-terror operations were launched at his house and two terrorists hiding there were neutralised,” an officer told TOI.Two AK-47 weapons and ammunition were recovered from Bashir’s house. He was arrested but later got bail on medical grounds.Mohd Yousf, a govt hospital driver posted at Bemina, Srinagar, was in regular contact with Pakistan-based Hizb operative Bashir Ahmad Bhat. On July 20, 2024, the police intercepted a vehicle in which Yousf and his associate Eashan Hamid were travelling, and recovered one pistol, ammunition, grenade and Rs 5 lakh in cash. Yousf revealed he was delivering the consignment to a terrorist on the direction of his Pakistani handler. He also confessed to providing phones to jailed terrorists to establish communication with their Pakistan-based handlers.","Jammu & Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha on Tuesday ordered the termination of five J&K govt staffers over alleged links with terror outfits.

Donald Trump’s Iran Trade Tariff Warning Puts India In A Bind Over Exports, Chabahar And US Ties

How Will 25% Additional Tariffs Impact India?



India-Iran Trade Overview

In a fresh round of global tariffs, US President Donald Trump has announced that countries doing trade with Iran will attract a 25% tariff from the world’s largest economy. The move is seen as a pressure tactic on Iran over its response to nationwide protests that have reportedly claimed nearly 600 lives.Trump has repeatedly warned that his administration could consider military action if it determines that the Iranian government is using lethal force against demonstrators. Trump described this as a threshold Iran is ‘beginning to cross,’ prompting discussions within his national security team on what he called ‘very strong options’.The tariff decision was announced by Trump in a social media post on Monday, where he said that measures would take effect immediately. Several major economies, including China, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, and India maintain trade ties with Iran.“Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America. This Order is final and conclusive. Thank you for your attention to this matter!,” Trump posted on Truth Social.India already faces 50% tariffs on its exports to the US. While 25% of this figure are ‘reciprocal’ tariffs’, the remaining 25% are a penal duty for India’s crude oil imports from Russia.India and Iran share an important trading relationship, with India consistently ranking among Iran’s top five trading partners in recent years, according to the Ministry of External Affairs.India’s key exports to Iran span a range of products, including rice (especially basmati), tea, sugar, pharmaceutical goods, man-made staple fibres, electrical equipment, and imitation jewellery. In return, India mainly imports items such as dry fruits, inorganic and organic chemicals, and glassware from Iran.In 2023, rice was India’s largest export item to Iran at $734 million, followed by soybean meal valued at $96.8 million and bananas worth $52 million. On the import side, India’s purchases from Iran were dominated by acyclic alcohol derivatives that are halogenated, sulphonated or nitrated, amounting to $309 million.Also read: 'Seize and hold the cities'; 5 takeaways from Reza Pahlavi's declaration amid Iran protests

Iran is a crucial market for Indian basmati rice, typically purchasing more than one million tonnes each year, according to reports. Iran has traditionally been among the biggest overseas markets for Indian basmati rice. Reports suggest that Iran purchases close to 12 lakh tonnes each year, with the trade estimated at around Rs 12,000 crore.However, Iran is not among its top 5 trading partners in terms of both imports and exports. India’s top exporting destinations are currently the United States of America, United Arab Emirates, Netherlands, China, United Kingdom - accounting for 41% of India’s exports according to the Ministry of Commerce dashboard.Beyond merchandise trade, the development of the Chabahar port remains a cornerstone of India-Iran economic cooperation. Situated in Iran’s Sistan-Balochistan province along the country’s resource-rich southern coastline, the port is being jointly developed to strengthen regional connectivity and expand trade links.From a trade and strategy perspective, India also has a major stake in Iran’s Chabahar port. Last year, the US extended its sanctions waiver for Iran’s Chabahar port by an additional six months to April this year. The waiver had earlier been withdrawn in September 2025 when the US State Department cancelled the exemption first issued in 2018, which had allowed India to develop the port as a gateway to Afghanistan and Central Asia while avoiding routes through Pakistan, as part of efforts to increase pressure on Tehran.If the exemption were to lapse, entities involved in operating the port or engaging in related activities could be exposed to US penalties under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act.Chabahar has gained strategic relevance for India’s outreach to Afghanistan, especially as engagement with the Taliban administration in Kabul has been gradually improving.","India and Iran share an important trading relationship, with India consistently ranking among Iran’s top five trading partners in recent years.

"Project-75I: How India’s $8 billion submarine upgrade reshapes the Pakistan, China equation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/project-75i-how-indias-8-billion-submarine-upgrade-reshapes-the-pakistan-china-equation/articleshow/126480351.cms,"What is Project-75I and why it matters



Why the German Type-214NG was selected



Make in India at the core



Pakistan, Karachi and the logic of sea denial



China’s expanding undersea footprint



Strategic timing of Merz’s visit



French-origin Scorpene follow-on plan put on hold as Project-75I gained priority



Long-term impact on India’s naval posture



NEW DELHI: More than five decades after Indian naval strikes crippled Karachi during the 1971 war, undersea power is once again at the heart of New Delhi’s strategic thinking. As German Chancellor Friedrich Merz began his visit to India on Monday amid a more volatile regional and global security environment, discussions around Project-75I have acquired fresh urgency.The Indian Navy’s plan to induct six next-generation conventional submarines equipped with air-independent propulsion reflects a convergence of hard lessons from history, renewed friction with Pakistan following recent crises, and China’s expanding undersea presence in the Indian Ocean. Together, these factors are pushing India towards one of its most consequential naval procurement decisions in years, one that blends deterrence, indigenisation and long-term strategic signalling.Project-75I is the Indian Navy’s flagship programme to build six modern diesel-electric submarines equipped with fuel-cell-based air-independent propulsion, advanced sensors, torpedoes and missile systems. The Ministry of Defence issued the Request for Proposal for the project in July 2021 under the Strategic Partnership Model, describing it as a key pillar of the government’s Make in India push, according to a PIB statement.The project envisages indigenous construction, long-term technology transfer and the creation of a domestic submarine-building ecosystem. The estimated cost was over Rs 40,000 crore at the RFP stage, with current assessments placing the final contract value closer to $8 billion, or about Rs 72,000 crore, based on configuration and lifecycle support.For the Indian Navy, the programme addresses a critical gap. Its conventional submarine fleet is ageing even as undersea activity by China and Pakistan increases in the Indian Ocean and along India’s maritime approaches.The Indian Navy has selected the German Type-214 Next Generation submarine, edging out Spain’s S-80 Plus offered by Navantia, defence sources said. The decision was driven primarily by the maturity of the German fuel-cell-based AIP system, acoustic stealth and lower lifecycle risk.AIP allows submarines to remain submerged for weeks without surfacing or snorkeling, reducing detection risk. In contested waters, endurance and silence are decisive. The Type-214’s AIP technology is widely regarded as operationally proven, while competing systems are still undergoing validation.In undersea warfare, reliability and survivability often outweigh novelty. That calculus appears to have guided the Navy’s choice.Under the proposed framework, all six submarines will be built in India at MDL, with TKMS providing design authority, engineering expertise and technical consultancy. Indigenous content is expected to start at around 45 percent and rise to nearly 60 percent by the final boat, aligning with Atmanirbhar Bharat goals.TKMS and MDL signed a memorandum of understanding in June last year to jointly pursue the project, laying the groundwork for the partnership. MDL’s prior experience building Scorpène-class submarines under the earlier Project-75 strengthened its case as the Indian strategic partner.The ministry of defence has repeatedly stressed that Project-75I is not only about acquiring platforms but about absorbing complex submarine design and construction technologies, as outlined in the 2021 PIB release.India’s emphasis on undersea capability is rooted in history. During the 1971 war, the Indian Navy’s attacks on Karachi port crippled Pakistan’s maritime logistics and fuel supply, accelerating Islamabad’s defeat. That episode stressed how control of the seas can shape outcomes on land.The relevance of that lesson resurfaced during Operation Sindoor in May 2025, when tensions with Pakistan escalated following a major terror provocation. Between May 8 and May 11, India placed its naval forces on heightened readiness, with Karachi again emerging as Pakistan’s most critical vulnerability.Karachi handles the bulk of Pakistan’s maritime trade and energy imports. India’s ability to credibly threaten that hub, even without firing a shot, highlighted the deterrent value of naval and undersea power. New submarines with extended underwater endurance would sharpen that leverage.Beyond Pakistan, China looms large in India’s maritime threat assessment. The People’s Liberation Army Navy operates a rapidly expanding submarine fleet, including nuclear-powered platforms that have increasingly deployed into the Indian Ocean.Chinese submarines have docked at regional ports and conducted patrols close to Indian waters, while Pakistan, with Chinese assistance, is also upgrading its submarine arm. For Indian planners, this twin challenge has made restoring conventional submarine strength an urgent priority.Project-75I is designed to plug that gap by giving India a survivable, persistent undersea capability suited to monitoring choke points, tracking adversary submarines and conducting sea-denial operations.Chancellor Merz’s visit from January 12–13 comes amid a broader effort by Germany to expand its strategic footprint in the Indo-Pacific. Berlin and New Delhi are also working toward an EU-India free trade agreement, as noted by AFP.For India, the potential submarine deal fits into a wider diversification of defence partnerships beyond legacy suppliers such as Russia. For Germany, it represents an opportunity to anchor a long-term industrial and security relationship with the world’s largest democracy.According to informed defence sources cited by idrw.org, the final contract is not expected to be signed during Merz’s visit but could be concluded within the next three months, with the high-level engagement expected to provide political momentum.In October 2025, India put on hold plans to build three additional French-origin Scorpene submarines at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited, even as it moved decisively to push ahead with Project-75I, which envisages the construction of six new-generation German-origin diesel-electric submarines at the same shipyard, The Times of India reported.Top government sources told TOI that the proposal for the three additional Scorpenes, estimated to cost around Rs 36,000 crore, “was not being pursued” at the time, although a formal decision to scrap it had not been recorded. While cost negotiations for the Scorpene follow-on order had concluded in the previous fiscal, final clearance from the Prime Minister-led Cabinet Committee on Security remained on hold.Officials told TOI that the German submarines under Project-75I were considered “a generation ahead” in terms of technology and capability. Concerns also existed about MDL’s ability to simultaneously execute two complex submarine construction programmes. The six original Kalvari-class submarines had already been built at MDL under the earlier Project-75 contract signed in October 2005, with the first boat INS Kalvari commissioned in December 2017 and the sixth, INS Vagsheer, inducted in January 2025.All six Kalvari-class submarines were slated to be retrofitted with the DRDO-developed air-independent propulsion system to improve underwater endurance. AIP allows a diesel-electric submarine to remain submerged for nearly two weeks, compared to boats without the system that must surface or snorkel every few days to recharge batteries.In contrast, the submarines planned under Project-75I, to be built in partnership with Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, were designed to incorporate AIP from the outset, along with land-attack cruise missiles and other next-generation technologies, TOI reported.Sources told TOI that the decision to proceed with final techno-commercial negotiations for the six German submarines, with an option for three more at a later stage, followed extensive deliberations involving the defence ministry, the Navy and the National Security Council Secretariat. Formal contract negotiations began in September 2025.“These new-generation boats under P-75I will come with design ToT (transfer of technology) and a greater indigenisation level of around 60%. The project will serve as a bridge to the future P-76, under which conventional submarines will be constructed based on totally indigenous design,” a source told TOI.Despite the pause on the Scorpene extension, officials indicated that France’s broader strategic partnership with India remained strong. Negotiations progressed on additional Rafale fighters for the Indian Air Force’s proposed 114 multi-role fighter aircraft programme, as well as a collaboration to co-develop a powerful jet engine with French major Safran for India’s fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft was nearly finalised.At the time, the Navy’s conventional submarine strength stood at six Scorpenes, six ageing Russian Kilo-class boats and four German HDW submarines, alongside two nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. China, by comparison, operated more than 50 diesel-electric and around 10 nuclear submarines and was in the process of supplying eight Yuan-class AIP-equipped submarines to Pakistan, a development seen as a major capability boost for Islamabad, TOI reported.Once inducted, the six Type-214NG submarines will significantly enhance the Indian Navy’s capacity for covert surveillance, sea denial and precision strike missions. Their sensors, weapons and endurance will form a key layer of India’s maritime deterrence architecture.Equally important is the industrial legacy. By absorbing advanced submarine technologies, India positions itself for future indigenous designs and follow-on projects. MDL’s role would be strengthened, and a specialised domestic supply chain would be deepened.Project-75I marks one of the most consequential naval procurement decisions India has taken in years. It addresses hard lessons from 1971, recent operational realities with Pakistan, and the growing challenge posed by China’s undersea expansion.As Germany’s chancellor arrives in India, the submarine negotiations underscore how defence industrial cooperation has become central to New Delhi’s foreign policy. From Karachi’s burning docks in 1971 to the silent depths of the Indian Ocean today, India’s maritime strategy is being reshaped through capability, indigenisation and strategic foresight.",Project-75I is the Indian Navy’s flagship programme to build six modern diesel- electric submarines.

NEW DELHI: In a significant effort to speed up diagnosis of serious infections - a move that experts say could also help reduce unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and mitigate the risk of anti-microbial resistance - Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has moved to develop a single diagnostic test capable of detecting multiple infections simultaneously.Patients arriving at hospitals with fever, breathlessness or severe illness are often subjected to a cascade of tests - dengue, influenza, Covid and typhoid - as doctors rule out infections one by one. Each negative report delays diagnosis and treatment, sometimes with serious consequences.To change this, ICMR has drawn up a plan to develop multiplex molecular diagnostic tests that can identify several infections in a single run, sharply cutting diagnostic delays and improving clinical decision-making.Currently, hospitals rely largely on symptom-based provisional diagnosis. ""Once a patient comes to a hospital with a suspected infectious cause, samples are sent for testing based on the provisional diagnosis,"" said Dr Hitender Gautam, professor of microbiology at AIIMS. ""If the test is positive, definitive diagnosis is made and treatment started. But if it is negative, testing for other pathogens follows - and this often leads to delay in diagnosis and delay in correct treatment. ""ICMR has flagged that this step-by-step approach not only raises costs, but also risks missing the actual cause, as many infections present with overlapping symptoms. The planned single-test model is intended to screen for priority pathogens in one go, allowing clinicians to move faster from suspicion to confirmation.The diagnostic delays have wider clinical consequences. While test results are awaited, doctors often initiate empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. ""Empirical antibiotic therapy is started during the provisional diagnosis phase and broadly covers many microorganisms,"" Gautam said. ""If this continues for long without a positive report, it increases the chances of antimicrobial resistance,"" he said.Concerns over this trend are reflected in the ICMR-Antimicrobial Resistance Research & Surveillance Network (AMRSN) annual report 2024, which shows that several routinely used antibiotics are rapidly losing effectiveness against bacteria most frequently isolated from hospitals.Faster, syndrome-based diagnosis could help reverse this pattern by enabling an early shift to targeted therapy, which carries a much lower risk of resistance. ICMR has also linked quicker diagnosis to stronger outbreak surveillance, citing lessons from Covid, when delayed detection allowed early silent transmission.The proposed tests will be tailored to India's disease burden, using national surveillance data. ICMR will support Indian manufacturers and research institutions to develop, validate and scale up these kits, including rapid production during outbreaks and future pandemics. Proposals are due by Jan 25.","Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has moved to develop a single diagnostic test. Currently, hospitals rely largely on symptom-based provisional diagnosis.

SC moves to ensure 25% free seats for poor in all schools,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-moves-to-ensure-25-free-seats-for-poor-in-all-schools/articleshow/126512505.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: Holding that the constitutional goal of fraternity can be achieved only when a rickshaw puller's child studies in a school alongside the child of a multi-millionaire or a Supreme Court judge, the apex court Tuesday initiated the exercise to ensure that all schools make available 25% free seats for children from poor and disadvantaged sections, as mandated under Right to Education Act (RTE).A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said the RTE Act envisages elementary education for all children in a shared institutional space without differentiating them on the basis of caste, class, gender or economic status. Writing the judgment, Justice Narasimha said, ""It makes it possible, normatively and structurally, for the child of a multi-millionaire or even of a Judge of the Supreme Court of India to sit in the same classroom and at the same bench as the child of an autorickshaw driver or a street vendor. This is the way Section 12 seeks to concretise the constitutional principle of fraternity alongside equality and liberty.""Dispelling the skepticism of many holding the traditional but mistaken view that 'fraternity' is non-enforceable, SC said, ""Unlike equality and liberty, which are frequently framed as individual rights-claims, fraternity is relational; it operates through institutional arrangements that enable individuals to 'lose suspect identities' based on caste, class or other hierarchies and to form solidaristic bonds.""In this sense, the 25% inclusion under Section 12, in unaided neighbourhood schools, is not an isolated welfare measure but a vehicle through which the constitutional commitment to fraternity and the 'development of the child' as recognised in Article 21A and Article 39(f) is sought to be realised,"" it said. The court also cited the Kothari Commission report's emphasis on the Common School System wherein children from every section of society get equal education without discrimination.It quoted HRD ministry's statement: ""The often-voiced concern about how 25% children from disadvantaged groups and weaker sections can cope in an environment where rich children exist can be resolved when teaching-learning process and teachers use these children as sources of knowledge so that their esteem and recognition go up and they begin to be treated as equals."" The bench said it is necessary and compelling to formulate subordinate legislation by issuing necessary rules and regulations, prescribing the method and manner by which children of weaker and disadvantaged sections are to be admitted in neighbourhood schools.""We direct the appropriate authorities to prepare and issue, in consultation with the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and SCPCRs, as the case may be, as well as the National and State Advisory Councils, necessary rules and regulations under Section 38 of the Act for implementing the mandate of Section 12(1)(c) of the Act,"" it said.""We further direct NCPCR to collate information about the issuance of rules and regulations by the states and UTs and file an affidavit before this Court by March 31,"" the bench said, listing the matter for further hearing on April 6.",The apex court Tuesday initiated the exercise to ensure that all schools make available 25% free seats for children from poor and disadvantaged sections.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has shortlisted 11 medical institutions across the country for a study to define what is medically normal for Indian children and adolescents - a move expected to significantly improve diagnosis and treatment.At present, many of the ""normal ranges"" used to interpret children's blood tests and other investigations are based on data from western populations, which doctors say may not accurately reflect Indian children's health profiles. The new study aims to address the gap by generating India-specific reference values. ""These reference values are crucial in helping doctors decide whether a child's test result falls within a healthy range or requires medical attention,"" said Dr Tushar Sehgal, in charge or hematology section in department of laboratory medicine of AIIMS and one of the principal investigators.""Children are not small adults, and Indian children are influenced by distinct genetic, nutritional and environmental factors. Using reference values developed for other populations can lead to errors. Creating indigenous reference ranges will greatly improve diagnostic accuracy and help avoid both unnecessary treatment and missed diagnoses,"" Dr Sehgal said. He added so-called ""normal"" blood test values can vary depending on where people live and their nutritional background.People living at high altitudes, for instance, naturally have higher haemoglobin levels because their bodies adapt to lower oxygen levels.The shortlisted institutions include AIIMS Delhi, Jodhpur, Raipur, Bhopal, Kalyani and Gauhati along with NIMHANS and others medical institutes.

Deal St: Cognizant inks over $1bn contract with Novartis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deal-st-cognizant-inks-over-1bn-contract-with-novartis/articleshow/126473146.cms,".

BENGALURU: Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis as part of a consolidation contract that includes renewals as well as new scope spanning application services, infrastructure, data and AI-led offerings, sources told TOI.This marks the second consecutive billion-dollar deal for Cognizant in less than a year, after it won a large contract from UnitedHealth Group last year. UnitedHealth ranks among Cognizant’s biggest customers, supported by a partnership spanning nearly two decades.When TOI reached out, a Cognizant spokesperson said the company is currently in a silent period and had no comment. An email sent to Novartis did not elicit a response until the time of going to press.Sources said Cognizant’s EMEA and APAC teams played a key role in clinching the deal under the leadership of Gagan Syal, head of life sciences for EMEA and APAC at Cognizant.Phil Fersht, CEO of USIT advisory HfS Research, said the rise in half-billion-dollar and larger IT services deals reflects a structural reset in how enterprises buy technology, rather than a surge in discretionary spending. “CIOs are aggressively consolidating vendors, bundling what were once multiple mid-sized contracts into fewer, broader and longer-term engagements with clearer accountability.These deals now typically span seven to ten years and combine transformation, run, cloud, data and AI under a single commercial construct, making the headline value appear larger even though annual spend is often comparable to legacy budgets,” he said. Fersht added that AI-led modernisation has become non-deferrable, as enterprises cannot pause core system renewal, cloud migration, cybersecurity or data platform investments, pushing deal sizes higher as “change plus continuity” are brought together.Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of US-based Everest Group, said Cognizant has been the most aggressive among Indian-based providers in combining a strong vision for AI transformation with very competitive pricing. “This has positioned them to take share in a hyper-competitive market. The vendor consolidation trend, of which the Novartis transaction is a leading example, is ripe for this approach. We are aware of other large transactions where Cognizant is in the lead,” he said.Healthcare contributes around 30% to Cognizant’s revenue. Early in its growth journey, the company rapidly expanded its healthcare footprint, counting nine of the top 10 payers—including United, Anthem, Cigna and Aetna—as customers, along with nearly 30 major pharma companies such as Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly.Novartis operates three state-of-the-art centres in India across two cities—Hyderabad, where it has facilities at the Novartis Corporate Center (NOCC) and Genome Valley, and Mumbai. The company employs around 8,500 people in the country.India serves as a key hub in Novartis’s global operations, supporting the development of breakthrough medicines across therapy areas including cardiovascular, oncology, immunology, neurology and global health. The India centres support a wide range of global functions such as global clinical operations, technical R&D, patient safety and pharmacovigilance, regulatory affairs and advanced quantitative sciences, among others.","Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis.

Army modernising force for future warfare: General

NEW DELHI: General Upendra Dwivedi said on Tuesday the Army is ready to induct women in the infantry but that is contingent on societal acceptance.Stressing that women should not be seen as a “vulnerable commodity”, the General, during a media briefing, said the Army's focus is on “gender neutrality”. “If standards are same, if capabilities are same, and in India as a nation, society is ready to accept it, it (combat role) can be done tomorrow,” he said.He said uniform standards are essential, but achieving them remains a challenge due to medical and operational constraints. Gen Dwivedi said performance data of women officers will determine the opening of more roles, starting with supporting arms, followed by combat arms and eventually special forces, calling it a “sequential and welcome social change.”Giving an estimate of the number of women in the Army currently, the Army chief had last year said, “In the NDA as of today, we have 60 women Army cadets and every year, we are looking at (inducting) 20 cadets. Also, in the Officers’ Training Academy (OTA)—Chennai and Gaya—we are looking at 120 per year.” When it comes to inducting women in the other ranks (ORs), it involves a change in Section 12 of the Army Act, he had said.The Army was looking at a 12 times increase in women’s induction in ORs by 2032. “Currently, the total number of women officers is 8,000,” he had said. The Territorial Army opened up for women and 110 vacancies will come up for women, he had added.Taking lessons from conflicts going on around the world, General Upendra Dwivedi said on Tuesday modernisation remains the urgent focus of the Indian Army. Dedicated regiments of drones with enhanced capabilities, rocket cum missile force, loitering munitions, new battalions like Bhairon equipped with modern technologies and advanced weapons and anti-missile defence radar and systems are on the cards.He said over 90% ammunition is now indigenised, underscoring the push towards self-reliance. “After Operation Sindoor , drones got a new thrust,” he said, adding that new drone formations have been raised and each command now has the capability to manufacture up to 5,000 drones depending on operational requirements. This capability can be enhanced to 20,000 or even one lakh drones depending upon the threat perception or conflict, he said.“As of today, we have raised 13 Bhairav battalions, which are meant to bridge the gap between lethal platoons and special forces within infantry battalions,” the Gen said.“Moving on to artillery, we have created a Divyastra battery. It will be part of the artillery regiment and will provide support to a division commander. Again, this involves UAS equipment. For counter-unmanned aircraft system ammunition, we have our powerful regiment, which we are currently raising three units of, and will later raise 12 more. We will then expand this further,” he added.","General Upendra Dwivedi said on Tuesday the Army is ready to induct women in the infantry but that is contingent on societal acceptance.

Third Stage Trouble Strikes Again: Inside ISRO’s PSLV-C62 Deviation And What The Failure Means Ahead

NEW DELHI: When its third phase failed on Monday, Isro’s PSLV-C62 launch vehicle lost 15 satellites from several countries and Indian companies, including the primary payload. However, a football-sized Spanish satellite called KID (Kestrel Initial Demonstrator), survived, though it transmitted “critical data” back to Earth for only about 3 minutes.The 25-kg satellite separated “against all odds” from PSLV's fourth stage despite the third-stage anomaly that caused the mission to fail. The satellite’s developer, Orbital Paradigm, said on X, “Our KID capsule... separated from PSLV C62, switched on, and transmitted data…”KID, designed for re-entry testing towards a splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean, endured peak deceleration forces and thermal stresses that would pulverise most experimental hardware. “We’re reconstructing trajectory. We survived peak heat and peak g-load (~28g recorded). We have internal temps. Full report will come,” the company said.Developed with French partner RIDE, KID validates Orbital Paradigm’s reusable re-entry technology, crucial for future satellite servicing and de-orbiting.The startup plans a detailed report soon and is likely to accelerate Kestrel’s full-scale development programme.Tragedy struck PSLV when an “anomaly” in the third stage diverted the rocket from its flight path, preventing sun-synchronous orbit insertion of its payload.Isro chairman V Narayanan said on Monday, “Near the end of the third stage, we observed some disturbance in the vehicle, and there was a deviation in its flight path. As a result, the mission could not proceed as expected.” After his statement, it was assumed that all the 16 satellites, including primary payload EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a hyperspectral earth imaging satellite developed by DRDO for national security and surveillance, were lost.KID turned out to be the only to survive long enough to transmit signals. Orbital Paradigm is yet to confirm if the capsule later burned out or splashed down on Earth.","Isro’s PSLV-C62 launch vehicle lost 15 satellites from several countries and Indian companies, including the primary payload.

"NEET-PG cut-off overhaul in Delhi: Centre lowers qualifying percentile to fill 9,000 vacant seats",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-pg-cut-off-score-now-fixed-at-40-out-of-800/articleshow/126514156.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday lowered qualifying cut-off for NEET-PG 2025, paving the way to fill over 9,000 vacant PG medical seats, amid concerns that a big chunk of training capacity was being wasted at a time of acute doctor shortages.Under the revised criteria, qualifying percentile for general and EWS candidates has been reduced from 50th to 7th percentile, and for general persons with benchmark disability (PwBD) from 45th to 5th percentile. For SC, ST and OBC candidates, the percentile has been reduced from 40 to zero, with the corresponding cut-off score fixed at -40 out of 800 (due to negative marking).The decision was notified by National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS), which revised qualifying percentiles across categories to expand eligibility for counselling and admissions. Officials said around 2.4 lakh candidates appeared for NEET-PG this year, but a high cut-off had left thousands of seats unfilled.Officials said India has 65,000-70,000 PG medical seats, and allowing nearly one in seven seats to remain vacant would weaken teaching hospitals and strain healthcare delivery, particularly in govt institutions that rely heavily on resident doctors. The relaxation followed a representation by Indian Medical Association (IMA), which had written to Union health minister JP Nadda on Jan 12, seeking a rational revision of cut-offs to prevent large-scale vacancies.Explaining the move, NBEMS officials said the entrance exam is meant to generate a merit list, not to reassess the competence of doctors who have already cleared MBBS and university exams. ""You can't afford to let 9,000-10,000 PG seats go to waste,"" an official said.The official acknowledged that sharp percentile reductions attract criticism but said the admission cycle was already delayed. ""Earlier, cut-offs were lowered in stages. This time, we are late. The focus is to fill seats and avoid losing national medical resources,"" he said.NBEMS clarified that the cut-off change does not alter exam scores or ranks, but only decides who is eligible to participate in counselling. Officials said the percentile system is used to rank already qualified doctors, and the cut-off was lowered simply to ensure enough candidates are available to fill all PG seats.IMA warned that vacant PG seats worsen resident doctor shortages, increase workload, disrupt academics and hurt patient care, especially in government and peripheral hospitals.","Officials said India has 65,000-70,000 PG medical seats, and allowing nearly one in seven seats to remain vacant would weaken teaching hospitals.

NEW DELHI: Election Commission on Tuesday told Supreme Court that scrutiny of citizenship during SIR of voter lists was only meant to ensure deletion of non-citizens from electoral rolls and did not extend to termination of citizenship or deportation. EC, through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, told a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that Article 326 of the Constitution mandated that only Indian citizens were entitled to be included in the electoral rolls.For this purpose and this alone, EC was entitled to inquire and conclude whether a person was an Indian citizen, entitling him to be a voter. ""If a person is found not to be a citizen of India by EC, then his name will either not be included in the voter list or, if it is there, then it would be struck off,"" he said.Dwivedi said no person with a shadow of doubt over citizenship could be included in the voter list. However, such a determination by the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) would not automatically result in a declaration that s/he was not a citizen of India - which was the domain of the competent authorities. ""The ERO's conclusion about a voter's citizenship being doubtful and the resultant removal of his name from the voter list can be set aside by a court of law only if it finds that the procedure adopted for such determination was perverse and illegal,"" he said.""Under the SIR exercise, the citizenship of an individual for the purposes of Citizenship Act, 1955, will not terminate on account of the fact that he/she is held to be ineligible for registration in the electoral rolls,"" EC said.Since the documents that could be used to establish citizenship were within a person knowledge, the burden of proof lay with the individual, it said.Dwivedi said when doubts arose about an elected representative's citizenship, the President or the governor was constitutionally bound by EC's opinion on whether the MP or MLA had incurred disqualification over being a non-citizen. This meant EC had the power to inquire into citizenship of MPs or MLAs if doubts arose, he said.Arguments in the matter will resume Thursday.","Election Commission told Supreme Court scrutiny of citizenship only meant to ensure deletion of non-citizens from electoral rolls.

NEW DELHI: To check the trend of highway contractors and consultants quickly getting a court stay on debarment and blacklisting orders issued by authorities for defaults, the government is working on a two-pronged strategy: studying the pattern through which such legal relief is secured and largely eliminating the scope of debarment, which can be challenged in courts.The road transport ministry has proposed changes in the contract conditions under which a contractor will be ineligible to bid for national highway (NH) projects after a recorded “major or catastrophic failure” in any ongoing project for two years. This would make it difficult for errant contractors to legally challenge such restrictions.TOI has learnt that the issue of contractors and consultants getting quick relief from courts was flagged at a high-level meeting held recently to review the highway sector. Highway agencies have debarred or suspended over 60 contractors and consultancy firms in the past two years and have imposed penalties of over Rs 307 crore.“It was felt that a detailed assessment should be carried out to detect if there is any pattern behind contractors and consultants getting immediate relief,” said an official.On the introduction of ""major or catastrophic incident"" conditions in contracts, another official said that these will include collapse of bridge, viaduct, elevated stretch and reinforced wall, and severe road damage.“Once you ban a contractor or consultant, they can approach a court for relief. It also impacts their business as they don’t get any work across departments and states. So, our eligibility condition linked to major incidents will impact contractors in getting NH projects and such players will have hardly any scope to challenge it,"" said an official.He added that since debarments hit companies hard, jeopardising their business, contractors and consultants try to get relief one way or the other.",The road transport ministry has proposed changes in the contract conditions under which a contractor will be ineligible to bid for national highway projects.

"Delhi govt to implement Carbon Credit Monetisation Framework, earn from green projects",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-govt-to-implement-carbon-credit-monetisation-framework-earn-from-green-projects/articleshow/126510693.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a Cabinet meeting held on Tuesday, the Delhi government gave a nod to implement the 'Carbon Credit Monetisation Framework' in the national capital, following in the footsteps of Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Indore city.The Department of Environment, Forests and Wildlife said in a statement that Delhi's ongoing initiatives such as the electric vehicle rollout, urban forestry, Yamuna restoration, solar energy adoption and waste-to-energy plants would generate tradable carbon credits, creating new funding for environmental protection without any financial burden on the government.It further said work was underway to convert the city's existing green projects into revenue-generating assets for pollution control and sustainability, subject to Cabinet approval.It added that for every one metric tonne of carbon dioxide reduced through Delhi's climate initiatives, one carbon credit would be generated, which could be sold in carbon markets in India and abroad.The no-financial-liability model would help existing green efforts across departments, including transport, power, forests, Delhi Jal Board, and urban development, according to the statement.Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said the implementation of the Carbon Credit Monetisation Framework will provide the government with an additional source of revenue, thereby accelerating development works.Gupta further said this will not only promote environmental conservation, but the revenue generated will also be deposited into the Consolidated Fund of the State and utilised for public welfare schemes.According to her, the initiative will enhance the efficiency of various departments and provide citizens with the benefits of a cleaner and healthier environment.The chief minister said that through this initiative, the Delhi government is not only leading India's commitments against climate change, but is also opening new financial pathways for sustainable development, and that Delhi will emerge as the country's leading state to harness the benefits of the carbon market.The scheme will cover various initiatives being implemented by different departments, with the environment department acting as the nodal department for the entire process, officials said.At present, the Delhi government is operating electric buses, undertaking large-scale plantation drives, promoting solar energy and implementing waste management initiatives, all of which contribute to reducing carbon emissions.Under the new policy, the reduction in pollution achieved through these initiatives will be scientifically measured and registered as carbon credits.These carbon credits can then be sold in national and international carbon markets, enabling the Delhi government to earn revenue.According to the Department of Environment, the most significant feature of the scheme is its financial model.Through a transparent tender or request for proposal process, the department will select a specialised agency, which will identify schemes that can generate carbon credits. It will also undertake documentation and registration in accordance with international standards, officials said.The entire process will be based on a revenue-sharing model, meaning the government will not have to incur any expenditure.A portion of the revenue generated will go to the agency, while the larger share will accrue to the government exchequer, they said.All revenue generated through the framework will be deposited directly into the Consolidated Fund of the state and reflected in the financial accounts of the Delhi government.The funds can be utilised to further strengthen development initiatives and environmental improvement efforts.""These efforts will help unlock economic value from pollution reduction while also supporting environmental goals,"" Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said.He further added that this framework allows us to quantify these achievements, certify them under global standards like VERRA, Gold Standard, and the Indian Carbon Market, and monetise them transparently. The revenue will fuel further pollution control and climate mitigation, making Delhi a model for urban sustainability.Explaining the core objectives of the framework, the ministry said it aims to create a structured system to identify, verify and register emission-reduction projects across sectors.It added that developing a strong 'Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV)' mechanism would ensure accurate data, transparency and international auditability.The ministry said other objectives include enabling smooth issuance and trading of carbon credits through approved platforms, strengthening departmental capacity for long-term participation in carbon markets, and positioning Delhi as a leader in climate finance aligned with national goals.The statement said expert agencies would be engaged on a success-fee basis, meaning payments would be made only after revenue is earned, ensuring zero upfront cost to the government. Up to three agencies will be empanelled to ensure scalability and wider participation.It added that the process of engaging these agencies would begin shortly and would cover project assessment, documentation, validation, registration, issuance of credits, trading strategies and capacity building.Revenue generated would be used through a dedicated mechanism for pollution control, climate adaptation and environmental management.If utilised effectively, Delhi's carbon credit potential could run into hundreds of crores, creating a steady funding source for environmental protection, the statement claimed.

Once the project is completed, drainage across the entire corridor will improve, roads will be upgraded and commuters will get significant relief from traffic bottlenecks,"" the chief minister said.In addition, the road is being strengthened and reconstructed, and crash barriers are being built in the central verge to ensure safe and effective drainage even during the monsoon season, she added.""Regular cleaning of drains, construction of new trunk drains and implementation of sewage treatment plants projects were being carried out simultaneously, so that only treated water flows into the Yamuna in the future and the capital is permanently freed from the problem of waterlogging,"" Gupta said further.Public Works Department (PWD) Minister Pravesh Sahib Singh who was also present at the event said that several roads in this area had been in an extremely dilapidated condition for many years.""The present government had taken responsibility for their reconstruction, completed the tendering process and commenced construction work,"" Verma said.Transport Minister Pankaj Singh said for the past 11 years, the situation was so bad in the area that neither pedestrians nor vehicles could move comfortably and conditions worsened further during the monsoon.","The Delhi government will take up a road and drain repair project along the Nangloi-Najafgarh road.

'Real Friends Can Disagree, But...': US Envoy Sergio Gor On India-US Ties, Comments On Trade Deal

India-US trade deal: The new US Ambassador to India, Sergio Gor on Monday shared an important update on the India-US trade deal progress, saying that the two sides will hold a fresh round of talks tomorrow. ""Many of you have asked me for an update on the ongoing trade deal negotiations. Both sides continue to actively engage. In fact, the next call on trade will occur tomorrow,” he said after assuming charge.“India is the world's largest nation. So it's not an easy task to get this across the finish line, but we are determined to get there and while trade is very important for our relationship, we will continue to work closely together on other very important areas such as security, counter-terrorism, energy, technology, education, and health,” he added.“No partner is more essential than India. In the months and years ahead, it is my goal as ambassador to pursue a very ambitious agenda. We will do this as true strategic partners, each bringing strength, respect, and leadership to the table,” he said.India currently faces 50% tariffs on its exports to the US, 25% of which are penal tariffs for its crude oil imports from Russia. Both sides have been engaged in discussions for the first tranche of the trade deal to be finalised but a breakthrough is still elusive.In the meantime, US President Donald Trump has threatened higher tariffs on India if it doesn’t stop buying Russian crude and a new bill that proposes 500% tariffs on countries buying Russian oil has received his nod and will be up for vote in the Senate soon.Talking about the bond between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gor said, “.I've travelled all over the world with President Trump, and I can attest that his friendship with Prime Minister Modi is real. The United States and India are bound not just by shared interest, but by a relationship anchored at the highest levels. Real friends can disagree, but always resolve their differences in the end.”""I spoke with President Trump just yesterday, and I bring his warm wishes to all the people of India, especially his dear friend, the incredible Prime Minister Modi.""... It is great to be here as the United States' Ambassador. I come to this remarkable nation with profound respect and a clear mission: to take the partnership between our two nations to the next level. This is the intersection between the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy... During my last dinner with him, President Trump recounted his last visit to India and also his great friendship with the great Prime Minister of India. I hope the President will be visiting us soon, hopefully in the next year or two,” he added.","'Real Friends Can Disagree, But...': US Envoy Sergio Gor On India-US Ties, Comments On Trade Deal.

Shaksgam Valley Row Deepens As China Rejects India’s Claim And Defends CPEC Infra Project With Pak





China on Monday reaffirmed its territorial claims over Jammu and Kashmir Shaksgam Valley and defended its infrastructure projects in the region, rejecting India’s objections and insisting the construction is “beyond reproach”.Responding to India’s objections last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the area belongs to China and that Beijing is well within its rights to carry out development activities there.“The territory you mentioned belongs to China,” Mao told reporters. “It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory. China and Pakistan in the 1960s signed a boundary agreement and delimited the boundary between the two countries, which is the right of China and Pakistan as sovereign countries,” she said.India, however, has firmly rejected China’s claims and the legality of the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement under which Pakistan ceded around 5,180 sq km of territory in the Shaksgam Valley to China from areas under its illegal occupation. New Delhi maintains that the region is part of Indian territory.“Shaksgam Valley is Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan ‘boundary agreement’ signed in 1963.We have consistently maintained that the agreement is illegal and invalid,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said on Friday.He further said the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are “an integral and inalienable part of India”, adding that this stance has been “clearly conveyed to Pakistani and Chinese authorities several times”.China, however, rejected India’s objections to CPEC as well, reiterating its long-held position that the project is an economic cooperation initiative. Mao said the corridor is aimed at promoting local socio-economic development and improving people’s livelihoods.“The China-Pakistan boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue and the position remains unchanged,” she said, adding that Beijing believes the “Jammu and Kashmir dispute is left over from history, and should be properly and peacefully resolved in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements”.The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a multi-billion-dollar network of roads, railways and energy projects linking China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port. India opposes it because key segments pass through Indian territory.","China on Monday reaffirmed its territorial claims over Jammu and Kashmir Shaksgam Valley.

Gold price prediction today: What is the gold & silver price outlook in the near-term?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-january-13-2026-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-silver-prices/articleshow/126496127.cms,"While gold may rise further to $4706/$4803, we note that the Fed's concerns may dissipate to some extent. (AI image)

Gold price prediction

today:

Gold prices may trend upwards, but instead of chasing the rally, investors should look to buy on dips, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Here’s his outlook on gold prices:

Gold Performance:

Spot gold, following its monstrous rally of 4.61% to $4510 in the week ending January 9, advanced further to a fresh record high of $4630 on Monday due to escalating geopolitical risks and growing threats to the Fed's independence.

The yellow metal at the time of writing this article was trading at $4622, up 2.48% for the day. The MCX February gold contract at Rs 142,306 was up 2.51%.

Geopolitics watch:

The US President Trump, viewing Greenland of immense strategic security significance for the US, is not ruling out use of force to bring the Island into the folds of the US. His stance has rattled the European nations; thus, creating friction in the US-led NATO alliance that has been in place since the second World War.

Germany and the UK, to restrain the US manoeuvres over Greenland, are discussing plans for a military presence in Greenland. Germany will propose setting up a joint NATO mission to protect the Arctic region as the UK urges allies to beef up their security presence in the High North.

It is to be noted that the majority of Greenlanders support independence from Denmark and strongly oppose US control.

The US President Trump said Sunday that although his administration was in talks with Tehran to set up a meeting, he may act before then due to mounting death tolls and the Iranian government arresting protestors. As per the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency, at least 572 people, including 69 members of security forces, have been killed in the ongoing protests.

Threat to the Fed's independence:

On January 9, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) launched a grand jury investigation threatening a criminal indictment as the DoJ served the central Bank with subpoenas over the Fed Chair Powell's testimony about the Fed's building renovations that incurred around $2.50 billion expenses. The subpoenas are related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June 2025.

Pushing back against the US Administration’s action to indict the Fed, Powell in a video statement released Sunday, called the threat of criminal indictment as pretexts to undermine the Fed's independence in setting monetary policy.

The fresh episode of Trump escalating battle with the Fed is yet another attack on the Central Bank’s independence for not kowtowing to the Administration to cut rates swiftly.

However, the Trump Administration's latest attempt to corner the Fed is facing bipartisan pushback as Senator Tillis, a key Republican on the Banking Committee, blasting the justice probe, vowed to oppose any Trump nominees to the Fed until the matter is resolved.

Democrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer condemned the probe saying Trump is abusing law to control the central Bank.

Data roundup:

US nonfarm payrolls data released Friday showed a stabilizing but a weak US job market as nonfarm payrolls rose 50K in January Vs the forecast of 70K. Although the unemployment rate unexpectedly edged lower to 4.4% from 4.5% in November Vs the estimate of 4.5%, it could be because of shrinking job pool as fewer people looked for jobs. Two-month payroll net revision stood at -76K jobs. Nonfarm payrolls 3-month average was noted to be -22K.

US Dollar Index and yields:

On Monday, the US Dollar Index fell 0.4% to 98.76 on mounting risks to the Fed's independence.

Two-year US yields rose by around 1 bps to 3.54%, while ten-year yields at 4.18% were up 1.50 bps.

US equities recovered most of the intra-day losses and were only slightly lower.

ETF holdings:

Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 98.95 MOz as of January 9, 0.003 MOz lower YTD.

Upcoming data:

Focus will be on the US CPI data to be released on January 13. University of Michigan Sentiment and inflation expectations (January 9), PPI (January 14) and retail sales (January 14) will also be in focus.

Gold Price Outlook:

While gold may rise further to $4706/$4803, we note that the Fed's concerns may dissipate to some extent on bipartisan opposition to the Trump Administration’s stance. Geopolitical risks may provide more sustainable support to the metal, though.

Buying the dips is preferred over chasing the rallies. Immediate resistance is at $4655, while support kicks in at $4550/$4500/$4400.

It is worth noting that despite elevated geopolitical risks to the Fed’s authority, risk appetite remains healthy. Sharp rallies in metals have become highly correlated with the risk assets though with a relatively higher beta. Moves in yields have been muted despite risk to the Fed.

Silver: Up over 5%

Spot silver prices caught strong bids right from the overnight COMEX session opening and the metal remained buoyant throughout the day. It rose to a fresh record high of $86.21.

At the time of writing, spot silver was changing hands at $85.28, up 7.57% for the day. The MCX March silver contract at Rs 270,423 was up 7% for the day.

Earlier, the grey metal surged 9.67% to $79.85 in the week ending January 9.

ETF:

Total known global ETF silver ETF holdings stood at 853.04 MOz as of January 9, down by around 10.50 MOz YTD.

Lease rates:

One-month LBMA lease rate stood at 3.36%, elevated on a historical basis, but down from 7%+ rates seen a few days ago.

Silver Price Outlook:

Silver is expected to maintain its positive momentum but is quite extended at the current level.

Moves in precious metals are in tandem with moves in risk assets and industrial metal copper, therefore, momentum buying is also visible in these parabolic moves.

Lease rates and ETF inflows have eased, which is not so supportive for the metal.

Nonetheless, spot silver can extend its rally to $87.30/$89.33 unless derailed by much hotter than expected US CPI data. Support is at $83.75/$80.

Buying the dips with a suitable stoploss is preferable over rally chasing trading.

Overall, we maintain a constructive outlook on the metal, though sharp intermittent corrections are likely to punctuate the rallies, which would be deemed as healthy corrections.

Budget 2026 expectations: Put more money in people’s hands to boost growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-put-more-money-in-peoples-hands-to-boost-growth/articleshow/126498956.cms,"If Budget 2026 is to accelerate growth meaningfully, it must leave more money in the hands of taxpayers.

Rework basic exemption and tax slabs to reflect inflation reality

Update Home Loan Interest Deduction to Match Market Prices

Expand Section 80D to Tackle Rising Healthcare Costs

Increase Standard Deduction to Ease Employment Costs

Bring Tax Parity for LLPs and Partnership Firms

Reward GST Compliance Through Income Tax Incentives

Allow Inter-State Services for Composition Dealers

(Umesh Kumar Jethani is co-founder, Apkireturn)

As India pushes towards the $5-trillion economy milestone, the Union Budget 2026 has a pivotal opportunity to fuel this growth. Consumption remains the most reliable engine of the Indian economy. Yet, rising inflation, higher EMIs and mounting compliance costs have steadily eroded disposable incomes, especially for the salaried class and MSMEs.If Budget 2026 is to accelerate growth meaningfully, it must leave more money in the hands of taxpayers while making compliance simpler and fairer. Against this backdrop, the following measures can pump money into the economy and support the salaried class and small businesses:The 30% tax bracket now applies from ₹24 lakh onwards—a threshold that no longer reflects urban living costs or salary inflation. To restore purchasing power and reward upward mobility, the highest slab should begin at ₹36-40 lakh. This adjustment would immediately increase discretionary spending among middle and upper-middle income earners, translating into higher consumption and tax buoyancy over time. With prices rising across essentials, the basic exemption limit must move up to at least ₹5 lakh. The Section 87A rebate should also be accordingly recalibrated.The housing sector has a strong multiplier effect across several sectors, including steel, cement, labour and financial services. However, with property prices and EMIs soaring, the ₹2 lakh cap under Section 24(b) has become outdated. Doubling it to ₹4 lakh would provide a meaningful incentive for homebuyers, revive housing demand and support the broader economy.Healthcare inflation far outpaces headline CPI. Yet, deductions for medical insurance under Section 80D remain constrained. Raising the limit to ₹1–1.25 lakh would encourage adequate insurance coverage and reduce households’ dependence on savings during medical emergencies—strengthening financial resilience.The standard deduction under Section 16(ia) should be raised to ₹1 lakh and made uniform across both tax regimes. This would account for rising employment-related expenses such as commuting, technology and skill upgradation. To manage fiscal impact, the benefit could be withdrawn for salaries exceeding ₹1 crore, ensuring progressivity without diluting relief for the mass salaried class.While companies enjoy a 25% corporate tax rate, LLPs and partnership firms continue to be taxed at 30%. This disparity discourages small business formation and scale-up. Aligning their tax rate with corporate entities would promote entrepreneurship, expansion and job creation—without distorting the tax base.Formalisation cannot rely solely on penalties. To widen the tax base, GST-compliant businesses should receive tangible income-tax incentives or rebates. Such a carrot-based approach would encourage voluntary compliance, expand registrations and improve revenue sustainability.Service providers under the GST Composition Scheme are barred from inter-state trade, severely limiting growth opportunities. Allowing inter-state supply of services would open national markets to small service providers, boost incomes and strengthen economic integration—without undermining revenue.","If Budget 2026 is to accelerate growth meaningfully, it must leave more money in the hands of taxpayers, says Umesh Kumar Jethani.

PSLV fails for 2nd time in 9 months; 3rd-stage glitch costs 16 satellites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pslv-fails-for-2nd-time-in-9-months-3rd-stage-glitch-costs-16-satellites/articleshow/126492197.cms,"Two consecutive failures in eight months

Third Stage Trouble Strikes Again: Inside ISRO’s PSLV-C62 Deviation And What The Failure Means Ahead

Things started going wrong 8 min after launch, says Isro chairman

SRIHARIKOTA/BENGALURU: India's first space mission of 2026 failed on Monday after Isro's workhorse PSLV suffered a glitch in its solid-propellant third stage (PS3), costing 16 satellites and an ambitious project of strategic, diplomatic and commercial importance.The PSLV-C62 failure comes nine months after a glitch in the same third stage of PSLV-C61 prevented EOS-09, another strategic satellite, from reaching orbit on May 18, 2025. This is also the first time PSLV has failed consecutively. The main satellite was EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a DRDO satellite designed to give India's military sharper eyes in space through a hyperspectral imaging payload.Towards the end of the third stage we saw a little more disturbance in the vehicle roll rates and subsequently there was a deviation in the flight path. We are analysing the data,” Isro chairman V Narayanan said. Isro is yet to make public the failure analysis report of the PSLV-C61 mission. All appeared good on Monday when the 44.4-m PSLV, flying its fifth mission in dual strapon configuration, lifted off from SDSC’s first launch pad at 10.18 am, about 1.30 minutes after the scheduled time.About 8 minutes and 40 seconds later, between the thirdstage shut-off and fourthstage (PS4) ignition, something went wrong.Soon, Narayanan announced the mission had failed. It also carried a satellite (Munal) for Nepal and a technology demonstrator (AyulSat) from start-up OrbitAID aimed at cracking on-orbit refuelling, along with 13 other payloads.Also read: Isro sees warning in two consecutive PSLV failures AyulSAT, which was to demonstrate fuel transfer internally and later act as a target satellite for OrbitAID’s chaser satellite planned about six months later, would have put India a step closer to testing on-orbit refuelling. China is the only country which now has on-orbit refuelling technology. OrbitAID founder and CEO Sakthikumar R told TOI on Monday: “We are now forced to launch both the target and chaser satellites together. We hope to do that later this year.”The rocket also carried satellites from the UK, Brazil, Thailand and Spain, apart from payloads developed by Indian startups demonstrating several technologies, including AI processing in orbit, store-andforward communication systems, IoT services, radiation measurement, agricultural data collection, and a re-entry capsule to be deployed after re-start and deorbit of the PS4 stage. This failure is the third launch setback for Isro since Jan 2025 — GSLV-F15, which carried the NVS-02 navigation satellite, failed to place the satellite in geostationary orbit due to a propulsion system malfunction.","India's first space mission of 2026 failed on Monday after Isro's workhorse PSLV suffered a glitch in its solid-propellant third stage.

Casey Stoner Unleashed: MotoGP Legend's Rise, Riches, and Life Today!





Casey Stoner and Adriana Tuchyna Stoner's net worth stability and diversification from 2021 to 2026

The husband-wife duo of Casey Stoner and Adriana Tuchyna Stoner leveraged their combined wealth through Stoner's championship-caliber MotoGP career and deliberately kept the majority of their finances private following Casey's retirement. The couple’s combined net worth in 2026 is estimated between $20 and $25 million based on their reported racing salaries, championship bonus payments, and endorsement deals, as well as Casey's post-retirement roles. As the couple has not disclosed precise numbers for many reasons, including privacy concerns, the estimated amounts are purely industry estimates.According to MotoGP official profiles, Casey Stoner's early retirement from MotoGP is one of the primary influences on how he and Adriana Tuchyna Stoner have maintained and increased their wealth. They prioritized long-term stability over continued exposure in commercial ventures.According to Forbes Australia's athlete earnings coverage , the couple had an estimated combined net worth of between $18 and $20 million by 2016. As a result of Casey's championship-winning seasons with Ducati and Honda, he was able to sign multi-million dollar contracts annually and received performance bonuses.Adriana's role as a stay-at-home mother and their mutual reluctance to pursue any high-visibility endorsement opportunities resulted in only certain limited commercially available products being endorsed by the couple's names.Their ultimate source of supplemental income included a few ambassador positions, limited media appearances, and manufacturer relationships. This allowed them to continue to maintain the value of their current position, but without aggressive growth.Between 2021 and 2023, Casey Stoner continued to maintain a selective involvement in motorsport through ambassador positions, casual media appearances, and consulting. According to Motorsport.com , by managing previous income, they have kept their estimated combined net worth between $20 and $22 million over this time period.Casey and Adriana's financial situation was stable from 2024 to 2026, rather than explosive. According to Idol Net Worth, the financial analysts project the couple's total combined net worth to be between $20 and $25 million in 2026. Therefore, while they have not obtained competitive new contract earnings through their respective careers, their continued commitment to the professions and the preservation of previous income has resulted in maintaining their current financial status quo, with modest post-retirement income.The financial history of Casey Stoner and Adriana Tuchyna Stoner illustrates a unique story in elite sport of an athlete followed by the intention to withdraw from the public eye, with a commitment to family, health, and long-term financial security, rather than increasing commercial success post-retirement.Also Read: Casey Stoner was bewildered by the marshalls who stopped him from rejoining the German MotoGP race after a last-lap crash","The husband-wife duo of Casey Stoner and Adriana Tuchyna Stoner leveraged their combined wealth through Stoner's championship-caliber MotoGP career.

Elon Musk leads the league for the fifth year in a row, with a staggering $717.9 billion wealth that has nearly doubled in the last several years. In contrast, newcomers have joined this league as a result of AI and semiconductor storms, as well as anticipated investments. The symbolic wealth levels of this important few contrast with the growing disparity between the issues of the globe and the super-rich.As of 2026, the world’s wealthiest men continue to amass staggering fortunes despite global economic challenges. According to Forbes, the top 10 richest men, led by Elon Musk, now hold combined wealth exceeding $3 trillion, dominating sectors from technology and AI to luxury, fashion, and global investments, reshaping markets, influencing policy, driving innovation, and redefining modern economic power.Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.The value of Musk's net worth escalated from 2021’s $300 billion to 2026's $717.9 billion because of the phenomenal performance of electric cars, space exploration, and social media reach. Musk's entry and eventual support or endorsement of Donald Trump in politics made news but made no tangible contribution to or subtraction from his net worth. Tesla is leading in global electric cars, while SpaceX is working towards making rocket technology reusable. Musk's projects also cover energy storage, AI, and neural tech, providing him with multiple income streams. Musk's increases in net worth despite controversies, disagreements with authorities, or unpleasant encounters with influential persons in social media like Twitter make him the richest person in planet Earth.Co-founder of Google, Larry Page, has leaped to the second position in the worldwide list. There has been a remarkable increase in his wealth from 133.1 billion to 258.3 billion dollars in one year alone. Though Larry has kept himself away from the limelight, he has been pursuing long-term ventures such as the “moonshot” projects of Alphabet, which comprises self-driving automobiles and AI-based health care. Though he is no longer actively involved with Google, his impact on the company’s planning has ensured an increase in his wealth. He is the epitome of success for innovators who firmly believe that innovations related to the tech infrastructure of data enterprises will result in massive returns.Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who holds 98% ownership of Lāna‘i in Hawaii, has moved up to the third position for 2026. This follows his net worth rising from $199.5 billion. He has also served as a technology advisor for Artificial Intelligence policy and strategy with expertise gleaned from his years at Oracle. He has diversified his portfolio, including involvement with ‘real estate, sailing, and life sciences. Ellison has demonstrated his capacity to engage with entrepreneurship and diversify his reach globally, keeping him relevant as one of the most significant stakeholders among the wealthy across the world.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has slipped to the fourth position, down from $248.1 billion last year. Bezos is a visibly successful person due to his dominance in online e-commerce, cloud computing through AWS, and media ventures like Prime Video. Bezos has had enormous success due to decades of expansion, acquisitions, and reach, but he still invests in space technology through Blue Origin, along with philanthropic work in climate change and healthcare.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, is at number five with a net worth of $238.4 billion. The position is an improvement from last year, when he ranked fifth with a net worth of $155.4 billion. Sergey Brin's net worth has been strengthened by Alphabet’s success in AI, cloud computing technology, and autonomous driving technology. Sergey Brin is still engaged in innovation and is a major beneficiary of Alphabet's long-term initiatives.Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has also minutely slid out from the top five richest people, with a wealth ranking of $223 billion from the previous year’s assessment of $219.9 billion. Mark Zuckerberg keeps pushing the initiatives for the “metaverse,” AI, and social networking. Zuckerberg’s presence in shaping technology policies and trends around the world has not changed, even though there are certain fluctuations.France's luxury leader, Bernard Arnault, has fallen to the sixth spot from the first position in 2024, but the value of his net worth, which is sourced from the success of LVMH as well as brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora, is still a remarkable $192.4 billion, slightly lower from the previous year's $195.1 billion, thus symbolizing the timeless use value of exclusive luxury products.A Taiwanese national, Nvidia's co-founder, Jensen Huang, has experienced tremendous growth because of the AI and silicon revolution. His net worth increased from 128.4 billion to 163.9 billion dollars. Huang's vision to develop chips for the gaming, AI, and data center markets has made him one of the leading tech billionaires globally.The 95-year-old investment guru and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has an estimated net worth of $146.8 billion, a marginal improvement from $143.4 billion. The key to Mr. Buffett’s achievement is his long period of value investing and his knack for investing in businesses during favorable times and diversifying his investment portfolios across various sectors.Amancio Ortega, the Spanish fashion tycoon behind Zara, is still a giant in the industry with an estimated wealth of 145 billion dollars. His success in the fast-fashion industry has been fueled by expansion and supply chain management. Amancio Ortega proves that the success in the affordable fashion industry translates to the accumulation of unimaginable wealth.","Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.

"US sanctions Iran: Additional 25% tariffs to have minimal impact on India, say government sources",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-sanctions-iran-additional-25-tariffs-to-have-minimal-impact-on-india-say-government-sources-heres-why/articleshow/126506774.cms,"AI image (Picture credit: Google Gemini)

US Threatens 25% Tariff on India-Iran Trade, Indian Rice Exporters Warn of Losses

India is unlikely to face any major impact from the 25 per cent tariff announced by the US President Donald Trump on countries doing business with Iran, as per government sources cited by news agency ANI, who pointed to India’s limited trade exposure with Tehran.Newly announced US tariffs are ‘likely to have minimal impact on India’ as Iran does not feature among the nation's top 50 trading partners, the government sources said.India’s total trade with Iran stood at around $1.6 billion last year, accounting for just 0.15 per cent of India’s overall trade.This figure is expected to decline further in the current financial year due to broader external economic factors.Of Iran’s total imports of about $68 billion in 2024, the UAE, China, Turkiye and the European Union together accounted for the bulk, while India’s share was only $1.2 billion, or 2.3 per cent.Exporters have also downplayed concerns. Ajay Sahai, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), said Indian companies and banks remain fully compliant with US Office of Foreign Assets Control norms and engage only in permitted humanitarian trade, mainly food items and pharmaceuticals, reported news agency PTI.“There is, therefore, no basis to anticipate any adverse impact on India,” Sahai said.He noted that India’s trade with Iran largely falls outside the scope of sanctions due to its humanitarian nature.In 2024-25, India’s total trade with Iran was $1.68 billion, including $1.24 billion in exports, primarily from the farm and pharmaceutical sectors, as per PTI.Industry representatives, however, flagged other challenges. Sahai said the sharp depreciation of the Iranian currency is a bigger concern for exporters, as it weakens consumer purchasing power and raises risks of cancelled contracts.Rice exporters also said their current exposure to Iran is limited and increasingly routed through the UAE to manage risks, reported ANI.Overall, exporters remain cautious but believe the proposed US tariff will have little direct effect on India, given the small trade volumes and the humanitarian nature of most shipments.","Newly announced US tariffs are ‘likely to have minimal impact on India’ as Iran does not feature among the nation's top 50 trading partners, the government sources said.

Budget 2026 expectations: Deloitte calls for customs duty overhaul; seeks higher allocations for exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-deloitte-calls-for-customs-duty-overhaul-seeks-higher-allocations-for-exports/articleshow/126510650.cms,"Representative image

Rationalising import duties and stepping up budgetary allocations in the upcoming Union Budget could give a strong push to domestic manufacturing and exports, Deloitte India said on Tuesday.The consulting firm said the Budget for 2026-27, which is scheduled to be presented on February 1, should build on the government’s ongoing efforts to strengthen manufacturing at home and improve India’s export competitiveness.It argued that a more balanced customs duty structure would improve export competitiveness.“A key measure would be to further rationalise the customs duty structure,” said Gulzar Didwania, Partner at Deloitte India, as quoted by news agency PTI.He suggested lowering duties on parts and components in sectors where India has already built adequate manufacturing capacity, while increasing duties on finished goods.According to him, this would discourage imports of fully-made products, promote domestic value addition and create a stronger base for exports.Deloitte also pitched for reforms to the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) regime to improve competitiveness and reduce disputes.These include allowing domestic supplies on a duty-forgone basis, easing sub-contracting rules and exempting value addition from customs duty. The firm also suggested a limited customs amnesty scheme to help cut down litigation, as per PTI.Didwania further said the Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP), which has shown positive results in sectors such as mobile phones and electronics, should be extended to other priority manufacturing areas.He added that higher budgetary support for research and development, along with technology upgradation, would help India move up the value chain and export finished products.The firm also called for higher allocations and an extension of the Market Access Initiative (MAI) scheme to strengthen export promotion bodies and help Indian exporters expand their presence in global markets.India’s merchandise exports during April–November 2025-26 rose 2.62 per cent to $292.07 billion, while imports increased 5.59 per cent to $515.21 billion, taking the trade deficit to $223.14 billion.",Deloitte: Budget for 2026-27 should build on efforts to strengthen manufacturing at home.

Budget 2026: COAI seeks cut in telecom licence fee; flags GST burden and ITC pile-up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-coai-seeks-cut-in-telecom-licence-fee-flags-gst-burden-and-itc-pile-up/articleshow/126509594.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: ANI)

India’s telecom industry body COAI has asked the government to reduce regulatory levies and ease Goods and Services Tax (GST) norms in the upcoming Union Budget, arguing that high statutory payments continue to strain the sector’s finances.The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), whose members include Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, has proposed lowering the licence fee to 0.5–1 per cent from the current 3 per cent, saying the existing structure places a heavy burden on telecom operators, reported news agency PTI.At present, the licence fee comprises a 3 per cent levy on Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR), along with a 5 per cent contribution to the Digital Bharat Nidhi.“The licence fee, which is a combination of the licence (three per cent of AGR) and Digital Bharat Nidhi Contribution (five per cent of AGR), is a huge financial burden for the licensed telcos,” COAI said in its submission.The association argued that a reduced levy of 0.5–1 per cent would be sufficient to cover administrative costs.COAI has also urged the Department of Telecommunications to pause further contributions to the Digital Bharat Nidhi until the existing unutilised corpus is fully used.The industry body said such steps would help reduce financial stress and allow operators to invest more in network expansion and next-generation connectivity, in line with the government’s ‘Viksit Bharat’ vision.On GST-related issues, COAI flagged concerns over rising input tax credit (ITC) accumulation in the sector. It recommended a special GST exemption on regulatory payments such as licence fees, spectrum usage charges (SUC), and spectrum acquired through auctions, reported news agency ANI.As an alternative, the association suggested cutting the GST rate under the Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) on these payments to 5 per cent from the current 18 per cent.COAI said this would be revenue-neutral for the government while offering liquidity relief to telecom operators and helping reduce ITC pile-up, as per ANI.COAI director general Lt Gen Dr SP Kochhar said the current levy framework continues to impose a significant financial burden on licensed telecom operators.The association also proposed allowing the use of existing ITC balances to discharge GST liabilities under RCM on licence fees and SUC, a move it said would reduce cash outflows and improve credit utilisation.Emphasising the sector’s wider role, COAI said telecommunications is no longer a standalone vertical but a “horizontal value-added enabler” supporting multiple industries.In this context, it has called for a broader recalibration of spectrum pricing and assignment models to reflect the sector’s strategic importance in India’s digital economy.",The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has proposed lowering the licence fee to 0.5–1 per cent from the current 3 per cent.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has revealed he has no plans to step down from his position at the company anytime soon. He noted that he will remain in charge for now. During a question-and-answer session at CES, 62-year-old Huang said this in response to shareholders' questions about his future at the chipmaker. Huang has led Nvidia since he started the company in 1993. He said he currently has no plans to leave his role, while the company has yet to announce who may replace him in the coming days.Huang attributed his long tenure to his continued interest in the company’s operations and his ability to meet performance expectations.

He noted that the AI chipmaker's performance will not just affect the tech industry but will also impact the entire market.he explained.Huang and Nvidia will have a lot of work to do in the coming years. At CES, Huang announced Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin superchip, which will begin shipping later this year. The company also announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to develop self-driving technology that will compete with Tesla's Autopilot.The Vera Rubin platform, which is named after American astronomer Vera Rubin, who changed how scientists understand galaxy motion, was one of the biggest highlights. It promises to train AI 10 times more efficiently than its previous version, Blackwell. According to Huang, a 10 trillion-parameter model can now be trained in one month using one-quarter of the chips.Huang noted.Huang has been Nvidia's CEO since 1993. He took the company from a stock price of just pennies per share between 1999 and 2016 to more than $187 today, making it the most valuable company in the world.His tenure has been much longer than that of most other tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook (14 years), Meta's Mark Zuckerberg (22 years), and Tesla's Elon Musk (who founded SpaceX in 2002).Born in Taipei in 1963, Huang moved to the US at age nine after his parents sent him to study there. Due to a mistake, he ended up at a tough school in rural Kentucky, where he did chores like cleaning toilets and helped his roommate learn to read.He finished high school at 16, studied electrical engineering, and worked night shifts at a diner to support himself. In 1993, Huang co-founded Nvidia at a Denny’s restaurant.

Microsoft makes 5 promises to everyone in America: We will ensure your electricity bill does not increase and 4 more,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-makes-5-promises-to-everyone-in-america-we-will-ensure-your-electricity-bill-does-not-increase-and-4-more/articleshow/126517590.cms,"Microsoft has stepped up with an ambitious five-step framework aimed at alleviating public unease surrounding AI data centers. The company's commitments include covering electricity expenses in full, ensuring water replenishment, supporting local job creation, honoring property taxes, and facilitating free AI education. These actions are crafted to heal community rifts and safeguard residents against potential spikes in utility bills.

Microsoft will ask utilities to charge it more for electricity

Data centers will replenish more water than they consume

Construction and operations jobs go to local residents first

No asking for property tax breaks from local governments

Free AI training for schools, libraries, and small businesses





Microsoft has unveiled a five-point plan to address growing public anger over AI data centers, promising Americans that its massive infrastructure buildout won't jack up their power bills or drain their water supplies.The announcement came Tuesday after the US President Donald Trump called out the tech giant on Truth Social, saying Microsoft would be ""first up"" among Big Tech companies to commit to keeping utility costs down for everyday households. ""I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,"" Trump wrote Monday night.Microsoft President Brad Smith acknowledged the backlash head-on. ""When I visit communities around the country, people have questions—pointed questions,"" Smith said at an event in Great Falls, Virginia. ""We are at a moment of time when we need to listen.""The company's first commitment is perhaps its boldest. Microsoft says it will work with utility companies and state commissions to set electricity rates high enough to cover the full cost of powering its data centers. The goal is to prevent those costs from trickling down to residential customers who never asked for an AI revolution in their backyard.Water usage has been a flashpoint for data center opponents.Microsoft is promising to return more water to local communities than its facilities withdraw. In Phoenix, for instance, the company has partnered with municipalities to find and fix leaks in aging pipe systems.Microsoft is teaming up with North America's Building Trades Unions to train workers in regions where data centers are being built. The company also plans to expand its Datacenter Academy program through local community colleges for ongoing operations roles.Most big corporations haggle for tax breaks when they roll into town. Microsoft says it won't. The company is committing to pay full property taxes wherever it builds. In Quincy, Washington — a small agricultural community where Microsoft opened its first data center back in 2008 — county tax revenues have jumped from $60 million to over $180 million. That money helped the town open a new 54,000-square-foot medical center last year while rural hospitals elsewhere were shutting down.Microsoft is pledging to partner with K-12 schools, community colleges, and local libraries to provide AI literacy training. Small businesses will also get access to AI tools and workforce development resources.The promises come after Microsoft scrapped a data center project in Caledonia, Wisconsin last October following intense community opposition. Hundreds of residents in Michigan also turned out Monday night to protest another proposed Microsoft facility.","Microsoft has unveiled a five-point plan to address growing public anger over AI data centers.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ However, he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

Bill Gates pens the year 2026 note; says: Thing I am most upset about is ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-pens-the-year-2026-note-says-thing-i-am-most-upset-about-is-/articleshow/126450754.cms,"Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Here’s Bill Gates annual 2026 letter in full

Optimism with footnotes

As we start 2026, I am thinking about how the year ahead will set us up for the decades to come.

I have always been an optimist. When I founded Microsoft, I believed a digital revolution powered by great software would make the world a better place. When I started the

Gates Foundation

, I saw an opportunity to save and improve millions of lives because critical areas like children’s health were getting so little money.

In both cases, the results exceeded my expectations. We are far better off than when I was born 70 years ago. I believe the world will keep improving—but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time.

Friends and colleagues often ask me how I stay optimistic in an era with so many challenges and so much polarization. My answer is this:

I am still an optimist because I see what innovation accelerated by artificial intelligence will bring.

But these days, my optimism comes with footnotes.

The thing I am most upset about is the fact that the world went backwards last year on a key metric of progress: the number of deaths of children under 5 years old. Over the last 25 years, those deaths went down faster than at any other point in history. But in 2025, they went up for the first time this century, from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025—an increase driven by less support from rich countries to poor countries.

This trend will continue unless we make progress in restoring aid budgets.

The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools. Yet I remain optimistic about the long-term future. As hard as last year was, I don’t believe we will slide back into the Dark Ages.

I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress.

The key will be, as always, innovation. Consider this: An HIV diagnosis used to be a death sentence. Today, thanks to revolutionary treatments, a person with HIV can expect to live almost as long as someone without the virus. By the 2040s, new innovations could virtually eliminate deaths from HIV/AIDS.

Budget cuts limit how many people benefit from lifesaving tools, as we saw to devastating effect last year. But nothing can erase the fact that for decades we didn’t know how to save people from HIV, and now we do.

Breakthroughs are a bell that cannot be unrung. They ensure that we will never go back to the world in 2000 where over 10 million children died from preventable causes every year—and they form the core of my optimism about where the world is headed.

But as I mentioned, there are footnotes to my optimism. Although the innovation pipeline sets us up for long-term success, the trajectory of progress hinges on how the world addresses three key questions.

1. Will a world that is getting richer increase its generosity toward those in need?

The “golden rule” precept is more important now than ever with the record disparities in wealth. This idea of treating others as you wish to be treated does not just apply to rich countries giving aid. It must also include philanthropy from the wealthy to help those in need—both domestically and globally—which should grow rapidly in a world with a record number of billionaires and even centibillionaires.

Through the Giving Pledge, I get to work with a number of incredible philanthropists who set a great example by giving away substantial portions of their wealth in smart ways. However, more needs to be done to encourage higher levels of generosity from the rich and to show how fulfilling and impactful it can be.

More needs to be done to encourage higher levels of generosity from the rich and to show how fulfilling and impactful it can be.

Turning to aid budgets for poor countries, I am worried about one number: If funding for health decreases by 20 percent, 12 million more children could die by 2045. I know cuts won’t be reversed overnight, even though aid represented less than 1 percent of GDP even in the most generous countries. But it is critical that we restore some of the funding. The foundation’s Goalkeepers report lays out what is at risk and how the world can best spend the aid it gives.

I will spend much of my year working with partners to advocate for increased funding for the health of the world’s children. I plan to engage with a number of communities, including health care workers, religious groups, and members of diaspora communities to help make this case.

2. Will the world prioritize scaling innovations that improve equality?

Some problems require doing far more than just letting market incentives take their course.

The first critical area is climate change. Without a large global carbon tax (which is, unfortunately, politically unachievable), market forces do not properly incentivize the creation of technologies to reduce climate-related emissions.

Yet only by replacing all emitting activities with cheaper alternatives will we stop the temperature increase. This is why I started Breakthrough Energy 10 years ago and why I will continue to put billions into innovation.

The world has made meaningful progress in the last decade, cutting projected emissions by more than 40 percent. But we still have a lot of innovation and scaling up to do in tough areas like industrial emissions and aviation. Government policies in rich countries are still critical because unless innovations reach scale, the costs won’t come down and we won’t achieve the impact we need.

If we don’t limit climate change, it will join poverty and infectious disease in causing enormous suffering, especially for the world’s poorest people.

Since even in the best case the temperature will continue to go up, we also need to innovate to minimize the negative impacts.

This is called climate adaptation, and a critical example is helping farmers in poor countries with better seeds and better advice so they can grow more even in the face of climate change. Using AI, we will soon be able to provide poor farmers with better advice about weather, prices, crop diseases, and soil than even the richest farmers get today.

The foundation has committed $1.4 billion to supporting farmers on the frontlines of extreme weather.

I will be investing and giving more than ever to climate work in the years ahead while also continuing to give more to children’s health, the foundation’s top priority. The need to ensure money is spent on the most important priorities was the topic of a memo I wrote in the fall.

A second critical area where the world must focus on innovation-driven equality is health care.

Concerns about healthcare costs and quality are higher than ever in all countries.

In theory, people should feel optimistic about the state of health care with the incredible pipeline of innovations. For example, a recent breakthrough in diagnosing Alzheimer’s will revolutionize how we test for—and ultimately prevent—this disease, saving billions of dollars in costs. (Funding Alzheimer’s research is a particular focus for me.)

There’s similar progress on obesity and cancer, as well as on problems in developing countries like malaria, TB, and malnutrition.

Despite so much progress, however, the cost and complexity of the system means very few people are satisfied with their care. I believe we can improve health care dramatically in all countries by using AI not only to accelerate the development of innovations but directly in the delivery of health care.

Like many of you, I already use AI to better understand my own health. Just imagine what will be possible as it improves and becomes available for every patient and provider. Always-available, high-quality medical advice will improve medicine by every measure.

We aren’t quite there yet—developers still have work to do on reliability and how we connect the AI to doctors and nurses so they are empowered to check and override the system.

But I’m optimistic we will soon begin to scale access globally. I am following this work so the Gates Foundation and partners can make sure this capability is available in the countries that need it most—where there aren’t enough medical personnel—at the same time it is available elsewhere.

We are already working on pilots and making sure that even relatively uncommon African languages are fully supported.

Governments will have to play a central role in leading the implementation of AI into their health systems.

This is another case where the market alone won’t and can’t provide the solution.

A third and final area I will mention briefly is education. AI gives us a chance for the kind of personalized learning to keep students motivated that we have dreamed of in the past. This is now a focus of the Gates Foundation’s spending on education, and I am hopeful it will be empowering to both teachers and students. I’ve seen this firsthand in New Jersey, and it will be game changing as we scale it for the world.

All three of these areas—climate, health, and education—can improve rapidly with the right government focus. This year I will spend a lot of time meeting with pioneers all over the world to see which countries are doing the best work so we can spread best practices.

3. Will we minimize negative disruptions caused by AI as it accelerates?

Of all the things humans have ever created, AI will change society the most. It will help solve many of our current problems while also bringing new challenges very different from past innovations.

When people in the AI space predict that AGI or fully humanoid robots will come soon and then those deadlines are missed, it creates the impression that these things will never happen. However, there is no upper limit on how intelligent AIs will get or on how good robots will get, and I believe the advances will not plateau before exceeding human levels.

The two big challenges in the next decade are use of AI by bad actors and disruption to the job market.

Both are real risks that we need to do a better job managing. We’ll need to be deliberate about how this technology is developed, governed, and deployed.

In 2015, I gave a TED talk warning that the world was not ready to handle a pandemic. If we had prepared properly for the Covid pandemic, the amount of human suffering would have been dramatically less. Today, an even greater risk than a naturally caused pandemic is that a non-government group will use open source AI tools to design a bioterrorism weapon.

We’ll need to be deliberate about how AI is developed, governed, and deployed.

The second challenge is job market disruption. AI capabilities will allow us to make far more goods and services with less labor. In a mathematical sense, we should be able to allocate these new capabilities in ways that benefit everyone. As AI delivers on its potential, we could reduce the work week or even decide there are some areas we don’t want to use AI in.

The effects of this disruption are hard to model. Sometimes, when a game-changing technology improves rapidly, it drives more demand at lower cost and, by making the world richer, increases demand in other areas. For example, AI makes software developers at least twice as efficient, which makes coding cheaper while also creating demand elasticity for code. (Computing is a good historical example where lower costs actually caused the overall market to grow.

)

Even with this complexity, the rate of improvement is already starting to be enough to disrupt job demand in areas like software development. Other areas like warehouse work or phone support are not quite there yet, but once the AIs become more capable, the job disruption will be more immediate.

We’re already starting to see the impact of AI on the job market, and I think this impact will grow over the next five years. Even if the transition takes longer than I expect, we should use 2026 to prepare ourselves for these changes—including which policies will best help spread the wealth and deal with the important role jobs play in our society.

Different political parties will likely suggest different approaches.

By including these footnotes, particularly the last one, some readers may find my continued optimism even more surprising. But as we start 2026, I remain optimistic about the days ahead because of two core human capabilities.

The first is our ability to anticipate problems and prepare for them, and therefore ensure that our new discoveries make all of us better off. The second is our capacity to care about each other. Throughout history, you can always find stories of people tending not just to themselves or their clan or their country but to the greater good.

Those two qualities—foresight and care—are what give me hope as the year begins. As long as we keep exercising those abilities, I believe the years ahead can be ones of real progress.





Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has written his annual letter for 2026, expressing a rare and “upsetting” shift in global progress. While maintaining long-term optimism, Gates revealed that a critical metric of human health has moved backward: child mortality. Gates noted that the trend will continue unless we make progress in restoring aid budgets.In his annual letter titled, “Optimism with footnotes”, Gates highlighted that for the first time since 2000, the number of deaths for children under the age of five increased, rising from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025. He also noted that while AI-driven innovation in health and climate is accelerating, the “trajectory of progress” is currently under threat by multiple factors: dwindling generosity, climate and health equality and AI disruptions.Gates remains confident that the “innovation pipeline” will eventually spark a new era of progress.","Gates: I believe the world will keep improving, but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time. Gates: I am most upset about the fact that the world went backwards last year on a key metric of progress.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126450746,imgsize-1409239,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-co-founder-bill-gates.jpg"

Meta shifts focus from Metaverse to AI





Facebook parent company Meta has begun restructuring of its Reality Labs division, initiating job cuts that are expected to impact more than 1,000 employees, a report has said. According to Bloomberg, affected employees were notified starting Tuesday morning (January 13 US time) following an internal memo from Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Andrew Bosworth.The report claims that in the post, Bosworth called the cuts as a necessary step to create a “more sustainable” business model for the division. It also signals a strategic backstep from the company’s focus on the “metaverse” in favour of opportunities in Artificial Intelligence (AI) wearables and mobile integration.“With the larger potential user base and the fastest growth rate today, we are shifting teams and resources almost exclusively to mobile to continue to accelerate adoption there,” Bosworth wrote, according to Bloomberg report.Reality Labs has been the primary focus for Meta’s virtual and augmented reality ambitions but the unit has bled billions since its inception. The division reportedly employs roughly 15,000 workers. While the company has not officially confirmed the total number of departures, the report suggest the reduction will hit approximately 10% of the division's workforce.A Meta spokesperson confirmed the shift in strategy, noting that the company had previously signaled a shift from purely virtual environments toward wearable technology, like Ray-Ban Meta Glasses.“We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from metaverse toward wearables. This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year,” the spokesperson told Bloomberg.Meanwhile, a separate report claims that Meta and EssilorLuxottica are considering doubling the production capacity of smart glasses to 20 million units annually by the end of this year. Bloomberg News reported that the potential increase is driven by strong demand, and may also see capacity exceed 30 million units.",Reality Labs has been the primary focus for Meta’s virtual and augmented reality ambitions but the unit has bled billions since its inception.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
