US rejects 15 mango shipments from India, exporters estimate losses of $500,000",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/forced-to-destroy-us-rejects-15-mango-shipments-from-india-exporters-estimate-losses-of-500000/articleshow/121245665.cms,"United States is India's primary export destination for mangoes. (AI image)

Mango Shipments to US rejected

US authorities have rejected no fewer than 15 mango shipments from India at various airports, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlanta, due to documentation irregularities. The exporters faced the choice of either destroying the fruit in the US or sending it back to India. Given the perishable nature of mangoes and the substantial costs involved in return shipping, all exporters opted to dispose of the mango shipments locally.The United States represents India's primary export destination for mangoes, making these incidents particularly significant for the trade relationship.Considering mangoes are perishable and the substantial expenses linked to destruction or re-exportation, traders anticipate losses of around $500,000.The mangoes had undergone the required irradiation process in Mumbai on May 8 and 9. However, according to an ET report US officials found inconsistencies in the documentation related to this mandatory treatment, which involves exposing the fruit to controlled radiation doses to eliminate pests and prolong shelf life. The issue stemmed from administrative errors in the pest-control documentation rather than actual pest presence, the report said. USDA communication to an affected exporter indicated that US Customs and Border Protection refused entry ""due to incorrectly issued PPQ203."" The notice specified that the shipment ""must be re-exported or destroyed,"" whilst clarifying that the US government would not bear costs for ""remedial measures for this shipment.""The irradiation procedure takes place at a facility situated in Navi Mumbai, overseen by a US Department of Agriculture (USDA) representative. This official is tasked with validating the PPQ203 form, which is essential for mango exports to the US. ""We are being penalised for mistakes made at the irradiation facility,"" an exporter said.Also Read | Why India can be a big winner of Donald Trump 2.0 era if it plays its cards right Another exporter, whose consignment was detained at Los Angeles airport during May 9-11, before receiving destruction orders, was notified that the shipment failed to satisfy the ""entry requirement,"" specifically regarding the mandatory irradiation treatment.The exporter firmly denied the allegation, asserting that the irradiation procedure was completed and the PPQ203 form was issued following the treatment. ""How can we receive the form if the treatment was never done? And without that form, issued by none other than the USDA officer, the mangoes couldn't even have been cleared for loading at Mumbai airport,"" he said.When asked about the specifics of the case, including the quantity of affected mangoes and documentation discrepancies, the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Authority (APEDA) chairman's office responded, ""The matter pertains to the shipment of mangoes from USDA approved facility, Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB) located at Vashi, Mumbai. Hence inputs may be sought from them. "" APEDA operates under the ministry of commerce and industry. MSAMB did not provide any response to the email enquiry.Meanwhile, India and US are looking to seal a trade deal soon. US President Donald Trump has claimed that India has offered a deal with 'literally no tariffs'. The first phase of the deal is expected to be completed in the coming months.India aims to enhance two-way trade by seeking tariff reductions from the United States for sectors employing large workforces. These include textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods, garments, plastics, chemicals, shrimp, oil seeds, chemicals, grapes, and bananas under the proposed trade agreement.The United States, in return, seeks reduced duties across various sectors including industrial products, automobiles (specifically electric vehicles), wines, petrochemical products, dairy items, agricultural produce such as apples, and tree nuts.According to a Bloomberg report, India is eyeing a three-phase trade deal with the US ahead of July when Trump's reciprocal tariffs become effective.Also Read | Donald Trump says India has offered a trade deal with ‘literally no tariffs’","Mango shipments to US rejected at Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlanta airports.

New law designed to rob Muslims of religious rights over waqf: Kapil Sibal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-law-designed-to-rob-muslims-of-religious-rights-over-waqf-kapil-sibal/articleshow/121301110.cms,"NEW DELHI: Urging Supreme Court to stay the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, the Muslim side claimed that the Union govt intended to expropriate waqf properties by de-recognising unregistered properties, including 'waqf by user', and by taking out ancient monuments such as Taj Mahal and Jama Masjid in Sambhal from the ambit of waqf.Leading a battery of senior advocates for the Muslim side, Kapil Sibal told a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice Augustine G Masih that the 2025 law was ""framed and designed for wholesale capture of waqf properties through a legislative fiat, in a process that is non-judicial and purely executive"".When the CJI said courts prima facie presume a law enacted by Parliament to be valid, Sibal said Waqf Amendment Act was discriminatory as it had singled out the Muslim community by mandating that a waqif has to be a practising Muslim for five years to be entitled to donate his properties for waqf. ""Has any other religious denomination been mandated by law to ask the same question to anyone making an endowment for charitable purposes?"" he asked.Sibal said while laws governing waqfs mandated that only Muslims could be members of Central Waqf Council and state Auqaf Boards, the new law allowed govt to nominate persons who could be non-Muslims and even form the majority in the council and boards, thus taking away the right of Muslims to manage their religious bodies.""No religious endowment of Hindus, Sikhs or Christians allows a non-believer in that religious faith to be a member of their endowment administrative body,"" Sibal said, adding that these provisions in Waqf Amendment Act completely violated Muslims' right to religious activities guaranteed under Articles 25 and 26 of Constitution.He said singling out Muslim community was violative of Article 15, which mandates that no citizen is to be discriminated against on the ground of religion. Since the law was ex facie unconstitutional, its operation needed to be stayed till the SC tested its constitutional validity, he added.Sibal said both the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act of 1904 and its updated version of 1958 provided that any govt takeover of an ancient monument, which is a waqf property, for its preservation would not change its character or hamper Islamic religious rituals there. But the present law completely barred ancient monuments from being counted as waqf property, he added.Sibal said if there was a dispute over waqf land, or it was claimed to be govt land, then a govt-appointed officer would decide the dispute and on the basis of his recommendation, the state would carry out necessary corrections in revenue records. ""The govt's own officer deciding disputes over govt land without any prescribed procedure, without any judicial adjudication, is akin to becoming judge in its own cause,"" he said.Sibal and senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan referred to the Ayodhya judgment of 2019 as 'Babri Masjid case' and said in that judgment, the SC had protected the character of ancient monuments as mandated by the Places of Worship Act, 1991. The Waqf Amendment Act could not override the 1991 Act or the SC's five-judge bench judgment, they said.Senior advocate A M Singhvi said the govt's prejudicial argument that there had been a huge increment in waqf properties since the 2013 amendment was fallacious as waqf properties were always there and their registration on the govt portal had increased over the years. Responding to the CJI's remarks on prima facie presumption of constitutionality of the Waqf Amendment Act, Singhvi said the SC had stayed the three farm laws enacted by Parliament in 2019.","The Muslim side claimed that the Union govt intended to expropriate waqf properties by de-recognising unregistered properties, including 'waqf by user' Kapil Sibal told a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice Augustine G Masih that the 2025 law was ""framed and designed for wholesale capture""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121301119,imgsize-56688,width-400,resizemode-4/121301119.jpg"

Yes, definitely No, current penalties are sufficient

NEW DELHI: Actress Ranya Rao and Tarun Raju on Tuesday were granted default bail by a Bengaluru court in connection with a gold smuggling case , but with strict conditions attached. The bail was granted after the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) failed to file a chargesheet within the legally prescribed period.However, Ranya will remain in custody despite the bail, as she is also facing proceedings under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA).COFEPOSA is a stringent preventive detention law aimed at curbing smuggling and safeguarding foreign exchange reserves.It permits authorities to detain individuals without trial for up to one year based solely on suspicion of their involvement in such offences.The bail was granted on the condition of two sureties each and a bond of Rs 2 lakh.The court also barred both from leaving the country and ordered them not to engage in similar offences.The case surfaced on March 3, when Ranya, also known as Harshavardhani Ranya, was arrested at Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru with 14.8 kilograms of gold allegedly smuggled from Dubai.Earlier, on April 26 the Bengaluru hight court had rejected Rao's bail plea.On March 14 and 27, Ranya Rao’s bail pleas were also rejected by the Special Court for Economic Offences and the Sessions Court, respectively. Tarun Raju, a US citizen and a co-accused in the case, was also denied bail on April 7.Ranya’s counsel, meanwhile had accused the DRI of document manipulation and argued the offences are compoundable. Meanwhile, on April 22, the Central Government issued a detention order against Ranya under the COFEPOSA Act.Authorities valued the seized gold at Rs 12.56 crore. Investigations that followed uncovered that Ranya had travelled alone to Dubai 34 times between 2023 and 2025, raising suspicions of her involvement in a larger gold smuggling network.A subsequent raid on her residence led to the seizure of gold jewellery worth Rs 2.06 crore and Rs 2.67 crore in cash. She has been charged under multiple provisions of Sections 135 and 104 of the Customs Act. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence has also initiated proceedings under Section 108 to probe potential financial violations.","Ranya Rao and Tarun Raju granted default bail by a Bengaluru court.

HASSAN: Heart Lamp , a collection of short stories by city-based Kannada writer Banu Mushtaq , has won the prestigious International Booker Prize 2025 . The book was translated from Kannada to English by Madikeri-based translator Deepa Bhasthi.An advocate and journalist by profession, Banu Mushtaq has made her mark as a storyteller, poet, novelist, and social activist.The award was announced at a ceremony held at London’s Tate Modern. Author Max Porter, who chaired the 2025 judging panel, revealed Heart Lamp as the winner — notably the first short story collection to receive this honour.“Heart Lamp is something genuinely new for English readers,” said Porter. “A radical translation that ruffles language to create new textures in a plurality of Englishes. It challenges and expands our understanding of translation.”He praised the book’s vibrant and uplifting narratives, rooted in Kannada yet enriched with the socio-political depth of various dialects and languages. The stories, he noted, explore themes such as women’s experiences, reproductive rights, faith, caste, power structures, and oppression.“This was the book the judges really loved, right from our first reading,” Porter said. “It’s been a joy to witness the evolving appreciation of these stories through the diverse perspectives of the jury.”After becoming the first Kannada author to win the International Booker Prize, Banu told TOI: “This prize shows the true potential of the Kannada language, its literature, and the possibilities ahead if more works are translated into other languages, especially English.”She emphasized the need to introduce more Kannada literature to a global audience. “There is a need to bring more and more Kannada works to readers around the world,” she said.Recalling the final moments before the announcement, Banu said, “It was very tense. When Max Porter announced Heart Lamp as the winner, it was electrifying. Everyone stood up and began congratulating me.”She described the honour as a shared victory. “This is not individual recognition. It’s recognition of teamwork,” she said, adding that despite the global attention, “My writing will remain the same.”Reflecting on her journey, she signed off with: “Life is amazing — from travelling in bullock carts to standing on this global stage.”","Heart Lamp, a collection of short stories by city-based Kannada writer Banu Mushtaq, has won the prestigious International Booker Prize 2025.

Global outreach teams to justify Indus treaty stand post-Operation Sindoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/global-outreach-teams-to-justify-indus-treaty-stand-post-operation-sindoor/articleshow/121301430.cms,"NC MP skips MEA briefing, no confirmation yet if he'd join tour

NEW DELHI: The all-party delegations headed to different parts of the world as part of the outreach post-Operation Sindoor will apprise foreign capitals of the 'new normal' in India's approach to Pakistan's use of terrorism, including the decision to pause the Indus Waters Treaty In a briefing to members of three delegations, foreign secretary Vikram Misri is learned to have said that Pakistan's nuclear blackmail would no longer allow terrorists to work with impunity and that the military establishment would pay a heavy price for any attempt to carry out attacks in India through its terror proxies. "" Operation Sindoor is our new normal,"" a source quoted Misri as saying, showing that the anti-terror doctrine spelt out by PM Modi at Adampur on May 13 has been baked into foreign policy Misri is also learned to have said India could not adhere to the existing terms of IWT. ""The treaty was negotiated on the assumption of good neighbourliness... It has been belied by Pakistan's use of terrorism because of which we have not been able to realise even the share, inadequate as it was, allocated to us,"" one of the members of the delegation led by JD(U)'s Sanjay Jha told TOI.Moreover, the challenge of climate change makes a relook at the technical design of dams and other projects an absolute necessity, one of the members of the delegation led by JDU's Sanjay Jha told TOI.The doctrine spelt out by PM Modi on May 13 in Adampur signalled India's lower tolerance threshold towards terror as well as its refusal to give in to Pakistan's nuke blackmail.Given the risk of appearing to be insensitive towards a lower riparian state, the boldness on IWT, as articulated by Misri, points to govt's determination to force a re-negotiation of the treaty.Members of the delegations headed by Jha, Shiv Sena's Shrikant Shinde & DMK's Kanimozhi attended the briefings. However, Kanimozhi herself could not attend. NC MP Altaf Ahmed, who is on Kanimozhi's panel, skipped the meet and there was no confirmation till late evening on whether he would be going on the tour.While Tuesday's briefing was intended for the groups departing on May 21, 22 and 23, Misri will brief the remaining delegations on Friday, sharing with them the talking points that can be stressed to familiarise their interlocutors with what India sees as Pakistan's double-dealing on the issue of cross-border terrorism While there has been some talk about India-Pakistan re-hyphenation, govt believes the vast gap in economic fundamentals between the two nations will ultimately prevail, leaving Pakistan far behind in the global imagination.While underscoring the need for the international community to call out Pakistan for its cross-border adventurism over past 40 years, Misri briefed the delegations about how the world asks the two countries to exercise restraint when there's a flare-up of tensions but does not seek accountability from Pakistan even when its role is obvious to all in perpetrating the most heinous acts of terrorism.He cited example of how there had not been enough pressure on Islamabad to bring the guilty to justice in cases like Mumbai and Pathankot attacks. An MP quoted Misri as saying that trusting Pakistan was like ""trusting a chor (thief) to investigate the crime he had committed"".Misri also briefed the delegations about India's decision to put IWT in abeyance till the time Pakistan acted irrevocably against cross-border terrorism. Unfazed by Pakistan's propaganda and its claim that it was an ""act of war"", the delegates are set to take a firm position in defence of govt suspending the treaty.The foreign secretary reiterated India's stand on the issue and urged the delegates to convey to the world that the unrelenting cross-border terrorism from Pakistan interfered with ""our ability"" to exploit the treaty as per its provisions. ""It is only natural and well within India's right to hold the treaty in abeyance when the fundamental ground situations have changed,"" Misri is said to have told the delegates.",All-party delegations headed to different parts of the world as part of the outreach post-Operation Sindoor will apprise foreign capitals of the 'new normal' in India's approach to Pakistan's use of terrorism.

New Baba Vanga’s prediction for July 2025

Tourism hit as ‘New Baba Vanga’ warning triggers mass cancellations

Official warnings and government response

Social media buzz and public reaction





A Japanese manga artist known for her unsettlingly accurate predictions has sparked widespread concern, leading to a surge in travel cancellations to Japan., often referred to as, has captured global attention for her chilling predictions, including a major disaster anticipated for July 2025. With a track record that reportedly includes predictions of the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and the death of iconic figures, Tatsuki’s latest prediction has left travelers reconsidering their plans.The impact of her warning is already being felt in the travel industry, with agencies reporting significant drops in bookings as the feared date approaches. Here, you can explore Tatsuki's predictions, her history of accurate foresight, and the response from concerned travelers.Ryo Tatsuki is a Japanese manga artist whose prophetic claims have drawn comparisons to the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, known for her eerily accurate predictions about global events. Tatsuki first gained attention in 1999 with the release of her booka compilation of visions she claims to have experienced over the years. While the book initially received little mainstream attention, several of Tatsuki’s predictions have reportedly come true, earning her a devoted following in Japan and beyond.Some of her most notable forecasts are catastrophic March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan’s northern Tohoku region. This disaster, which claimed over 18,000 lives and triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis, occurred in the same month and year Tatsuki had predicted. Her book also allegedly foresaw the 1995 Kobe earthquake and the death of legendary Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, adding to her reputation as a modern-day seer.In a revised edition ofpublished in 2021, Tatsuki issued a stark warning about a potentially catastrophic event set to strike in July 2025. According to CNN and other media reports, Tatsuki’s prophecy describes a massive undersea rupture forming between Japan and the Philippines, capable of generating tsunamis three times the height of those seen during the 2011 Tohoku disaster.Her prediction includes unsettling imagery of Japan’s oceans “boiling,” which some interpret as a possible reference to an underwater volcanic eruption or a massive seismic event. The epicenter of this anticipated disaster is drawn as a diamond-shaped region connecting Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, and the Northern Mariana Islands – a part of the Pacific known for its intense geological activity.Reports indicate that Tatsuki’s prophecy has already started to influence travel behavior, particularly among tourists planning to visit Japan in the coming months. According to Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG, bookings to Japan dropped by as much as 50 percent during the recent Easter break, a trend expected to continue as the feared date draws closer.Speaking to CNN, CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, noted that concerns over Tatsuki’s prediction have been compounded by recent advisories from the Chinese embassy in Tokyo. In a statement issued in April 2025, the embassy warned Chinese nationals in Japan to remain vigilant against potential natural disasters, further fueling anxiety among travelers.The Chinese government’s warning was reportedly prompted by a series of recent seismic events and increased volcanic activity around Japan’s coastline. The South China Morning Post reported that the advisory urged residents and tourists to “take extra precautions against natural disasters,” a statement that many interpreted as an indirect acknowledgment of the growing fears surrounding Tatsuki’s prediction.Japanese authorities, however, have been more reserved in their response, focusing on reassuring the public about the country’s extensive disaster preparedness infrastructure. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has not issued any specific alerts related to the July 2025 timeframe, emphasizing that its seismic monitoring systems remain among the most advanced in the world.Social media platforms have become hotbeds of speculation and debate, with the hashtag #July2025Prediction trending across multiple countries. Some users have expressed deep concern, while others have dismissed the claims as mere coincidence or sensationalism. Online forums dedicated to earthquake preparedness have also seen a surge in activity, with members sharing safety tips and evacuation plans in case of a worst-case scenario.","Ryo Tatsuki is a Japanese manga artist whose prophetic claims have drawn comparisons to the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga.

Donald Trump's ally Laura Loomer who is against American jobs going to immigrants, said the administration should restrict H-1B visas -- after the US Monday announced bans on travel agents from India who are allegedly facilitating illegal migration. H-1B, the program that allows US companies to hire skilled employees from foreign countries, has again become a flashpoint as the US immigration revealed that they selected 120,141 H-1B visa applications for the fiscal year 2026.H-1B registrations experience a remarkable decline this time owing to an increased fee, and the figure 120,141 is the lowest since 2021. But MAGA activists, US tech workers are pushing for reduction/abolition of the programs. They say the continuation of programs that hire immigrants goes against Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration and his promise of America First.The US administration imposed visa restrictions on travel agencies, their owners, executives and senior officials if these agencies have any link with illegal immigration.A US Department of State notification said its diplomatic and consular staff in India are working to identify and hold the individuals who are involved in promoting unauthorised migration to the US accountable.In April this year, the US Embassy in India canceled 2,000 visa appointments due to fraud concerns. The latest move is an expansion of its probe into travel agents who are misusing the system.The move was lauded by many MAGA activists who asked for a similar crackdown on H-1B visa programs.The H-1B program operates under an annual cap of 65,000 new visas. However, an additional 20,000 petitions are exempt from this limit for applicants who hold a U.S. master's degree or higher.That the department has already selected 120,141 H-1Bs for the next financial year has sparked concern that companies have already identified people who will be fired to accommodate this people in the US workforce as new jobs are not being created."," MAGA activist urges administration to ban H-1B after US announced visa restrictions for Indian travel agents with alleged links to trafficking.

CHENNAI: Fevers in city hospitals, largely attributed to influenza A and B until two weeks ago, are now increasingly linked to Covid-19. This has prompted surgeons to cancel critical procedures like transplants, bypass surgeries, and heart valve replacements, doctors said.The public health department, which says there are 40 active cases, is yet to confirm whether people with the viral infection have strains similar to Omicron JN.1 descendants—LF.7 and NB.1.8—observed in Singapore and Hong Kong, where there is a rise in cases and hospitalisations.While healthy people with mild disease, treated as outpatients, are not tested, people with co-morbid conditions or those with severe disease requiring admission undergo tests.In most hospitals, including govt-run facilities, the panel of tests includes influenza, Covid-19, and respiratory syncytial virus. ""We test for these because treatment for these diseases varies,"" said Gleneagles Healthcity infectious diseases expert Dr Subramaniam Swaminathan.Since August 2024, there was a steady flow of patients with fever in the city due to various viruses. ""We did not see a dip even when day temperatures were hovering near 40 degrees C.Nearly 60% of cases we tested were influenza A and B two weeks ago. Now, it is Covid,"" he said.Most people report symptoms such as fever, nasal congestion, respiratory distress, and a persistent cough, but there is no spike in admissions to intensive care units or deaths reported so far, health officials confirmed. ""There is no need for panic,"" said Director of Public Health Dr T S Selvavinagayam. ""Like influenza-like illness, Covid never completely went away. We have been seeing sporadic cases of the viral infection with seasonal peaks,"" he said.On Tuesday, the directorate asked people to wear masks and maintain social distancing when they are in closed crowded spaces. ""It is important for the elderly, pregnant women, and people with co-morbid conditions or immunity issues to take precautions,"" he said. Educational institutions, workplaces, and public places must provide facilities for people to wash their hands with soap or cleanse them with sanitisers, he added.Doctors also advise people to take the flu vaccination. The flu vaccine prevents flu in up to 70% of cases. It also reduces the chances of severe disease, hospitalisation, and death, particularly among children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, said Apollo Hospital's infectious diseases expert, Dr V Ramasubramanian. ""We don't yet have the Covid vaccination to prevent the present variant of Covid circulating in Singapore. We recommend people at risk to take the existing booster dose if they haven't taken the vaccine for six months,"" he said.The immune response to the flu weakens after six months. The annual vaccination boosts immunity. Additionally, viruses are constantly changing, he added.","Covid-19 has prompted surgeons to cancel critical procedures like transplants, bypass surgeries, and heart valve replacements.

As the tech giant pushes deeper into artificial intelligence, industry experts question the decision. Find out why even AI leaders weren’t safe from Microsoft’s sudden cuts.

Poll Do you think AI will replace more jobs in the future? No, humans will always be needed. Yes, it's inevitable.

To those also affected—you're not alone, we're at least 6,000, says Microsoft's fired AI director

Microsoft's second biggest layoffs ever hits over 6,000 employees



Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce—in what marks the company's second-largest job reduction in its history. Among those affected was Gabriela de Queiroz , Director of Artificial Intelligence for Microsoft for Startups , who shared the ""bittersweet news"" of her departure on social media.""I was impacted by Microsoft's latest round of layoffs. Am I sad? Absolutely. I'm heartbroken to see so many talented people I've had the honor of working with being let go. These are people who cared deeply, went above and beyond, and truly made a difference,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), alongside a picture of herself smiling.The layoffs come as Microsoft aggressively pushes into artificial intelligence, with CEO Satya Nadella revealing in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects. Software engineers bore the brunt of the cuts, representing over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state alone, according to Bloomberg analysis.Despite being asked to stop work immediately and set an out-of-office message, Gabriela de Queiroz chose to stay longer. ""I chose to stay a little longer—showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,"" she explained in her social media posts.The irony of laying off an AI director while the company invests heavily in AI technology wasn't lost on industry observers. One Microsoft vice president recently told his team to use AI chatbots to generate half their computer code, up from the current 20-30%, before more than a dozen engineers on his team were subsequently laid off.""But if you know me, you know I always look at the bright side. I'm an optimist at heart. That hasn't changed. My smile, my gratitude, my belief that each day is a gift—that's all still here,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote, maintaining her positive outlook despite the circumstances.The cuts affect all levels, teams, and geographies as Microsoft streamlines operations and reduces management layers. ""What's next? I don't know yet. It's too soon to say. But I trust that something good will come out of this,"" Gabriela de Queiroz concluded, addressing fellow impacted employees: ""To those also affected—you're not alone. We are at least 6,000.""In another news, a Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s annual developer conference, Build 2025, in Seattle on May 19.

Sharma, 67, was found living as a priest in Rajasthan.



From 1998 to 2004, ‘Dr Death’ involved in kidney transplants





NEW DELHI: Nearly two years after he jumped parole, Dr Devender Sharma , notorious as ‘ Doctor Death ’, was on Monday arrested by Delhi police from an ashram in Rajasthan’s Dausa, where he was living as a ‘priest’.Sharma (67) was involved in the abduction and murders of truck and taxi drivers in Delhi and other states in the early 2000s, and was also convicted of his role in a kidney racket First arrested in 2004, he was granted a two-month parole on June 9, 2023, but went into hiding instead of returning to prison.DCP (crime) Aditya Gautam said on Tuesday that a police team launched an investigation across several locations, including Aligarh, Jaipur and Delhi.Over a period of six months, the cops explored possible hiding spots, including Agra and Prayagraj. Finally, they traced Sharma to an ashram in Dausa, where he was living under a false identity, posing as a priest.A native of Aligarh, UP, Sharma graduated with a Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) degree in 1984. His father worked for a pharmaceutical company in Siwan, Bihar.Sharma later set up and ran a clinic in Rajasthan for 11 years. In 1994, he faced a major financial setback after being defrauded of Rs 11 lakh in a gas dealership scam. By 1995, he himself allegedly started a fake gas agency to recover his losses.Between 1998 and 2004, Sharma allegedly became involved in illegal kidney transplants , working closely with a person named Dr Amit. He allegedly facilitated more than 125 illegal kidney transplants, earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7 lakh per procedure. Sharma earlier told police that as an intermediary, he arranged kidney donors for Dr Amit.In 2004, Sharma was arrested in Gurgaon in connection with the kidney racket. Around the same time, he and his gang were also allegedly involved in the abduction and serial killing of taxi drivers and disposing of their bodies in the crocodile-infested Hazara canal in UP's Kasganj. Each vehicle sold in the grey market in UP earned them between Rs 20,000 and Rs 25,000.Sharma was charged with the murder of 21 truck and taxi drivers and sentenced to life imprisonment in seven cases across Delhi, Rajasthan and Haryana. He was also sentenced to death by a Gurgaon court for the murder of a taxi driver. Sharma confessed to killing more than 50 people. His horrific crimes led to his wife and children abandoning him.In 2020, Sharma was granted a 20-day parole but jumped bail, staying at large for seven months before being apprehended in Delhi. In June 2023, he was again granted parole for two months, but failed to return to prison.","Dr Devender Sharma, known as 'Doctor Death,' was rearrested after jumping parole, Delhi police reported on Monday.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Election Results 2025: Why AAP Lost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-election-results-2025-aap-lost-reasons-arvind-kejriwal-new-delhi-manish-sisodia-bjp-modi-incumbency-corruptio-sheesh-mahal-liquor-freebies-congress-rahul/articleshow/118023276.cms,"Here are 10 reasons behind AAP's defeat:



Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

HONG KONG: Crude prices surged Wednesday following a report that US intelligence suggested Israel was planning a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, which would send geopolitical tensions into overdrive and fuel regional conflict fears.While safe haven gold pushed almost two percent higher, the news from CNN appeared to be having little detrimental effect on Asian equities in early trade, with most extending the previous day's rally.Still, investors are keeping tabs on China-US relations after Beijing hit out at Washington's ""bullying"" over chip export controls, just over a week after the two sides dialled down trade tensions by temporarily slashing eye-watering tit-for-tat tariffs.Both main crude contracts jumped almost two percent after CNN reported multiple US officials as saying the government had received intelligence indicating Israel was preparing to target Iranian atomic facilities.There are fears that such a sharp escalation could tip the Middle East into a war, with tensions already high over Israel's strikes on Gaza.""This is the clearest sign yet of how high the stakes are in the US Iran nuclear talks and the lengths Israel may go to if Iran insists on maintaining its commercial nuclear capabilities,"" Robert Rennie, at Westpac Banking Corp, said.""Crude will maintain a risk premium as long as the current talks appear to be going nowhere.""Crude prices have risen around 15 percent since the start of the month on softening worries about the economic outlook as tariff tensions grow relatively calmer.Equities mostly built on Monday's gains on trade talk hopes.H ong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Wellington, Taipei and Manila all outshone Tokyo and Singapore.But the recent detente between China and the United States suffered a jolt Wednesday when Beijing slammed Washington's ""bullying"" chip export controls.It also warned it would take steps against measures aimed at restricting Chinese access to high-tech semiconductors and supply chains.The remarks came after US officials last week unveiled guidelines warning firms that using Chinese-made high-tech AI semiconductors, most notably tech giant Huawei's Ascend chips, would put them at risk of violating US export controls.Several Federal Reserve members appeared to dampen hopes they will cut US interest rates anytime soon as they warned over the effects of Trump's tariffs on the economy and inflation.St. Louis Fed chief Alberto Musalem warned the measures would likely hurt growth and jobs, even as countries look to dial down the blistering tariffs the president proposed.""Even after the de-escalation of May 12 (with China), they seem likely to have a significant impact on the near-term economic outlook,"" Musalem said.""On balance, tariffs are likely to dampen economic activity and lead to some further softening of the labour market.""He added that ""committing now to ignoring higher inflation from tariffs, or to easing policy, runs the risk of underestimating the level and persistence of inflation"".Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic said Moody's ratings cut and Trump's proposed tax cuts could compound uncertainty and force officials to keep rates elevated.West Texas Intermediate: UP 1.9 percent at $63.22 per barrelBrent North Sea Crude: UP 1.8 percent at $66.56 per barrelTokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.1 percent at 37,491.80 (break)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 0.5 percent at 23,806.59Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.2 percent at 3,386.46Euro/dollar: UP at $1.1322 from $1.1284 on TuesdayPound/dollar: UP at $1.3425 from $1.3391Dollar/yen: DOWN at 144.07 yen from 144.47 yenEuro/pound: UP at 84.32 pence from 84.26 penceNew York - Dow: DOWN 0.3 percent at 42,677.24 (close)London - FTSE 100: UP 0.9 percent at 8,781.12 (close)","Crude prices surged Wednesday following a report that US intelligence suggested Israel was planning a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.

"Chipping away at ties: China slams US AI chip curbs, vows retaliation against ‘bullying’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chipping-away-at-ties-china-slams-us-ai-chip-curbs-vows-retaliation-against-bullying/articleshow/121304850.cms,"China on Wednesday sharply rebuked the United States over its latest warnings against the use of Chinese-made artificial intelligence chips , calling Washington’s moves “unilateral bullying and protectionism” that threaten global tech supply chains The condemnation came after the US government issued fresh guidelines cautioning firms that using Chinese high-tech semiconductors, particularly Huawei’s Ascend AI chips, could place them at risk of violating American export controls.In a strongly worded statement, China’s commerce ministry accused the US of abusing its export control regime to suppress Chinese tech development. “These actions seriously harm the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and endanger China's development interests,” the ministry said, warning that any party aiding in the enforcement of such measures could be in breach of Chinese law.Beijing also vowed to take “firm steps to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” though it did not specify what retaliatory actions might follow.The latest clash comes amid a years-long effort by Washington to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors over national security concerns. US officials fear that cutting-edge chips could be used to enhance Beijing’s military capabilities and undermine American dominance in AI and related technologies.Last week, the Biden administration, continuing policies initiated under President Donald Trump, announced it would rescind some export restrictions on advanced computing semiconductors. The move followed pressure from several countries arguing that the controls had cut them off from the critical tools needed for AI development.However, the relaxation was coupled with a renewed crackdown on Chinese access. The US commerce department reiterated that it aims to share American AI technology “with trusted foreign countries” while preventing adversaries from gaining access.Under the previous US policy, countries were grouped into three tiers, with top allies like Japan and South Korea exempt from restrictions. Nations in the second tier, including Mexico and Portugal, faced caps on the number of AI chips they could receive. The new revisions adjust those categories but still prioritise curbing China’s tech ascent.Industry giants like Nvidia and AMD, which had opposed the tiered restrictions, saw their stock prices rise following signs the Biden administration would recalibrate the rules. Yet the renewed focus on blocking Chinese firms from AI technology has rekindled tensions between the world’s two largest economies.As the global race for AI supremacy accelerates, the semiconductor battlefield is becoming increasingly geopolitical, with ramifications for supply chains, international trade, and diplomatic ties.",The US government issued fresh guidelines cautioning firms that using Chinese high-tech semiconductors could place them at risk of violating American export controls.
