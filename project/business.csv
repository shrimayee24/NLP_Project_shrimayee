NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday addressed the nation from Jammu & Kashmir on the occasion of the 10th International Yoga Day .PM Modi said Yoga has been creating new records ever since India's proposal for International Yoga Day was passed in the United States in 2014.""We can feel the energy in Srinagar, that we gain through Yoga. I extend greetings to people of the country and people performing Yoga in every corner of the world on Yoga Day. International Yoga Day has completed a historic journey of 10 years.

While 20 deaths were reported from central govt hospitals, 12 were recorded in Delhi govt facilities. This takes the heat toll in Delhi to at least 70, most occurring in the last two weeks. The number is likely to be higher as data from several hospitals isn't readily available.Safdarjung hospital has witnessed a surge in heat-related deaths , with 13 fatalities reported since Wednesday. This brings the total count in the hospital to 24, including two cases reported by TOI on Wednesday and five earlier casualties which have now been confirmed as heatstroke deaths after postmortem.Safdarjung authorities said 47 patients were currently admitted and of these 29 were critical with ailments related to heat. The influx of patients continues, hospital sources said, underlining the risk to public health from the unrelenting spell of heat.To cope with the growing crisis, the hospital has raised the number of beds for such patients from 13 to 23.Dr Ajay Chauhan from Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital said that RML admitted 73 heatstroke patients since May 27, with 26 of them in the past 24 hours. ""Till date, 18 people have died due to heatstroke, seven in the last 24 hours."" The hospital currently has 32 such patients, 26 of whom are on ventilator support .

Longest & severest spell of heat in at least 74 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/longest-severest-spell-of-heat-in-at-least-74-years/articleshow/111153275.cms,"NEW DELHI: Starting May 13, Delhi's main weather station Safdarjung has logged temperatures of 40 degrees C and more every single day. That's 39 days and counting, making this the longest spell of high heat in the capital in records of the past 74 years. It is also the severest heat spell in these years, with day and night temperatures among the highest ever recorded and as many as seven days when the mercury crossed 45 degrees.TOI analysed IMD 's daily temperature logs at Safdarjung since 1951 and found that the longest streak of 40+ temperatures prior to 2024 was 32 days, recorded from May 9 to June 10, 1978 (including both days), followed by 27 days in 1984 (from May 13 to June 8), which can be extended to 34 days if a single day of below 40 degrees C temperature is disregarded. Another notable streak of extreme heat was in 1998, which extended to 27 days with a single day of below 40-degree C temperature.As per these records, not only has the current heat spell extended far beyond any other in the past, Delhiites have also had to endure more temperature extremes than during any other spell. Day temperatures hit a peak of 46.8 degrees Celsius on May 29, the second highest maximum ever recorded at Safdarjung, next to only 47.2 degrees C logged on May 29, 1944. The only other long heat spell where the highest maximum came close was the one in 1998, when temperatures peaked at 46.5 degrees Celsius.No other spell had as many as seven days when the maximum was 45 degrees Celsius or higher. Again, the 1998 spell was a distant second with four such days.There have been as many as 12 heatwave days during the current spell, five in May and seven so far in June. This data is also likely to be highest although strict comparisons could not be made because the normal temperatures in the previous periods weren't available. As per IMD's categorisation, a heatwave day is when the maximum temperature is either 45 degrees C or more, or when it is more than 40 degrees Celsius and at least 4.5 degrees Celsius higher than normal.Besides, the current streak has had six straight days of 'warm night' conditions (when the maximum is over 40 degrees Celsius and the minimum is at least 4.5 notches above normal). The highest maximum temperature was recorded at 35.2 degrees on June 19, the highest minimum in the capital since 1964.So what led to this unprecedentedly long and severe spell of heat in the region this year? Said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, ""Three-four factors combined to make it a summer of extremes this year. First, this is the year after an El Nino event, when summers are usually harsh in India. Second, there were no western disturbances impacting northern India from mid-May till June 18. This meant there was no rainfall for over a month in the region, leading to an accumulation of heat which was exacerbated by the presence of anti-cyclonic circulations. Third, the monsoon went into a lull. It has started moving again but hasn't entered northwest India yet. These factors together led to the temperature extremes during the past month or so.""","Starting May 13, Delhi's main weather station Safdarjung has logged temperatures of 40 degrees C and more every single day. This is the longest spell of high heat in the capital in records of the past 74 years. It is also the severest heat spell in these years, with day and night temperatures among the highest ever recorded.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111153548,imgsize-1299786,width-400,resizemode-4/111153548.jpg"
"Kejriwal gets bail in excise case, ED to move HC today",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kejriwal-gets-bail-in-excise-case-ed-to-move-hc-today/articleshow/111153233.cms,"ED presuming and speculating: CM to court

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday granted bail to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal , who was arrested in March this year in a money laundering case related to implementation of Delhi excise policy of 2021-22. Special judge Niyay Bindu passed the order after hearing submissions of Kejriwal and Enforcement Directorate over two days.Kejriwal will be out of Tihar Jail on Friday after paying a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh. The court, however, imposed some conditions, including that he will not try to hamper the investigation or influence witnesses. After the order was pronounced around 7.56pm, ED requested the court to defer signing of the bail bond by 48 hours so that the order may be challenged before the appellate court. However, the court rejected the plea and asked for production of the bail bond before the duty judge on Friday. ED will be filing an appeal in HC on Friday. Kejriwal had been arrested by ED on March 21.A day earlier, his counsel, Vikram Chaudhri, had told the court that the case against him was based entirely on the statements of people who were not only tainted but had also been arrested and subsequently promised bail for supporting ED’s case. He had also argued that there was no corroborative evidence that Rs 100 crore was paid to AAP functionaries by the so-called ‘South Group’ and that there was no “camera recording or money as such which has been exchanged”.During the hearing on Thursday, additional solicitor general (ASG) S V Raju, who was appearing for ED, told the court that the agency was not conducting an investigation in the air but possessed concrete evidence. He said photos of currency notes produced in court were part of the money given as kickbacks and related to Kejriwal's stay at a seven-star hotel in Goa.“Instructions were received from one Vinod Chauhan to make payments to Chanpreet Singh and others. The pictures have been found on the phone of Chauhan. Chanpreet was speaking regularly to him on phone… Chauhan has good relations with Arvind Kejriwal,” claimed Raju.Chauhan, accused in the case, has been alleged to be handling the proceeds of crimes connected with hawala operators and managing postings in Delhi Jal Board through Kejriwal. ED has said he was the one responsible for the transfer of Rs 25.5 crore from Delhi to Goa.Chanpreet Singh, according to ED, was AAP’s fund manager for the Goa elections. He has been accused of collecting the proceeds of crime from Chauhan and being responsible for generation/acquisition/use of the alleged proceeds of crime, an amount of Rs 45 crore.Citing the refusal of the Delhi CM to reveal the password of his phone, ED told the court on Thursday: “Kejriwal says my phone is sacrosanct. Mai password nahi doonga. (I will not give my password)… An adverse inference has to be drawn from the fact that Kejriwal has refused to give his password. A lot of skeletons will come out if he gives his phone. This is a ground for refusing bail under ordinary bail law, forget section 45 PMLA for the time being.”Arguing that Kejriwal was liable to be prosecuted under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) even if he was not personally involved in any offence, Raju said: “You may not have committed the offence but you are responsible for the affairs of AAP, and if AAP is guilty of an offence, then you are guilty of it as well.”Turning to co-accused Vijay Nair, ASG said he was unconnected with the government and had no business framing the excise policy. He alleged that Nair was used as a middleman by Kejriwal.Referring to ED’s summons to CM, the ASG said there was willful disobedience of the summons by Kejriwal and the magistrate had taken cognisance of that and summoned him. Further, ED pointed out that a division bench of Delhi HC did not grant Kejriwal relief after he was arrested by ED.Responding to ED’s claims, Kejriwal’s counsel Chaudhri questioned the timing of Kejriwal’s arrest. Why did you not arrest him earlier? Why March 21? What did you want from him? Is ED an independent agency or is it playing in the hands of some political masters? said Chaudhri.","Arvind Kejriwal will be out of Tihar Jail on Friday after paying a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh.

Probe into Uttarakhand crash that killed 15 reveals driving test fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/probe-into-uttarakhand-crash-that-killed-15-reveals-driving-test-fraud/articleshow/111152751.cms,"DEHRADUN: An inspection report submitted by the transport department 's lead agency has revealed that the Rudraprayag accident on June 15, which led to the death of 15 people, found that the online fee for the endorsement of mountainous routes on the driver's licence was deposited after the accident, suggesting that ""someone else completed the online test and fee submission on behalf of the driver"". The report further recommended reconsidering the implementation of the earlier system of physical examination of the driver to prevent such fraud. It was also found during the investigation that the driver was driving on mountain routes for the first time and was speeding.The report, still under consideration at the headquarters in Dehradun, further stated that the Tempo Traveller vehicle broke through five parapet blocks before falling 250 metres into the Alaknanda river . The vehicle took several turns and partially drowned in the river, with some passengers being thrown out onto the slope during the fall. The report added that the accident could have been less severe if connected crash barriers had been installed instead of parapet blocks.When contacted, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO) Rudraprayag, Pramod Karnatak, said, ""The issue of licence fees has come up and it is being probed. The time at which the licence fee was submitted is also being looked into.""Another official, requesting anonymity, confirmed to TOI that the crash barriers installed there were not connected with each other.Significantly, the govt had ordered a magisterial enquiry into the accident, which has been the worst this summer.The officials involved in the report noted that the road from Rishikesh to Rudraprayag, constructed under the All-Weather Char Dham Road project, was currently ""in good condition with a speed limit of 30-km per hour."" However, most vehicles were observed to be over-speeding, putting lives at risk.The report further suggested installing rumble strips, white markings and other measures to restrict the speed limit at accident-prone spots.The condition of the accident site indicated that the driver had lost control of the vehicle, likely due to speeding and sleep deprivation, as he had been driving continuously for over 11 hours.It also highlighted the need to improve parking arrangements in Shivpuri, Devprayag, Dhari Devi temple and Brahmapuri to reduce traffic jams caused by roadside parking. Drivers often overspeed after passing through traffic to compensate for lost time, increasing the risk of accidents on the roads ahead.Joint transport commissioner Sanat Kumar Singh said the department would ""consider all the points to improve the situation and act accordingly.""",The online fee for the endorsement of mountainous routes on the driver's licence was deposited after the accident.

India stresses on border peace as China pushes for resumption of direct flights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-stresses-on-border-peace-as-china-pushes-for-resumption-of-direct-flights/articleshow/111145324.cms,"NEW DELHI: China is pushing India to restart direct passenger flights after a four-year hiatus, though India remains hesitant due to ongoing tensions over a border dispute.The diplomatic strain stems from a major military confrontation in June 2020 that resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese soldiers. Thousands of troops from both nations are still deployed along their shared border.Since the clash, India has restricted Chinese investments, banned numerous popular apps, and halted passenger flights between the two countries, although cargo flights continue to operate. While both economies stand to gain from resuming direct flights, the stakes are particularly high for China, where recovery in international travel post-COVID-19 has been sluggish, in contrast to India's booming aviation sector.Over the past year, China's government and airlines have approached India's civil aviation authorities several times to restore direct air links.""We hope the Indian side will work with China in the same direction for the early resumption of direct flights,"" China's Foreign Ministry told Reuters last week, highlighting that resuming flights would benefit both countries.However, a senior Indian official responded, ""Unless there is peace and tranquillity on the border, the rest of the relationship cannot move forward.""Indian airlines, including Indigo, and Chinese carriers are discussing with their respective governments the feasibility of resuming direct routes. ""When the time is right and the governments come to a mutual understanding of how to move forward, we'll assess the market,"" said Pieter Elbers, CEO of Indigo, India's largest airline.Direct flights between India and China hit a peak in December 2019, with 539 scheduled flights, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. Chinese carriers accounted for 371 of those flights, while India's airlines scheduled 168.These flights were halted in early 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic escalated. Despite the resumption of international travel restrictions being lifted a year later in India and early 2023 in China, direct flights have not resumed, except for minimal Covid-19 repatriation flights. Travelers must now rely on connecting flights through hubs like Hong Kong , Dubai, or Singapore. This has extended travel time from less than six hours to upwards of 10 and diverted business—including lucrative through traffic to the United States—to carriers such as Emirates, Singapore Airlines, and Cathay Pacific.Air India CEO Campbell Wilson added, ""Direct India-China flights 'would seem to be a huge potential market,' but for now there are factors at play 'beyond our level.'""","China is pushing India to restart direct passenger flights after a four-year hiatus.

The case was disposed of by the HC in view of the Haryana statement that benefits have been granted, but It is not clear whether the benefits have been issued to the legal heirs , if any, or have only been granted on paper. On May 22, the counsel representing Shri Niwas told the HC that the petitioner and his wife have passed away.However, his case has led the high court to issue directions to the Haryana chief secretary to compile a list of all such cases from all the government departments so that they can be decided expeditiously.With regard to the cases which are admitted in the court and old cases in which even paper-books are not available with the organisations/state public sector undertakings, the HC has granted liberty to all the public sector undertakings/state organisations to seek a copy of the paper-book from the registry of the high court by routing their applications through the office of the Haryana advocate general.As per available information, Haryana has identified 31 cases ofstatutory corporations and two cases of statutory boards wherein employees are waiting for their pensionary benefits for a long time. The Haryana government has also issued instructions to all the statutory boards and corporations to evaluate all such pending cases.The HC has asked Haryana to file a compliance report after two months ""on the larger issue"" with regard to action taken on such other cases. Niwas's case for grant of pensionary benefits was not cleared for one reason or the other in spite of the fact that no inquiry or disciplinary proceedings were pending against him. There was some dispute regarding his promotion and that is why the board stopped his retiral benefits . A letter was issued by the department on August 28, 1998 stating that the petitioner was ordered to be retired as head clerk and not as circle superintendent.His pensionary benefits were withheld on the ground that now the pay of the petitioner would be fixed as head clerk and his pensionary benefits would be calculated after that. His plea was that since till the date of retirement he worked as circle superintendent, the pay of that period could not be denied to him as he actually worked on that post.After being deprived of his retiral benefits, he approached the government with a request that whatever pensionary benefits he is entitled to as per calculation made by his office should be released so that he is able to carry on with responsibilities towards his family.Even this request was ignored and no action whatsoever was taken, after which he approached the HC asking, ""whether pensionary benefits of an employee can be withheld for no rhyme and reason.","Shri Niwas, an employee of Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited, had filed a petition in the high court in 1998 and sought directions to grant him pensionary benefits after his retirement.

Anything in ""excess"" of this is banned.I travelled to the US to meet my son, who is pursuing a master's in supply chain management in Texas. I was carrying eight shirts, four trousers, some socks, and a pair of shoes.

Congress poses six questions as PM Modi visits J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-poses-six-questions-as-pm-modi-visits-jk/articleshow/111143629.cms,"Here are the questions posed by Congress

When will full statehood return to Jammu and Kashmir?



""Since 2018, the people of J&K have been denied any avenue to express their grievances. The region has become a bureaucratic fiefdom controlled by the BJP-RSS cabal. While claiming to have ended special status for J&K, the one-third Pradhan Mantri has in fact created an extra-special situation of a new and unique political system: one where the state has been downgraded to a UT, elections have been suspended, and all norms of constitutional morality violated. In his speech in Parliament on December 11, 2023, Home Minister Amit Shah said that full statehood to J&K would be restored at an “appropriate time”. Five years after being stripped of their statehood, the people of J&K still lack clarity on what the timeline for this return of statehood is. Can the one-third Pradhan Mantri give a straight answer to this key question: when will full statehood return to Jammu and Kashmir?"" Why is the BJP scared of elections in Jammu and Kashmir?



""The people of Jammu and Kashmir have been left without an elected government for the last six years. The last Vidhan Sabha elections were held in 2014 and four seats in the Rajya Sabha remain vacant because of the delay in holding assembly polls. The terms of 4,892 Panchayats and 316 Block Development Councils (2nd and 3rd tiers of Panchayati Raj) also came to an end on January 9, 2024. The blame for this suspension of democracy lies entirely with the Centre. As the Chief Election Commissioner clarified in March 2024, the one-third Pradhan Mantri’s Government failed to reconcile its own J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019 with its own Delimitation Exercise, 2022 – preventing the ECI from initiating the electoral process. This weaponized incompetence appears to be deliberate: unable to win power through legitimate electoral means, the BJP has used this opportunity to control the levers of power for selfish gains. Several allegations had been made by various stakeholders within J&K that Government-awarded contracts are being given to a chosen few, in a well thought out policy of discrimination against locals. It is only the Supreme Court-imposed deadline of September 2024 that has forced the Center to conduct the polls now. Can the one-third explain this long delay in holding the elections? Why has he clung so desperately to power in a state where the people never chose to be led by him?"" Why has the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir deteriorated under your watch?



""The one-third Pradhan Mantri claims to have curbed terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir at all his public meetings. The mood on the ground in J&K, however, is one of anxiety. Since January 1st 2023, 35 of our brave security personnel and eight innocent civilians have lost their lives in the Pir Panjal Range (comprising the Rajouri-Poonch area) alone, in an area where there were no major incidents of terrorism between 2007 and 2014. In the last few weeks, it has spread even to neighboring districts that we considered largely peaceful: as evinced by the attack in Reasi on the 9th of June, the attack in Kathua on the 10th of June, and in Doda on the 11th of June. Infiltration from Pakistan is rising along the International Border, and a palpable sense of insecurity prevails across J&K. The one-third Pradhan Mantri, who has been busy accepting congratulatory messages, including from Pakistani PM, has been conspicuously silent even amidst this surge in terrorism. Why has his Government has failed to salvage the security situation in J&K? What is his vision to restore normalcy?"" Why has the Government failed to support Kashmiri Pandits?



""The BJP has exploited the misery of the Kashmiri Pandits in every election campaign. However, ten years after coming to power, the one-third Pradhan Mantri and the Home Minister have done absolutely nothing for the community and have not even held a meeting with the community’s representatives. In consultation with the community, Dr. Manmohan Singh’s Government had devised a 6,000-job employment package for Kashmiri Pandit youth to take up jobs in Kashmir Valley. For all the bluster of the current Government, that remains the last major intervention by the Union Government to rehabilitate the Pandit community, even amidst a nationwide social and political consensus for the community’s Gharwapsi. Does the one-third Pradhan Mantri view the community only as a talking point? Why has he neglected their interests over the last decade?"" If the Union Government’s actions are popular, why do the BJP and its proxies keep getting rejected by the people of J&K?



When the BJP abrogated Article 370 to much fanfare in 2019, they repeatedly argued that the actions were popular among the people of Jammu and Kashmir. However, the one-third Pradhan Mantri refused to visit the J&K after 2019, until the Lok Sabha polls in 2024. The BJP refused to contest the Lok Sabha elections in the Kashmir Valley, instead implicitly supporting candidates put up by its proxies. However, all three proxies fared poorly, scoring a zero in the Lok Sabha and securing a lead only in one Vidhan Sabha segment. If the Union Government’s actions are popular, why do the BJP and its proxies keep getting rejected by the people of J&K?"" How much investment has Jammu and Kashmir actually garnered since 2019?



""When the BJP abrogated Article 370 to much fanfare in 2019, they repeatedly argued that the law was a hindrance to “development and progress”. In the three years since the new industrial policy was announced in January 2021, the Union Territory has received proposals worth 84,544 crore in as many as 42 industrial sectors. Till date, only 414 units have been registered and actual investment on the ground is just 2,518 crores. Although there was much optimism about the hospitality sector, only 87 crores of investment proposals have been received till now. Apart from J&K Bank, the only large-scale employer in J&K is the Chenab Textile Mills (CTM), which came to J&K in 1962, during Pandit Nehru’s tenure. After achieving quite little over the past decade, the one-third Pradhan Mantri is back in J&K to lay the foundation stone of projects worth 3,300 crores this time. But before he does so, can he answer: How many jobs has his Government created – in the public sector or in the private sector? How many investors from the rest of India have actually invested in J&K since 2019? How many PSUs has the Union Government set up in J&K? Can the one-third Prime Minister inaugurate a single facility that his Government has built in J&K?""

During its probe, Sebi found that a significant portion of one public debt issue was allotted to retail shareholders, many of whom exited on the listing day itself. Trading data showed that JM Financial Products (JMFPL) was the counterparty to these trades. JMFPL sold the securities purchased from retail investors at a loss on the same day.

Sebi noted that JM group entities were incentivising certain investors to apply for securities. Furthermore, RBI had earlier barred JM Financial from IPO financing following irregularities.

Despite intense lobbying by the powerful lobby and vocal investors, the all-powerful panel headed by union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will steer clear of issues, such as a review of levies on online gaming and casinos, which attract 28% GST. The Council had earlier decided to review the tax after six months, prompting companies and their vocal backers to raise the demand soon after the Modi govt was sworn in for a third term.

Tax consultants were also expecting the process of rationalisation of GST rates to start after the new govt took charge. ""This meeting will focus on issues that require legal changes as they can be dealt with in the Finance Bill,"" an official said. Sitharaman will move her tax proposals in the Budget, scheduled for next month.

ENA is one of the issues that requires amendments. Last October, the Centre ceded the right to levy GST on ENA and left it in the domain of the states. The law committee of the council was asked to examine if amendments are required to exclude ENA for use in manufacture of alcoholic liquors for human consumption from the ambit of GST.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

The legislation that Republican Gov.

""If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses"" who got the commandments from God, Landry said.

The World Weather Attribution also said that extreme highs witnessed over that region were four times as likely to occur today as a quarter of a century ago.

For its study, WWA analysed the hottest five consecutive days and nights during a ""heat dome"" that lingered over the southwest US, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras in late May and early June. They concluded ""that human-induced warming from burning fossil fuels made the five-day maximum temperature event about 1.4 hotter and about 35 times more likely"". WWA warned if humans continue burning fossil fuels in the near term, these extremes could become more frequent still. ""The additional 1.4C of heat caused by climate change is the difference between life and death,"" said Karina Izquierdo of Red Cross Climate Centre.

A newly detected signal might finally provide answers to the long-standing mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 , which vanished nearly ten years ago. British researchers from Cardiff University have identified a fresh clue that could help pinpoint the final resting place of the ill-fated jet.The signal, detected recently, is being hailed as a significant development in the search for MH370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board. Despite extensive searches over the years, the plane's exact location has remained elusive.Richard Godfrey, a British engineer who has been heavily involved in the search efforts, said, ""We have detected a weak signal that could potentially be from the aircraft. This is the first time we have such a lead in years.""The researchers believe the new signal could help narrow down the search area in the southern Indian Ocean, where the aircraft is believed to have ended its flight. The signal's detection comes after years of using advanced technology and simulations to trace the plane's final moments.Experts involved in the search are cautiously optimistic about this development. ""This signal could be the breakthrough we have been waiting for. We hope it will bring closure to the families of those on board,"" said another member of the research team.The disappearance of MH370 has been one of aviation's greatest mysteries, leading to numerous theories and extensive international search efforts. The search for MH370 has been one of the most challenging and complex in aviation history, involving multiple countries, advanced technology, and extensive resources.Following the disappearance, a massive international search operation was launched. Initial efforts focused on the South China Sea but later shifted to the southern Indian Ocean based on satellite data.The first phase involved surface searches by ships and aircraft, covering thousands of square kilometers. Despite the vast efforts, no debris was found in the initial stages.In April 2014, Australia's Ocean Shield vessel, equipped with advanced underwater search technology, was deployed. It searched for acoustic signals from the aircraft's black boxes but found no conclusive evidence.Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) like Bluefin-21 and GO Phoenix were deployed to conduct detailed seafloor searches in the Indian Ocean's search zones, covering areas with depths of up to 6,000 meters.In July 2015, a flaperon from MH370 was discovered on Réunion Island, confirming the aircraft had ended in the Indian Ocean. This discovery spurred new hope and directed the focus on the southern Indian Ocean.Over the next year, more debris washed ashore on islands in the Indian Ocean and African east coast, including parts of the wing, stabilizers, and cabin interior.After covering over 120,000 square kilometers of seafloor without locating the main wreckage, the official search was suspended in January 2017. The challenging underwater terrain, including deep trenches and volcanic activity, hindered efforts.Ocean Infinity Search: In early 2018, private company Ocean Infinity conducted a renewed search using advanced AUVs, covering an additional 112,000 square kilometers. Despite their efforts, no new debris was located.","The signal detected recently is being hailed as a significant development in the search for MH370.

United Airlines jet turns back after engine piece falls off,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/united-airlines-jet-turns-back-after-engine-piece-falls-off/articleshow/111153625.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

A United Airlines flight bound for Denver returned to Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, on Thursday after a piece of the engine's sound-dampening outer liner fell off during takeoff. The crew of the Airbus A320 heard an ""abnormal noise"" shortly after departure and decided to turn back, according to the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ).The airline said that the missing portion of the liner was found on the runway, and there were no reported injuries among the 124 passengers and five crew members on board. The FAA announced that it would investigate the incident .This event follows a series of mishaps involving United Airlines earlier this year, which prompted the FAA to tighten its oversight of the carrier. These incidents included a piece of fuselage falling off a plane, a wheel coming loose during takeoff, an engine fire, and other problems. CEO Scott Kirby assured travelers that the incidents were unrelated and that the airline is safe, but he also mentioned that United would review its safety training for employees.The aircraft involved in the latest incident is 22 years old. While the cause is not yet known, issues with older planes are often isolated and not indicative of systemic problems or manufacturing defects. According to a recording of conversations between the airport control tower and the plane, the aircraft lost several pieces of sheet metal during takeoff, which were recovered from the runway, and additional debris fell off upon landing.A nearby JetBlue Airways pilot initially reported the debris to the tower, causing some planes to be diverted to other runways. The United pilot informed the tower that one of the engines was slightly exceeding normal exhaust gas temperatures, and he was concerned they had hit a bird or blown a tire during takeoff. The pilot declared an emergency but noted that ""Everything is running fine, the engine is within parameters.""The ongoing FAA review has limited United's certification activities, effectively restricting the carrier's growth. However, United stated last month that it could begin the process of adding new planes and routes again. CEO Scott Kirby has said that the airline is ""embracing"" the FAA evaluation as an opportunity to improve its already high level of safety.","A piece of the engine's sound-dampening outer liner fell off during takeoff. The crew of the Airbus A320 heard an ""abnormal noise"" shortly after departure. There were no reported injuries among the 124 passengers and five crew members.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111153762,imgsize-49686,width-400,resizemode-4/111153762.jpg"
US Supreme Court upholds Trump-era tax rule on foreign income over challenge backed by business interests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-upholds-trump-era-tax-rule-on-foreign-income-over-challenge-backed-by-business-interests/articleshow/111146781.cms,"NEW DELHI: The US Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of a tax imposed on Americans who have invested in certain foreign corporations . The 7-2 ruling, delivered on Thursday, comes at a time when some Democrat lawmakers are pushing for a wealth tax on the super-rich.The case involved Charles and Kathleen Moore , a retired couple from Redmond, Washington, who challenged the ""mandatory repatriation tax"" (MRT) imposed on foreign company earnings, even if those profits have not been distributed to shareholders. The tax, which was part of a Republican-backed tax law passed in 2017, applies to owners of at least 10% of a foreign company controlled by Americans.The central issue in the case was whether this tax on unrealized gains was permitted under the US Constitution's 16th Amendment , which allows Congress to ""collect taxes on incomes."" The Moores, supported by various conservative and business groups, argued that ""income"" refers only to gains that are realized through payment to the taxpayer, not merely an increase in the value of property.Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in his majority opinion joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's three liberal members, stated that the MRT ""does tax realized income - namely, income realized by the corporation,"" attributes that undistributed income to shareholders, and taxes them on their share of it. ""The MRT therefore falls squarely within Congress's constitutional authority to tax,"" Kavanaugh wrote.However, Kavanaugh clarified that the court was not deciding on the key dispute of whether an economic gain must be realized or not to be considered income - a crucial question related to the concept of a wealth tax. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in a separate opinion joined by Justice Samuel Alito, expressed her view that the Constitution does not allow Congress to tax unrealized sums without apportionment among the states.Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented, also noting that ""unrealized gains could not be taxed as 'income'"" under the 16th Amendment.The Moores sought a refund of nearly $14,729 in taxes they were required to pay as minority shareholders in a company based in Bangalore, India. The Justice Department had warned that a ruling invalidating the MRT could have cost the US government $340 billion over the next decade and potentially more if other tax provisions were also affected.The ruling also has implications for legislative proposals favored by some Democrats, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, who advocate for a tax on the net worth of super-rich Americans. However, such proposals face significant challenges in Congress, particularly with the House of Representatives under Republican control.","US Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of a tax imposed on Americans who have invested in certain foreign corporations.

Fox News poll reveals 3-point shift in Biden-Trump matchup since May,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fox-news-poll-reveals-3-point-shift-in-biden-trump-matchup-since-may/articleshow/111145106.cms,"NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden has emerged as the frontrunner in a hypothetical matchup against former President Donald Trump for the first time since October, according to a new Fox News national survey. This shift coincides with a rise in positive views of the economy, marking the highest level of approval for economic conditions during Biden's presidency.The survey reveals a 3-point change in the presidential race since May. Previously, Trump was ahead by 1 point, but Biden now leads with 50 per cent to Trump's 48 per cent, which is within the margin of error. Biden's current 50 per cent support is his best in this election cycle; he last led Trump in October 2023 by a mere 1 point (49 per cent-48 per cent).The survey notes several events since May that could influence voter preferences , including Trump's hush money conviction, Hunter Biden’s gun trial conviction, a positive US jobs report, and Biden’s immigration executive order.""There is not a lot of movement in this poll since May, but it is enough to make this a welcome poll for Biden,"" said Democratic pollster Chris Anderson. ""The vote preference improvement is one thing, but perhaps more importantly, we saw notable erosion of Trump’s advantage on the economy and immigration, while Biden built on his advantages on abortion and health care.""The expanded ballot shows Biden leading Trump by 1 point (43 per cent -42 per cent), with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 10 per cent , and Cornel West and Jill Stein each at 2 per cent . Last month, Trump led Biden by 3 points (43 per cent -40 per cent).Trump maintains strong support among men (+15), rural voters (+17), White men without a degree (+30), and White evangelical Christians (+46). Biden counters with strong backing from voters aged 65 and over (+15), women (+17), urban voters (+23), and White women with a college degree (+28 per cent). Biden receives 73 per cent support from Black voters, slightly down from the 79 per cent before the 2020 election when he ultimately won 91 per cent of the Black vote.As per the Fox News survey, partisan loyalty remains high, with 95 per cent of Democrats supporting Biden and 95 per cent of Republicans backing Trump. Independents, however, now favor Biden by 9 points, a change from May when they preferred Trump by 2 points. Leadership and integrity are extremely important to Independents, who view Biden as having more integrity by 23 points, while Trump is seen as a stronger leader by 11 points.""The underlying demographic tendencies that have defined the race remain in place,"" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw. ""Biden has improved slightly with women and seniors, which keeps him afloat despite significant reductions from 2020 in support from younger voters and African Americans.""Three-quarters of voters consider it highly important who wins the presidential election, with a 5-point preference for Biden. More women than men and more voters aged 65+ than younger voters believe the outcome matters greatly, potentially benefiting Biden.In terms of personal favorability, majorities have a negative view of Trump (57 per cent), Vice President Harris (57 per cent), Biden (56 per cent), and Kennedy (51 per cent). Among Democrats, 84 per cent have a positive view of Biden, 82 per cent of the first lady, 77 per cent of Harris, and 35 per cent of Hunter Biden, while 86 per cent of Republicans view Trump favorably.Economic sentiment has improved slightly, with 32 per cent of voters rating the economy as excellent or good, the highest during Biden's presidency. Fifty-nine percent say they are financially stable or improving, up 5 points since last summer, and 44 per cent feel optimistic about the economy, a 9-point increase from 2023.Biden’s job approval stands at 45 per cent , unchanged from last month but the best since January 2023. Thirty-four percent are satisfied with the country's direction, the highest in over three years but still lower than when Biden took office in 2021.Voters prioritize handling issues over candidate character by a 59 per cent -29 per cent margin. Trump is trusted more on immigration (+9 points) and the economy (+5 points), though these advantages have narrowed since May. Biden is trusted more on health care (+10 points) and the future of American democracy (+6 points), with his biggest advantages on abortion (+13 points) and climate change (+20 points).Kennedy’s support has declined, with his net favorability now at -11 points. His supporters are evenly split between Biden and Trump in a two-way race.The survey, conducted June 14-17, included 1,095 registered voters and has a margin of error of ±3 percentage points.","US President Joe Biden has emerged as the frontrunner in a hypothetical matchup against former President Donald Trump for the first time since October.

Jacques Bermon Webster , better known by his stage name Travis Scott , has been taken into custody by Miami authorities on allegations of disorderly intoxication and trespassing, BBC reported.

The 33-year-old rapper was officially booked at 04:35 local time, as per Miami-Dade County Corrections Department's online records.

Travis Scott, a Grammy Award nominee , is widely considered one of the most prominent figures in the hip-hop industry .

Milk prices surge as economic crisis contributes to inflation in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/milk-prices-surge-as-economic-crisis-contributes-to-inflation-in-karachi/articleshow/111085342.cms,"KARACHI : As Pakistan continues to grapple with economic challenges that, in turn, are contributing to inflation in the country, the cost of various essential products, including milk, have also gone up, putting the brunt on the people.The reason for the skyrocketing prices of essential goods is due to energy shortages, and fluctuations in global commodity prices.Amidst these hardships, voices from Karachi resonate with frustration and concern.M. Akhter, a resident, expresses the struggles faced by daily wage workers and labourers, highlighting the impact of soaring prices not only on milk but also on related products such as Ghee (clarified butter).""We can't sustain our households in such inflationary times,"" he laments, urging the government to consider the plight of its citizens amidst these challenging circumstances.Faizan echoes similar sentiments, explaining that milk prices have escalated due to the rising costs faced by dairy farm owners for essentials like fodder, high rents, and water.""They have no choice but to pass on these expenses to consumers,"" he observes, urging the government to prioritise the welfare of the common people regardless of how they came into power.In Karachi, and across Pakistan, the struggle against inflation is not just about economic numbers but about the daily realities faced by the citizens.According to local media reports, the cost of milk in Karachi surged notably after dairy farmers and wholesalers, in collaboration with commissioner Karachi , settled on an agreement to raise prices by PKR 20 per litre.The decision came after an extensive consultation session that lasted several hours, where the commissioner met with stakeholders from the dairy farming, wholesaling, and retail sectors to discuss and finalise the price adjustment.Following thorough deliberations, all parties reached a consensus to implement the PKR 20 per litre hike, setting the new price of milk at PKR 220 per litre, which represents a significant increase compared to previous rates.","The cost of milk in Karachi surged notably after dairy farmers and wholesalers settled on an agreement to raise prices by PKR 20 per litre.

Massive protests threatening to send the government packing used to be held across the country.""Oh, how the times have changed. Days after dropping tax bombs that will further eviscerate the struggling masses, the authorities have announced that not only will they be taking more money out of the pay cheques of salaried individuals, they will also be squeezing whatever is left through significantly jacked-up electricity bills ,"" the editorial read.Citing news reports, it said that Nepra (National Electric Power Regulatory Authority) has hiked the uniform national tariff for the base price of electricity by almost 20 per cent to hand over electricity distribution companies almost half a trillion rupees more over the next fiscal year.The average base tariff for a single unit of electricity, which was PakistRupees (PKR) 27.78 in the outgoing year, will be PKR 35.50 from July 1.On top of this, various duties, taxes, and surcharges, as well as fuel and tariff adjustments, will be levied, forcing ordinary citizens to pay through their noses, not just for the fuel and operation and maintenance costs involved in generating electricity, but also for capacity charges that past governments have promised power generation companies, as well as the theft and transmission losses that distribution companies have shown a complete unwillingness to mitigate for many years.The average middle-class bill-paying customer will be forking out between PKR 65-72 for each unit of electricity they use in a month. Meanwhile, the federal government will present this as an 'achievement' in front of the IMF to ask for even more loans to keep a clearly failing system running for a few years longer, the editorial added.However, at the same time, the government has announced a PKR 10.69 per unit 'relief' for the industrial sector to 'make it competitive'. There can probably be no better example of crony capitalism.While the average salaried individual is finding it difficult to meet their ends on a shrinking real wage amidst month after month of unceasing, unchecked inflation, it is the big industries who get a break in the form of cheaper electricity so that they can pad up their profits while paying little back to the country in the form of taxes.""That the government is failing the people seems like an understatement. It is clearly least bothered by their plight. Its financial planning shows that it has no interest in going after those who dodge their dues; it just wants to take the easy route and enjoy the ride for however long it is in power,"" the Dawn editorial stated.","The average base tariff for a single unit of electricity, which was PakistRupees (PKR) 27.78 in the outgoing year, will be PKR 35.50 from July 1.

Pakistan: Tomato prices soar to PKR 200 per kg ahead of Eid festivities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tomato-prices-soar-to-pkr-200-per-kg-ahead-of-eid-festivities/articleshow/111049153.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The price of tomatoes has surged to over PKR 200 per kilogram in a single day just ahead of Eid al-Adha, despite the district government setting the price cap at PKR 100 per kilogram, as per reports.This annual occurrence during Ramadan and Eid al-Adha typically goes unnoticed by authorities, despite their assurances to the contrary.In response to the situation, the Peshawar Deputy Commissioner has taken action by imposing a ban, under Section 144, on transporting tomatoes out of the district.With Eid al-Adha merely two days away, local retail markets have seen tomato prices double, aligning with earlier predictions that tomatoes, along with onions, would once again be sold at inflated prices during this festive period.Residents of the area have expressed frustration, noting that prices have escalated by Rs100 per kilogram in just one day. Many believe that the district administration's efforts will likely be limited to verbal instructions, as has been the case in previous instances, as per reports.During the budget presentation, one of the standout assertions was the government's commitment to maintaining inflation at 12 per cent in the upcoming fiscal year. On the surface, this goal appears supported by various planned initiatives aimed at curbing inflation rates.However, the implementation of aggressive tax measures, highlighted as key revenue strategies, seems paradoxical as they could potentially escalate prices instead of stabilising them.Regardless of the method used to gauge inflation, the stark reality is that any figure exceeding the previous fiscal year's average monthly inflation rate of 24.9 per cent will inevitably lead to increased consumer prices.Abid Suleri, Executive Director of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), argues that the government ought to have adjusted the minimum taxable income thresholds to factor in inflation when outlining personal income tax brackets. He criticises the current monthly exemption of PKR 50,000 as insufficient and warns that doubling taxes on those falling within the initial tax slab could reduce their disposable income, thereby exacerbating economic hardships.Moreover, heightened fuel expenses stemming from amplified levies and augmented GST rates in specific sectors are anticipated to drive inflation even higher, intensifying the overall cost of living. Suleri emphasises the absence of any mention regarding the taxation of agricultural income, which he believes could substantially broaden the tax base, Dawn reported.","The price of tomatoes has surged to over PKR 200 per kilogram in a single day just ahead of Eid al-Adha.
