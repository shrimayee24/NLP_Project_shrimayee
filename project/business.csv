BAGALKOT: In a shocking twist to the incident of a hair dryer exploding in the hands of a woman recently, leaving her maimed, Karnataka police have arrested a person who allegedly planted a detonator inside the appliance with the intention to kill.However, in a bizarre turn of events, it ended up maiming the accused's paramour rather than his purported target - a woman who was opposed to their relationship.Accused is Siddappa Sheelavant alias Hudedmani, 35, of Kurtageri village in Karnataka's Koppal. The hair dryer was originally couriered to a woman, Shashikala, on Nov 15. Since she was not at home, she requested the delivery man to hand it over to one of her neighbours, Basavarajeshwari, to collect the parcel and open it. However, as soon as Basavarajeshwari switched it on, it exploded, severing her hands.Though police had initially suspected an electrical short circuit as reason behind the blast, investigation revealed that it was Siddappa who had plotted to kill Shashikala for objecting to his affair with Basavarajeshwari. Sources said Siddappa and Basavarajeshwari were from the same village and were in a relationship. Their affair continued after the death of Basavarajeshwari's husband Papanna Yarnal, an ex-armyman.Bagalkot SP Amarnath Reddy said a few months ago, Basavarajeshwari introduced her friend and neighbour Shashikala to Siddappa. Once Shashikala came to know about the affair, she advised Basavarajeshwari to avoid Siddappa, which she did. This angered Siddappa and led him to plot the lethal, booby-trap attack.Police said Siddappa's job at a granite company for past 16 years had made him familiar with detonators and their use. He bought a hair dryer and fixed a detonator - commonly used for blasting rocks at quarries - in it.","Accused is Siddappa Sheelavant alias Hudedmani, 35, of Kurtageri village in Karnataka's Koppal.

MOSCOW: Amid govt's big push for more Vande Bharats, railways is yet to finalise the design for the semi-high-speed train 's new sleeper coach version, even after 14 months of it signing a Rs 55,000 crore contract with Russian firm TMH under a joint venture. The reasons for the hold-up are need for more toilets in a coach (four instead of three), a pantry car in every train set, and luggage space in each coach - issues that could lead to an increase in project cost and roll-out delay.The matter was taken up at a high-level committee meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and first deputy PM of Russia Denis Manturov in Delhi last week, TMH CEO Kirill Lipa said. He added that even Russian President Vladimir Putin is aware of the issue.""We raised this issue during the meeting. It's not that we are seeking some pressure from Russian govt, but we want Indian Railways to give us key explanations. For that, we need some support from Indian govt,"" Kirill said.TMH is the major shareholder in Kinet Railway Solutions, SPV of the Russian firm and Indian Railways PSU RVNL. It bagged the contract and signed an agreement with Indian Railways in Sept 2023 to manufacture 1,920 Vande Bharat sleeper coaches and maintain them for 35 years.Kirill said till May this year, they were hopeful of rolling out the first prototype of the train by year-end. ""But Indian Railways sought changes in the design and we had to rework. These changes are creating need for time and for additional budget,"" he said. Kinet has also sought compensation for changes in design.A railway spokesperson said the ""technical modifications"" were sought as per the contract agreement and Kinet gave responses ""after a gap of 4-5 months"".

"Final design of Vande Bharat sleeper trains stuck after railways seek for more toilets, luggage space & pantry car",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/final-design-of-vande-bharat-sleeper-trains-stuck-after-railways-seek-for-more-toilets-luggage-space-pantry-car/articleshow/115565486.cms,"MOSCOW: Amid the big push for Vande Bharat trains , the railways is yet to finalise the design for these new trains with sleeper coaches even 14 months after it signed an agreement with an Indo-Russian joint venture (JV). What has held up the freezing design is the need for more toilets, new luggage zones in every coach and a pantry car in each train to meet Indian requirements.“If Indian Railways will postpone the process, the timeline for execution will definitely be impacted…We are keen to start production quickly. To my feelings, what we are discussing can all be resolved at the same time, within two hours. We are spending months just sending letters and waiting for the explanations,” said Kirill Lipa, CEO of TMH , the major shareholder in the JV that has got the contract to manufacture 1,920 Vande Bharat sleeper coaches or.Kinet Railway Solutions, the SPV of TMH and Indian Railways’ PSU, RVNL to execute the project, bagged the Rs 55,000 crore contract to manufacture Vande Bharat sleeper trains and the agreement was signed in September last year. TMH is among the top five railway companies across the globe with more than 1 lakh manpower.Lipa said till May this year they were hopeful of rolling out the first prototype of the train by the year end. But the Indian Railways sought changes in the design of the coaches and they had to rework. “These changes are creating the need for time and for additional budget,” he added. The SPV has sought compensation for the changes in design.However, he said they are hopeful of rolling out the prototype by the second quarter of next year and as per the contract, they need to do so by the end of 2025.An official spokesperson of TMH said while in the original contract the condition was to manufacture 120 trains and each having 16 coaches, now it needs to produce 80 trains and each having 24 coaches. In place of the earlier condition for three toilets in every coach, now Kinet has to provide four lavatories, and every train needs to have a pantry car, which was not in the original tender conditions. The railways also sought space for luggage zones in each coach, which was not there earlier.A railway spokesperson said the “technical modifications” were sought as per the contract agreement and Kinet gave the responses “after a gap of 4-5 months” and their response is under examination. The railway said, “Looking into the future requirements of travelling passengers on the Indian Railways network, it has been decided to opt for 24 coaches in future.”Lipa said while the composition of each train so far as the number of coaches are concerned is not an issue at all, changes in design is a complex process. “It’s not the design of the coaches itself. The significant changes have been about the design. For example, we got the demand to increase the number of toilets. If you put this additional toilet into the coach, it seems there is no problem. But the problem comes from engineering. We need certain systems for this, and it means you need to change the whole layout of the coach; reshape the design and engineering infrastructure within the coach. You need to change in terms of windows and seats. So, when we have some deviations like this, it unfortunately brings us back in terms of design because the old design is more or less completely finished,” the TMH CEO said.On the fresh requirement of a pantry car in each train, he said this is not just about cooking, but this must be done as per the standards of railways and fire system for security of wires. “We need a very clear explanation from the customer of what exactly it wants to have in a pantry; what are the terms and conditions. It needs electricity, heating and water supply. You need to put certain cable and pipes in the train and not just in the one pantry car. Once again, the trainset will be redesigned to some extent,” Lipa said.He said since these were key changes as compared to the original contract they have sought resigning of the contract with modifications to avoid any legal problem in future. Lipa said they have sent letters to the Indian railways and recently on September 27. “We have given official letters to Indian Railways mentioning point by point what should be done in terms of resigning of the contract and we are ready to do it. It has not been resigned yet,” he added.The CEO said the matter was raised even at the India Russia Inter-Governmental Commission for Trade, Economic, Scientific and Cultural Cooperation (IRIGEC-TEC) meeting in Delhi last week, which was chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar.Lipa said, “We raised this issue during the meeting, and we hope it was raised in the right manner and at the right level. It’s not that we are seeking some pressure from the Russian govt but we want the Indian railways to give us key explanations. And for that, we definitely need some support from the govt leaders in India. I believe that after this meeting we will find solutions.”","Kinet Railway Solutions, the SPV of TMH and Indian Railways’ PSU, RVNL to execute the project, bagged the Rs 55,000 crore contract to manufacture Vande Bharat sleeper trains and the agreement was signed in September last year.

Amit Shah's stern message to Delhi cops: 'Laxity unacceptable',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-ticks-off-delhi-police-over-rising-crime/articleshow/115579318.cms,"Amit Shah

NEW DELHI: In a stern message to Delhi Police commissioner Sanjay Arora and his deputies, Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday made it clear to the police brass that law and order was top priority and any laxity was ""unacceptable"".Expressing concern over the rising crime in the national capital, Shah is learnt to have warned senior cops that if crime was not brought under control soon, officials, from top to bottom, would be replaced.He specifically warned the special cell and the crime branch to work with utmost seriousness, sources said. ""When two special commissioners tried to cover up, Shah apparently snubbed them saying 'rehne dijiye' and 'bandh kijiye', indicating how miffed he was with the functioning of Delhi Police,"" a source said.Shah was expected to visit the Delhi Police headquarters on Friday but instead the police chief and five-six special CPs were summoned to Ministry of Home Affairs and the home minister apparently didn't mince words while engaging with them for around 15 minutes. Union home secretary Govind Mohan then reviewed their working for about one and a half hours. The Intelligence Bureau director and a few others were also present.The home minister reiterated that it was the personal responsibility of all Delhi Police personnel to ensure that every Delhiite felt completely safe. He also stressed the need for the special cell and the crime branch to be completely revamped. ""Safai kijiye,"" he warned. This year, barring two central agency-aided operations, the cell has not conducted a single major anti-terror operation.To address the growing concerns over crime in Delhi, Shah directed police to create special action plans and run campaigns in important areas related to civil security. ""The aim is to ensure that criminals are afraid of police and citizens feel assured of their safety,"" he said. ""You are good people, but you are not in sync.""The safety of children, women and senior citizens should be the top priority, Shah emphasised.The home minister's directives come amid growing concerns over the deteriorating law and order situation in Delhi. Organised crimes like extortion and shooting incidents have skyrocketed and street crimes had risen drastically. Police have been citing data to claim a decline in crime trends, but on-ground situation has been narrating a different story. In any case, MHA was clear that much needs to be done to ensure the safety and security of Delhi's residents.","Amit Shah is learnt to have warned senior cops that if crime was not brought under control soon, officials, from top to bottom, would be replaced.

'Ludicrous, smear campaign': India rejects Canadian media report on Nijjar killing

Globe and Mail report

NEW DELHI: Canada on Friday issued a statement clarifying that it has no evidence linking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, or National Security Advisor Ajit Doval to criminal activities in the country.""On October 14, because of a significant and ongoing threat to public safety, the RCMP and officials took the extraordinary step of making public accusations of serious criminal activity in Canada perpetrated by agents of the Government of India,"" statement issued by intelligence advisor to the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau read as.""The government of Canada has not stated, nor is it aware of evidence, linking Prime Minister Modi, Minister Jaishankar, or NSA Doval to the serious criminal activity within Canada. Any suggestion to the contrary is both speculative and inaccurate,"" it added.This comes after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in October had publicly accused India of conducting covert operations in Canada that posed a significant threat to public safety. Trudeau claimed that Canadian officials had made multiple attempts to collaborate with Indian authorities but faced consistent refusals.The Canadian Prime Minister stated that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) had compelling evidence linking Indian government agents to activities such as information-gathering and coercion, including involvement in serious criminal acts. Trudeau condemned these actions and called for respect for Canada's sovereignty.India had categorically rejected these allegations, labelling them as baseless and politically motivated. The ministry of external affairs said that Trudeau’s government was using anti-India rhetoric for domestic political gains. They pointed to his past actions, including associations with political groups that advocate for separatism in India, as evidence of his longstanding hostility towards India.The MEA also criticised Canada for providing a platform to extremist elements, especially in light of the investigation into Nijjar’s murder.Following this, India expelled six Canadian diplomats and recalled its High Commissioner from Canada. The MEA summoned Canada’s charge d’affaires, Stewart Wheeler, to express discontent over the allegations and warned that further retaliatory actions could follow. India’s government, meanwhile, dismissed the claims of Modi’s involvement in Nijjar’s death as “ludicrous” and said that the accusations were designed to serve political purposes, further straining already tense relations.On Wednesday, India strongly rejected Canadian media reports alleging that PM Modi was aware of a plot to kill pro-Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada.The MEA dismissed these claims as ""ludicrous"" and urged that they be dismissed with the ""contempt they deserve."" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We do not normally comment on media reports. However, such ludicrous statements made to a newspaper purportedly by a Canadian government source should be dismissed with the contempt they deserve. Smear campaigns like this only further damage our already strained ties.""The rejection followed alinking Nijjar's death to the Indian government, citing a senior Canadian security official. The official alleged that Canadian agencies believed PM Modi had knowledge of Nijjar’s death and ""other violent plots"" in Canada.","Canada on Friday issued a statement clarifying that it has no evidence linking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, or National Security Advisor Ajit Doval to criminal activities in the country.

"Over 100 monkeys die after inhaling pesticide in food godown, buried in secrecy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-100-monkeys-die-after-inhaling-pesticide-in-food-godown-buried-in-secrecy/articleshow/115573883.cms,"NEW DELHI: Over 100 monkeys died after allegedly inhaling a pesticide sprayed in a Food Corporation of India (FCI) warehouse and were then secretly buried in a pit by warehouse workers to conceal the incident.The tragic discovery came to light when the buried carcasses were exhumed on Friday by a team of veterinarians for postmortem.Circle Officer (CO) Yogendra Krishna Narayan said that police were first alerted to the deaths on Wednesday and have since registered a case against FCI employees while launching a full-scale investigation.The pesticide, identified as aluminium phosphide , was sprayed on wheat sacks in the FCI godown on November 7 to protect the grain from insects and rodents.According to police, a troop of monkeys entered the warehouse through a broken window that night, inadvertently inhaling the toxic gas.When workers reopened the warehouse on November 9, several monkeys lay dead. Instead of reporting the deaths to higher authorities, the workers allegedly chose to bury the bodies in a nearby pit in an attempt to cover up the incident.The incident came to light after members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad raised concerns after learning about the mass burial.This is not the first time such an incident has been reported. Last year, carcasses of nearly 100 monkeys were discovered on the outskirts of a village in Telangana’s Siddipet district. Officials suspected that the monkeys had been poisoned elsewhere, with their bodies later dumped in the area.","The pesticide, identified as aluminium phosphide, was sprayed on wheat sacks in the FCI godown on November 7.

Supreme Court on Friday reserved its order on petitions challenging the changes in the Preamble to put 'socialism' and 'secularism' in it in 1976, even while making plain its disinclination to intervene saying 'socialism' in the Indian context meant "" social welfare state "".Advocate Vishnu Jain cited the recent judgment of a nine-judge SC bench, in which the court had said during the nascent years of the nation, the country had followed the mixed economy model, which in the 1960s and 70s gave way to to a socialist pattern. ""Since the decade of the 1990s, or the liberalisation years, there has been a shift towards pursuing a policy of market-based reforms,"" it had said.Jain said the nine-judge bench had ruled against imposition of a particular economic ideology, for example socialism, and argued that since the Preamble too formed part of the basic structure of the Constitution, it could not have been amended by Parliament in 1976 in violation of the 13-judge bench 'basic structure' ruling in Kesavananda Bharati case. Similar arguments were advanced by Subramanian Swamy and advocates Ashwini Upadhyay and Alakh A Srivastava.However, a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said, ""The way we understand socialism in India is different from the way it is understood in other parts of the world.""The CJI said, ""In India, it means a welfare state. Despite the inclusion of the word 'socialism' in the Preamble of our Constitution, we have turned to privatisation and benefited from it. But we have also focussed on equal opportunity for every citizen. So, why should the court go into the validity of inclusion of 'socialism' in the Preamble?""The CJI-led bench said the 1976 constitutional amendment has not prevented courts from striking down many legislations.In favour of the amendment inserting 'socialism' in the Preamble, the bench said, ""Power under 168 of the Constitution (to amend the Constitution) extends to amending the Preamble, which is part and parcel of the Constitution."" When arguments were advanced that Preamble too was part of the basic structure, which could not have been amended, SC asked, ""Who says Preamble is part of basic structure?""","The issue of the legality of the insertion of'socialism' in the Preamble of the Constitution through the 42nd amendment during the infamous Emergency has simmered for decades.

BAKU: Negotiations at CO went into overtime as the presidency texts that were tabled on Friday, the UN climate talks scheduled concluding day, carried huge gaps on climate finance issues, which need to be bridged for a final outcome.The biggest point of disagreement was meagre core goal of $250 billion per year which developed countries are expected to mobilise for developing nations from a ""wide variety of sources"", including public, private, bilateral and multilateral, by 2035, rather than only from public finance.Though the annual $250 billion is part of the overall figure of ""at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035"" from ""all public and private sources"", developing countries outrightly rejected it as they are pitching for a bigger share of public finance (grants and grants equivalence resources) from the developed nations in the overall package. The post-2025 annual $250 billion by 2035 in the text is meant for replacing the existing goal of $100 billion per year.The other point of discord is the provision where even developing countries are expected to make additional contributions to supplement the finance goal.","Negotiations at CO went into overtime as the presidency texts that were tabled on Friday carried huge gaps on climate finance issues.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday sought Varanasi's Gyanvapi mosque management committee's response to a plea of the Hindu side for an ASI conducted scientific survey of the sealed area inside mosque, where a court commissioner had purportedly discovered a huge 'Shivling' which the Muslim side claimed was a fountain.The Hindu side, through senior advocate Shyam Divan, said ASI survey of the area inside the mosque, which has been sealed on the orders of SC since May 20, 2022, could not take place and pleaded that ASI be directed to conduct the survey using all possible scientific methods and submit a report to SC.The Hindu side's application, through advocate Vishnu S Jain, said the ASI survey report on other parts of the Gyanvapi mosque contained several photographs and material relating to the temple. ""There is important material and evidence relating to the temple within the sealed area which could serve as important evidence in deciding the suits seeking right to worship within the mosque,"" it said.Earlier, SC had deferred scientific survey of the 'Shivling' as even the Centre had said that such a survey, as ordered by the trial court in Varanasi and upheld by Allahabad HC, could be postponed.Divan pointed out that several suits were pending for trial before the district judge and civil judge (senior division) in Varanasi and pleaded for their consolidation before the district judge, whom SC had entrusted with the main suit, or before a three-judge bench of HC. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan said it was for consolidation of the suits to avoid conflicting views. However, it said consolidation of suits before HC would not be advisable as HC should remain the appellate forum, which could re-appreciate evidence.","Supreme Court on Friday sought Varanasi's Gyanvapi mosque management committee's response to a plea of the Hindu side for an ASI conducted scientific survey of the sealed area inside mosque.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Friday met the production team and cast of ' The Sabarmati Report ' - a film based on the Godhra train burning incident of Feb 27, 2002 - and congratulated them ""for their courage to narrate the truth"".""The film exposes the lies and misleading facts to unveil the truth that was suppressed for a long time to meet political interests,"" Shah stated in a post on 'X'. The post put out photographs of his meeting with key members of the team behind the film at his North Block office.Produced by Balaji Motion Pictures and distributed by Zee Studies, the movie stars Vikrant Massey , Raashii Khanna and Riddhi Dogra. It is directed by Dheeraj Sarna. The post by Shah comes close on the heels of many BJP-ruled states declaring the film tax-free. These states include Haryana, Chhattisgarh, MP, Rajasthan and UP.Fire inside the Sabarmati Express near Godhra railway station in Gujarat in 2002 had killed 59 Hindu pilgrims and kar sevaks who were returning from Ayodhya. The incident had triggered communal riots in Gujarat. A commission set up by the then railway minister Lalu Prasad Yadav had in its report described the fire as an accident. However, the trial court in March 2011 convicted 31 persons, sentencing 11 to death and 20 to life imprisonment. In Oct 2017, Gujarat HC upheld the convictions but commuted the death sentences of 11 to life imprisonment. Several appeals against Gujarat HC are pending in SC.","Home minister Amit Shah met the production team and cast of 'The Sabarmati Report' Shah congratulated them ""for their courage to narrate the truth"" The movie stars Vikrant Massey, Raashii Khanna and Riddhi Dogra.

KOLKATA: CPM is hiring political strategists to manage campaigns in Bengal, keeping the 2026 assembly polls in mind. On Friday, the party came out with an advertisement on Facebook looking for political analysts , content writers, graphic designers and digital marketing executives.""We used social media volunteers to reach out to people during the Covid pandemic. But now we need creativity-infused and technology-driven teams skilled in working with data. They will also carry out research at the ground level and create actionable data sets,"" said party's state secretary Md Salim. CPM feels that depending on traditional modes of social media campaign was not enough to catch eyeballs of the younger population.Over the decades, CPM had depended heavily upon its organisation and cadre for its campaign strategies . The party mouthpiece, Ganashakti, has been used since 1967 to convey the party's voice to the masses. However, a change in news consumption patterns and reversal of CPM's political fortune have impacted Ganashakti's importance.""We cannot afford to engage a private company for campaigns and strategies. And unlike BJP or TMC, we are not outsourcing the political process to private organisations,"" Salim said.","CPM is hiring political strategists to manage campaigns in Bengal, keeping the 2026 assembly polls in mind.

NEW DELHI: Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has indicated that National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for Undergraduate ( NEET-UG ) is likely transitioning to computer-based testing (CBT).Speaking exclusively to TOI, Pradhan said a consensus is being developed in consultation with ministry of health, National Testing Agency (NTA), and a newly-formed third-party monitoring group led by former Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chief K Radhakrishnan . This group is tasked with advising and monitoring NTA to ensure robust and transparent examination processes.The Radhakrishnan committee, established in response to NEET paper leak allegations, has proposed transformative recommendations. Key among them is a phased shift to online testing to mitigate security risks associated with paper-based exams. It has also suggested a hybrid model where question papers are digitally transmitted to examination centres, and responses are recorded on paper. This approach would reduce physical handling of question papers, eliminating vulnerabilities at printing, storage, and transportation stages.He said: ""We have started implementation of the committee's report. A monitoring group has been set up, which will continuously advise and monitor NTA. It will work as a third-party vigil."" On NEET, he said, ""Health ministry is primary client and it is being consulted for its suggestions. NTA will conduct the test. We have two ways - paper-based and computer-based testing. Based on consultation and deliberations with the ministry, the committee and NTA, we are in all likelihood moving towards CBT.""Ministry of education has also placed renewed emphasis on social science research to evaluate policies and their societal impact. Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) has announced a significant budget increase to Rs 235 crore for current financial year by expanding funding support for diverse initiatives, including studies on particularly vulnerable tribal groups, projects led by women researchers, and opportunities for undergraduate and postgraduate students.Highlighting the significance of social science research, Pradhan emphasised its role in understanding societal behaviour and crafting effective policies.""Govt in the past 10 years has implemented various transformative policies. So it is important for govt to get these policies and their impact analysed by a third party,"" he said, adding that social sciences are crucial for addressing real-world challenges with practical solutions. ""They provide critical insights for evidence-based policymaking that takes into account empirical data and human factors.""","Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has indicated that National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for Undergraduate ( NEET-UG ) is likely transitioning to computer-based testing (CBT) He said a consensus is being developed in consultation with ministry of health, National Testing Agency (NTA), and a newly-formed third-party monitoring group.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115584740,imgsize-748383,width-400,resizemode-4/115584740.jpg"

The Basavanagudi Kadalekai Parishe , Bengaluru’s beloved groundnut fair, returns on November 25 and 26. The vibrant festival seamlessly combines traditional customs, cultural heritage and community spirit.Environmental advocates have reasons to rejoice as vendors will distribute groundnuts in paper bags crafted from old newspapers, following a successful community initiative involving residential complexes throughout the city.The Zero Waste Collective leads the campaign that aims to reduce plastic bag usage. The theme selected for this year states: ‘Parishege banni, kai cheela thanni’ (Come to the fair, bring your own bags).The Zero Waste Collective collaborates with RWAs, NGOs, schools, colleges and others to promote paper bag usage. “We have already crafted more than 60,000 paper bags this year,” says an organiser, noting that HSR Citizen Forum and RR Nagar contributed one-fourth of these bags, distributed free to vendors.“Kadalekai Parishe happens right in front of my college and that’s how I got involved in it,” says Dhruv Nagarajan Koundinya, a 21-year-old engineering student at BMS College, Basavanagudi, who works with Zero Waste Collective.Dhruv is passionate about peanuts, and looks forward to the annual Kadalekai Parishe. He would watch with fascination as groundnut farmers from across Karnataka gathered at the Bull Temple to offer prayers for bountiful harvests.But a particular aspect of it troubled him. The event produced substantial amounts of plastic waste. Dhruv pondered the feasibility of organising a celebration without any plastic materials. This led to the establishment of the Zero Waste Collective. “It was a person from HSR Citizen Forum who came up with the concept of paper bags,” he says.The paper bags are constructed without staplers or adhesives. “We don’t even use scissors for making these bags. To make a bag, you just need two sheets of newspaper,” says Dhruv.The collective has organised training sessions in residential complexes, including Salarpuria Serenity in HSR Layout, Skylark Greens in Whitefield, Pride Enchanta on Mysore Road, Sterling Terraces in Banashankari, and Nandi Gardens in JP Nagar.Residents at Prestige Bagamane Temple Bells apartment complex produced 650 paper bags during a two-hour session. “It was exciting to see our young ones join hands to make paper bags for the Kadalekai Parishe,” says Santosh Kumar, executive committee member. “While it was a fun activity, it also created awareness about the impact of plastic on the environment, the importance of recycling and repurposing, and how each of us can contribute to sustainable living,” adds Santosh, director of SP Jain Institute of Management Research.The collective also encourages festival-goers to bring their own paper bags. “A bag weighs just 300-400 gm. Choosing to carry your own bag is a great leap towards sustainability,” says Dhruv.Regarding future plans, Dhruv says: “I hope and pray that there will be a day when people carry their own bags and there won’t be a need for any of us to sit and make paper or cloth bags and work with civic bodies to ensure that enforcement happens.”","The Basavanagudi Kadalekai Parishe returns on November 25 and 26.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

President-elect Donald Trump said he is nominating Scott Bessent , who runs macro hedge fund Key Square Group , as the next US Treasury secretary, enlisting a key adviser to manage the sweeping economic agenda he has vowed to enact in a second term.“Scott has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda,” Trump said in a statement Friday. “On the eve of our Great Country’s 250th Anniversary, he will help me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States, as we fortify our position as the World’s leading Economy.”Bessent, 62, emerged as the pick after an extended search for a Treasury chief that saw Trump consider multiple candidates — and Wall Street executives and business leaders vie to influence the president-elect’s decision. Allies believed that Trump sought a candidate that would be favored both by Wall Street as well as an electoral base eager for him to implement sweeping tariffs, embrace cryptocurrencies and crack down on undocumented migration.Bessent beat out other prominent contenders including Apollo Global Management Inc. executive Marc Rowan, former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh and Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty as well as Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, who was named to lead the Commerce Department.If confirmed by the US Senate, Bessent would be the first openly gay Treasury chief, and one of the wealthiest in modern times. Bessent has said that he has always wanted to serve his country, but in the 1980s his sexual orientation prevented him from going to the US Naval Academy, and after graduating from Yale University, from joining the State Department.He joins an economic team beginning to take shape just weeks after Trump won a second presidential term. Trump announced that his former budget director, Russ Vought, would be returning to the same role in a statement to his social media platform later Friday.“He did an excellent job serving in this role in my First Term - We cut four Regulations for every new Regulation, and it was a Great Success!” Trump said.Vought, a key architect of Project 2025, the controversial Heritage Foundation policy document released during the campaign, will work alongside Bessent to implement Trump’s economic agenda.As the nation’s highest ranking economic policymaker, Bessent will have to wade through political thickets in Washington, spearhead international economic diplomacy and bring Wall Street know-how to crisis situations. He will also be closely watched by investors and financial institutions, who are looking for predictability and stability.He has been a proponent of realigning US currency policy, but has stopped short of supporting an overt strategy of depreciating the dollar. During Trump’s first term, the then-president called out dollar appreciation for being harmful to US manufacturers and even considered government intervention to manage the greenback’s value.Bessent has acknowledged that while a weaker dollar would be good for some parts of the economy, some of Trump’s proposals would drive up its value.He has criticized President Joe Biden’s administration for its management of federal debt financing, and has talked about expanding its “friendshoring” policy to create a tiered system among trade partners.At Treasury, Bessent is expected to advise Trump on candidates to chair the Federal Reserve when that job opens up in May 2026. Earlier this year, he talked about the idea of nominating a new Fed chair well in advance of the expiration of current chair Jerome Powell’s term. Financial markets would turn their attention to that shadow Fed chair instead of Powell, Bessent has said.He has said the Fed was too slow to respond to rising inflation in 2021, and criticized the US central bank for its large interest-rate cut in September.Bessent spent part of his career managing money for billionaire George Soros. He lived in London and was part of the team, under Stan Druckenmiller, that made $1 billion in 1992 shorting the pound — a wager that helped force the currency out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, and made Soros famous as the man who broke the Bank of England.He would be the second Treasury secretary, after Steven Mnuchin, who has worked for groups with close ties to Soros.Soros’ family office made about $10 billion in profit under Bessent as investment chief, or about 13% annualized. Since then, he’s run Key Square, which started with a $2 billion investment from Soros — funds he later returned as other investors came in.“I think he’ll be outstanding,” said Druckenmiller. “Having worked for me and George for all those years, he’s been exposed to everything a Treasury secretary has to deal with. He has a deep knowledge of markets and he’s also an intellectual who has the chops to work with academic policymakers. It’s a rare combination.”Bessent will be returning his hedge fund clients’ capital as soon as possible after Dec. 1, according to a person familiar with his plans. Federal rules require cabinet members to develop plans to remove their potential conflicts of interest, and then follow through on them, usually within as little as 90 days.Here’s a look at some key areas of responsibility for the role of Treasury Secretary:Bessent is expected to play a key role in pushing for a renewal of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts through Congress, many of which are set to expire at the end of 2025.The Treasury chief could be charged with liaising with Republicans in Congress to expand the scope of the tax bill to include some of Trump’s campaign-trail tax promises, including a 15% corporate rate and exempting tipped wages from taxation.The Treasury Secretary is also charged with running the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a panel set up after the financial crisis. Under outgoing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, FSOC looked at the issue of climate change, triggering criticism from Republicans who have been wary of any requirement for banks to incorporate climate in their lending or capital decisions.FSOC under Yellen also recommended stronger oversight of stablecoins, which the Fed has likened to bank deposits and money market funds — and which are subject to much more regulation. Trump’s advocacy of the crypto space on the campaign trail likely will put the new Treasury chief’s stance under the spotlight.Peppered through the year are meetings of the finance chiefs of the Group of Seven, G-20 and other international organizations, which the Treasury secretary typically attends as the chief US representative.The Treasury Department implements US sanctions on foreign countries, companies and individuals, which have soared in number over the past several years. Yellen helped to lead efforts at the G-7 to isolate Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and to step up financial assistance for Kyiv.The secretary also has often served as point person on engagement with China. The Treasury chief tends to be a cautionary voice when it comes to proposals aimed at America’s biggest strategic rival. Mnuchin, Trump’s Treasury head in his first term, was seen as playing that role when tensions escalated in 2018 and 2019.In charge of the nation’s purse strings, Bessent will have to deal with a costly, and ballooning, debt load. The federal budget deficit crept up to 6.4% of GDP in fiscal 2024, historically high for a time of economic expansion and full employment. A key driver has been soaring interest costs, in the wake of Fed rate hikes in 2022 and 2023.“No one has been more terrified about this debt stack and the coming refinance we’ve got to do,” Bessent said on a recent War Room podcast with longtime Trump adviser Stephen Bannon. What can “stabilize the bond market” is a fiscal package that reins in spending, he said.Bessent has also complained about Treasury’s debt financing strategy, claiming that Yellen was trying to juice the economy and help her boss ahead of the November election — a charge she rejected.Debt managers may need to be active in managing the Treasury’s liquidity, because the federal debt ceiling is scheduled to kick back in at the start of January. That bars the department from issuing new debt, and triggers an oft-deployed sequence of maneuvers to prevent the US government from running out of cash or, worse, defaulting on its debt — an event that could have catastrophic repercussions.Glen Capelo, who spent more than three decades on Wall Street bond-trading desks and is now a managing director at Mischler Financial Group, called Bessent a “fiscal hawk.”“He definitely will be positive overall for the economy and the markets. He wants to rein in spending. Bessent wants to get the Secretary of the Treasury back in line with the markets – because he does believe Janet Yellen has twisted the issuance around a bit,” Capelo said.","Scott Bessent, 62, runs macro hedge fund Key Square Group. If confirmed by the US Senate, he would be the first openly gay Treasury chief. Trump announced that his former budget director, Russ Vought, would be returning to the same role.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115584242,imgsize-19480,width-400,resizemode-4/115584242.jpg"

The legality of the curriculum remains uncertain.The Texas education agency developed the materials following a 2023 law passed by the Republican-led Legislature.The vote comes amidst a broader push by Republican-controlled states to incorporate religion into public schools.

A man in Michigan, US, can now smile, smell, and swallow for the first time in a decade, thanks to a ""life-changing"" face transplant . Derek Pfaff , 30, underwent the procedure in February, ten years after surviving a self-inflicted gunshot wound that severely damaged his face.Pfaff, who was home on spring break in March 2014, attempted suicide but has no recollection of the event, according to a CNN report. ""I don’t remember anything,"" he said. ""I don’t remember getting the gun, going outside, shooting myself, or the weeks afterward.""His father, Jerry Pfaff , discovered the family's gun cabinet open and found Derek injured in the snow near their garage shortly after 1:30 am. Rushed to the hospital, Derek initially believed he had been in a car accident upon regaining consciousness. The gunshot wound caused the loss of his nose, lips, teeth, and portions of his forehead, impairing his ability to breathe, chew, swallow, smile, and blink, the CNN report said.Pfaff’s injuries made basic functions like eating solid food or speaking clearly impossible. Despite undergoing 58 reconstructive surgeries, significant damage remained. His mother, Lisa Pfaff, recalls a doctor telling her, ""The only option for Derek is a face transplant.""The complex, 50-hour operation involved a team of 80 medical professionals and replaced approximately 85% of Pfaff’s face with donor tissue. Dr Samir Mardini, surgical director of Mayo Clinic ’s Reconstructive Transplant Program, who led the surgery, explained, as quoted by CNN, ""With facial transplantation, it’s not a lifesaving procedure, but it’s a life-giving procedure.""The surgery reconstructed various facial structures, including Pfaff’s forehead, nose, cheekbones, jaws, eyelids, and mouth. Doctors even used a new technique to transplant the donor’s tear drainage system.A month after the surgery, Pfaff saw his new face for the first time. His mother described the moment: ""We turned a really sad, hard day into a really joyful experience for Derek, and it was just a miracle – a miracle for him to see himself.""Pfaff continues his recovery with speech therapy and medication to prevent organ rejection. He is working to raise suicide awareness , saying, as quoted by CNN, ""The sun will rise tomorrow. You just have to stay positive, no matter what the situation is. Look past the down.""","Derek Pfaff, 30, underwent the procedure in February, ten years after surviving a self-inflicted gunshot wound that severely damaged his face.

Who is Santino Pietrosanti?

Pietrosanti's commitment to diversity

Backlash: Is Jaguar's rebranding too ""woke""?

British vehicle company Jaguar 's latest advertisement, ""Copy Nothing ,"" has ignited a firestorm on social media for featuring models and not a single car. Critics have labeled the ad everything from ""pretentious"" to ""a fashion show for people who forgot what they're selling."" Santino Pietrosanti , the self-styled marketing guru who orchestrated Jaguar's controversial rebranding, is at the center of the fierce debate surrounding the car company's shift toward inclusivity and diversity.In Jaguar's 30-second ad, the models walk through abstract scenes while delivering phrases like ""Create Exuberant"" and ""Live Vivid,"" which have been widely mocked. Notably, not a single Jaguar car appears in the entire ad. This absence has baffled many, especially considering the brand's reputation for sleek luxury vehicles.Pietrosanti, a US native, is the head of brand at Jaguar. He now resides in Milton Keynes, England, where he lives with his Scottish husband, Paul, and their cockapoo, Mia, in a £975,000 home, according to The Daily Mail report.At the Attitude Awards last month, dressed in a spangled dinner jacket over a see-through t-shirt, Pietrosanti shared his vision for the rebrand, describing it as a return to Jaguar's roots of ""something truly special.""""We're not just talking about new cars,"" Pietrosanti told the audience, as quoted by The Daily Mail. ""We are talking about all new ways of thinking and embracing the full spectrum of human potential and creativity. Jaguar has always stood for fearless originality, striving to be a copy of nothing. And we believe that every person has the potential to be something unique, something original, and that's what makes us strong.""A key part of Jaguar's transformation, according to Pietrosanti, is its commitment to diversity and inclusion . ""At Jaguar, we proudly stand with the LGBTQ+ community,"" he said. ""Originality and creativity thrive in spaces where people are free to be themselves.""Under his leadership, Jaguar has established over 15 DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) groups, including initiatives focused on Pride, women in engineering, and neurodiversity. Major policy changes, such as creating support for transitioning employees, have been implemented to drive equity and ensure that Jaguar's workforce reflects the diverse society in which it operates.While Pietrosanti's vision has been hailed by some for championing inclusivity and employee empowerment, others have criticized the rebrand as pandering to a ""woke"" agenda. Regardless of the backlash, Pietrosanti remains steadfast in his belief that Jaguar’s commitment to diversity will not only redefine the brand but will also empower its employees and customers alike.""We're on a transformative journey of our own,"" Pietrosanti declared, ""driven by a belief in diversity, inclusion, creativity, policy, and most importantly, action.""","Santino Pietrosanti, head of brand at Jaguar, is at the center of the fierce debate surrounding the car company's shift toward inclusivity and diversity.

A claim that Tesla founder Elon Musk once accused MacKenzie Scott , novelist, philanthropist, and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , of ""destroying Western civilization "" is currently resurfacing on social media. These rumors spread on various platforms, including Reddit, where one post claimed that Musk had criticized Scott for her philanthropy, which focuses on women, minorities, and marginalized groups.The claim, which cites a tweet from Musk, is true but requires context, according to a Snopes report.In March 2024, Musk posted a now-deleted tweet that read, ""Super rich ex-wives who hate their former spouse should be listed among 'Reasons that Western Civilization died.'"" Musk was responding to a post that criticized Scott’s philanthropic efforts, specifically noting that over half of her donations went to organizations focused on race and gender issues. The post asked, ""Who is Bezos' ex giving money to?""While Musk didn't directly name Scott, the context of his reply clearly pointed to the ex-wife of Bezos. The deleted tweet sparked significant backlash, and Musk later removed it. However, the tweet was preserved in the internet archive.This wasn't the first time Musk publicly criticized Scott’s charitable work. In May 2022, Musk expressed concerns about her donations, particularly to Democratic causes, according to a Snopes report. He suggested that Scott, in retaliation for her divorce from Bezos, was targeting all tech moguls, including him, by supporting political movements he believed opposed his business ventures, like Tesla.Scott is a prominent philanthropist. At the time of her 2019 divorce from Jeff Bezos, after 25 years of marriage, Scott, 50, received a 4% stake in Amazon. Forbes currently estimates her net worth at $30 billion, a decrease from $38 billion just days earlier and significantly lower than her peak of $59 billion in 2021.","Tesla founder Elon Musk once accused MacKenzie Scott of ""destroying Western civilization"" The claim, which cites a tweet from Musk, is true but requires context, according to a Snopes report.

Pakistan sparks global health concern with 50th polio case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-sparks-global-health-concern-with-50th-polio-case/articleshow/115458987.cms,"Pakistan’s National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) sparked global health concerns with the revelation of another polio case on Tuesday, which brings the total number of cases in 2024 to 50, as per ARY News.According to the operations center, the latest case was identified by National Reference Lab in a 2 month old girl, from Tank district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, who was confirmed to have Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1).This is the second case reported from Tank this year, with a genetic connection linked to a case from July in the same district.Balochistan province continues to be the most affected, with 24 cases reported this year, followed by Sindh with 13, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 11, and both Punjab and Islamabad each reporting one case. As a result, authorities continue to stress the importance of polio vaccination campaigns to prevent the spread of the virus, especially in high-risk areas. International organizations have also urged Pakistan to implement emergency measures to prevent the spread of the virus.Health authorities announced on November 14 that the case detected in Jaffarabad, Balochistan, marked the district's first confirmed polio infection, highlighting the continued spread of the virus across the country.Genetic sequencing of the virus sample, carried out by the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad, has traced the virus to a WPV1 strain that was previously identified in Pishin, Balochistan, in April. This connection highlights active transmission within the province, which remains the hardest-hit area, with 24 cases reported till now.Besides Afghanistan, Pakistan remains the only country where wild poliovirus transmission has yet to be eradicated. The continued spread of the virus is largely attributed to challenges such as insecurity, misinformation, and community resistance, all of which hinder vaccination efforts.Polio affects the nervous system, often resulting in paralysis or even death. Although there is no cure for the disease, health officials stress that vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent infection.","The latest case was identified by National Reference Lab in a 2 month old girl, from Tank district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
