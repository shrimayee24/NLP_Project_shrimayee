"Instead of foreign data, ICMR wants India’s own evidence to treat lifestyle diseases",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/instead-of-foreign-data-icmr-wants-indias-own-evidence-to-treat-lifestyle-diseases/articleshow/128098205.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a shift aimed at making medical treatment more relevant to Indian patients, the Indian Council of Medical Research has called for large, multi-centre clinical trials to generate India-specific evidence for treating lifestyle and chronic diseases, instead of relying largely on data from Western countries.The move targets conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other non-communicable diseases that affect millions across the country. Health experts say therapies proven effective in Western populations do not always produce the same results in Indian patients because of differences in genetics, diet, climate, disease patterns and access to care.The need for such an approach is already evident in ongoing research. Dr Ambuj Rao, cardiologist at AIIMS Delhi, said India-specific clinical research is essential, pointing to a pan-India influenza vaccine trial in heart attack patients currently underway at AIIMS. He noted that evidence for such interventions cannot come from Western countries because India has a distinct flu season and different public health challenges.Under the initiative, networks of at least five hospitals will jointly evaluate treatments, medical procedures, digital tools and lifestyle interventions in real-world Indian settings.The aim is to identify therapies that are not only clinically effective but also affordable and workable within government hospitals and public health programmes. Officials said the findings will directly inform national treatment guidelines, with each selected study eligible for funding of up to Rs 8 crore over four years.Dr Ravinder Goswami from the endocrinology department at AIIMS Delhi said India’s tropical climate, repeated cycles of stress and poverty, and distinct dietary patterns have led to unique metabolic and hormonal adaptations in Indians, including insulin resistance, higher cortisol levels, central obesity and lower muscle mass. He said rapid lifestyle changes and the growing consumption of refined foods have worsened the burden of diabetes, hypertension, polycystic disorders and other metabolic diseases, which require culturally acceptable and India-specific treatment strategies. The ICMR’s call for well-planned studies, he added, offers a crucial opportunity to generate evidence for conditions unique to India, including certain metabolic disorders and cancers such as oral cancer.Beyond improving treatment protocols, the programme is also expected to strengthen India’s research capacity. Participating hospitals will be required to conduct trials independently, maintain standardised digital records and share data transparently, reducing dependence on pharmaceutical-driven global research.Public health experts say the initiative could have a direct impact on patients, as even small changes in treatment protocols, backed by Indian evidence, can improve outcomes and reduce out-of-pocket spending for families living with chronic disease. If successful, the effort could ensure that what doctors prescribe in India is guided by data generated from Indian patients, not assumptions imported from elsewhere.","The Indian Council of Medical Research has called for large, multi-centre clinical trials to generate India-specific evidence for treating lifestyle and chronic diseases.

The cancer we can see and still miss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-cancer-we-can-see-and-still-miss/articleshow/128098056.cms,".

It begins in plain sight — on the tongue, the cheek, the gums. Yet oral cancer, one of the few cancers that can be detected by a simple examination of the mouth, continues to be diagnosed far too late in India.Nearly 70 to 80 per cent of oral cancer patients in the country are identified only at advanced stages, when chances of survival drop sharply. While early-stage oral cancer has a five-year survival rate of over 80 per cent, late-stage disease pushes survival below 30 per cent. India today accounts for almost one-third of the world’s oral cancer burden, turning a largely preventable disease into a silent public health crisis.Doctors say the problem is delay. Patients typically take three to seven months from first noticing symptoms to reaching a specialised cancer centre. Early lesions are often painless, small, and easily ignored. A minor ulcer, a white patch, or slight discomfort while chewing is dismissed, especially among tobacco users, until the disease progresses beyond easy cure.“Oral cancer outcomes change dramatically with early screening,” says Dr Sultan A Pradhan, Surgical Oncologist at the Head &Neck Cancer Institute of India.Organised screening programmes, he says, can reduce mortality by 24 to 30 percent by detecting precancerous lesions early. Mobile screening units and community cancer camps have already shown that timely identification can stop cancer before it turns fatal.The risk factors are well known. More than 90 percent of oral cancer cases in India are linked to tobacco use, particularly smokeless forms such as gutka, khaini, and betel nut. Alcohol further increases the risk. Doctors are also reporting a gradual rise in HPV-related oral cancers among younger patients with no history of tobacco use, expanding the risk beyond traditional groups.Specialised hospitals play a crucial role once patients enter the system, combining early detection pathways with advanced surgery, reconstruction, and team-based care. But clinicians emphasise that even the best technology cannot fully offset the damage caused by late diagnosis. Oral cancer remains one of the few cancers where awareness and timely referral save more lives than any single drug or machine.At the same time, cancer care is moving beyond what scans can show. Dr Shrinidhi Nathany, Consultant Molecular Hematologist and Oncologist at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, explains that tumours smaller than five millimetres often escape detection on CT or PET scans. Blood-based tests that analyse circulating tumour DNA, or ctDNA, can detect biologically active disease, early relapse, and treatment resistance months before scans reveal any change.In the Indian context, where repeated imaging is expensive and often inaccessible, such tests could help reduce unnecessary scans and ineffective treatments. Used carefully, genomics may lower overall costs while enabling more precise, timely care.Oral cancer does not hide. It appears in the open. The tragedy is not that it cannot be seen, but that it so often is not looked at in time, said experts.","Nearly 70 to 80 per cent of oral cancer patients in the country are identified only at advanced stages, when chances of survival drop sharply.

NEET-PG cut-off: Single-digit scores land PG seats in top med colleges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-pg-cut-off-single-digit-scores-land-pg-seats-in-top-med-colleges/articleshow/128086922.cms,"Removing cut-offs altogether risks patient safety , says doc



NEW DELHI: A steep cut in NEET-PG qualifying standards has led to postgraduate medical seats in govt colleges being filled at shockingly low scores - including in high-risk clinical specialties - triggering alarm across the medical fraternity, reports Anuja Jaiswal.The impact was stark in third-round PG counselling, where candidates secured seats in govt medical colleges with scores ranging from single digits to double digits, spanning both clinical and non-clinical disciplines. Even premier institutions and core clinical branches saw seats being allotted to candidates with such scores.An MS orthopaedics seat at a govt institute in Rohtak was allotted to a candidate with just 4 marks out of 800, while obstetrics and gynaecology at a premier Delhi medical college went to a candidate who scored 44 marks. A general surgery seat was filled at 47 marks.This signals a serious breakdown in medical education and workforce planning,” said a senior faculty member at a govt medical college. “Orthopaedics has traditionally been among the most demanding surgical specialties. Filling it at near-zero scores is a sign not of weaker students but a system under severe strain.”This happened following the sharp lowering of NEET-PG qualifying standards by Union health ministry for the 2025–26 academic session, with drastically reduced cut-offs across categories allowing candidates with extremely low — and even negative — scores to qualify.The effect was visible across disciplines. Seats were filled at 10 marks in transfusion medicine, 11 marks in anatomy, and minus 8 marks in biochemistry, many under reserved and PwD categories. While the revised cut-offs ensured that seats did not remain vacant, doctors warn the policy risks trading competence for convenience.“Allowing surgical and clinical branches to be filled at zero or near-zero percentile represents a serious erosion of standards,” said a senior doctor at a govt medical college. “Marks as low as 4, 11, 44 or 47 out of 800 point to a lack of basic aptitude. Removing cut-offs altogether directly risks patient safety.”The current policy marks a sharp shift from govt’s earlier stand. In July 2022, opposing a plea to lower NEET-PG cut-offs in Delhi HC, Centre had argued that minimum qualifying percentiles were essential to maintain education standards. The court agreed, warning that lowering medical education standards could “wreak havoc on society”, as medicine involved matters of life and death.Defending the present framework, a senior health ministry official said PG seats are allotted strictly under revised eligibility rules, and competence is intended to be ensured through training and exit exams, not entry cut-offs alone. Colleges are certified by regulators and are responsible for failing unsuitable candidates, the official said.Medical educators, however, say the trend reflects deeper structural problems — rapid seat expansion without a matching rise in trained faculty, overcrowded classrooms and eroding bedside skills. “Without strong faculty, robust exit exams and a system to weed out unsuitable candidates, anyone who enters medicine eventually gets a degree,” said a senior academician.Faculty members say the consequences are already visible. Many postgraduate students arrive without strong theoretical foundations, clinical skills or discipline. Pressure to pass students, weak exit mechanisms and over-reliance on online learning have further diluted training quality.“Easy entry has reduced seriousness even at top institutions,” said another doctor on condition of anonymity. “Numbers are rising, but training quality is falling — and that poses long-term risks to patient care.”Doctors caution that the branch of medicine does not reveal its failures immediately. Gaps in training today may surface years later, when these doctors practise independently — with serious implications for patient safety and public trust in the healthcare system.","St steep cut in NEET-PG qualifying standards has led to postgraduate medical seats in govt colleges being filled at shockingly low scores.

PM Modi sets May deadline to prioritise quality improvement of highways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-sets-may-deadline-to-prioritise-quality-improvement-of-highways/articleshow/128085143.cms,"NEW DELHI: Concerned over numerous complaints about poor-quality highways in recent months, particularly during and after monsoon, PM Narendra Modi has set a May deadline for the road transport ministry to prioritise quality improvement and develop robust standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure accountability and consistency.TOI has learnt that while recently reviewing progress in the highway sector, Modi also asked the ministry to crack down on poorly performing and litigating contractors, a move aimed at sending a strong message to errant highway builders.This comes amid poor construction by contractors, along with inadequate supervision by consultants and govt engineers, contributing to decline in quality of highway projects.In a series of instructions, the PM has asked the ministry to devise a mechanism to ensure that blacklisted contractors are barred from participating in fresh bids, even indirectly. It has also been instructed to identify “litigative behaviour” among contractors and factor this into their ratings. Contractors with a record of frequently invoking arbitrations would get lower ratings.Taking note of the possibility of collusion between contractors and farmers, often leading to delays in land acquisition and subsequent arbitration, the ministry has been asked to conduct a detailed study of this pattern and take corrective measures.Following the directions issued after the review meeting, the ministry will also introduce a mechanism to end the practice of contractors engaging subcontractors without the approval of highway agencies, a factor that directly affects construction quality. Norms are being revised to mandate prior approval from authorities before involving any subcontractors.In another major policy shift, the ministry has also been asked to stop the practice of converting state highways (SHs) into national highways (NHs). Highway development plans, the PM has said, should be “economy-centric”, focusing on improving connectivity between economic centres.The move is significant given that the current govt has expanded the NH network from about 91,300 km in March 2014 to around 1.46 lakh km now, a 60% increase, with rapid NH development being one of its key achievements. People aware of the development said states will retain responsibility for maintaining their highways, while Centre will focus on framing quality-control norms and guiding them.Officials added that PM has also instructed the ministry to study constraints and gaps preventing high-speed corridors from operating at the desired speed of 70 kmph, as against the existing average of 50 kmph, and ensure such deficiencies are eliminated in new projects.","PM Narendra Modi has set a May deadline for the road transport ministry to prioritise quality improvement.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday congratulated Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on her landmark victory in the elections to Japan’s House of Representatives, expressing confidence that bilateral ties between India and Japan would further deepen under her leadership.Congratulating her on the outcome, PM Modi underlined the importance of India–Japan ties, which are anchored in a Special Strategic and Global Partnership and play a key role in regional and global stability.In a post on X, he wrote, “Congratulations Sanae Takaichi on your landmark victory in the elections to the House of Representatives. Our Special Strategic and Global Partnership plays a vital role in enhancing global peace, stability and prosperity. I am confident that under your able leadership, we will continue to take the India-Japan friendship to greater heights.”Takaichi secured a sweeping mandate in the snap lower house elections, consolidating her position just months after becoming Japan’s first woman prime minister. Her ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), along with coalition partners is expected to command a strong two-thirds majority, giving her government a decisive edge to push its legislative agenda.Takaichi, 64, emerged as Japan’s prime minister in October after winning the leadership of the LDP, becoming the country’s first woman to hold the office.Known for her tough stance on defence, economic security and China, she has positioned herself as a strong advocate of closer cooperation with the United States and like-minded partners in the Indo-Pacific region.Her victory marks a turnaround for the LDP after years of political turbulence marked by inflation, funding scandals and voter discontent.The decisive mandate is expected to give Takaichi greater authority to pursue policy reforms, including increased defence spending, economic stimulus measures and a more assertive foreign policy.","PM Narendra Modi congratulated Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on her landmark victory in the elections to Japan’s House of Representatives.

Nayara's future unsure: India may bargain with US for Russian crude,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nayaras-future-unsure-india-may-bargain-with-us-for-russian-crude/articleshow/128084437.cms,"NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's threat to bring back the 25% ""penalty"" if India does not stop buying Russian crude has deepened the question mark on the operations of Nayara refinery in Jamnagar.The crisis facing the refinery has triggered talks about change of ownership. While the refinery, under normal circumstances, would qualify to be a good buy, US's hardline stance may prove to be a dampener for prospective buyers, something which is going to persist unless there is a dramatic breakthrough in the talks to get Russia to pause its aggression against Ukraine.Rosneft - Russia's state-run energy giant that has been sanctioned by the Trump administration in order to pressure Vladimir Putin into agreeing to pause his offensive against Ukraine - owns majority stake in the 20 million metric tonnes per annum refinery. Located at Vadinar (Gujarat), Nayara, the country's second-largest single-site refinery, specialises in processing heavy crude. Until the US sanctions were imposed, it was almost entirely dependent on Russian crude as feedstock.Analysts said with the immediate future of the refinery in mind, India may continue negotiating with the Trump administration to allow import of smaller volumes of Russian crude.Indian refineries have been cutting down on purchase of Russian crude.Though observers said India cannot immediately halt purchases even if it decides to reduce dependence on Urals as refiners have already booked Russian cargoes for the next eight to 10 weeks and cancelling them is not feasible, it does not remove the uncertainty about the fate of Nayara.""My sense is that India will still bargain with the US to import some amount of oil from Russia, especially for Nayara refinery,"" said Prashant Vasisht, senior V-P at ratings agency ICRA.Energy expert Narendra Taneja said India will continue importing oil from Russia too, though volumes would decline. ""India will continue to get oil supplies from Russia for two reasons - to assert its strategic autonomy and to maintain the right optics for domestic political consumption,"" he said.""Since India has to make purchases of $500 billion from the US over a period of five years - imports of oil, gas and LPG are the best way to clock the numbers up quickly, which overall is not a bad idea since what we are going to back in return (capital, technology and bigger access to American markets) is quite attractive,"" he said.India imports almost one-third of its crude from Russia, and purchases fell to $2.7 billion in Dec 2025 - the lowest monthly value of shipments in the last three years - and nearly 27% lower than the $3.7 billion recorded in Nov, according to commerce department data.Despite the decline, Russia remained the largest crude supplier to India in 2025-26, accounting for 31.5% of purchases worth $105.1 billion during April-Dec.","US President Donald Trump's threat to bring back the 25% ""penalty"" if India does not stop buying Russian crude has deepened the question mark on the operations of Nayara refinery in Jamnagar.

Young J&K MLA draws praise from across the aisle for House speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/young-jk-mla-draws-praise-from-across-the-aisle-for-house-speech/articleshow/128081626.cms,"JAMMU: A young BJP legislator in J&K Saturday drew rare praise from across the political aisle with her speech in the Assembly, which she confined strictly to budgetary issues in the otherwise highly polarised House.Devyani Singh Rana, 31, is the daughter of former Nagrota MLA Devender Rana, who died in 2024 after winning the assembly election. In Oct 2025, BJP fielded Devyani from Nagrota in the bypoll, which she won. After her father’s death, Devyani had joined BJP and was appointed vice-president of the J&K BJP Yuva Morcha in Jan 2025.While governing National Conference legislators focused on J&K’s special status, BJP used the debate to highlight what it described as developmental gains after the abrogation of Article 370.Devyani, however, flagged electricity shortages, raised concerns over the union territory’s growing climate vulnerabilities, education sector and transportation as members listened to her raptly for around 12 minutes.In her speech, she deprecated Rs 271-cr reduction in disaster management, relief and rehabilitation department allocation, saying the sharp cut comes in a year that saw unprecedented and intense rainfall that devastated large parts of rural Jammu.Referring to tragedies in her constituency, she cited the death of three-year-old Mahi in a landslide and 28-year-old Sheer Khan, who drowned in a river. “These names represent the lives lost in the Jammu division,” she said, calling for stronger flood and landslide management measures.About flash floods that hit Jammu last year, Rana said, people lost their lives, bridges were damaged, roads became unsafe and houses were destroyed. “Our children were stranded at home and in colleges. Apple trucks were stuck on the Jammu–Srinagar National Highway (NH-44), and our traders suffered losses,” she said. She called for more allocation in disaster management as Jammu and Kashmir, she said, is “earthquake-prone, landslide-prone and fire-prone. ”Devyani also flagged under-spending in the social sectors. “If around Ra 193 crore is spent less on education, then how will the children of poor families be uplifted,” she said.She also pointed to a reduction of Rs 782.8 crore in power capital expenditure, saying it comes at a time when voltage remains unstable and transformers frequently fail.While welcoming the initiative of free bus travel for persons with disabilities, the MLA questioned its effective implementation. “Are these buses adequately equipped with ramps and access mechanisms? And when there have been documented cases of buses failing to stop even for women, what deterrent exists to ensure compliance?” she asked.As she ended her speech, members from the NC, BJP and PDP thumped their tables and crossed over to her seat to congratulate her.Devyani holds a degree in economics from the University of California. The eldest of three siblings — two sisters and a brother — she is a businesswoman who took over the management of the family business after her father’s death. “I feel humbled and very blessed by the response to my speech. We all work for the public good,” Devyani told TOI.She said since the ongoing Assembly session is the budget session, she preferred to focus on the budget only to identify problem areas that could be addressed in coming years. “I chose to speak in English because the budget across all quarters is presented and discussed in English,” she said.","Devyani Singh Rana, 31, is the daughter of former Nagrota MLA Devender Rana.

India's electronics manufacturing has grown sharply over the past 11 years, with production rising about six-fold and exports jumping eight-fold, govt told Rajya Sabha on Friday, adding that India has now emerged as the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer.Sharing official figures in the House, MoS for electronics and IT Jitin Prasada said electronics production climbed from about Rs 1.9 lakh crore in 2014-15 to nearly Rs 11.3 lakh crore in 2024-25, while exports rose from around Rs 0.4 lakh crore to about Rs 3.3 lakh crore over the same period.Mobiles have been the biggest growth engine. Production increased sharply from roughly Rs 0.2 lakh crore in 2014-15 to about Rs 5.5 lakh crore in 2024-25, while exports surged from nearly Rs 1,000 crore to close to Rs 2 lakh crore - a more than 100-fold rise.Govt attributed much of this momentum to production linked incentive scheme for large-scale electronics manufacturing, launched in 2020. Under the scheme, mobile phone output rose from Rs 2.14 lakh crore in 2019-20 to Rs 5.5 lakh crore in 2024-25, while exports expanded from nearly Rs 0.3 lakh crore to Rs 2 lakh crore.Officials also said India has turned into a net exporter of mobile phones, reversing its position as an importer a decade ago.Till Dec 2025, the mobile PLI scheme attracted investments of over Rs 15,000 crore and generated over 1.7 lakh additional jobs, Prasada told Parliament. He added PLI 2.0 for IT hardware, launched in 2023, has so far led to cumulative production of over Rs 16,500 crore, with investments of about Rs 857 crore and nearly 4,800 direct jobs.With factories scaling up and exports rising steadily, govt said India is strengthening its position as a reliable global hub for electronics manufacturing.","India has now emerged as the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer.

NEW DELHI: Country’s apex highway builders organisation has sought PM Narendra Modi ’s intervention to review the squeezed construction timelines for big highway projects on PPP, their overall bankability and modification in dispute redressal through arbitration.The National Highways Builders Federation (NHBF), in a letter addressed to the PM, has referred to a recently floated tender for a 200-km greenfield project on Public Private Partnership (PPP) in which a two-year construction period has been set.“Considering the scale of such projects and the scope of activities involving land availability, utility shifting, major and minor structures, interchanges, safety provisions and stringent quality standards, the industry apprehends that such timelines may pose significant execution challenges, even best efforts,” NHBF said.It has cited how the Delhi-Vadodara Greenfield Expressway, despite focused attention and continuous efforts by stakeholders, is yet to be completed even after more than five years from commencement. It has urged govt to set realistic construction timelines to ensure quality and timely completion.It has also raised its concern over the recent amendments to dispute resolution provisions of PPP agreements, wherein arbitration for disputes above Rs 10 crore has been restricted.The changes have been made with reference to the finance ministry’s June 2024 circular.NHBF has said that while arbitration has been curtailed, “well-advised and financially strong participants may still bid, but disputes — if they arise — are likely to go to courts”. It said in such a scenario, even relatively small contractual issues may result in prolonged litigation, disruption to project execution and escalation of claim values, ultimately leading to higher fiscal exposure for govt, rather than faster or more efficient dispute resolution.“There is also a concern that such a framework may inadvertently encourage the emergence of entities oriented more towards litigation-driven outcomes than execution, and that even minor disputes could potentially lead to complete stalling of projects, which may not align with the original objectives of the PPP highway programme,” the highway builders body said.",The National Highways Builders Federation (NHBF) has referred to a recently floated tender for a 200-km greenfield project on Public Private Partnership (PPP) in which a two-year construction period has been set.

India Can Wait Out Trump: Ajit Doval Warned Marco Rubio Against Bullying On Trade Deal, Says Report

NEW DELHI: India and Canada have agreed to formulate a ""shared work plan"" to guide cooperation on national security and law enforcement issues with a larger plan to have practical collaboration to address mutual concerns such as transnational criminal networks.The decision was taken at a meeting between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and his Canadian counterpart Nathalie Drouin in Ottawa on Saturday.The move is seen as part of efforts by the two sides to normalise their relations that came under severe strain following a diplomatic row over the killing of a Khalistani separatist in 2023.NSA Doval's visit to Ottawa came as the two sides are making preparations for a likely trip to India early next month by Canadian prime minister Mark Carney.The ministry of external affairs (MEA), sharing details of the Doval-Drouin meeting, said on Sunday that the two sides acknowledged the progress on initiatives aimed at supporting the safety and security of their countries and citizens.""They agreed to a shared work plan to guide bilateral cooperation on national security and law enforcement issues and to enable practical collaboration on respective priorities,"" it said.""During the meeting, it was agreed that each country would establish security and law-enforcement liaison officers and that their respective agencies would build on working relationships,"" the MEA said in a statement.It said this ""important step"" will help streamline bilateral communications and enable timely information sharing on issues of ""mutual concern"" such as the ""illegal flow of drugs, particularly fentanyl precursors, and transnational organized criminal networks"".""They also committed to formalising cooperation on cybersecurity policy and information sharing on cybersecurity issues, as well as continuing discussions on cooperation related to fraud and immigration enforcement, consistent with domestic laws and international obligations,"" it said.NSA Doval also had a meeting with Canada's Minister for Public Safety Gary Anandasangaree on Friday.The India-Canada relations hit rock bottom following then prime minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in 2023 of a potential Indian link to the killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.India had dismissed Trudeau's accusation as ""absurd"".In October 2024, India recalled its high commissioner and five other diplomats after Ottawa attempted to link them to the Nijjar case.

A stream of hope flows in Bundelkhand through 'Har Ghar Nal',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-stream-of-hope-flows-in-bundelkhand-through-har-ghar-nal/articleshow/128078386.cms,"-

LUCKNOW: For the people of Bundelkhand, this is nothing short of a dream come true that water is now available inside their homes. There are countless stories of hunger, poverty, and hardship linked to water scarcity in this region.The image of a woman carrying a pot of water on her head from faraway places had, for years, become the very identity of Bundelkhand’s districts.For decades, women here endured the water crisis. They walked long distances to reach remote wells and stood in queues at handpumps to collect water. But all this is now part of the past. Today, water tanks visible from afar stand as flowing streams of hope.This scene in Bundelkhand can captivate anyone. In Marwari Gram Panchayat of Panwari block in Mahoba, a woman adjusts her veil outside her house and fills a bucket with water from a tap, while a six-year-old child stands nearby holding a glass. The happiness on the woman’s face says everything about what this tap means to her.When asked, she replies shyly, “Brother, a big crisis has been removed.” When asked whether water comes regularly, her enthusiasm is evident. “Yes, why not. It comes every day.”When asked who all have tap connections, the village head standing nearby explains in detail, “Everyone in the village has it. Water comes twice a day. One tap connection is public, where anyone passing by can drink water.”Talking about Mahoba, the people here had long endured extreme hardship due to water scarcity. At one point, water had to be supplied through water trains. People wandered far and wide just to fill a single pot of water. Now, water tanks visible from a distance tell a completely new story.Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, through five projects, pipeline connectivity has been provided to more than 1.12 lakh households in the district. However, this large-scale scheme did not take shape easily. About 1,131 kilometers of roads were damaged during the work. While repair work was carried out, people did face some inconvenience.Arshad from Mahoba says that whenever a scheme begins, some inconvenience is inevitable, but “Har Ghar Nal” has emerged as a very big hope for this region.In Chitrakoot, under the Silauta Gram Mustakil Group Scheme, the water problem of about 1.25 lakh people in the development blocks of Pahadi, Ramnagar, and Manikpur has been resolved. The hardship of Manikpur’s residents can be understood from the fact that they earlier had to bring water from nearly one kilometer away.Because of this problem, people were often reluctant to marry off their daughters. For them, this water means life itself and the future of their children.Under the scheme, a total of 576 km of pipeline was planned, of which 572 km has already been laid. There are 17 overhead tanks, where water is brought daily from the water treatment plant. Water is drawn from the Yamuna River, treated at the plant, lifted into tanks, and then supplied to people’s homes.Smt. Rajjan Devi, the village head of Barhat, becomes emotional while talking about this scheme. She says, “We are grateful to the Yogi-Modi government for making arrangements to protect our children from diseases. Our children now bathe and go to school. A sense of cleanliness has automatically developed in them.”Along with Silauta, Raipura and Chandi Bangar group drinking water schemes are also being implemented in Chitrakoot. These schemes represent streams of hope that people had never even imagined.Under the Raipura Gram Samuh Peyjal Yojana, the target was to provide tap water to 19,570 families. Taps have been installed in all these houses, and water supply has begun in 60 revenue villages.Chunbad Yadav, a resident of Madna village covered under the scheme, says that a major problem has been resolved. Arranging water even for daily use was difficult earlier, and water for livestock was out of the question. Now they no longer have to worry.This may appear to be just about a tap, but for Bundelkhand, it is a blessing. It represents the fulfillment of a resolve that the Modi-Yogi government undertook as a mission.In Jhansi district, Jal Jeevan Mission pipelines have reached even the last-mile villages in Bada village, Chirgaon, and Bangra.Kamta Prasad, a 65-year-old resident of Gairaha Gram Panchayat in Bangra block, becomes emotional and says that his eyes had longed to see this day.Shagun, a married woman from this village located far from the district headquarters, says ‘earlier she had to walk half a kilometer outside the village to fetch water, and the situation became extremely difficult during the rainy season’.In Pachwara Gram Panchayat of Bangra block, when Ragini came as a daughter-in-law, she had to fetch water from a government handpump. Today, she proudly turns the tap and shows how clean the water is.The daughter-in-law of a poor family is happy that her husband Mukesh Kumar, a daily wage laborer, did not have to pay even a single rupee for the tap connection.Village head Akhilesh Rawat says, ‘about one thousand connections have been provided in his village’. In this Dalit-dominated village, the Arogya Mandir built during the Yogi government also has a tap connection under the Jal Jeevan Mission, ensuring clean drinking water for patients and attendants. Government schoolchildren are also now drinking clean water.Executive Engineer of the Jal Jeevan Mission, Ranvijay Singh, says that 42 villages are covered under this scheme, with 11,437 connections provided.Earlier, the very mention of Banda would bring to mind drought, water scarcity, and thirst. Now, through the Amlikaur Drinking Water Project and the Khatan Drinking Water Project, water has reached 544 villages, and 82,266 households have been provided connections.Pardeshi, a resident of Bandha Purwa village in Badokhar Khurd block says, ‘earlier they struggled a lot for water, but now they are receiving clean water inside their homes’.Executive Engineer of Jal Nigam, Vimal Kumar Verma says, ‘that roads dug up for pipeline laying have also been repaired’.In Hamirpur district as well, two drinking water projects are underway, through which tap water is being supplied to homes in 320 out of 322 villages. For the people here, this scheme is set to play a very significant role in transforming daily life.","The image of a woman carrying a pot of water on her head had, for years, become the very identity of Bundelkhand’s districts. For decades, women here endured the water crisis. They walked long distances to reach remote wells and stood in queues at handpumps. Today, water tanks visible from afar stand as flowing streams of hope.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128078370,imgsize-1048709,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2026-02-08t221401525.jpg"

Misunderstood nature of male loneliness

Patriarchy and the myth of collective guilt

Friendship recession

Do romantic relationships solve loneliness?

Towards solutions

Cultural change:

Institutional support:

Community building:

Policy reform:

Whenever the subject of men’s loneliness or men’s mental health comes up, the conversation almost always follows the same path. It turns into a reckoning. A reminder. Sometimes even a punishment.Men built this system.Men benefit from patriarchy.Men commit violence against women.So why should we feel sorry for them now?None of this is untrue. Patriarchy is real. Gendered violence is real. Women have borne the heaviest cost of systems created and upheld largely by men. Acknowledging male loneliness does not erase that reality.But somewhere along the way, the conversation becomes so rigid that it stops seeing men as individuals and starts treating them as a single, guilty category. And that’s where something important gets lost.Because not all men are perpetrators. Not all men are powerful. And not all men feel seen by the system they are assumed to benefit from.But what about the man who genuinely respects women, who does not subscribe to regressive ideologies, who feels no ownership over the beliefs of his ancestors, and who is trying, quietly and consistently, to do what society expects of him?These men exist in large numbers, yet they are almost entirely absent from public conversations about male loneliness.This article is about them.Loneliness, despite common misconceptions, is not merely the absence of romantic intimacy. It is a subjective emotional experience characterised by a perceived gap between desired and actual social connection. Recent discussions around a so-called “male loneliness epidemic” often reduce the issue to dating failures or sexual frustration, particularly online.However, empirical research consistently shows that male loneliness extends far beyond romantic relationships. Men can be married, employed, socially functional, and still profoundly lonely.Studies suggest that men often experience loneliness differently from women. While women tend to maintain emotionally intimate friendships and family ties throughout adulthood, men are more likely to rely on structured social contexts—such as workplaces, educational institutions, or group activities—to sustain relationships. When these structures weaken or disappear, men are less likely to replace them with emotionally open connections. As a result, loneliness can persist unnoticed, even by the men experiencing it.Crucially, research also indicates that many men do not self-identify as “lonely,” even when they exhibit psychological markers associated with chronic loneliness. This disconnect is especially pronounced in India, where cultural norms discourage emotional introspection in men and valorize endurance over expression. Counselling psychologist Dr Ishita Mukerji observed this pattern repeatedly in clinical settings: “I have seen a lot of times in therapy that, you know, many male clients of mine say that I don't know what I feel. I just know something is wrong. I try to think about it but I don't get an answer. So they really don't know, right, what and how they're feeling. This confusion is not their fault. It is the result of growing up without that emotional permission. They sometimes are numb, emotionally very numb. ”India’s cultural framework places immense emphasis on masculinity as duty. Men are socialised from an early age to internalize responsibility—towards parents, siblings, spouses, children, and society at large. Emotional needs, in contrast, are often framed as indulgent or secondary. This produces what many researchers describe as a “provider burden,” where a man’s worth is tied almost exclusively to his economic utility.Recent data underscores the scale of the problem. A study conducted by the Indian Psychiatric Society found that over 20% of Indian men report experiencing loneliness. Another study by the National Sample Survey Organization revealed that nearly 45% of Indian men feel lonely, with urban men reporting the highest levels. These numbers point to a widespread phenomenon rather than isolated individual distress.Dr Mukerji explained how deeply financial instability can destabilise a man’s sense of self:“What happens is that when a person when a man loses a job, or he's earning less, or he's if he's struggling financially, it doesn't feel like a normal life to him, it actually feels like a personal failure. And this creates deep shame, stress, anxiety, and depression as well. Married men feel the pressure most. Because it's not just they responsibility for themselves, they're carrying responsibility for their wives, children, parents, extended family. They don't allow themselves to feel or say, ""I'm tired,"" or ""I'm struggling."" So when stress keeps building, and there is no emotional outlet, some men start feeling hopeless and extremely depressed.”Sanyam Kapoor, a 28-year-old product manager, when asked whether he ever feels his value as a human being is tied to his bank balance or job title, says, “I don’t want it to be, but yeah, it sneaks in. Especially when things aren’t going great financially. It’s hard not to measure yourself that way when that’s what gets noticed first.”Urbanisation has intensified this issue. Modern Indian cities often lack communal spaces that facilitate organic social bonding. Extended families have fragmented into nuclear units, neighborhoods have grown anonymous, and work hours have expanded. In this environment, men frequently find themselves socially functional but emotionally disconnected.One of the most significant psychological constructs relevant to male loneliness is “restrictive emotionality,” a term introduced by Levant in 1995. Restrictive emotionality refers to the learned inhibition of emotional expression, particularly emotions associated with vulnerability such as sadness, fear, or loneliness. According to psychologist Agneta Fischer, emotional expression is not biologically predetermined but shaped through social learning—a process heavily influenced by gender norms.In India, boys are often taught—explicitly or implicitly—that emotional restraint is a marker of strength. Crying, expressing confusion, or admitting loneliness is frequently met with ridicule or concern about masculinity. While men and women experience emotions to similar degrees, men are more likely to redirect vulnerable emotions into socially acceptable outlets such as anger, withdrawal, or stoicism.Kapoor explained why emotional restraint often feels like self-protection rather than denial.“All the time. Not because I think weakness is bad in theory — but because once you say it out loud, you can’t take it back. People look at you differently. Sometimes they worry. Sometimes they dismiss it. Either way, the dynamic changes.”This emotional suppression has tangible consequences. Chronic stress, untreated emotional distress, and prolonged loneliness can contribute to depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and physical health problems.These numbers are not abstract. In recent years, several cases have drawn public attention to the emotional distress faced by men navigating marital conflict and prolonged isolation. In one such case, a 30-year-old executive employed with a major IT firm died by suicide at his family home in Agra. Prior to his death, he recorded a video describing an overwhelming sense of loneliness and urged greater societal awareness of men’s mental health struggles, particularly the emotional isolation men experience during personal and legal disputes.""Please, someone should talk about men. They become very lonely. If laws do not protect men, then there will be no man left to be accused..."" said Manav in his note.A 22-year-old architecture student from a private engineering college in Bengaluru died by suicide last week, allegedly due to ragging. Before taking the extreme step, the student, identified as Arun, recorded a video blaming his peers and expressing emotional distress over being spoken about behind his back.A native of Hassan, Arun was a final-year architecture student who had secured a free seat at his college owing to his academic performance. His parents, daily-wage labourers, had struggled financially to support his education. Arun was also known to be a talented portrait artist. He recorded a video message detailing his anguish, mentioning that friends had been speaking ill of him behind his back.This disparity is often misunderstood. Women are statistically more likely to experience depression, yet men are significantly more likely to die by suicide. Research suggests that this paradox is linked to differences in help-seeking behavior, emotional expression, and method lethality. Men are less likely to seek professional support and more likely to reach crisis points without intervention.A 2023 study found that suicide rates among Indian men are particularly high among married men and daily wage workers—groups traditionally assumed to be socially anchored. This challenges the assumption that marriage or employment alone protect against loneliness or mental distress.A 35-year-old man, married with one child and working at a consulting firm, chose to remain anonymous. He described his life as stable, predictable—and emotionally narrow. “I wouldn’t say I’m unhappy,” he said, “but I don’t feel connected either.” Most of his close friendships gradually faded after marriage, and although he shares a home with his spouse, he feels uneasy bringing up his stress or exhaustion. “I don’t want to burden her,” he explained. “I’m supposed to handle things.”Addressing male loneliness does not negate feminist concerns, it complements them by targeting one of patriarchy’s quieter casualties.It is important to acknowledge that patriarchy harms women disproportionately and violently. However, it is also true that patriarchy diminishes men by restricting emotional expression and reducing identity to productivity. The idea that men “deserve” loneliness because they benefit from patriarchy overlooks the fact that most men do not experience power as autonomy or choice, but as obligation.Holding individual men morally accountable for historical and structural injustices obscures the real issue: systems that socialise men into emotional isolation while offering no legitimate pathways for connection.When asked, 23-year-old journalist Pranav Shukla, what stops men from talking openly about mental health, in your experience? He said, ""I think men are conditioned not to talk about it. Society often labels them as weak when they do, which makes opening up harder. That said, things are slowly changing and more men are beginning to speak openly about mental health.""Friendships are often the first relationships we form outside our families, and they play a crucial role in emotional and social development. In theory, friendships should remain one of the most important emotional anchors throughout adulthood. In practice, however, male friendships often change shape rather than deepen.Sociologist Daniel Cox coined the term “friendship recession” to describe the steady decline in close friendships across industrialised societies. While much of this research has focused on Western contexts, similar patterns are becoming increasingly visible in India as well. Men, in particular, report having fewer close friendships over time and describe greater difficulty forming new ones after early adulthood.It is important to recognise the real value that male friendships offer while also acknowledging their limitations. Many men do not lack friends, nor do they lack affection or loyalty within those friendships. What is often missing is emotional articulation. It is not that men do not want to talk about their personal victories, their disappointments, or their insecurities; rather, many hesitate because they are unsure how such openness will be received. The unspoken rule becomes one of mutual distraction—spending time together, sharing experiences, and silently hoping that presence alone will be enough.This dynamic is reflected in the experience of Ansh Srivastava, a 22-year-old software developer working in Gurgaon. ""I always have a fair guess of what’s going on in my closest friends' lives but never the whole picture. The whole point of male friendships is to spend time together through the lowest and not talk about it and feel better by the presence of their friend. I don’t think I’ve ever had a conversation about my mental health or my friends’ mental health ever, it's always external events, even though he is literally a part of my family and vice versa. ""There is a persistent assumption that romantic relationships function as a remedy for male loneliness. While intimacy can provide emotional support, research indicates that relying solely on a partner for emotional fulfillment can be precarious. Men who lack broader social networks may experience intense loneliness following relationship conflict, separation, or loss.Moreover, when emotional labor is outsourced entirely to romantic partners, it can strain relationships and reinforce dependency rather than resilience.Dr Mukerji emphasised that mental health care should not be framed as a competition:“From a clinical point of view, if we talk about mental health care, it is not just about comparing who suffers more. It is about, helping people who are struggling and supporting men's mental health does not just take away from women's issues. In fact, healthier men leads to healthier families and relationships. It is very important for men to take care of their mental health irrespective of whatever is happening.”Loneliness, therefore, must be addressed as a social condition rather than an individual romantic deficit.Addressing male loneliness in India requires interventions at multiple levels:Challenging restrictive norms around masculinity and emotional expression is essential. Vulnerability must be reframed as a human capacity rather than a gendered weakness.Mental health education should be integrated into schools, workplaces, and community organizations. Affordable and accessible mental health services are critical, particularly for working-class men.Encouraging participation in community groups, sports clubs, volunteering, and peer support initiatives can help rebuild social capital.Mental health must be treated as a public health priority. Data collection, funding, and targeted programs for men at high risk of isolation are necessary.Male loneliness in India is not a fringe concern or an online exaggeration. It is a widespread, under-acknowledged phenomenon with serious consequences for mental and physical health. While patriarchy shapes this crisis, it does not justify indifference to male suffering. The men who quietly shoulder responsibility, who respect others, and who strive to meet societal expectations deserve to be seen—not as perpetrators by default, but as human beings navigating structural silence.If we are to build a society that values mental well-being, we must move beyond blame and toward understanding. Loneliness, after all, is not a moral failing. It is a signal—and one that India can no longer afford to ignore.","Loneliness is not merely the absence of romantic intimacy. It is a subjective emotional experience characterised by a perceived gap between desired and actual social connection. Indian cultural framework places immense emphasis on masculinity as duty. Emotional needs, in contrast, are often framed as indulgent or secondary.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128075728,imgsize-1542358,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-2026-02-08t203429253.jpg"

‘1.25 Crore Hindus In Bangladesh’: RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat Issues Big Unity Call

'On what grounds should he be awarded Bharat Ratna?: Congress launches sharp attack

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said that the prestige of India’s highest civilian award Bharat Ratna would increase if it is conferred to Hindutva ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.The remark drew an immediate and sharp response from the Congress, which questioned both the merit and the intent behind the demand.Speaking at a public interaction in Mumbai to mark the RSS centenary, Bhagwat said that the long-pending demand for honouring Savarkar deserved serious consideration.“Bharat Ratna’s prestige will increase if the award is given to Savarkar,” he said, reiterating a position that has been echoed by sections of the Sangh Parivar and the BJP over the years.Bhagwat commented while responding to questions on a range of issues, including the Uniform Civil Code, nationalism and the role of the RSS in public life. The programme was attended by several prominent personalities from the film and cultural world.The Congress reacted strongly to Bhagwat’s statement. Party MP Imran Masood questioned the basis on which Savarkar should be awarded the Bharat Ratna and accused him of contributing to the idea of India’s partition.Speaking to reporters in Varanasi, Masood said, “On what grounds should he be awarded the Bharat Ratna? For what merit? For causing the partition of India and Pakistan?”“It was Savarkar who first propagated the idea of two nations within the country and laid the ideological foundation for the division between India and Pakistan,” he added.The latest exchange comes against the backdrop of a long-standing and politically charged debate over Savarkar’s legacy. While the BJP and its ideological affiliates project him as a freedom fighter and a key ideologue of Hindutva who suffered incarceration under British rule, the Congress has consistently opposed any move to honour him with the Bharat Ratna, citing his controversial views and alleged links to the conspiracy in Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination.The issue first gained major political traction in 2019, when the BJP’s Maharashtra unit included a promise in its election manifesto to seek the Bharat Ratna for Savarkar. The Congress had then hit out sharply, with senior leader Manish Tewari saying that conferring the award on Savarkar, especially around Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary, would be deeply inappropriate.At the time, the BJP defended the demand, arguing that Savarkar was a freedom fighter who spent years in harsh imprisonment in the Andaman Cellular Jail and that many national leaders, including BR Ambedkar and Sardar Patel, received the Bharat Ratna long after Independence.The demand resurfaced in 2024 as well, when Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray questioned why the BJP-led Centre had not yet honoured Savarkar despite repeated assurances and letters from BJP leaders themselves. Thackeray said that the ruling party had no right to lecture others on Savarkar if it failed to act on its own promises.",Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) chief Mohan Bhagwat said that the prestige of India’s highest civilian award Bharat Ratna would increase if it is conferred to Hindutva ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta, along with transport minister Pankaj Kumar Singh, PWD Minister Parvesh Verma and BJP National President Nitin Nabin, flagged off around 500 electric buses and the Delhi-Panipat bus service on Sunday to mark the BJP-led government's first year in office.Addressing a gathering, chief minister Rekha Gupta said that the people of Delhi ended years of neglect in development by electing the BJP government.""For eleven years, Delhi lagged behind in development. The hopes and aspirations of the people of Delhi withered away. Delhi stopped dreaming of development. The people of Delhi were left yearning for basic amenities like water, sewage, and healthcare.

Even more gratifying is that we are continuing to fulfil the promises we made to the people of Delhi. Today, we have introduced 500 electric buses for the people of Delhi. We are also increasing connectivity between Delhi and Panipat. So, I am happy that our work is progressing day by day.

Isro kicks off process to get special rail track system at second launch complex,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-kicks-off-process-to-get-special-rail-track-system-at-second-launch-complex/articleshow/128064659.cms,"Representative photo (PTI)

BENGALURU: Isro has begun the process to find companies that can install a sophisticated rail track system at its upcoming Second Launch Complex (SLC) in Kulasekarapattinam, which will cater to small rocket launches once it gets commissioned.The Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) has invited bids for the supply, erection, and commissioning of approximately 1,700 meters of heavy-duty rail tracks that will transport fully integrated launch vehicles from the assembly facility to the launch pad—a distance of about 740 meters.The rail system will be designed to carry the Mobile Launch Structure (MLS) loaded with the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) class of rockets, with a maximum payload capacity of 570 tonnes. The project involves installing special grade rails capable of withstanding individual bogie wheel loads of up to 100 tonnes.“This is not just a conventional rail system”, project documents accessed by TOI, read. “The tracks must maintain level differences across rails within just ±1 millimeter to ensure the stability of the launch vehicle during transportation.”The complex engineering requirements include a curved segment with a 300-meter mean radius of curvature, as well as a perpendicular cross-track system with a 9-meter gauge that will allow the MLS to be parked when not in use.A unique feature of the system is the axle-turning arrangement at track junctions, which will enable the bogie system to switch between the main track (6.5-meter gauge) and cross tracks (9-meter gauge). During this operation, the MLS will be temporarily placed on ground anchors while the bogie is lifted, manually rotated to align with the desired track direction, and then repositioned.Work is scheduled to be completed within 29 weeks of order placement, with payment terms of 100% within 30 days after successful erection, testing, and acceptance by Isro. The project includes liquidated damages of 0.5% per week for delays, capped at 10% of the total contract value.The Department of Space (DoS) had earlier said that the Kulasekarapattinam spaceport is targeted to be commissioned in the next fiscal (2026-27). The Govt has allocated nearly Rs 986 crore for the project.DoS, while detailing specific advantages of the Kulasekarapattinam launch site in terms of payload capacity and its comparison with the existing launch facility at Sriharikota, had said: “The new site will enhance payload capability of launch vehicles in the class of SSLV, while launching satellites to polar orbits.”Launches to Sun-Synchronous Polar Orbits (SSPO) from Sriharikota need maneuvering of the rocket to avoid the impact of spent stages over landmasses and this will significantly reduce the payload capability. “The payload capability of SSLV to SSPO while launching from Kulasekarapattinam is about 300kg whereas the capability is inadequate for a useful payload while launching from Sriharikota,” as per DoS.Post commissioning, the launches of SSLV and equivalent launch vehicles from the private sector are expected to be carried out from Kulasekarapattinam spaceport.",The rail system will be designed to carry the Mobile Launch Structure (MLS) loaded with the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) class of rockets.

India begins human trials of new indigenous vaccine for forest fever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-begins-human-trials-of-new-indigenous-vaccine-for-forest-fever/articleshow/128063215.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has moved a step closer to strengthening its defence against Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a tick-borne viral infection that has long troubled forest-edge communities in the Western Ghats. The Indian council of medical research (ICMR) has initiated Phase I human clinical trials of a newly developed, fully indigenous vaccine after completing key laboratory and animal studies.The vaccine programme was taken up at the request of the Karnataka government, one of the states most affected by recurring KFD outbreaks. The disease is endemic to parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa and Maharashtra, and is associated with high fever, severe weakness and, in some cases, fatal complications.Developed under the Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the candidate vaccine is a collaborative effort involving Indian immunologicals limited and the ICMR- National institute of Virology. It is a two-dose, adjuvanted, inactivated vaccine, with doses administered 28 days apart.Officials said animal challenge and toxicity studies have been successfully completed, and GLP-grade vaccine material has already been produced.Following approval from the national drug regulator, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, the first phase of human trials has now begun to assess safety and early immune response.If the Phase I trial shows the vaccine to be safe and immunogenic, it will progress to larger clinical trials before seeking full regulatory approval. Scientists say the new candidate aims to overcome limitations of the existing KFD vaccine, which requires repeated booster doses and has shown variable effectiveness in the field.The government said it will continue to support state governments in addressing difficult public health challenges, with the KFD vaccine effort seen as part of a broader push to develop solutions for region-specific infectious diseases using indigenous research and manufacturing capacity.","Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is endemic to parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa and Maharashtra.

Why the GCC Unified Visa matters



Seamless multi-country travel: Visit multiple member states without applying for separate visas, a huge boon for global travellers.

Biometric and border control integration across all six nations. Common digital application and data-sharing platforms. Security and immigration protocols to ensure regional safety and streamlined entry.





The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) comprising of Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region. This initiative, often described as a “Schengen-style visa” for the Gulf, aims to let visitors enter all six member states on a single travel permit, eliminating the need to apply for separate visas for each country.Officials sometimes refer to this new permit as the GCC Grand Tours Visa or Unified GCC Tourist Visa. Travel and tourism authorities have repeatedly emphasised that this is not just a travel document but a key step in deeper regional economic integration and tourism growth.Although the unified visa was originally expected to start as early as late 2025, plans have been pushed to 2026 due to the complexity of aligning immigration systems, security protocols and data-sharing across six sovereign states. According to travel industry reporting, the rollout will unfold in stages:No exact day or month has been publicly confirmed yet as authorities have only reiterated that the visa will go live in 2026 (at latest early 2027 according to some officials).The unified GCC visa will be designed primarily for non-citizen visitors (tourists, business travellers, conference attendees and multiple-destination holidaymakers) who want to explore the Gulf without the hassle of applying for individual visas for each country. Key predicted eligibility criteria include:Authorities are expected to launch an online application portal where travellers can submit their details digitally and receive the visa electronically, similar to e-visa systems in other regions.Official fee structures have not yet been confirmed by GCC authorities, but industry sources and draft proposals indicate that the unified visa could cost in the range of US $100–$150 (approx. AED 367–550). This price range would make the unified GCC visa competitive with other regional multi-country visas, and far simpler than paying for six separate tourist visas for each member state.The digital process and single-application design are expected to reduce administrative overheads and processing delays, helping travellers plan trips without multiple embassy visits.While final rules are still pending official publication, proposals for the unified visa include several options:The exact structure (single entry vs multi-entry, extension rules, etc.) will be published when the official visa framework and application system launch, but authorities have emphasized flexibility to accommodate both short holidays and longer multi-destination itineraries.The GCC Unified Visa is considered a game-changer for travel and tourism in the Middle East Officials have drawn inspiration from the European Schengen visa model, though the GCC’s version will be adapted to regional needs and security standards. Before the visa becomes fully operational, GCC member states need to finalise:If pilot testing in late 2026 goes smoothly, widespread availability could follow in early 2027 though authorities remain optimistic about a 2026 launch for general applications.The GCC Unified Visa 2026 promises a major shift in how travellers explore the Gulf. It's launch is expected in 2026 (pilot late-year, full rollout to follow), eligibility includes tourists and other visitors with valid travel credentials, fees is estimated at US $100–$150 range with validity of likely 30–90 days, with single or multiple entries. This unified system could be a milestone for regional travel and a boost for the Gulf’s tourism, business and investment landscape.","The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region.

New labour code changes and why companies are making one-time provisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-labour-code-changes-and-why-companies-are-making-one-time-provisions/articleshow/127929310.cms,"1.

MUMBAI: Most companies reporting their financial results for Q3FY26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits attributing it to the new labour code. TOI takes a look at what brought about these changes and how does it affect stakeholders.The change relates mainly to gratuity payments under the Code on Social Security, 2020. The new rules redefine “wages” for calculating gratuity and expand eligibility for fixed-term employees.Under the revised rules, wages used to calculate gratuity must form at least 50% of an employee’s total cost-to-company (CTC). If allowances exceed 50% of CTC, the excess must be added back to wages for gratuity calculation. This increases the base on which gratuity is calculated.The law also allows fixed-term employees to become eligible for gratuity after completing one year of service instead of the earlier five-year requirement. Because of these changes, companies must account for higher future gratuity payouts, forcing them to create one-time provisions in their financial statements.The government introduced the change through the Code on Social Security, 2020, which forms part of four consolidated labour codes replacing 29 older labour laws.The codes were passed by Parliament in 2020, but detailed implementation rules were notified later.The reform aimed to simplify labour laws, improve social security coverage and reflect modern employment practices. A key concern was that many companies structured salaries with a low basic pay and high allowances to reduce statutory payouts such as provident fund and gratuity. The new definition of wages reduces this flexibility.Another trigger was the growing use of fixed-term employment across industries. The government sought to extend social security benefits to such workers, especially in sectors with high attrition and contractual hiring.The new labour codes, including the Social Security Code, came into force on November 21, 2025. While the central framework became effective from that date, states continue to finalise detailed implementation rules.Employees benefit mainly through higher gratuity payouts and wider eligibility. Because gratuity calculations now use a broader wage base, many employees will receive higher retirement or exit benefits.Fixed-term employees, who earlier did not qualify unless they completed five years of service, can now receive gratuity after one year. This benefits workers in sectors with short-term or project-based employment.The changes also aim to bring more transparency to salary structures and expand social security coverage.The financial impact varies depending on salary structure and workforce composition.Manufacturing and heavy industries: These sectors rely heavily on contract and fixed-term workers. The new rules increase gratuity liabilities and could push companies to review workforce models.Technology and IT services: These companies often use allowance-heavy salary structures. They may need to restructure compensation to meet the wage definition norms.Banking and financial services: The sector may see higher statutory benefit costs and increased liabilities for outsourced and contractual staff.Construction: The sector employs a large informal workforce. The new rules increase compliance requirements and settlement obligations.Retail and e-commerce: Companies with seasonal hiring and gig-based employment may face higher employee benefit costs and classification challenges.Healthcare: Round-the-clock operations and contract staffing could raise wage and benefit compliance costs.Manufacturing and heavy industries are expected to make the largest one-time provisions. These sectors typically have a large contract workforce, lower basic salary structures and higher dependence on fixed-term employment, which significantly increases gratuity liabilities.Technology and financial services companies are also likely to see sizeable increases due to changes in salary structure norms, though typically less than manufacturing.","Most companies reporting their financial results for Q3FY26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits.

Ramadan 2026 working hours in the UAE explained: Penalties and rules for private sector and government employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ramadan-2026-working-hours-in-the-uae-explained-penalties-and-rules-for-private-sector-and-government-employees/articleshow/127923197.cms,"Ramadan 2026 in UAE: How Will Working Hours Change for You?

Why working hours change during Ramadan in the UAE



UAE Ramadan 2026: Reduced Working Hours for Private and Government Sectors

Private sector during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE: Mandatory two-hour reduction



How it works:



If a regular workday was 8 hours, it becomes 6 hours during Ramadan.

Employers may offer additional flexibility, such as remote work or staggered schedules, provided the reduced hours rule is followed.

This rule is not optional as companies that do not implement the reduction can face legal consequences, including labour complaints and possible penalties if inspected by MoHRE.

Tip for employees:

Government/public sector during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE: Set reduced hours and flexibility



Typical government hours during Ramadan 2026



Monday to Thursday: 9:00 am to 2:30 pm

9:00 am to 2:30 pm Friday: 9:00 am to 12:00 pm (shorter to allow for Jummah prayer and family time)

Flexible arrangements



School hours and broader work-life adjustments during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE



UAE Employers Face Penalties for Ignoring Ramadan Working Hour Laws

Legal backing and employer responsibilities during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE



Employers should:



Apply the two-hour reduction for private sector workers.

Ensure government department staff adhere to the FAHR-issued Ramadan hours.

Offer reasonable flexibility when operationally possible to support employee well-being.

Failure to comply with mandated Ramadan working hours may expose employers to labour disputes, inspections or penalties — especially in the private sector where these reductions are legally binding.

What this means for UAE workers during Ramadan 2026



Shorter workdays with at least two hours reduced for private workers.

Government hours typically from 9 am to 2:30 pm (Mon–Thu) and 9 am to 12 pm (Fri).

Flexibility options such as remote work where feasible.

School schedule adjustments and broader lifestyle shifts in line with Ramadan culture.





As the holy month of Ramadan 2026 approaches (expected to begin around February 18–19, 2026 after the crescent moon sighting), residents and workers across the United Arab Emirates are preparing for annual adjustments to daily routines including reduced working hours in both the private and government sectors. These changes are designed to help employees balance work responsibilities with fasting, prayer and family time during the sacred month.The working-hour adjustments are not just tradition or goodwill, they are formally recognised within UAE labour regulations and official government circulars.Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, during which many Muslims fast from dawn until dusk, engage in prayer, reflection and community gatherings. In recognition of the physical and spiritual demands of fasting, authorities in the UAE modify work schedules to allow workers time to maintain energy, attend religious activities and manage family life.According to the UAE’s labour law (Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021), working hours during Ramadan are specifically determined by executive regulations, requiring shorter daily schedules for employees unless otherwise authorised.For most private sector employees in the UAE, daily working hours are reduced by two hours throughout Ramadan. This reduction applies to all employees under the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE), regardless of their religion or fasting status.Any private sector employer who keeps standard hours throughout Ramadan is not complying with UAE labour regulations and can be reported to authorities.For federal government employees, the Federal Authority for Government Human Resources (FAHR) issues specific working schedules to balance productivity and observance.These hours represent a reduction of about 3.5 hours on weekdays and 1.5 hours on Fridays compared with normal schedules.Government entities are also encouraged to introduce flexible work options, including remote work on Fridays for up to 70% of staff where operationally feasible, without affecting service delivery.In addition to workplace changes, school hours are usually shortened during Ramadan to accommodate fasting students and teachers, with many institutions operating on adjusted timetables.At the same time, routine city services such as public parking, tolls and other community functions also adapt their timings to reflect the daily rhythm of Ramadan life.Under UAE law, the obligation to reduce working hours in Ramadan is grounded in Article 17 of the Labour Law and its executive regulations, which explicitly empower authorities to set specific working hours during Ramadan.For 2026’s Ramadan season, likely starting mid-February, both private and public sector employees in the UAE should expect:These changes offer a practical blend of cultural respect and workplace productivity, helping employees maintain spiritual practices without sacrificing essential functions of daily life in the UAE during the holy month.","Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, during which many Muslims fast from dawn until dusk.

Why Amazon is shutting down Amazon Go and Fresh stores

Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain. The decision of the company to shut down the Amazon Fresh stores will lead to thousands of job cuts across the US. Last week, the e-commerce major announced that it will close around 60 Fresh stores which will put an end to the effort of six-years. As reported by Business Insider, the WARN notices filed in various states confirm the sale of layoffs. As aper the filling, in California only the company will shut down 20 Fresh stores which will affect around 3,900 workers. Most Fresh locations closed to the public on February 1, though California stores will remain open until mid-March due to state law.As Amazon is shutting down the Fresh stores, it has outlined two main options for the affected employees. The company is giving a choice to the employees in which they can either choose the severance pay or can take transfer within the company. The workers will continue to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after the closure announcement, or until April 28. The compensation offered by the company will be based on either the minimum pay for their employee class of their average hours worked over the past 60 days whichever is higher.The report further adds that employees who do not secure another role within the company by late April will then receive severance packages, calculated as one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of four weeks’ pay, with the possibility of up to 20 weeks depending on tenure.For those seeking to remain within Amazon, the company is encouraging Fresh workers to apply for similar positions at Whole Foods Stores or Amazon grocery warehouse via its internal A to Z portal. An Amazon spokesperson said: “All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we’re providing career transition services to help them explore options.”Amazon Fresh associates typically earned between $16 and $20 per hour, according to data from job site Indeed. Their responsibilities ranged from picking delivery orders to handling checkout operations.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model. On the other hand, Whole Food Market acquired in 2017 by Amazon say strong growth with sales rising more than 40% in recent years. Also, Amazon’s online grocery business also witnessed a surge with perishable grocery sales through Same-Day Delivery growing 40x since January 2025, making fresh groceries one of the most-ordered categories on its platform.",Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain.

Despite a significant selloff in software stocks triggered by Anthropic's legal AI tools, they argue AI will enhance, not replace, existing software, enabling greater productivity and innovation.

Nvidia's Huang chimes in with Pichai, calls selloff 'most illogical thing in the world'

What exactly triggered the selloff

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Why the fear runs deeper than one plugin

Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't buying the panic. During the company's earnings call, Pichai pushed back against the market hysteria triggered by Anthropic's new AI plugins, calling it overblown. AI is ""an enabling tool,"" he said, just as it has been for Google 's own products—Search, YouTube and others. Companies ""seizing the moment"" will find the same opportunity ahead, he added.His comments come as software stocks worldwide nurse heavy losses. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins, wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single session. Analysts dubbed it a 'SaaSpocalypse'. Pichai's view? The scramble is overdone.Pichai isn't alone in questioning the market reaction. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was even more direct at a Cisco event, calling the selloff ""the most illogical thing in the world."" His take: AI will use existing software tools, not reinvent them. ""Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?"" he asked. Huang added that Nvidia itself has adopted such tools extensively, freeing up employees to focus on designing chips and computer systems.Software company executives have also pushed back, arguing they do far more than just build code. Their offerings include data management and purpose-built solutions that are difficult to replicate, especially for enterprises outside the tech world like retail and oil and gas.Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its agentic AI assistant for non-technical professionals. Most covered standard enterprise functions—sales, marketing, finance, customer support. But the legal plugin rattled nerves. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings.Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan called it ""a sign of intensifying competition"" that could hurt big players in the legal space. The fallout was swift. Thomson Reuters and RELX both closed down around 15%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. Indian IT stocks weren't spared—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5%, Wipro fell nearly 5%.The concern isn't just about legal workflows. There's a dawning realisation that AI tools can now do far more than most non-techies realise.

Piyush Goyal Says Agriculture Is Self Reliant Sector As India Refuses Farm Import Benefits To US

Steel, energy and technology to drive future imports

India will face no difficulty in purchasing goods worth $500 billion from the United States over the next five years, with Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal calling the number “very conservative” given the scale of demand expected from the country’s expanding economy.Speaking to PTI Videos in an interview on Sunday, Goyal said India’s import demand is projected to touch about $2 trillion over the next five years, creating significant scope to increase sourcing from the US.“We are even today importing 300 billion dollars of goods that can be imported from the US. We are importing from all over the world. That is going to grow up to two trillion in the next five years...I told my counterparts that look, I can assure you that there is demand in India, but you have to be competitive,” he said.India and the US on Saturday announced that they have finalised the framework for the first phase of the bilateral trade agreement. According to a joint statement issued by both sides, India has expressed its intention to purchase $500 billion of US energy products, aircraft and aircraft parts, precious metals, technology products and coking coal over the next five years.Goyal said rising investments by global technology firms in India are expected to significantly increase demand for equipment imports.He said large data centre expansion is likely to drive demand for US-origin technology and equipment.“My sense is that we will see 10 gigawatts of data centres” in India, he said, adding that the US can supply key equipment required for such infrastructure.Responding to a query on whether the $500 billion purchase plan includes existing aircraft orders, including Boeing deals, Goyal said current commitments are part of the overall figure.“Everything that we are talking about is in continuation and includes what we already are purchasing,” he said.He added that India currently imports about $45-50 billion worth of goods from the US, largely in categories where domestic production is limited.“We are going to need aircraft. We are going to need engines for aircraft. We are going to need spare parts. We already have $50 billion worth of orders on Boeing alone for aircraft. We have orders for engines,” he said.The minister said aviation sector demand alone could cross $100 billion over the next five years.“So, almost 80, 90 billion (dollars) is already on order for the next five years. We will actually need more than that. I read the other day that Tata plans to place some more orders. My sense is we need at least a 100 billion dollar plus only for the aviation sector, in addition to oil, LNG, LPG, and crude oil,” he said.Goyal also flagged strong demand for coking coal to support steel sector expansion.India is already importing about 17-18 billion tonnes of coking coal, he said, adding that rising steel production could push import demand sharply higher.“When we reach 300 billion, which is a stated target and expansion is going on at breakneck speed in the steel industry. We'll need 30 billion dollars per year for cooking coal alone. And all of these products I'm mentioning are already being imported since the Congress time, since the UPA was in power. Nothing new,” he said.The minister said rising consumption and industrial demand in the world’s fastest-growing major economy will continue to drive imports of high-end technology and industrial inputs.“There's a growth of demand and consumption of all of these products. In addition, we announced in the budget that we want to promote data centres, we want to promote the AI mission, and we want to promote critical manufacturing and critical minerals processing in India. All of this will require high-quality machinery, ICT products, and Nvidia chips, as well as machinery for AI for quantum computing. Where is all of that going to come from?” he said.Goyal said the US remains the world’s leading provider of advanced technologies.“So, 100 billion (dollars per year) is very conservative. I think it's extremely conservative for a country which wants to become a 30 trillion dollar economy, which India intends to,” he added."," commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal says India's import demand is projected to touch about $2 trillion over the next five years.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-led Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Friday kept the repo rate unchanged at 5.25% in line with expectations from market analysts and economists. The decision to hold the repo rate was driven by resilient GDP growth and benign inflation, amid global headwinds.“After a detailed assessment of the evolving macroeconomic conditions and the outlook, the MPC voted unanimously to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent; consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) remains at 5.00 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 5.50 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the neutral stance,” announced RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra.“The MPC noted that since the last policy meeting, external headwinds have intensified though the successful completion of trade deals augurs well for the economic outlook. Overall, the near-term domestic inflation and growth outlook remain positive,” he added.What does the RBI monetary policy say on India’s GDP growth and inflation outlook? What does the decision to keep repo rate at 5.25% mean for your loan EMIs, fixed deposit and mutual fund investments? We take a look:According to RBI, on the growth front, economic activity remains resilient.The First Advance Estimates suggest continuing growth momentum, driven by domestic factors amidst a challenging external environment. The growth outlook remains favourable.The Indian economy continues on a steadily improving trajectory, with real GDP poised to register significantly higher growth of 7.4% in 2025-26, as compared to the previous year, it said.Real GDP growth projections for Q1:2026-27 and Q2 have been revised upwards to 6.9% and 7.0%, respectively . The risks are evenly balanced.The projections for the full year to the April policy have been deferred by RBI as the new GDP series will be released later in the month.RBI noted that the headline CPI inflation remained low in November and December even as it firmed up by one percentage point in these two months. This increase was largely driven by the lower rate of deflation in the food group. Excluding gold, core inflation remained stable at 2.6 per cent in December.“In terms of the headline inflation trajectory, despite the anticipated momentum being muted, unfavourable base effects stemming from large decline in prices observed during Q4:2024-25 would lead to an uptick in y-o-y inflation in Q4:2025-26. Considering all these factors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at 2.1 per cent with Q4 at 3.2 per cent. CPI inflation for Q1:2026-27 and Q2 are projected at 4.0 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively. Excluding precious metals, the underlying inflation pressures remain muted. The risks are evenly balanced,” RBI governor said.In view of the impending release of the new CPI series (base 2024=100) on February 12, 2026, similar to growth, RBI will now share CPI inflation projection for the full year 2026-27 in the April policy.RBI has cut the repo rate by 1.25% since early 2025. This has led to a similar lowering in loan rates and hence EMIs for borrowers. With the central bank maintaining the status quo on repo rate, EMIs are unlikely to come down further for now.According to Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar, a status-quo decision reinforces the central bank’s preference to monitor inflation trends, liquidity conditions and transmission before initiating the next phase of rate action.“The cumulative easing already delivered has largely flowed through to retail lending, making home loan rates relatively competitive compared to recent years. Even in a pause scenario, affordability conditions remain supportive, aided by steady spreads, lender competition and selective seasonal concessions. Borrowers can continue to optimize savings by retaining higher EMIs to compress loan tenures and reduce total interest costs,” he says.“Balance transfer opportunities and loan restructuring options also remain relevant for those seeking incremental efficiencies. Stable rates, combined with sustained housing demand and improved project execution, create a conducive environment for long-term home buyers, particularly end users focused on financial predictability rather than short-term rate movements,” he adds.When the RBI cuts the repo rate, banks in turn lower the rates for fixed deposits. “A pause in the repo rate sustains the gradual moderation in deposit returns already underway following earlier policy actions. High-yield fixed deposits are becoming increasingly selective, with most mainstream offerings consolidating within a narrower band. While current liquidity conditions continue to support deposit mobilisation, the likelihood of materially higher FD rates emerging remains limited in a steady-rate environment,” Adhil Shetty says.“Investors assessing locking strategies may benefit from spreading allocations across multi-year tenures to preserve returns before further repricing takes place. Senior citizen premiums remain an advantage, though these too are expected to evolve as banks adjust to a stable but lower reference-rate regime,” he said.According to Adhil Shetty, bond market participants may interpret this as supportive of stable-to-gradually-softening yields, creating a constructive environment for medium- to long-duration debt and gilt funds over time.“For mutual fund investors, a stable rate regime allows capital appreciation opportunities in debt portfolios without immediate yield compression, while equity markets benefit from policy continuity and earnings visibility. A balanced asset allocation approach—combining steady SIP flows in equities with calibrated duration exposure in debt—continues to remain an effective strategy for navigating evolving interest rate cycles,” he says.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-led Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Friday kept the repo rate unchanged at 5.25% in line with expectations from market analysts and economists.

Inside the 32-hour operation to contain Mumbai–Pune Expressway gas leak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/32-hour-delay-what-slowed-punemumbai-expressway-tanker-gas-leak-response/articleshow/127952077.cms,"Pune- Mega Cycling Event, Traffic System, Future Skills & More

What needs to be done immediately

A clearly defined, legally binding SOP must be put in place for responding to chemical and gas tanker emergencies

It should spell out roles of oil companies, district administrations, police, fire brigades, and disaster response teams, along with strict response timelines

Petroleum companies, gas refineries, and chemical manufacturers must be mandated to deploy dedicated rescue and recovery vans, equipped to handle compressed gas leaks

These units should be strategically stationed along major highways and industrial corridors to ensure rapid response

Movement of highly hazardous gas tankers should be restricted to designated time windows — preferably during low-traffic hours — to minimise public risk and allow quicker isolation of accident sites if required

Drivers transporting hazardous materials must undergo compulsory training in emergency response

Each tanker should carry a basic emergency kit capable of addressing minor leakages, along with real-time communication systems to alert authorities instantly

State govts need to invest in specialised training for fire services, police, and disaster management personnel to handle hazardous material emergencies

Regular mock drills on highways and near industrial hubs must be institutionalised

Growing risk on highways

The scale of hazardous material movement across the country is staggering

Nearly 1,000 propylene gas tankers travel daily from refineries in Kochi, Visakhapatnam, Chennai, and Jamnagar, supplying industries across India

In addition, around 4,000 ammonia tankers originate from Maharashtra's industrial hubs such as Taloja and Chembur, moving to southern states and other regions

Experts warn that while propylene is highly flammable, an ammonia leak would be far more dangerous, releasing toxic gases that could make containment virtually impossible in densely populated or high-traffic areas

Expert Speak

— Amit Bhargava | Co-founder & CEO of Canada-based EnviroApp (hazmat shipping solutions company)





PUNE: The 32-hour-long operation to neutralise a leaking propylene gas tanker on the Pune–Mumbai expressway threw a harsh spotlight on the lack of preparedness, specialised manpower, and equipment within the state's hazardous materials (hazmat) response system, disaster management experts said.The long-winded series of events began around 5pm on Tuesday evening, when a tanker carrying nearly 21,000kg of highly flammable propylene gas overturned near the Adoshi tunnel.Bhalchandra Chavan, director of the state disaster management department, told TOI, ""We could not operate at the site as we did not have the capabilities and trained personnel to operate in such an environment. We were totally dependent on private agencies that eventually helped us. To tackle such emergencies, we will take the necessary steps and train our personnel.""A senior official from state disaster management added, ""As multiple agencies were on board and since the gas was highly inflammable, we took extra precautions to ensure the safety of commuters and personnel involved in the operation. This took extra time since the operation was in the ghat section and there was huge traffic congestion.So, it hampered the operation and thereby consumed extra time.""Despite the gravity of the situation, specialised response teams did not reach the site for several hours. Officials confirmed that the operation eventually stretched to over 32 hours not because of the complexity alone, but due to delays in mobilising trained hazmat experts and appropriate equipment.Technical intervention was finally led by a private agency, Mec Elec Industrial Services, whose team reached the site only on Wednesday morning. By then, propylene continued to escape the tanker. ""This was not a conventional fuel spill. Propylene is a compressed, highly volatile gas. Any wrong move could have triggered a massive blast,"" said a senior disaster management official, pointing out that most state agencies lacked hands-on experience in such scenarios.ZN Gawade, technical director of Mec Elec Industrial Services (MEIS), Thane, a private agency which played a crucial role in the operation, told TOI that the situation on the ground was extremely volatile and critical.""All three top-mounted ball valves on the tanker were damaged in the rollover and were leaking. Liquid propylene was discharging from every connection, forcing authorities to stop traffic in both directions. Lower Explosive Limit readings were alarmingly high even 500m from the site, underscoring the severe explosion risk,"" he said.Working under life-threatening conditions, the response team managed to arrest two out of three leaks — one liquid and one vapour valve. The third valve, however, posed a formidable challenge. Bent sharply during impact, its handle jammed against the weld cap, making operation impossible while liquid propylene continued to escape, officials said.Gawade reached the site on Wednesday morning, travelling against traffic flow in a police-escorted ambulance. After a detailed technical assessment, the team opted for a high-risk decanting strategy — transferring the tanker's contents through the single operable vapour valve into multiple empty propylene tankers.""The objective was to reduce the liquid level inside the damaged tanker until the leaking valve began releasing vapour instead of liquid, significantly lowering the hazard,"" he said.""By around 4.30pm, specialised transfer hoses were connected and liquid transfer was initiated using pressure differential, with receiving tankers carefully depressurised. The process was repeated thrice, each transfer conducted with extreme caution due to loosened valves and mechanical instability,"" said Madhav Divekar, director of MEIS.Once the leaking valve began venting vapour — indicating the liquid level dropped below roughly 50% — authorities prepared for the next critical phase: lifting the overturned tanker. The operation was carried out with extensive multi-agency support, including the police, NDRF, fire brigade, and other state and local agencies. Four cranes and multiple fire tenders were deployed, and the plan was rehearsed in detail before execution, Divekar said.""As anticipated, the leak briefly intensified when residual liquid contacted the damaged valve via the dip pipe. The response team swiftly arrested the final leak, preventing escalation at a critical moment. At around 1.30am on Thursday, the tanker was escorted through the ghat section under strict safety supervision,"" he said.""Despite still containing a significant quantity of propylene, another delicate operation was undertaken, partially opening the bent liquid valve to decant additional product into a fourth tanker. The tanker was finally transported to the Khalapur tanker testing station, reaching the facility at around 5am. By then, the technical team worked continuously for almost 36 hours, navigating one of the most complex and hazardous compressed-gas response operations witnessed on an Indian highway in recent years,"" Divekar added.India has thousands of hazmat tankers moving daily. Therefore, it is essential to have designated routes for transportation of ‘dangerous goods' across highways to prevent incidents like this","The long-winded series of events began around 5pm on Tuesday evening, when a tanker carrying nearly 21,000kg of highly flammable propylene gas overturned near the Adoshi tunnel.

Metallic blues: Red metal turns too hot to handle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/metallic-blues-red-metal-turns-too-hot-to-handle/articleshow/128098519.cms,"AN INDUSTRY THAT’S CAPITAL-INTENSIVE





Every day, somewhere in India and other countries, cops embark on a hunt for copper thieves – some thefts becoming so rampant that the thefts of copper wires carrying electricity have caused blackouts in the US.But it’s not just law enforcers — even investors are now chasing the red metal, which has quietly joined the price frenzy of gold and silver.This growing rush for copper is tightening supply and worsening shortages in the market. The impact is now being felt most sharply by industries, ranging from engineering units and cable makers to submersible pump manufacturers and brass parts producers in Gujarat, where copper is a crucial raw material.Copper conducts electricity efficiently, and resists corrosion, making it indispensable in electric vehicles and in clean energy era. An electric vehicle uses nearly four times more copper than a petrol or diesel car. Data centres, wind turbines, solar panels, and power transmission networks also consume large quantities of the metal. As demand has outpaced supply, copper prices have surged nearly 48% over thepast year.The London Metal Exchange (LME), the global benchmark, saw copper prices rise from around $8,900 per tonne a year ago to nearly $13,000 per tonne in Jan.“The rising price is not the only problem. Copper prices are highly volatile, which reflects in the final product cost and discourages buyers,” said Jasmat Santoki, promoter of PMC Wires in Rajkot, which manufactures copper strips, rods, pump cables and industrial cables. He added that higher prices require greater working capital investment, and cre- ate challenges in exports while domestic customers delay purchases.In the engineering sector, submersible pumps, especially for agriculture, account for the highest copper consumption. Industry players say they can absorb price increases temporarily, but frequent fluctuations disrupt business operations. Copper constitutes nearly 30% of the raw material used in these pumps, which are widely used by farmers as well as real estate developers.“The skyrocketing copper price has raised our production costs significantly. Customers are unwilling to accept higher prices, which directly are affecting profit margins,” said Kamal Sojitra, executive director of Falcon Pumps, Rajkot.Another major consumer is the brass parts industry centred in Jamnagar, which has over 8,000 units. Brass parts use about 60% copper and 40% zinc. Jamnagar produces around 3,500 tonnes of brass parts annually, but demand has dropped sharply due tohigh raw material costs, a weak rupee against the dollar, and a slowdown in European markets.Copper mining is among the most capital-intensive and time-consuming industries. From discovery to first production, the process can take up to 20 years and requires massive investment. Companies spend billions on surveys, approvals, land acquisition, drilling, and infrastructure. Global copper reserves are concentrated in countries such as Chile, Peru, Congo, China, and the US.As ore grades decline and mining goes deeper, waste rock increases significantly. After extraction, ore is processed using waterintensive flotation to produce copper concentrate, which is then sent to smelters for refining.With gold and silver prices climbing sharply, retail investors in Ahmedabad are turning to copper bars in growing numbers, betting the industrial metal could witness a similar bull run.Some jewellers and bullion traders have begun offering copper bars to walk-in customers who find silver prices too high and are reluctant to invest in silver amid volatile market conditions. However, the trade comes with a caveat: most sellers are not offering buyback, leaving investors uncertain about exit options.According to market sources, several jewellers and bullion traders have been selling copper bars for about a month. However, resale for customers could become a major challenge because copper is primarily an industrial commodity and there is no established mechanism of selling copper back to jewellers,” he said.Unlike gold and silver, which attract 3% GST, copper is taxed at 18%, raising the effective acquisition cost for retail buyers. Traders said the higher tax rate, combined with the lack of a buyback channel, makes copper bullion a very different proposition from precious metals despite the recent surge in interest.Nishant Dholakia, a city-based jeweller, said copper bars are being sold in both bullion-grade and commercial-grade categories, typically priced between Rs 1,600 and Rs 2,000 per kg depending on grade and taxes. He said enquiries have risen sharply, with around 600kg sold in the last 20 days at his shop alone.“Retail customers are buying with an investment motive, and the average purchase per buyer is around 20kg,” Dholakia said, adding that supply is being sourced from Mumbai, with some local availability as well.He said jewellers are clearly communicating the lack of liquidity. “We clearly say that we will not take this back for at least two years,” he said, even as he expects industrial demand and investor buying to tighten supply and eventually scrap traders to offer better rates. “Scrap traders are currently offering buyback at Rs 1,300 for a kilogram but investors who have bought at higher prices for the long-term will not sell at a l o w price,” he added.The inquiries for 1kg copper bars are high, with customers viewing it as an investment opportunity in place of silver. Investments are ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 20,000.","Copper conducts electricity efficiently, and resists corrosion.

SBI shares today: State Bank of India’s shares soared to record high on Monday, after the lender turned in its strongest quarterly profit on record for the October–December period of FY26. The stock climbed up to 6.7% to hit Rs 1,137 on the BSE. Last week, SBI reported standalone net profit of Rs 21,028 crore for Q3FY26, up 24% as compared to a year ago. The robust figures came on the back of loan growth and stable margins.At 11:54 am, the SBI stock was trading at 1137.80, up 71 points or 6.7% on the BSE.Income from core lending activity stayed firm. Net Interest Income rose 9% year-on-year to Rs 45,190 crore. Operating profit, calculated before provisions and contingencies, advanced 40% from the same period last year to Rs 32,862 crore, reflecting improved leverage in the business.Brokerages tracking the lender largely maintained positive recommendations, with many highlighting growth in loans, steady profitability and comfort on asset quality.maintained a ‘Buy’ view and lifted its target price to Rs 1,300, implying a 22% upside from current levels. The brokerage highlighted broad-based strength in performance, helped by business growth, expansion in margins and stable asset quality, as reported by ET.also kept a ‘Buy’ rating, with a target of Rs 1,235. It pointed to resilient margins, rising 2 basis points sequentially and comparing well with peers. Loan growth of 16% year-on-year was seen ahead of competitors even with the bank’s sizeable base, and core profitability metrics continued to exceed those of peers.also reiterated its ‘Buy’ recommendation and set a target price of Rs 1,250.

What Fragrances Will Define Ramadan 2026 for Women? Exploring Arabic Perfume Trends

Why Arabic perfume culture is resonating with women ahead of Ramadan 2026







As the holy month of Ramadan gears up to unfold across the Middle East and beyond, women’s fragrance choices are becoming a meaningful expression of personal style, cultural resonance and sensory storytelling. Arabic perfumes, long celebrated for their rich, evocative compositions, are trending this season not just as gifts or evening scents but as symbolic extensions of the Ramadan experience: warm, comforting and deeply memorable.In 2026, the narrative around women’s fragrances reflects broader industry shifts toward textural sophistication and emotional connection. Global perfumery trends emphasise personalisation, immersive scent experiences and nuanced reinterpretations of classic notes, all of which align beautifully with the rich palette of Arabic perfumery.One of the defining movements in the Ramadan perfume landscape this year is the resurgence of floral-oriental compositions. These perfumes blend soft blossoms like jasmine and rose with deeper bases such as amber and musk, resulting in scents that feel both romantic and sophisticated. For many women, these fragrances strike the perfect balance between everyday elegance and evening allure, suitable for mosque visits, iftar gatherings or Eid celebrations.Floral-oriental profiles are evolving in 2026 to feel more refined and textured. Industry voices note that florals are being paired with unexpected elements of earthier woods, nuanced resins or gourmand undertones, giving traditional blooms a modern and personal expression.As the sun sets and social rhythms begin, many women are drawn toward warm spice and amber compositions. These fragrances open with rich, comforting top notes, often complemented by subtle hints of spice, before settling into amber-clad bases that envelop the wearer in warmth. These profiles are especially beloved for evening wear, when gatherings with loved ones call for something both bold and memorable.In a broader context, amber and spice-driven perfumes resonate with a growing preference for scents that feel like a sensory hug: enveloping, rich and long-lasting. This mirrors global trends where gourmands and amber accords are gaining traction for their comforting, tactile qualities.Another strong current in the Ramadan fragrance story for women is the rise of softly sweet and powdery scents. These are lighter, more approachable compositions featuring gentle sweetness or subtle vanilla-like nuances layered with musky or floral undertones.They are excellent for daytime moments of quiet reflection, casual outings or workplaces where subtlety and elegance are valued over bold projection. This trend toward nuanced sweetness also reflects a shift in the industry where refined gourmand notes feel less dessert-sweet and more textured, mature and wearable.More women are also embracing the idea of scent layering by combining multiple fragrances or formats (like concentrated oils, sprays or body mists) to create something uniquely personal. This approach echoes a broader 2026 trend toward “scent wardrobes” or narrative fragrance experiences, where a perfume isn’t just a single choice but part of a richer sensory identity.Layering allows for playful contrasts like a soft floral with a warm amber base or a light citrus top with a spice-accented dry-down, offering versatility throughout the varied moments of Ramadan and Eid.Arabic perfumes for women this Ramadan are not just trending because of their notes; they are resonating because they bridge tradition and contemporary expression. Their richness and depth reflect cultural heritage, while their evolving compositions align with global fragrance innovations, from gumptious amber blends to nuanced floral artistry.Whether worn for spiritual reflection, family gatherings or festive evenings, these fragrances are helping redefine how scent plays into holiday rituals, turning each application into a small celebration of identity, memory and beauty.","Ramadan 2026 Fragrance Trends: Arabic Perfumes for Women, Floral-Oriental and Amber Scents.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Zakat Al Fitr and Fidyah rates for Ramadan 2026



Kaffarah amounts for missed fasts and broken vows



How the values were calculated



Payment timing, cash permissibility and authorised channels







As preparations for Ramadan 2026 gather pace, the UAE Council for Islamic Affairs has formally announced the official rates and cash values for Zakat Al Fitr, Fidyah, Kaffarah, and iftar meals for the holy month, corresponding to 1447 Hijri. The figures aim to ensure clarity, fairness, and uniformity for donors and beneficiaries across the country.The council confirmed that Zakat Al Fitr is fixed at 2.5 kilograms of rice per person, or a cash equivalent of Dh25. This obligation applies to every eligible Muslim and is intended to support the needy ahead of Eid celebrations.For individuals unable to fast, Fidyah has been set at 3.25 kilograms of wheat or barley per beneficiary per day, or Dh20 in cash. The same Dh20 per person rate applies to Fidyah feeding cases.Fidyah for prohibited acts during Hajj or Umrah has been determined at Dh120 to be distributed among six beneficiaries. The council also confirmed that the minimum value of an iftar meal for a fasting individual during Ramadan is Dh20 per meal.Kaffarah for invalidating a fast during Ramadan or breaking a vow has been fixed at Dh1,200 per day, with the amount distributed to 60 needy beneficiaries at Dh20 each.For broken oaths, Kaffarah has been set at Dh200, to be shared among 10 beneficiaries.These figures are intended to provide a clear framework for those seeking to fulfil religious obligations correctly and consistently.The council said the decisions were based on a detailed field study carried out in coordination with the Ministry of Economy and Tourism. The study included market inspections, consultations with suppliers, and price surveys of staple food items across all Emirates.According to the authority, standardising these amounts improves efficiency, transparency, and fairness in charitable work, while also ensuring smoother collection and distribution for both individuals and institutions.The council recommended that Zakat Al Fitr be paid after the Fajr prayer on Eid day and before sunset, as this best serves those in need during the festivities. Early payment is permitted when necessary, particularly to avoid crowding at charitable organisations. Payments made after sunset are considered Qada, or make-up payments, rather than standard fulfilment. Unjustified delays are discouraged.Cash payment of Zakat Al Fitr has been deemed permissible, based on historical precedent. The council noted that the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, approved monetary substitutes for staple foods, and that early Muslims were known to give cash alongside food. In modern circumstances, cash contributions often better meet beneficiaries’ needs.Faithful were urged to channel Zakat, Fidyah, and Kaffarah through authorised bodies, including the Zakat Fund under the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments, the Emirates Red Crescent, and other certified charitable centres and associations across the UAE.The announcement concluded with prayers for a blessed Ramadan, continued prosperity for the UAE, and acceptance of the faithful’s charitable contributions.","Zakat Al Fitr fixed at 2.5 kilograms of rice per person, or a cash equivalent of Dh25.
