NEW DELHI: Vistara, the Tata Group-Singapore Airlines joint venture, will complete its final flight on Monday, marking the end of its independent brand identity as it merges with Air India.Starting November 12, Vistara flights will officially operate under the Air India banner. The milestone has sparked an emotional response on social media, as netizens share memories and reflections on their last flights with Vistara.On X, Parth Suba expressed his gratitude for the airline’s legacy, posting, “Farewell to Vistara ❤️‍🩹 India’s finest domestic airline, as it takes its final flight today. Since 2015, Vistara has set new standards for service and comfort in Indian🇮🇳 skies. Thank you, Vistara, for making every journey memorable! 💜 Let us fly high to new horizons with Air India.""Another user, Chirag Naik, shared his nostalgic sentiment: “Wrapped up my last flight on @airvistara before its merger with @airindia. Filled with nostalgia for the great flights and excellent service that made Vistara India’s best airline. Wishing them all the best for this new chapter!”Many users reminisced about the airline’s elevated service and unique travel experience. Anubhav Goel remarked, “Grateful to have experienced @airvistara on its final day of operations—a brand that truly delivered on its promise of ‘a new feeling’ in travel. Vistara is one of the few brands where the brand promise matched delivery so seamlessly. Their attention to detail proved that business is more than cost-cutting & short-term revenue.”Meanwhile, another user, Adarsh Ilango, shared a snapshot of his final journey with Vistara, reflecting, “As we bid goodbye to @airvistara, a sneak peek of my flight with UK in July this year. An airline with true class and luxury.

Starting Monday, Vistara flights will be listed under a new four-digit Air India code beginning with ""2"" (e.g., UK 955 becomes AI 2955). Though routes, schedules, and services will remain the same, passengers will now experience Vistara’s in-flight offerings as part of the Air India experience.To facilitate the integration, Air India has stationed help desks at major airports, staffed by team members wearing “How may I assist you?” branded T-shirts, and updated check-in signage at international terminals. Vistara’s ticketing offices and check-in terminals will gradually transition, guiding passengers to select Air India’s new AI2 code. Air India has already migrated over 270,000 Vistara passengers and more than 4.5 million loyalty members into its system.With this integration, Air India’s network will expand to 90+ destinations, leveraging both its fleet and Vistara’s extensive domestic routes, supported by enhanced interline and codeshare agreements for global reach.","Vistara, the Tata Group-Singapore Airlines joint venture, will complete its final flight on Monday.

Waqf Bill JPC’s study tours put off amid oppn decision to boycott trips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-bill-jpcs-study-tours-put-off-amid-oppn-decision-to-boycott-trips/articleshow/115192453.cms,"JPC chairperson and BJP MP Jagdambika Pal

NEW DELHI: With opposition MPs “boycotting” the scheduled study tour of members of the joint parliamentary committee on the Waqf Bill , the LS Secretariat has postponed the trips to Kolkata, Patna and Lucknow from Nov 12 to Nov 14, with a notification being issued on Monday.The secretariat decided to defer the meetings at the three cities after those at Guwahati and Bhubaneswar were washed out as just five (all from BJP) of the 31 members of the panel attended them — the meetings had failed to garner the required quorum.The panel’s opposition members had earlier met LS Speaker Om Birla and requested him to postpone the tours planned between Nov 9 and Nov 14 as MPs were visiting their constituencies.On Saturday, some opposition MPs had written to Birla, expressing dismay that despite their meeting with him over the panel’s functioning , JPC chairperson and BJP MP Jagdambika Pal had gone ahead with the state tours according to the schedule that he had set.After the tours were postponed, TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee on Monday said, “We had requested for deferment of the tours, as we were caught up with elections in many of states. Also, most often, JPC meetings in Delhi have few members from the governing side attending, hence with opposition members staying away, we had warned of lack of quorum at the meetings. However, finally good sense seems to have prevailed, and it is welcome.”In their letter to the speaker, the members had said, “To our utter surprise, we found that the tour commencing from Nov 9 has not been deferred. In such view of the matter, we thought it prudent to boycott the said tour.”The members announced their decision at a press conference in Kolkata, which was held by Banerjee. In their letter to Birla, they had said they would make their decision public. Banerjee, DMK's A Raja and Congress's Mohammad Jawed were among those who wrote to the speaker.Following claims by the opposition MPs that tour meetings being led by Pal lacked quorum, JPC chairman Jagdambika Pal on Sunday refuted the charge saying “study tours” of parliamentary panels are an informal exercise and are not bound by formalities like meeting the quorum.","The LS Secretariat has postponed the trips to Kolkata, Patna and Lucknow from Nov 12 to Nov 14.

DEHRADUN: Untreated effluent discharged from a sewage treatment plant (STP) is polluting Ganga near its source, a report submitted to National Green Tribunal (NGT) has revealed. The report, based on findings from Uttarakhand government, was presented during a tribunal hearing on pollution control in Ganga in Uttarakhand.The NGT, which had requested a report from the state and related authorities, passed an order on Nov 5 and has scheduled the matter for further discussion on Feb 13 next year.The original application, filed by environmentalist M C Mehta, focuses on preventing and controlling pollution in Ganga and its tributaries. The NGT is addressing the pollution in each state through which Ganga flows.A bench comprising NGT chairperson Justice Prakash Shrivastava, Justice Sudhir Agarwal, and expert member A Senthil Vel noted the submission from an advocate representing one of the intervening applicants, saying, “She (the advocate) has submitted that even the originating point of the pious river Ganga is polluted by the STP discharge .”According to this submission, sewage samples from the 1 million litres per day (MLD) capacity STP at Gangotri contained faecal coliform (FC) bacteria with a most probable number (MPN) of 540/100 ml. FC levels reflect contamination from human and animal waste. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) standards state that water with an MPN below 500/100 ml is suitable for organised outdoor bathing.The tribunal directed Uttarakhand’s chief secretary to review the situation and ensure compliance by submitting a detailed status report.","Untreated effluent discharged from a sewage treatment plant is polluting Ganga near its source.

NEW DELHI: India is set to receive the first of its two guided-missile warships being built in Russia by the end of this month, following a long delay due to ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. However, the delivery of 2 remaining squadrons of S-400 Triumf air defense missile systems is likely to be delayed until 2026, and lease of a nuclear-powered attack submarine until 2028.The multi-role frigate, with a displacement of almost 4,000-tonne, will be handed over to the Indian crew of over 200 officers and sailors stationed at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad for the last few months, defence sources told TOI.The warship will then be commissioned as INS Tushil by defence minister Rajnath Singh, who is slated to visit the country early-Dec for India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) meet.“The second frigate, Tamal, will be handed over early next year. Both the stealth frigates will be packed with weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, and sensors to undertake a variety of missions,” a source said. India in Oct 2018 had inked an umbrella agreement for procurement of four Grigorovich-class frigates , with the first two to be imported from Russia for around Rs 8,000 crore.The other two are being built at Goa Shipyard (GSL) with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore, with the first being “launched” as Triput in July this year. These four warships will add to the six such Russian frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted in the Navy from 2003-04 onwards.Delivery of fourth and fifth squadrons of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in 2018, in turn, will take place only by 2026. “India has asked Russia for faster delivery. But it looks difficult because Russia’s entire defence-industrial production is geared towards Ukraine war,” another source said.IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, missiles and drones at a range of 380-km, in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan, as reported by TOI earlier.On underwater front, India in the past has operated two nuclear-powered attack submarines armed with conventional weapons (called SSNs), INS Chakra-1 and INS Chakra-2, after leasing them from Russia. Then, in March 2019, India inked an over $3 billion (Rs 21,000 crore) deal with Russia to lease a more advanced SSN for 10 years, but its delivery has also been delayed beyond 2027. “Russia has been asked to deliver the SSN earlier, but it is doubtful before 2028,” the source said.The PM-led cabinet committee on security on Oct 9, incidentally, cleared the indigenous project to build two SSNs at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore, but it will take at least a decade for them to roll out.India had of course commissioned its second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBNs) as INS Arighaat in August and plans to induct the third as INS Aridhaman early next year, in a major boost for strategic deterrence.","The multi-role frigate, with a displacement of almost 4,000-tonne, will be handed over to the Indian crew of over 200 officers and sailors stationed at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad.

All-year firecracker ban? Supreme Court asks Delhi to decide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-year-firecracker-ban-supreme-court-asks-delhi-to-decide/articleshow/115195407.cms,"Supreme Court

Police could’ve been more proactive in enforcing firecracker ban: SC

NEW DELHI: Observing that it is the fundamental right of every citizen to live in a pollution-free environment and that no religion promotes activities which cause pollution, Supreme Court Monday directed Delhi govt to decide by Nov 25 on a perpetual ban on selling and bursting of all kinds of firecrackers throughout the year in the national capital and not just on Diwali.It also sought a response from NCR states — Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab — on banning firecrackers in their territories as a measure to deal with the pollution crisis.Though the AAP govt sought time till Jan to take a decision after holding consultations with all stakeholders, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and A G Masih said the govt had to take a decision fast and set a deadline of Nov 25.It also directed the Delhi police commissioner to form a special squad of officers to enforce the ban, both in the open market and on online portals. “The right to live in a pollution-free atmosphere is a fundamental right of every citizen which is protected by Article 21 of the Constitution. We are prima facie of the view that no religion encourages any activity which creates pollution. If firecrackers are burnt in this fashion, it also affects the fundamental right to health of citizens. We direct Delhi govt to take a decision on or before Nov 25,” the bench said.As Delhi govt and Delhi Police blamed each other for incessant bursting of firecrackers on Diwali night, the bench said action taken by both of them was mere eyewash. Responding to the apex court’s query on non-compliance of its ban on firecrackers, Delhi govt said it had passed an order on Oct 14 banning sale and bursting of all kinds of firecrackers and expressed helplessness in enforcing the order as it was the duty of Delhi Police.Delhi Police, however, blamed the govt for passing the ban order too late when the festive season had already begun. Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati told the bench it was difficult to enforce the order as the ban was imposed just a fortnight before Diwali and by that time, the market was flooded with firecrackers. “Until Oct 14, we did not have control over it. We can enforce ban only after the decision was taken,” she told the courtAgreeing with Bhati’s submission that the ban was imposed too late, the court, however, said police could have been more proactive and should have informed all licence holders to forthwith stop the sale of firecrackers. It directed the police commissioner to form a separate squad to stop selling of firecrackers in the open market or on online portals and asked him to file a personal affidavit on compliance of its order.“We direct the commissioner of police to immediately take action of informing all concerned about the said ban to ensure that during the subsistence of the ban, no licence holder manufacturers, stores or sells firecrackers. Delhi Police must immediately inform those entities that sell firecrackers online to stop sale and delivery of firecrackers within the limits of National Capital Territory of Delhi. We direct the commissioner of police to set up a special cell for implementation of the order of ban and to hold SHOs of all local police stations responsible for enforcing the ban through the year,” the court said.The SC had put a blanket ban on selling of firecrackers in the NCR in Nov 2016 and directed the Centre to suspend all licences allowing sale of fireworks. Later, it extended the ban across the country and allowed only green crackers. As its ban order was not effective, SC had in 2021 directed that top bureaucrats, including the chief secretary and the police commissioner of the area concerned, and other officials would be held personally liable for violation of its order.Noting that its various directions was not being implemented, the court had last year said responsibility had to be fixed and suggested that the police commissioner be held responsible for any violation.",Police could’ve been more proactive in enforcing firecracker ban: SC.

Need to tackle backlog, make litigation affordable: CJI

NEW DELHI: President Droupadi Murmu on Monday administered oath of office to Justice Sanjiv Khanna as Chief Justice of India in a brief ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan in the presence of PM Modi and his Cabinet colleagues, SC and Delhi HC judges and former CJIs.In the three-minute ceremony, Justice Khanna took oath as the 51st CJI in the name of God “to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India”, “to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India” and “perform the duties of office without fear or favour, affection or ill will”.After the oath, he greeted the PM and other dignitaries with a ‘namaste’ from a distance without the customary shaking of hands. Home minister Amit Shah was conspicuous by his absence at the ceremony, which was attended by Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar and Andhra Pradesh governor Abdul Nazeer, a former SC judge, and the top law officers. Justice Khanna will have a tenure of six months and two days as CJI and will retire on May 13 next year.CJI Sanjiv Khanna identified the challenge areas as need to tackle case backlog, make litigation affordable and accessible, and need to simplify complex legal procedures.Promising to focus on reforms in criminal case management, he said his priority would be to reduce trial durations through adoption of a systematic approach, and positioning the justice delivery mechanism to ensure that process of law was not gruelling for citizens.There is a natural penchant for tax laws in the family of CJI Khanna, who has penned many landmark judgments on tax matters. His father, Justice DR Khanna, was a judicial officer who later became a member of appellate tribunals in both sales tax and income tax before becoming a judge of Delhi HC in Oct 1979.His father was 11 years junior to brother Justice HR Khanna, who became an HC judge in 1962 and resigned as SC judge in March 1977 when he was superseded to the CJI’s post with his junior, Justice MH Beg, by the Indira Gandhi govt in Jan 1977 over his judgments upholding the rights of citizens against draconian powers by the state during the Emergency.Justice DR Khanna retired from high court in 1985, two years after Sanjiv Khanna started practising tax and civil laws under a busy octogenarian lawyer FC Bedi in Tis Hazari courts.Justice Sanjiv Khanna had told TOI that he would not shift into the official bungalow of the CJI at 5, Krishna Menon Marg as he had a short tenure. Justice BR Gavai, who will succeed Justice Khanna as Chief Justice of India on May 14 next year, is also of the view that he would not shift to the CJI’s official bungalow as his tenure as CJI — from May 14 to Nov 23 — is also as short as Justice Khanna’s.Justice Khanna intends to focus on reducing pendency in the SC, which has around 66,000 live petitions, three-fourths of which are more than a year-old and 16,000 unregistered cases.

15 lakh people died in accidents on Indian roads in 10 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/15-lakh-people-died-in-accidents-on-indian-roads-in-10-years/articleshow/115193431.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: In the past decade (2014-23), around 15.3 lakh people have been killed in road crashes — that’s more than the population of the Union Territory of Chandigarh and nearly equivalent to that of Bhubaneswar — despite the Central govt making repeated global commitments to reduce road fatalities and the Supreme Court’s interventions to curb such deaths.The Union road transport ministry’s data shows that the road death rate in the country is around 250 per 10,000 km. In the US, China and Australia, the corresponding figures are 57, 119 and 11, respectively.In the preceding decade (2004-13), 12.1 lakh lives were lost in road crashes, as per data collated by road transport ministry. While the increase in fatalities in the past decade must be seen against the backdrop of quantum jump in population, road length and number of vehicles, experts say not much effort has been put into curbing this massive loss of lives.Government data show that the number of registered vehicles has more than doubled from 15.9 crore in 2012 to around 38.3 crore in 2024 and the road length has gone up from 48.6 lakh km in 2012 to 63.3 lakh km in 2019 as per the latest published data.Experts said that increase in road length and vehicles can’t be the reason for more people dying every year. They added that while it is well known and often highlighted that road safety is a multi-sectoral issue requiring greater cooperation among govt departments, stakeholders, and non-profit entities, not much has been made in this direction, with agencies concerned continuing to work in silos.Former top cops also told TOI that while explanations are called from officers for a single unsolved murder, such an action is unheard of in case of fatal road crashes. “Top officers hardly seek explanation from juniors even if there are a dozen road deaths or enquire about the outcome of investigations. Road crashes are not a priority for all agencies,” said a former Delhi Police officer.T Krishna Prasad, a former IPS officer, chairman of Road Safety Authority in Telangana and now a sitting MP, said while importance is given to murders, road crashes and deaths don’t get due attention.The lawmaker, who plans to move a private member bill on road safety, said the number of people killed in road crashes in a year is much more than any natural disaster India has seen.","In the past decade (2014-23), around 15.3 lakh people have been killed in road crashes.

NEW DELHI: Concerned over dependence on private coaching which often creates barriers for students from low-income backgrounds as well as creating an unequal field for aspirants from underserved regions, Centre is setting an ambitious target of assisting 12.5 lakh competitive exam candidates by 2029.The ministry of education will take up this key agenda with states during a two-day consultation on implementation of National Education Policy, 2020, from Tuesday, where MoE officials will deliberate with their state/ UT counterparts along with issues like accreditation and digital learning, among others.According to ministry officials, Centre is preparing to discuss measures to reduce “reliance on private coaching and extend support for students’ competitive exam preparation.” According to the agenda accessed by TOI, “SATHEE – reducing coaching dependency” focuses on free digital resources for competitive exam preparation , AI-based learning tools , collaboration with IITs and AIIMS for high-quality content, resources on DTH platforms and efforts to democratise “access to competitive exam preparation.”According to a govt official, “Through this programme, the govt hopes to create a level playing field by offering structured support, particularly for those in underserved regions”.One of NE’s primary objectives is the widespread accreditation of higher education institutions . By 2029, the govt aims to achieve a 90% accreditation rate, with a goal of positioning at least 10 Indian HEIs among the world’s top 200. The meeting agenda also covers strategies to expand digital learning, with the govt targeting two core new enrolments over the next five years through SWAYAM courses.","The ministry of education will take up this key agenda with states during a two- day consultation on implementation of National Education Policy, 2020, from Tuesday.

Bengaluru Apartment Dwellers Raise Concerns Over E-Khata Ownership Issues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-apartment-dwellers-raise-concerns-over-e-khata-ownership-issues/articleshow/115150752.cms,"Bengaluru: With Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) rolling out e-khata for properties, various flat owners' associations have raised concerns over what they say are ""ambiguities in its legal and procedural framework"" when it comes to apartment complexes.E-khatas are geotagged but stacked flats share the same coordinates, making it challenging to verify individual compliance with building plans. They further said the current khata system has created dual ownership records, complicating land rights for apartment owners.""The BBMP's initiative to issue e-khatas to independent properties is a good idea. E-khatas are identified by geotagging, which identifies properties by latitude and longitude, which will be the same for flats which are one above the other in an apartment building. This khata will not clearly identify the property and will not clarify whether the building was constructed in violation of the building plan or on a valid sanction plan,"" Srinivasa Talla, representing Bangalore City Flat Owners' Welfare Association, told TOI.With BBMP sending messages to property owners to get their e-khatas, flat owners are restive. The associations point out that properties must be classified as buildings, vacant land, or both, to be subject to property tax under Section 142(1)(a) of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations (KMC) Act. Paying property taxes is the responsibility of property owners, but flat owners hold an undivided share of the land, which remains in the landowner's name. Without land being divided, BBMP or other local bodies lack authority to issue sub-khatas, as partitioning is not permitted under the apartment ownership scheme, they argue.""Even after khatas for flats are being created in their owners' names, the land khata is still held by the landowners/promoters in the revenue records. With both flat owners and landowners being reflected as owners, there is dual ownership. BBMP has not found the solution for the land khata bifurcation process or notified the public about it. What property owners demand is a proper khata that protects the land rights of flat owners. Why should property owners pay property tax for property they don't own in BBMP records?"" asked Dhananjaya Padmanabhachar, sanchalak of Karnataka Home Buyers Forum.E-khatas available to flats: BBMPThe civic body, meanwhile, says e-khata is available for all property types, including apartments, through an online application process.""Residents of apartments can obtain an e-khata just like any other property owner. The process is accessible online, where they can directly apply through the official website. For those who already have a physical khata, it is digitised. If you already have a physical khata as an apartment, then you can immediately get e-khata. But if it's a new apartment complex where khatas haven't yet been issued manually, then new ones will be issued in the next 10-15 days,"" said Munish Moudgil, special commissioner (finance), BBMP.","E-khatas are geotagged but stacked flats share the same coordinates, making it challenging to verify individual compliance with building plans.

Couple Arrested After Social Media Post Exposes Balcony Ganja Growing Operation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/couple-arrested-after-social-media-post-exposes-balcony-ganja-growing-operation/articleshow/115123653.cms,"The saplings weighing 54 grams were seized

BENGALURU: A couple from the bustling central business district area of Sadashivnagar found themselves in trouble after an unexpected twist to their green thumb hobby: They took to social media to share a clip of their potted plants, unknowingly catching the attention of netizens who identified a pot in which ganja saplings were growing!Alerted by the online chatter about ganja being grown in the home garden, police swung into action and arrested the couple — 37-year-old Sagar Gurung and his wife Urmila Kumari. Hailing from Namchi in Sikkim, they moved to the city two years back, residing at MSR Nagar in Sadashivanagar. While Sagar is into an eatery business, his wife is a homemaker.Urmila, whose pastime is to watch videos and view photos online, recently chose to become active on social media. Apart from posting her own photos and putting out her thoughts, she started making videos. One such video she posted on Oct 18 was an introduction to the nearly two dozen plants being grown at her residence. However, in this leafy lineup were two ganja saplings, which netizens flagged.The police FIR read: ""After getting the basic information, we raided the couple's home on Nov 5 afternoon. Initially, they did not respond to our questions on the ganja saplings. We inspected and found signs of plants uprooted from two pots. On further questioning, the couple confessed to growing ganja in them and showed us the dustbin where they had thrown them. The saplings weighed 54 grams, and we seized them.""Police suspect that the couple spotted cops at their doorstep and hastily removed the saplings and tossed them into the dustbin in a bid to destroy evidence. They believe the couple grew ganja for commercial gains.Alongside the saplings, police seized Kumari's phone, which she had used to upload the now-infamous video. They now face charges under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act for allegedly intending to cultivate ganja for sale.","Sagar Gurung and his wife Urmila Kumari were arrested for growing ganja in their home garden.

(PTI Photo)

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Sunday said that India is not among the countries who are ""nervous"" as Donald Trump is set to return to White House after defeating Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections.""I know today a lot of countries are nervous about the US. Let's be honest about it. We are not one of them,"" Jaishankar said while speaking at the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of the Aditya Birla Group Scholarships Programme in Mumbai.In response to a question on the reset in the global power dynamic that was playing out amid the shift in the balance of power from the West to the East, Jaishankar remarked, ""Yes, there is a shift. We are ourselves an example of the shift. If you look at our economic weight, you look at our economic ranking, you look at even Indian corporates, their reach, their presence, Indian professionals, which I spoke about. So no question there is a rebalancing.""He explained that this change was expected, saying, ""And to my mind, it was inevitable because once these countries after the colonial period got their independence, they started making their own policy choices, then they were bound to grow.""Nevertheless, Jaishankar pointed out that western industrialised nations maintain significant influence globally. ""But do remember one thing, the older, the western economies, the older industrialised economies, they have not gone away. They still count, they are still prime investment targets. They are big markets, strong technology centres, hubs for innovation. So let's recognise the shift, but let's not get carried away and kind of overstate it and distort our own understanding of the world,"" the minister said.When asked about the impact of the recent US presidential election on Indo-US relations, Jaishankar highlighted PM Modi's consistent ability to establish strong connections with US Presidents, from Barack Obama through Donald Trump to Joe Biden. ""The Prime Minister was among the first three calls I think that President Trump took. Prime Minister Modi has actually built rapport across multiple presidents. When he first visited DC, Obama was the president, then it was Trump, then it was Biden. So, you know, for him (PM Modi), there's something natural in terms of how he forges those relationships. So, that's helped hugely,"" Jaishankar said in his response.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's victory on November 5 against vice president Kamala Harris secured his return to the White House. PM Modi's subsequent telephone conversation with ""friend Donald Trump"" on November 6 included congratulations for both his presidential win and the Republican Party's Congressional success.The Prime Minister acknowledged the strong trust Americans placed in Trump's leadership and vision. He recalled significant events like the Howdy Modi event in Houston in September 2019 and the Namaste Trump event in Ahmedabad in February 2020.""Heartiest congratulations my friend Donald Trump on your historic election victory. As you build on the successes of your previous term, I look forward to renewing our collaboration to further strengthen the India-US Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership. Together, let's work for the betterment of our people and promote global peace, stability and prosperity,"" PM Modi shared on X."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar said that India is not among the countries who are ""nervous"" as Donald Trump is set to return to White House.

Excerpts from the interview:



How would you describe your eight-and-a-half years in SC as a judge, especially the last two years as CJI?

Is Indian democracy in danger? There have been attempts to create a phobia about democracy being in danger in India. Your take on the role of the judiciary on this issue.

Is hate speech a cause for concern? What should India do to curb it?

Reservations for SCs and STs were to last for 10 years. But backwardness appears to be an incurable defect in Indian society with political parties vying with each other for an increase in quota beyond the 50% limit set by the SC in 1992 in the Indra Sawhney case. Should reservations be eternal?

Over the past decade, a degree of transparency has been infused into selection of persons by the SC collegium for appointment as constitutional court judges. Would it have been better if the SC had allowed the NJAC model to operate for a few years, maybe with appropriate tweaking?

Should India follow the US mechanism for selection of judges to the SC? Should the retirement age of HC and SC judges be raised?

After implementation of the Second National Judicial Pay Commission, the salaries of trial court judges have increased substantially. Should the salaries of HC and SC judges, who are paid a pittance compared to their income as advocates, be increased to give them a fair compensation for their tedious work and to attract more talent?

As CJI, the bench you headed gave many landmark judgments involving sensitive social, economic and governance issues. Were you ever approached by the executive seeking a favourable order?

Have PILs, an instrument created on the lines of class action suits to address problems faced by vulnerable sections of society, the marginalised and poor, been hijacked by a few? Has it become an industry in itself?

NEW DELHI: Marking out hate speech as a cause for concern, Justice D Y Chandrachud said its impact was multi-fold with the rise of social media.“Hurtful comments have far-reaching consequences on the psyche and emotional well-being of people,” he said while warning that curbs on hate speech must not have the effect of “chilling free speech”.Looking back at his eight-and-a-half years in the Supreme Court as a judge, the last two years as CJI, Justice Chandrachud told TOI in an exclusive interview he believed he had “left the system better than I found it”, pointing to his verdicts on disability rights, right to information, and economic federalism, besides the equal opportunity doctrine in the context of sex and caste discrimination.Asked if reservations should continue for perpetuity, the outgoing CJI said it could not be denied that quota as a means of affirmative action had promoted substantive equality. “That is a model of equality that is tried and tested, and has worked in India,” he added.Justice Chandrachud said he did not agree with the perception that a judge’s work involved an element of ‘service’. “A judge, while discharging her functions, is not doing any service. Judges are doing a job just like everybody else. They are two different issues and must not be mixed,” he said, adding that a judge must be paid commensurate with the work output.Many lawyers refer to Justice Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud as the ‘Rockstar’ of judiciary. After a stellar 25-year judicial career, eight of which were in the Supreme Court, the curtains came down on Sunday. He spoke on a range of subjects — from democracy, hate speech, reservation, executive-judiciary relations to judges’ salaries.I don’t think I can speak of my experience as a judge of the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of India without a reference to 13 years as a judge of Bombay High Court and three years as Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court. Much of what I have learnt and, particularly, my judicial philosophy is shaped by my experiences from then. In Bombay HC, I learnt the ropes of judging from many, especially judicial craftsmanship by observing Justices Sujata V Manohar and P D Desai. As CJ of Allahabad HC, I learnt about judicial administration.Allahabad HC has the highest sanctioned strength of 160 judges and heading the court was a challenge. It taught me many lessons on leadership and judicial administration. As the Chief Justice, you are not a ‘leader’ in the traditional sense. You are the first among equals. Your brother and sister judges could be older and more experienced in the profession.Thus, a very delicate balance has to be drawn. I learnt much about human emotions and relationships as the HC CJ. These experiences guided my functions, both administrative and judicial, at the Supreme Court. The switch from being the HC CJ to a puisne judge at the Supreme Court is in a lot of ways humbling. You are back to focusing solely on the judicial side of things. Looking back, I have had a very fulfilling journey.I had the opportunity to lay down the jurisprudence on disability rights, expanded the equal opportunity doctrine in the context of sex and caste discrimination, limited the scope of sealed cover jurisprudence to exceptional situations, gave teeth to the right to information, and crafted a nuanced understandings of economic federalism while deciding Centre-State disputes in the mineral and liquor cases. I am retiring with a sense of satisfaction.I have critically engaged in areas of law and developed jurisprudential frameworks to limit the ad-hoc model of judicial decision making. As the Chief Justice of India, I believe that I have left the system better than I found it.There are no uniform components of democracy that every country must tick to ensure that it is functioning ‘democratically’. The premise of democratic functioning in India, where we are faced with our own unique problems, is different from the premise of democracy in other countries.In India, we don’t subscribe to a merely ‘political’ understanding of democracy. Issues relating to elections or representation such as the right to vote or gerrymandering are a part of democratic governance.We also believe in social democracy, that is, the existence of certain minimum social factors such as absence of discrimination and ensuring substantive equality of opportunity. What is the role of institutions in democracy? Institutions are created and conferred with power to ensure that (i) the premises of democracy are not abrogated and (ii) the values that democratic foundations rest upon are fostered. I would term courts as ‘specially abled’ democratic institutions whose function itself is to ensure that the other democratic institutions are not captured and are able to freely exercise their duties.Viewed in that manner, the courts are conferred with powers to prevent democratic decay. This could include the role of courts to challenges which alter the rules of elections and the process of appointing persons to democratic institutions and their independence. But it would equally include the role of courts in a challenge against a reservation policy or even a challenge to the recruitment process to the post of a teacher or the challenge to arrest or an application requesting bail.Each of these issues is connected to the constitutional idea of democracy. So, it cannot be denied that courts have a very important role to play in the sustenance of Indian democracy. But it must be equally recognised that the length and breadth of Indian democracy and its meaning cannot be limited to certain ‘big’ matters.I am an ardent believer and proponent of the freedom of speech and expression. Constitutional freedom is subject to reasonable restrictions. I also believe that the restrictions must not render the right a mere paper right. Hate speech is a cause for concern. Its impact is multi-fold now with the rise of social media.There are an increasing number of keyboard warriors who say things in exercise of their freedom of speech to just gain traction and to stay relevant in public. Hurtful comments have far-reaching consequences on the psyche and emotional well-being of people. What should India do to curb it? The method opted by the state must be covered within the fold of the restrictions. It must not have the effect of chilling free speech.A balance must be drawn to ensure that the means adopted are proportionate to the infringement of the right.The statement that reservations for SCs and STs were to last for 10 years is factually inaccurate. Article 334 of the Constitution states that reservations for SCs and STs in the House of the People and the legislative assemblies of states must cease to exist in 10 years. This provision was amended multiple times that it now reads that it shall cease to exist in 80 years.Thus, the time limit was prescribed only for reservations in the legislature and not for reservations in educational institutions and services. From a constitutional perspective, the amendments to the time limit are unconstitutional only if the original and unamended provision has attained the character of a basic feature.The concept of equality of opportunity is eternal. That is one of the basic features of the Constitution. Reservation is a means to ensure equality of opportunity. You cannot deny that reservation as a means of affirmative action promoted substantive equality. That is a model of equality that is tried and tested, and has worked in India.The question is based on a surmise. I am not in a position to answer whether the NJAC model of appointment would have been ‘better’ than the collegium system. The Supreme Court decided the ‘constitutional validity’ of the NJAC model.The court does not sit in judgment on whether a model of appointment is better than the other but only on whether it is constitutionally sound. A constitution bench of the Supreme Court held that the NJAC model of appointment was not constitutionally sound.Within the system of appointment that is in place, I have infused a degree of transparency. There are parameters based on which we recommend a judge. We consider the factors of (i) merit, performance and integrity; (ii) diversity and inclusion; and (iii) representation.I don’t have an appropriate answer for whether the retirement age for judges must be raised. There are two perspectives from which this question can be viewed. If you ask me whether our brain becomes ‘slower’ at the ages of 62 and 65, and whether we can no longer discharge the functions of a judge, I would say no. We have legal luminaries in the bar who are at their prime even at the ages of 70 and 75.There is another perspective to this. The prescription of a retirement age is to prevent the concentration of power and to ensure that the opportunity is available to many from the younger population. The aim must be to balance experience with adaptability.I am a firm believer in payment of salaries commensurate with work. I also believe that any service must provide competitive salaries to attract talent. For example, when I took over as the Chief Justice of India, the salary of judicial law clerks was Rs 65,000. It is now Rs 80,000 for the first year of clerkship and Rs 90,000 from the second year.Clerkship in India is now a highly competitive and sought after job, which attracts talent. Competitive salaries also ensure that the job presents an opportunity to law graduates across the board, irrespective of the social and economic status. The same principle applies to judgeship as well. I know more than one candidate who has denied taking up judgeship because of the lack of financial prospects.It is a particularly difficult choice to make when you are offered judgeship in the high court. In many cases, candidates have to give up their lucrative practice which pays them 10x to 100x the salary they would be offered as a judge. There is often a perception that floats around. That as a judge, there is an element of ‘service’ involved and that economic benefits should be immaterial. I do not subscribe to this school of thought.A judge, while discharging her functions, is not doing any service. The minute that is the perception, then any decision of the judge will be viewed not as a discharge of her constitutional function but as an outcome of ‘graciousness’. A judge must be paid commensurate with the work output. While they are working, they are doing a job just like everybody else. The manner in which they discharge their job must conform to the principles prescribed by the Constitution. They are two different issues and must not be mixed.No, I have never been approached by the executive seeking a favourable order.I think it would amount to diminishing the impact and the benefits of PILs to say that it has been hijacked by a few. The core principle of public interest litigation is that it dilutes the traditional rule of locus standi on who can raise an issue before the court.A person who is not directly affected by an action (or inaction) may initiate a public interest litigation if it affects the public. It cannot be denied that courts have been more ‘activist’ in the PIL pleas. It can also not be denied that these petitions have contributed to social progress in India.The judgment of the Supreme Court in Vishaka is a prime example, where it developed the right against sexual harassment and framed guidelines to fill the legislative vacuum. Another very recent example is the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sukanya Shantha , where the court dealt with caste discrimination in prisons. The petitioner in the case was a journalist.There are numerous frivolous petitions which are instituted because of the dilution of locus standi. There is no denying that it burdens the already heavy docket. I remember that there was a PIL filed claiming that Charles Darwin was wrong in his evolution theory and Albert Einstein erred in deducing E=mc2.There was another petition with the grievance that the Chief Justice of Bombay High Court did not say ‘I’ while taking oath. So, there are good and bad cases. A few lawyers have made their name and have become popular through PILs but that is really a natural consequence of diluting the principle of locus standi. It is up to the court (and individual benches) to take a firm stand against it.",Justice D Y Chandrachud said its impact was multi-fold with the rise of social media.

Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy has provided a closer look at Donald Trump’s plans for a sweeping deportation initiative, which he describes as the largest in US history. In a recent interview, Ramaswamy defended the proposal’s feasibility and outlined initial steps to bring it to life.Ramaswamy stated that Trump’s plan would focus on deporting millions of undocumented individuals, estimating between 11 and 20 million. Priority would be given to those who entered the country in the past two years, labelled by Ramaswamy as “illegal migrants who have no place in this country.” He also highlighted a particular focus on deporting individuals with criminal records.Ramaswamy explained that the plan includes cutting all government funding that currently benefits undocumented immigrants, including federal aid to sanctuary cities. By limiting financial support, he suggested, many undocumented individuals would choose “self-deportation” as access to welfare and other support is restricted, potentially leading to a significant reduction in their numbers.Trump’s proposal aligns with ongoing debates around government spending, with Ramaswamy positioning it as part of a larger strategy to reduce the national debt, now at $34 trillion. “Using taxpayer money to subsidise illegal migration is offensive,” he stated, adding that the policy respects “the dignity of Americans already here.”Trump’s commitment to large-scale deportations is reinforced by his running mate, JD Vance, who suggests the plan could result in the deportation of up to one million people annually. Trump’s immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, has proposed that National Guard troops from supportive states could help in these efforts. Voters remain divided: Edison Research exit polls show that while 39% support deporting most undocumented immigrants, 56% favour allowing them to apply for legal status.Scaling up deportations was challenging during Trump’s first term. Despite this, recent data indicates that President Biden deported more individuals in fiscal year 2023 than Trump did in any single year of his presidency. Experts estimate that deporting 13 million people would require a significant increase in officers, detention facilities, and immigration judges and could cost up to $968 billion over a decade.Organisations like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) are preparing to challenge Trump’s plan if implemented. ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, who has previously challenged Trump’s immigration policies, revealed that more than 15 lawyers specialising in immigration law are readying resources to fight the new policies in court.Trump’s second term could involve a stronger approach from the State Department, aimed at facilitating the repatriation of deported individuals. Supporters argue that strategic appointees in the State Department will play a key role. Additionally, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a branch of ICE focused on transnational crime, may also be called on to shift resources toward immigration enforcement.Miller has suggested that states willing to cooperate may deploy National Guard troops to assist in deportations, especially in areas resistant to these policies. Trump’s team also plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, allowing for the swift deportation of alleged gang members. This move could prompt legal challenges, but proponents believe it is a powerful tool for expediting deportations.The Alien Enemies Act, a component of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals from hostile countries during wartime. Historically used during conflicts like the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II, Trump’s plan to apply this act to undocumented migration has stirred debate over its constitutional and ethical implications.Legal experts warn that invoking the Alien Enemies Act for immigration purposes raises significant constitutional questions. The Act traditionally requires either a formal declaration of war or an imminent threat to US territory. Extending it to undocumented migration raises concerns about overreach, with critics advising caution against using wartime authority for immigration enforcement.Some members of Congress have introduced a repeal bill, the Neighbours Not Enemies Act, led by Rep. Ilhan Omar and Sen. Mazie Hirono. They argue that current immigration, intelligence, and criminal laws already address national security concerns, making the Alien Enemies Act outdated and potentially detrimental to civil liberties.With modern legal frameworks in place, critics argue that the Alien Enemies Act is unnecessary for today’s immigration challenges. Deploying it for non-military purposes would shift its role and risk discrimination claims. As Trump’s plan unfolds, it faces legal, financial, and societal hurdles, with anticipated costs and consequences that could affect communities across the country.","Vivek Ramaswamy has provided a closer look at Donald Trump’s plans for a sweeping deportation initiative.

When Usha Vance's grandfather's Telugu accent made IIT students fall in love with him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/usha-vance-grandfather-telugu-accent-iit-students/articleshow/115183784.cms,"The IITians



Flashback to 1954

A tall gangling young lecturer, Rama

Sastri

, with a very marked Telugu lilt to his English, taught us Physics at IIT Kharagpur. He was an excellent teacher, despite his accented English, and also served as the warden of Azad Hall.

A (hilarious) general body meeting of the hostel was held sometime late1954 to discuss burgeoning mess bills, which had climbed from rupees thirty to an astronomical forty rupees per month. Rama Sastri had to pacify the irate students.

He patiently explained the reasons for the increase 'What to do, everythingu become costly, ricu, saltu, pepperu, vegetablesu all cost more."" The students were mesmerised by the accent'u and kept quiet. The meeting passed off peacefully. The anecdote became part of the early IIT student lore as a memorable event'u!

Rama Sastri was deputed for a year to MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, on a post doctoral fellowship. He came back a changed man. He had broad shoulders (filled out thanks to nourishing US food) and sported a marked American accent. His bold visage was unrecognizable from the figure he cut a year earlier.

He sounded totally American until he came to the deadly word 'against' when he reverted to his original Telugu persona. He pronounced it as 'againistu,' and we were relieved that our beloved

Prof

had become normal.

Rama Sastri left IIT Kharagpur in the early sixties and joined the Physics Department of the newly set up IIT Madras. He retired years later as a much loved Professor after an excellent career. IIT Madras now runs a student award in his memory.

Rama Sastri's son,

graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree from IIT Madras in 1977 and later, in the 1980s, migrated to the US and is now a lecturer in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at San Diego State University.

One may wonder the reason for a long spiel about a Physics teacher of long ago: His granddaughter Usha was born in USA, graduated from Yale, did a Master's degree at Cambridge and later attended the Law School at Yale where she met and married a classmate. Usha Chilukuri is the wife of

JD Vance

, Trump's running mate.

Yes, the accomplished daughter of a Mechanical Engineer from IIT Madras and the granddaughter of a Physics teacher at IIT Kharagpur and IIT Madras is set to become the Second Lady of the USA!

The Legacy of Rama Sastri: A Beloved Physics Lecturer and Pioneer



A Family Tradition at IIT: Honouring the Past, Embracing the Future



Usha Chilukuri: A Trailblazer in the US



Indian Institutes of Technology ( IIT ) alumni, including leaders like Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella, have greatly influenced US tech, finance, and entrepreneurship, driving innovation in major firms and startups. Their impact spans sectors, with IITians leading transformative ventures and shaping global industries through their technical expertise and leadership. And now there will be an IITian's progeny at the upper echleons of the US politics.One of the most desi US elections of all time ended with the Telugu brigade triumphing over the Tamil side as Trump-Vance beat Harris-Walz comprehensively. Usha Vance is poised to become the first Indian-origin Second Lady and across IIT campuses and alumni groups worldwide, there’s a palpable sense of pride and celebration as Usha Chilukuri, granddaughter of an IIT legend, steps into her role as the first Indian American Second Lady of the US. WhatsApp groups are lighting up with messages, memories, and heartfelt tributes, as alumni share stories of her grandfather, the beloved Professor Rama Sastri , whose Telugu-accented English and dedication made him an unforgettable figure in IIT’s early days.Rama Sastri, Usha’s grandfather, was an iconic figure in the early days of IIT Kharagpur. Arriving at the prestigious institution in 1954, he quickly became known not only for his exceptional teaching in Physics but also for his unique and memorable Telugu-accented English. His light-hearted approach and charismatic presence were well-received by students, particularly during a legendary general body meeting in Azad Hall, where students debated over a 10-rupee hike in the mess bill. As he humorously reassured students, citing the rising costs of “ricu, saltu, pepperu, vegetablesu,” his distinctive accent softened the tension, etching a fond memory into IIT’s early lore.In 1955, Rama Sastri earned a postdoctoral fellowship at MIT, where he gained a broader outlook and a slight American lilt, though students later remarked that his Telugu accent crept back at unexpected moments, reinforcing his endearing place in IIT’s heart. After a distinguished tenure at IIT Kharagpur, he joined IIT Madras, contributing to its budding Physics Department and eventually retiring as a revered professor. In his memory, IIT Madras now hosts a student award, a tribute to a lecturer who shaped countless careers.The IIT connection carried on with Rama Sastri’s son, Krish, who graduated in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Madras in 1977. He later moved to the US, where he currently lectures in Aerospace Engineering at San Diego State University. IIT alumni fondly recall the Sastri family’s legacy, appreciating the deep-rooted values of academia and intellectual rigor that each generation upheld. Now, as the IIT community watches Usha ascend to a national role, memories of her grandfather and father resonate strongly, with IITians reflecting on the impact of their work and presence.Usha Chilukuri’s journey to becoming the Second Lady is a testament to her dedication and intellect. Born in the US to an IIT graduate, she excelled academically, graduating from Yale, obtaining a Master’s from Cambridge, and returning to Yale Law School . It was there she met JD Vance, a rising political figure who is now the Republican vice-presidential candidate in the US. Together, they represent a new era, bringing with them the cultural and intellectual foundations of their heritage.As the first Indian American to serve as Second Lady of the US, Usha’s story is one that connects the rich tradition of IIT with the highest echelons of American politics. For IITians and many Indians, it is a moment of pride, reflecting how the academic roots nurtured in India can flourish internationally.This historic rise from the IIT classrooms of the 1950s to the global stage in 2024 marks a full-circle moment, one that not only honours Rama Sastri’s legacy but celebrates the bridge between tradition and progress that his family embodies. For Usha, this journey carries forward a legacy and adds a new chapter to the Sastri family’s enduring contribution to the worlds of academia, culture, and public service.","Usha Chilukuri, granddaughter of an IIT legend, steps into her role as the first Indian American Second Lady of the US.

US Election 2024: How Amish voters helped Donald Trump swing Pennsylvania,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-results-2024-why-amish-who-never-vote-voted-for-trump/articleshow/115144822.cms,"Members of the Amish community, Samuel Stoltzfus and his wife Lillian Stoltzfus, vote at a polling center at the Garden Spot Village retirement community in New Holland, Pa., Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. (AP Photo/Luis Andres Henao)

In the 2024 election, Donald Trump managed to expand his support across a broad demographic range, drawing in women, men, young voters, Black Americans, and Hispanics. But perhaps the most surprising new contingent of Trump supporters was the Amish, who typically avoid political engagement. For the first time in Pennsylvania, Amish voters registered to vote in “unprecedented numbers” to support Trump in this key battleground state.This shift came after a government raid at Amos Miller’s raw milk farm in Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania, last January. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture had received reports of illness linked to raw dairy products sold at the farm and subsequently launched an enforcement action. This event sparked widespread concern in the Amish community, which saw it as emblematic of government overreach into their way of life. Traditionally averse to modern politics, the Amish felt compelled to get involved in an effort to protect their livelihoods and traditional practices.Local conservative activist Scott Presler played a significant role in mobilising the Amish for Trump . He spent weeks in Pennsylvania's Amish regions, capitalising on the raid narrative to illustrate government interference in Amish agricultural practices. By highlighting Trump’s stance on limiting federal authority and advocating for religious and personal freedoms, Presler successfully connected with Amish voters who felt that their values and way of life were under threat.The “Amish for Trump” momentum went beyond this one community. Presler also reached out to other traditionally conservative groups, like union laborers and hunters, by emphasising Trump’s positions on job security and Second Amendment rights. However, the Amish alignment was especially striking, as it marked a rare moment when this insular community actively participated in national politics.Elon Musk, one of Trump’s high-profile allies during the campaign, underscored the importance of the Amish vote to Trump’s Pennsylvania ground strategy. In an interview with Tucker Carlson, Musk noted, “We paid significant attention to the Amish community. There was government overreach with the Amish farmers. They were upset, so we made sure they got out to vote.” This outreach effort helped secure Trump’s victory in Pennsylvania, a critical win on his path to the presidency.The “Amish for Trump” movement was more than an anomaly in voting behaviour; it was a testament to the Amish community’s commitment to safeguarding their traditions in the face of what they perceived as federal encroachment. This unexpected surge in support demonstrated the unique coalitions that Trump’s 2024 campaign built across diverse, and often overlooked, American communities.","For the first time in Pennsylvania, Amish voters registered to vote in “unprecedented numbers” to support Trump in this key battleground state.

NEW DELHI: Justice Sanjiv Khanna , who has been part of several landmark Supreme Court judgements such as scrapping the electoral bonds scheme and upholding abrogation of Article 370, will be sworn in as the 51st Chief Justice of India on Monday. President Droupadi Murmu will administer the oath of office at Rashtrapati Bhavan in a ceremony scheduled at 10 am.Justice Khanna will succeed Justice DY Chandrachud , who retired on Sunday, and his term will last until May 13, 2025.The Centre officially notified Justice Khanna's appointment on October 24 following Chief Justice Chandrachud's recommendation on October 16. Friday was the last working day of Justice Chandrachud as the CJI and he was given a rousing farewell by judges, lawyers and staff of the apex court and the high courts.Justice Khanna, who served as a Supreme Court judge since January 2019, has been part of several landmark judgements such as upholding the sanctity of EVMs, scrapping the electoral bonds scheme, upholding the abrogation of Article 370 and the grant of interim bail to former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.Hailing from an illustrious Delhi-based family, Justice Khanna is the son of former Delhi high court judge Justice Dev Raj Khanna and the nephew of prominent former apex court judge H R Khanna.Justice Sanjiv Khanna, who was elevated as a judge of the Supreme Court on January 18, 2019, was a third-generation lawyer before being appointed as judge of the high court.

JD Vance's journey from marine corps to family life



Vance's memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy"" sheds light on his turbulent childhood and socio-economic challenges in Appalachia



JD Vance’s net worth



JD Vance's political rise and evolving stance on Trump



JD Vance's journey is one of resilience, shaped by his childhood in Middletown, Ohio, and summers in Jackson, Kentucky. At 40, he is on the verge of becoming the youngest vice president since Nixon. His service in the Marine Corps as a public affairs officer in Iraq deepened his sense of duty and influenced his political beliefs.Vance gained national recognition with his 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy , where he openly discussed the hardships of his upbringing and offered a window into the socio-economic challenges of Appalachia. This work helped launch his political career and contributed to his evolving views on former President Trump.JD Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, and spent summers with extended family in Jackson, Kentucky. His upbringing in these areas significantly influenced his perspectives. Vance turned 40 on August 2. He is now the youngest vice president-elect since Richard Nixon. After high school, Vance joined the Marine Corps and served as a public affairs officer in Iraq, adding a layer of depth to his political identity.Vance married Usha Chilukuri Vance in 2014 after meeting at Yale Law School. Usha is a former litigator who left her job following Vance’s nomination for vice president. The couple has three young children: Ewan (7), Vivek (4), and Mirabel (2). Their family dynamics play an important role in Vance’s public image. Vance and his family live between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Alexandria, Virginia, reflecting his commitment to both his home state and his political responsibilities. Vance’s mother, Beverly Aikins, has been a significant figure in his life. Raised in Middletown, she is now 10 years sober, a journey Vance often highlights in his speeches. Aikins has travelled with him on the campaign trail, sharing her story to inspire others facing similar challenges.Vance gained national recognition with his memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" published in 2016. The book offers a candid look at his turbulent childhood, including his mother’s struggles with addiction and the profound impact of his grandmother, whom he refers to as Mamaw. It has served as a lens through which many understand the socio-economic issues affecting the Rust Belt and Appalachia. The memoir was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard, starring Glenn Close and Amy Adams.Forbes estimates Vance's net worth at approximately $10 million, a substantial amount that highlights his rise from humble beginnings and positions him in circles that may have once felt uncomfortable to his younger self. According to his 2023 Senate financial disclosure, Vance earned about $55,000 in royalties from his memoir, with $121,000 reported in 2022. By July 2024, media reports indicated the book had sold nearly 2 million copies.Vance entered politics in 2022, securing a Senate seat in Ohio by defeating former Democratic Representative Tim Ryan. His relationship with Trump has changed over the years. Initially critical, he once compared Trump to ""America’s Hitler"" and was hesitant to support him in 2016. However, as he prepared for his Senate campaign, Vance reversed his position, deleted the controversial tweets, and began endorsing Trump, eventually earning his backing.As Vance helps Trump form his administration after the election, he is on track to become the nation's youngest vice president since 1953, when Richard Nixon, who was 40 just days before his inauguration, was sworn in as Dwight Eisenhower's vice president. The record for the youngest vice president is held by John C. Breckinridge, who was 36 when he assumed office in 1857 as James Buchanan's vice president.","JD Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, and spent summers in Jackson, Kentucky.

From Friendship to Marriage



A Resilient Partnership in Life and Politics



JD Vance and Usha Chilukuri come from markedly different backgrounds. Vance, the son of a mother struggling with addiction and raised by his grandmother in an economically challenged community in Ohio, faced considerable hardships. In contrast, Chilukuri, the daughter of Indian immigrants, grew up in California in a household that placed a strong emphasis on academic and professional achievements—her father an IIT-trained mechanical engineer and her mother a marine biologist. Despite their contrasting upbringings, their lives intersected at Yale Law School, where they collaborated on a significant writing project. As Usha noted, “We were friends first; I mean, who wouldn’t want to be friends with JD?”Their connection continued to grow, evolving from friendship into love. In Hillbilly Elegy , Vance describes his initial feelings for Usha as overwhelming. He recalls, “I thought about her constantly. One friend described me as ‘heartsick,’ and another said he had never seen me like this.” Once he learned that Usha was single, he didn’t hesitate to ask her out, beginning a relationship that gradually deepened.Navigating their personal differences and social challenges, Usha supported JD as he adjusted to unfamiliar environments. At one point, however, Vance’s struggle with handling stress within their relationship put their bond to the test. He recounts an incident in which he stormed out of a hotel room after a disappointing interview, only to later offer a heartfelt apology. Reflecting on Usha’s response, he said, “She calmly told me through her tears that it was never acceptable to run away.”JD and Usha married in 2014, and their intercultural relationship has proven to be a strong foundation for both of them. While introducing JD at the Republican National Convention , Usha remarked, “That JD and I could meet, let alone fall in love and marry, is testament to this great country.” She described JD as a “meat and potatoes guy” who, over time, learned to enjoy her vegetarian diet and even prepared Indian dishes for her mother.Their unique partnership has now propelled them to one of the highest platforms in the US, as JD, a venture capitalist and author, prepares to assume the role of Vice President-elect.","JD Vance and Usha Chilukuri come from markedly different backgrounds.

2. The Role of Gun Rights in the Political Divide



3. “Gays” and LGBTQ+ Rights: A Cultural Flashpoint



4. God and Religion: A Dividing Line in Morality Politics



5. The Working-Class Perception of the Democratic Party



6. Messaging Challenges and the Path Forward



7. Reclaiming the Working-Class Base



8. Moving Beyond “Anti-Trump” Rhetoric



In the aftermath of a difficult electoral defeat for the Democrats, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered a candid assessment of what went wrong and what lies ahead. Reflecting on Trump’s return as president-elect, a Republican Senate majority, and an uncertain House race, Pelosi acknowledged the setbacks but resisted claims that the Democratic Party had lost its core values. Key to her analysis was the idea that Democrats faced a cultural assault centered on divisive issues like guns, LGBTQ+ rights, and religion — a triad Pelosi referred to as “guns, gays, and God.” This phrase encapsulated her view that the Republican strategy successfully leveraged emotional issues to gain traction with certain voters, particularly among working-class and religious Americans.Pelosi argued that the Republican Party effectively redirected public discourse towards cultural issues. These “guns, gays, and God” topics have been foundational to a conservative agenda aiming to galvanise specific voting blocs. According to Pelosi, these themes serve as rallying points, distracting voters from economic and social issues in favour of intense, often emotional appeals to deeply held beliefs. The Republican approach, she suggested, helped frame the Democrats as out of touch with traditional American values, especially among rural and working-class voters.One major aspect of this cultural strategy, Pelosi noted, is gun rights. Gun ownership and Second Amendment rights are central to many Americans, especially in rural areas, where gun culture is both a lifestyle and a matter of personal freedom. The Democratic Party’s push for gun control and common-sense regulations has been met with opposition by the Republican narrative that casts these efforts as infringements on personal liberty. For many voters, the right to bear arms is not only a constitutional issue but also a symbol of resistance to perceived government overreach. Pelosi recognised that the Democrats’ stance on gun control likely alienated some voters who prioritise this issue, though she maintained that the party’s commitment to reducing gun violence remains strong.Another focal point of the Republican strategy, according to Pelosi, is the issue of LGBTQ+ rights. Although public support for LGBTQ+ rights, including same-sex marriage, has grown significantly over recent years, conservatives have continued to use this issue to draw a contrast between “traditional” and “progressive” values. Pelosi argued that the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals have been framed as a threat to traditional family values by some Republicans, particularly in states with strong religious influences. This framing, she suggested, alienates conservative-leaning voters and casts the Democratic Party as opposed to conventional family structures, despite Democrats’ advocacy for equal rights and protection for all citizens.The recent surge in anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, especially regarding trans rights and issues like gender identity, has become a divisive cultural flashpoint. Conservatives have argued that Democrats’ stance on transgender issues is out of step with mainstream values, leveraging this rhetoric to win over voters who view these issues as emblematic of an overly progressive agenda. Pelosi observed that this strategy has had some success, especially in more conservative areas, as it taps into voters' anxieties about societal change and traditional norms.Religion, particularly Christian nationalism, has also become a critical theme in the Republican cultural arsenal. Pelosi noted that Republicans have positioned themselves as the party aligned with religious values, often accusing Democrats of being secular or even hostile to faith-based beliefs. For some voters, Pelosi argued, the Democratic Party’s commitment to policies such as reproductive rights and separation of church and state are interpreted as direct challenges to religious doctrines. This framing casts the party as morally and culturally out of sync with many Americans, particularly evangelical and conservative Christian communities who see their faith as under attack.According to Pelosi, the use of “God” in the cultural narrative is especially powerful, as it appeals to Americans who feel their religious identity is threatened by progressive social policies. She warned that by exploiting these divisions, Republicans have managed to create a moral opposition to the Democratic platform, positioning themselves as protectors of a “Christian America.”Beyond these cultural issues, Pelosi acknowledged that some critics within her party, like Bernie Sanders , argued that Democrats had lost touch with working-class voters. Sanders suggested that the party’s focus on progressive cultural issues and social agendas alienated voters concerned with economic issues like inflation, jobs, and wages. Pelosi, however, refuted claims that the Democrats had abandoned working families, citing legislative achievements like the child tax credit, the Infrastructure Bill, and the CHIPS Act. Nonetheless, she admitted that the Democratic message may not have been communicated effectively, with cultural issues overshadowing economic accomplishments in the eyes of voters.Pelosi recognised the difficulty of competing with the emotional appeal of cultural issues, which often draw a sharper line than economic debates. She acknowledged that the Democrats’ message on economic achievements and social policies may not have reached certain segments of the electorate. In her view, the party’s challenge is to clarify its values and communicate its achievements in ways that resonate with everyday Americans, especially those drawn to the cultural appeals of the Republican message.In Pelosi’s assessment, the way forward for the Democratic Party involves shifting the focus back to its core mission: advocating for working families, addressing economic inequality, and ensuring a strong social safety net. She stressed that the party’s historical strength has been in representing the interests of those who work hard and seek fairness, contrasting this with the perception that the Republican Party primarily serves the wealthy elite. Pelosi urged her party to “organise, not agonise,” reaffirming its commitment to policies that benefit working families and challenging the narrative that has allowed Republicans to gain ground with cultural issues.Finally, Pelosi cautioned against letting the Democratic Party become solely defined as the opposition to Trump. While acknowledging the need to counter Trump’s policies and rhetoric, she argued that Democrats must also articulate a positive, aspirational vision that transcends merely being “anti-Trump.” By focusing on its achievements and future goals, the Democratic Party, she believes, can reclaim its identity as a force for progress and justice, rather than simply an antagonist to Trumpism.In closing, Pelosi underscored the need for the Democratic Party to connect with voters on both cultural and economic grounds, striving to bridge the divide that “guns, gays, and God” has opened. As the party prepares for future battles, Pelosi remains optimistic that a redefined message and unified strategy can help them win back support across diverse communities.","Pelosi argued that the Republican Party effectively redirected public discourse towards cultural issues.

Russia-Ukraine war: Why North Korean soldiers are ready to die for Putin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-why-north-korean-soldiers-are-ready-to-die-for-putin/articleshow/115185855.cms,"File photo: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center, meets soldiers who took part in a training in North Korea.

Driving the news

North Korea has reportedly sent thousands of troops to support Russia’s military efforts in Ukraine. Estimates range from 10,000 to 11,000 soldiers stationed in the Kursk region, where fierce combat against Ukrainian forces continues.

The move marks an unprecedented step by North Korea, which typically refrains from deploying troops abroad for fear of defection or exposure to foreign influences.

Why it matters

This deployment reflects a significant shift in the strategic alliance between Russia and North Korea, cemented by a mutual defense treaty signed in June 2024 by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un .

and . While North Korean soldiers may not dramatically alter the course of the conflict due to their limited equipment and training, their presence underscores the lengths to which Pyongyang is willing to go to maintain and bolster its ties with Moscow.

For Russia, grappling with high casualty rates and recruitment challenges, these North Korean reinforcements offer a short-term solution to manpower shortages.

The motivations behind deployment

According to a Wall Street Journal report, insights from former North Korean soldiers provide a clearer picture of why so many troops would willingly volunteer for a war far from home. Ryu Seong-hyeon, a defector who escaped across the Korean Demilitarized Zone in 2019, described the severe conditions that shape military life in North Korea. Young soldiers like Ryu endure grueling physical labor, inadequate food, and a regimented lifestyle dominated by propaganda. “If ordered to fight with the Russians,” said Ryu, “I would have answered, ‘Thank you.’ Wouldn’t the meals be better at least?” Such remarks highlight how even meager improvements in living conditions could motivate troops to volunteer for deployment.

Former elite soldiers also confirm that indoctrination plays a significant role. North Koreans are trained from an early age to venerate their leader and see loyalty as a virtue worth dying for. Daily drills and ideological training reinforce this mindset. Children are taught through school textbooks to prove their allegiance by volunteering for extreme scenarios, like being the target of hypothetical artillery strikes. This conditioning ensures that by the time they join the military, soldiers are prepared to undertake any mission without question, the WSJ report said.

What they’re saying

“North Korean soldiers are convinced that they should do anything for Kim,” said Ryu, encapsulating the unwavering loyalty instilled in troops. Lee Hyun-seung, another defector and former member of the elite Storm Corps, noted that despite limited combat experience abroad, the ideological training these soldiers receive is thorough. Lee recalled constant drills and recitations affirming their willingness to sacrifice themelessves for the regime.

“They may be sacrificed without making much impact in the war. But they wouldn’t dare cast doubt on the leader’s orders to go to Russia,"" Lee told the WSJ.

""The strength of North Korean special operations forces lies in their ability to endure harsh conditions, even when food and other resources are in short supply,"" Lim Eul-chul from Kyungnam Universitym told AFP. ""They have strong mental resilience.""

This blind devotion could explain why North Korean troops seem ready to serve in Ukraine, despite uncertain prospects.

""If Russia is having manpower issues, it will require far more North Koreans to address these challenges,"" observed Mick Ryan, a retired Australian general.

Despite their prestige, these North Korean units still suffer from significant disadvantages compared to Western or Russian elite forces. As David Maxwell, a retired US Army Special Forces colonel, put it, these soldiers are “highly disciplined” but often trained under outdated conditions with insufficient resources. Their focus has been on tasks such as infiltration and infrastructure sabotage rather than conventional warfare, leaving them at a disadvantage in modern combat scenarios.

A telling example of the disparity lies in the equipment used by North Korean forces. State parades often showcase an array of advanced weaponry, but experts agree that these displays are largely for show. In reality, most North Korean soldiers lack modern combat gear and rely on decades-old technology. Reports suggest that the troops deployed to Russia have been equipped with Russian uniforms and trained minimally in artillery, drone operation, and trench warfare. This limited preparation highlights their role as foot soldiers rather than as a well-integrated combat unit.

Between the lines

As per an AFP report, the commitment to deploy troops outside North Korea is unprecedented and risks exposure to ideas and practices that might unsettle Pyongyang’s tight control. “The regime is worried that soldiers from the isolated country might pick up ‘incorrect’ ideas,” wrote Fyodor Tertitskiy, a researcher at Seoul’s Kookmin University. Yet, with a mutual defense treaty now binding Russia and North Korea closer together, the gamble appears calculated. The Kim regime seeks not just economic and military benefits but also invaluable lessons on modern warfare.

Analysts also question the strategic impact of North Korean soldiers in Ukraine. While their loyalty and resilience are beyond doubt, operational integration remains a challenge. The language barrier could hinder coordination between Russian commanders and North Korean troops, potentially compromising effectiveness on the battlefield. “While translators will be helpful, this kind of communication gap can, and will, be a problem during combat operations,” said Mick Ryan, a retired Australian general.

Despite these hurdles, the willingness of North Korea to send more troops poses a potential long-term concern. With one of the world’s largest standing armies, estimated at 1.2 million active-duty personnel and several million more in reserves, North Korea could continue to reinforce Russia’s forces if required. This scale of potential deployment is concerning, especially when viewed against the backdrop of Russia’s attritional warfare strategy and high troop casualty rates.

Zoom in

What’s next

The potential ripple effects of North Korean participation in the Ukraine war extend beyond the battlefield. Sim Ju-il, a former officer who fled North Korea in 1998, suggested that those who return from deployment could gain elevated social and political status, much like the pilots who fought for North Korea during the Vietnam War. Survivors were celebrated as heroes, and even the families of those who perished were granted prestigious positions within the Workers’ Party. Such incentives reinforce the belief among North Korean soldiers that fighting abroad, even at high personal risk, is a worthwhile endeavor.

Nevertheless, the deployment of North Korean troops to Ukraine adds a new layer of complexity to an already multifaceted conflict. While their presence might provide temporary manpower relief for Russia, questions about their operational effectiveness and the sustainability of such support persist. The ideological training and blind loyalty instilled in these troops may propel them into combat, but their impact remains uncertain. Both Russia and North Korea are gambling on a collaboration that could yield strategic gains or prove to be a costly miscalculation. The world will be watching closely to see how this unusual alliance evolves on the battlefields of Ukraine.

As the war in Ukraine stretches into its third year, a new and unexpected contingent has joined the fray: North Korean soldiers, deployed to support Russian forces in the embattled Kursk region. The decision to send troops abroad—a first for North Korea since the Korean War—has startled analysts, shifting attention to what drives these soldiers to fight, not for their homeland, but for a distant ally. What is it about the Kim regime’s iron grip that compels young men to risk everything for a foreign war? To understand this, one must delve into the layered motivations that go beyond simple allegiance to the supreme leader.Life in the North Korean military is marked by hardship. A World Food Program report states that around 45% of North Korea’s 26 million people are undernourished. Soldiers, despite their status, are not immune to these food shortages. Many subsist on rice mixed with corn, and meat is a rare luxury. For those deployed to Russia, the promise of more regular meals and a modest wage—around $2,000 a month, according to South Korean officials—provides substantial motivation. This figure dwarfs the average monthly income in North Korea, which is only a few dollars. Even though a large portion of this pay will go to the regime, the remainder still represents an opportunity for the soldiers and their families back home.(With inputs from agencies)","North Korea has reportedly sent thousands of troops to support Russia’s military efforts in Ukraine.

MUMBAI: The Samajwadi Party (SP) has demanded a new cabinet minister for 'MMR' region in MVA govt. SP has demanded establishment and appointment of a cabinet minister for the MMR to fast-track the infrastructure development projects and works in the region. SP MLA Rais Shaikh has written to the MVA leaders Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray and Nana Patole on the same. The region includes 9 Municipal Corporations, 9 Municipal Councils, one Nagar Panchayat and 1465 villages. Shaikh said there is a lack of coordination between the local bodies and various authorities in MMR so there is a need for establishing a separate ministry for the MMR region .The MMR is known as the region with the highest population density and the fastest growing region. The region includes 9 Municipal Corporations, 9 Municipal Councils, one Nagar Panchayat and 1465 villages in Palghar, Thane, Raigad districts. The population of this area is 2.35 crore and the area of the region is 6328 sq.""Although there is a MMRDA , its emphasis is on building infrastructure. There is a lack of coordination between the local bodies and various authorities in MMR. Therefore, this region could not develop to its full potential. As a result, various projects and works of the local bodies are going on at a slow pace. Hence, the citizens are suffering due to the lack of basic amenities in the region,” Shaikh said.Shaikh said Bhiwandi is a logistics and warehouse hub. ""Navi Mumbai International Airport will be operational soon. There is Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust in the area and a newport is being developed in Palghar district. Samruddhi Expressway, Virar-Alibaug Multimodal Corridor, Coastal Highway, Railway Network are being developed that will create a huge transportation network in MMR,"" added Shaikh.Shaikh said the projects in the area are being implemented by various authorities. ""There is a lack of coordination between the authorities and the local bodies in the area. Therefore, there is a need for establishing a separate ministry for the MMR region that should be headed by a cabinet minister,"" said Shaikh.","SP has demanded establishment and appointment of a cabinet minister for the MMR.

Pakistan Air Pollution: 11 million children at risk: Unicef urges Pakistan government to act on hazardous air pollution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/11-million-children-at-risk-unicef-urges-government-to-act-on-hazardous-pakistan-air-pollution/articleshow/115199039.cms,"Unicef’s representative in Pakistan Abdullah Fadil warned of severe health risks facing around 11 million children who are currently breathing hazardous air in Punjab. He urged the Pakistan government to take immediate action to curb the worsening air pollution and protect these vulnerable populations.Fadil, in a statement, said, ""I am extremely concerned about the well-being of young children who are forced to breathe polluted, toxic air. Over 11 million children under five years of age are exposed to this smog in the worst-affected districts.""He noted that even before this year’s record-breaking smog, 12% of deaths in children under five in Pakistan were attributed to air pollution—a number likely to increase with the ongoing crisis.Fadil warned of the additional risks to expectant mothers, stating that exposure to polluted air increases the likelihood of premature births, respiratory complications, and low birth weight. ""When pregnant women are exposed to polluted air, they are more likely to give birth prematurely, face respiratory issues, and their babies may have a low birth weight. We cannot afford to let our babies breathe toxic air. We cannot let the health, education, and well-being of millions of children suffer,"" he said.Calling on the government for immediate intervention, Fadil said that clean air is a fundamental right for every child, highlighting the urgency of protective measures to safeguard the health of Pakistan's youngest citizens amidst this crisis.Dawn reported that Punjab's Air Quality Index (AQI) has surged to critical levels, with seven districts, including Sialkot, registering AQI readings above 400 and one district reaching a staggering 774.In response to this escalating public health emergency, local authorities have temporarily closed schools until November 17. Residents are also being restricted from public parks, zoos, playgrounds, and museums to limit their exposure to the dangerous smog levels.The Unicef office in Islamabad highlighted that cities like Lahore and Multan are recording unprecedented levels of air pollution, with hospitals admitting numerous patients affected by the toxic air, including dozens of young children.","Unicef representative in Pakistan Abdullah Fadil warned of severe health risks facing around 11 million children.

Singles Day: How Singles' Day in China evolved into one of the world’s largest shopping event,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/how-singles-day-in-china-evolved-into-one-of-the-worlds-largest-shopping-event/articleshow/115198868.cms,"Pedestrians walk near an advertisement promoting the sales festival in Beijing. (Picture credit: AP)

While the Western world is gearing up for Black Friday and Cyber Monday , China has already celebrated its biggest shopping extravaganza—Singles Day. Often overshadowing other global shopping events, Singles Day has grown from a niche celebration to a retail phenomenon , surpassing the likes of Prime Day and Black Friday.Originating as a light-hearted holiday to honour singlehood, it has evolved into a massive online shopping festival. This year, the event began on October 14 and culminated on November 11, marking the longest Singles Day sales period ever.The concept of Singles Day traces back to 1993 when it was first celebrated at China's Nanjing University, initially dubbed ""Bachelor's Day.""On this day, single individuals would treat themselves to gifts, often accompanied by social gatherings. What started as a modest celebration has transformed into a retail juggernaut, attracting millions of shoppers eager to grab deals.The event's popularity soared after Alibaba , China's e-commerce giant, adopted it in 2009, turning November 11, or ""11.11,"" into a day synonymous with discounts and deals. Over the years, other major platforms like JD.com and Pinduoduo joined the bandwagon, transforming Singles Day into a country-wide shopping spree.Last year's Singles Day saw Chinese consumers spending a staggering 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.4 billion), according to Syntun data, reported by the news agency Reuters. This figure dwarfs the $38 billion spent during the US's Cyber Week, which includes Black Friday and Cyber Monday.However, despite the impressive numbers, growth has been slowing down. The sales increase last year was just 2 per cent, the slowest in its history, reflecting changing consumer behaviours and market saturation.Analysts suggest that this year's sales could reach an estimated 1.2 trillion yuan ($167 billion), reflecting a potential 15 per cent rise. However, experts remain cautious, noting that the increase may come with caveats as many shoppers bulk-buy to hit discount thresholds, often leading to returns, which can erode profits.In recent years, Singles Day has seen a shift in consumer spending patterns . While previous years featured splurges on luxury goods and big-ticket items, last year saw a trend towards necessities like tissues, handwash, and pet food as shoppers turned frugal.This shift could be attributed to economic uncertainty and the lingering effects of China's stringent Covid-19 measures. For 2024, household appliances have gained traction, partly driven by a 150 billion yuan trade-in subsidy scheme introduced by the Chinese government to spur consumption.The landscape of Singles Day is also changing, with competition intensifying among e-commerce giants. While Alibaba remains a key player, JD.com and other platforms have gained significant ground.The Singles Day frenzy comes at a crucial time for China, which is grappling with sluggish domestic consumption despite recent measures from Beijing aimed at boosting spending.The government has rolled out aggressive policies, including key rate cuts and easing debt limits for local governments, hoping to spark a consumption-driven recovery. However, experts believe a full return to pre-pandemic growth levels may require more substantial fiscal intervention.As the longest Singles Day ever comes to a close, all eyes are on the final sales figures, which Alibaba and JD.com have chosen not to disclose for a second consecutive year.Despite the challenges, Singles Day continues to be an indicator of China's retail health, reflecting the delicate balance between discount-driven sales and the pursuit of sustainable profit margins.","Singles Day has grown from a niche celebration to a retail phenomenon.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
