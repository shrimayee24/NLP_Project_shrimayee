Their discussions will focus on key areas such as trade, tariffs, defence partnerships, and economic collaboration.Before his departure for the US, PM Modi emphasised the importance of strengthening ties between the two nations.

"Register land for hosiery unit or be present in court, SC tells WB chief Secy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/register-land-for-hosiery-unit-or-be-present-in-court-sc-tells-wb-chief-secy/articleshow/118197730.cms,"NEW DELHI: It is literally a 14-year-long kachcha-banian fight by a reputed hosiery manufacturing company to get hold of an acre of land in New Town, Kolkata. The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave an ultimatum to the West Bengal chief secretary – register the sale deed by March 2 or remain present in court.Rupa & Co were allotted the land in 2011 for establishing a modern showroom and manufacturing unit. It fully paid the cost of the land to the state government, but has been waiting since then, despite orders in its favour from Calcutta high court , for execution of the conveyance/sale deed, without which it cannot utilise the land.Senior advocate Nalin Kohli told a bench of Justices B R Gavai and A G Masih that a division bench of the HC had on Feb 10, 2020, ordered the state to register the allotted land in favour of Rupa. When the HC directions remained non-complied, the petitioner had filed repeated contempt petitions.Despite the HC judgment attaining finality and the only question remaining before the court was the implementation of its order, the HC rather surprisingly took note of the advocate general’s request for allotment of an alternative land of same area and referred the matter to mediation for amicable resolution, Kohli said and argued that such a course was not open for the HC in contempt proceeding.The bench agreed with the counsel and said if found the HC’s approach untenable, especially when the HC had on multiple occasions entertained contempt petitions and ruled that the state was bound to comply with its 2020 order.The bench said the HC could not have referred the matter for resolution through mediation solely based on the AG’s submissions, that too without the petitioner’s consent. “The majesty of law requires due obedience to the HC order, especially when the state’s appeal against it has been rejected by the SC,” Justice Gavai-led bench said.“This is a serious issue of maintaining the dignity and authority of the HC. Obedience of mandamus concerned. If the HC is not concerned about its dignity, then we are,” it said.Directing the state chief secretary to comply with the HC’s 2020 order by March 2 or remain present before it, the bench said it finds that the state’s approach in the case contumacious as it dared to seek the present market value of the land after the petitioner had succeeded before the HC and the SC.","The Supreme Court gave an ultimatum to the West Bengal chief secretary – register the sale deed by March 2 or remain present in court.

SC quashes NCH chairperson’s appointment; Khurana six months short of completing 4-year tenure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-quashes-nch-chairpersons-appointment-khurana-six-months-short-of-completing-4-year-tenure/articleshow/118197732.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed appointment of N K Khurana as the chairperson of National Commission for Homeopathy (NCH), who is six months shy of completing four-year term, finding that he did not meet the eligibility criteria and indicted AYUSH secretary for declaring Khurana eligible.The appointment of Khurana, whose term was to end in July this year, was set aside by a single judge bench of the Karnataka HC but he continued in the post as the single judge's decision was reversed by a division bench of the HC.On the appeal filed by Amaragouda L Patil, an unsuccessful contender for the chairman’s post, a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan found Khurana said the then AYUSH secretary, without any material, had in 2021 misled the selection committee that Khurana had the required experience when in reality he did not.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Devadatt Kamat and lawyer Nishant Patil said Khurana did not fulfil the eligibility criteria of “not less than 20 years in the field of Homeopathy, out of which at least 10 years shall be as a leader (as head of the department or the head of an organization) in the area of healthcare delivery.”After examining the documents relating to selection of candidates, three of whom were empaneled by the search committee including Amaragouda L Patil, the bench rejected Khurana’s claim that he was head of the department since 2008 and said, “It is plain and clear that he misrepresented his work experience for being considered for the coveted position of chairperson of the Commission.”Criticizing the Union govt for deviating from the mandatory eligibility criteria to favour Khurana, the bench said his appointment as chairperson despite not having the requisite experience suffers from malice in law.Writing the judgment, Justice Datta said, “We hasten to add that whenever appointment to a public office is sought to be made, irrespective of the nature of the office, the rules prescribing mandatory eligibility criteria must be applied in a strict manner; after all, every public appointment under Article 16 of the Constitution must be fair, non-arbitrary and reasonable. Tested on this touchstone, the appointment of the third respondent fails to pass muster.”Ordering Khurana to step down from the post in a week, the time given to enable him complete pending assignment without taking policy decisions, the bench asked the government to initiate a fresh process for selection of chairperson for NCH. It said though the past financial benefits would not be recovered from Khurana, he would not be entitled to any future financial benefit for holding the post of chairperson for 42 months.",The Supreme Court quashed appointment of N K Khurana as the chairperson of National Commission for Homeopathy (NCH) The court found that he did not meet the eligibility criteria and indicted AYUSH secretary for declaring him eligible.

"Modi, Macron seal deals on N-energy to power AI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-macron-seal-deals-on-n-energy-to-power-ai/articleshow/118196236.cms,"PM Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron

India and France adopted a roadmap for cooperation in AI and concluded 9 other agreements, including 3 to boost civil nuclear cooperation, as PM Narendra Modi and President Emmanuel Macron held bilateral talks, reaffirming their strong commitment to the strategic partnership between the 2 countries.Among the major takeaways was an agreement for jointly developing and producing advanced and small modular reactors that could hold the key to powering the energy-intensive AI industry in both countries. The leaders discussed regional and global issues like the West Asia situation and Russia-Ukraine war and enhanced their Indo-Pacific partnership with an agreement for triangular cooperation to promote sustainable development in third countries in the region.While no agreement was signed in defence, Modi and Macron welcomed cooperation in building air and maritime assets in line with the 2024 defence industrial roadmap. In a special gesture, the leaders travelled together in the French presidential aircraft to Marseille where they held delegation-level talks, visited a war cemetery and inaugurated the new Indian consulate. Macron hosted a private dinner for Modi and later also went to the airport in Marseille to see off the Indian PM.Four of the agreements signed were in areas related to technology and innovation. While the leaders didn’t address the media, they acknowledged in a joint statement India-France civil nuclear ties and efforts in cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, notably in relation with the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Plant Project. They welcomed the partnership for co-designing, co-developing and co-producing advanced modular reactors (AMR) and small modular reactors (SMR). India has been in touch with the US, Russia and France for the past couple of years for jointly developing the technology and the issue is likely to figure in Modi’s engagements in the US too on Thursday. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said cooperation in SMR and AMR is important also for AI, recalling International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol’s remark that AI essentially means electricity. “And the amount of electricity that will be needed, if it is going to be sustainable, then it has to be something like nuclear power-driven electricity. And that is the area in which SMRs and AMRs can play a key role. It can also help us tackle complications in conventional projects,’’ said Misri.The leaders also agreed to work closely on implementing the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEEC) initiative, stressing its importance for connectivity, sustainable growth and access to clean energy. In this regard, they acknowledged the strategic location of Marseille in the Mediterranean Sea, said the joint statement.The leaders also underlined their common commitment to a free, open, inclusive, secure and peaceful Indo-Pacific region, where France is a resident power. On trilateral cooperation in the region, Misri said the choice of projects will be driven by host countries. “These are demand-driven initiatives and not supply-driven initiatives. And we feel that it is important for us to provide choices to countries, amongst our partners, with regard to development cooperation pathways. And I think India and France have a certain alignment in their thinking about this kind of cooperation,’’ he said.There was focus also on skill development and vocational education as the leaders welcomed the operationalization of the Young Professionals Scheme (YPS), under India-France Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement (MMPA), which is expected to facilitate two way mobility of youth and professionals,France reiterated its firm support for India’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council as Modi and Macron emphasised the urgent need for the reform of the Council. “The two leaders agreed to strengthen conversations on regulation of use of the veto in case of mass atrocities. They held extensive discussions on long-term global challenges and current international developments and agreed to intensify their global and regional engagement, including through multilateral initiatives and institutions,’’ said the joint statement.France joined India in unequivocally condemning all forms of terrorism including, importantly for India, cross-border terrorism and called for the disruption of terrorism financing networks and safe havens. “They further agreed that no country should provide safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist acts. The leaders also called for concerted action against all terrorists, including through designations of individuals affiliated with groups that are listed by the UN Security Council 1267 Sanctions Committee,’’ said the joint statement.","India and France adopted a roadmap for cooperation in AI and concluded 9 other agreements, including 3 to boost civil nuclear cooperation.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained","For a Rs 1 crore loan at current interest rate of 8.75%, the EMI will come down from Rs 84,450 to Rs 82,630. For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315. The cut will take effect from April 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118010397,imgsize-101606,width-400,resizemode-4/118010397.jpg"
'Delhi model' or 'new model' - Will Arvind Kejriwal make course correction in Punjab?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-model-or-new-model-will-arvind-kejriwal-make-course-correction-in-punjab/articleshow/118184891.cms,"NEW DELHI: Will Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann persist with Arvind Kejriwal 's ""Delhi model"" to win a second term or will he explore a ""new model"" to woo voters? AAP's humiliating loss in the just concluded Delhi assembly elections has suddenly put a question mark on Kejriwal's winning strategy which had helped the party rule the national capital for over a decade.On Tuesday, when Kejriwal huddled with Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann and all other Punjab MLAs, the obvious question was: Why meet Punjab MLAs after losing Delhi? Well, answer perhaps lies in the fact that AAP in Punjab has relied heavily on the Delhi model to not just win elections but also govern the state.""We have replicated Delhi Model in Punjab. We discussed how we can take our model to the grassroots,"" AAP Punjab chief Aman Arora said after yesterday's meeting with Kejriwal.Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann also spoke of the party's dependence on Delhi model. ""We are implementing the Delhi model in Punjab as well. Like Mohalla clinics, Aam Aadmi clinics are being built there.... We will make Punjab a model state and present it to the entire country,"" Mann said.Little wonder, Kejriwal was in a huddle with party's Punjab unit and not its Delhi unit which lost 40 seats in the new assembly raising questions on people's choice for the Delhi model.So, for Kejriwal and AAP the biggest question now is why would the people of Punjab accept the Delhi model which has been rejected by the people of Delhi?The Aam Aadmi Party stormed to power in Punjab in 2022 by winning 92 of the total 117 assembly seats. In the process it decimated the Congress, reducing it to just 18 seats and dislodging it from power. The AAP had then showcased its ""Delhi model of development"" to Punjab voters, promising them freebies like free electricity, Rs 1,000 per month for women, better health care facilities and improvement in the education sector.Besides these freebies, the USP of AAP in 2015 was a promise of clean and transparent politics. However, Arvind Kejriwal's second term was overtaken by controversies and charges of corruption against all the key leaders of the party. Kejriwal and all his top ministers were jailed in the excise policy case and are presently out on bail. Then, there was also 10 years of anti-incumbency against the AAP government.The road ahead for AAP in Punjab is not going to be easy. The Congress and the BJP have gone all out against the AAP government in the state. While the Congress would want to avenge its humiliating loss in 2022, the BJP is keen to step in and spread its wings in the state. With Akalis already struggling, the BJP would hope that a weakend AAP makes it BJP vs Congress contest in the state. And we all know, who has the advantage in such a contest.Bhagwant Mann has time to make course corrections as assembly elections in the state are still two years away. But the big question is: Will Arvind Kejriwal explore a new model for Punjab or will he still put all his bets on the ""failed"" Delhi model?","Arvind Kejriwal huddled with Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann and all other Punjab MLAs.

He will be meeting White House incumbent Donald Trump on Thursday evening; less certain is when he will be meeting the temporary resident of EEOB who is now thought to be the most important man in the United States.Elon Musk has been camping out at the EEOB-- which some historians consider the ugliest building in America -- for almost a month since Trump returned to the White House. He is expected to walk across to Blair House at some point to meet a man he has openly expressed admiration for and who in turn has courted him for almost a decade in a tech outreach few Indian PMs have undertaken. On the agenda will be advancing the coming of Musk companies -- Tesla and SpaceX -- into a market that the world's richest man sees as legitimately protected by Modi to safeguard India's interest.Follow live updates: PM Modi wraps up France visit, leaves for key US trip An extraordinary event at the White House on Tuesday showed just why Musk is now considered the most important man in America, as the South Africa-born billionaire with a net worth of almost $ 400 billion held forth in the Oval Office on his work, raging about the stranglehold of the bureaucracy in America, and explaining his efforts to cull the government. Seated behind the Resolute Desk, Trump, who rarely cedes centerstage to anyone, allowed ""President Musk"" -- as some have dubbed the DOGE honcho -- to speak virtually uninterrupted for half an hour.“If the bureaucracy’s in charge, then what meaning does democracy actually have?” Musk asked in an unprecedented rant, accusing US government officials of enriching themselves at the expense of tax payers, as President Trump, seated behind the Resolute Desk, nodded in approval. “Quite a few people” in the bureaucracy had managed to increase their network by millions of dollars, Musk suggesting rampant corruption in the government and calling the bureaucracy an “unelected, fourth, unconstitutional branch of government, which has, in a lot of ways, currently, more power than any elected representative.”“It does not match the will of the people,” Musk, who is himself unelected, said of the bureaucracy, even as courts have stepped in to constrain his efforts to cull the 2.4 million federal work force. Musk called the ruling a ""judicial coup.""The unusual media interaction was made even more remarkable by Musk bringing in his four-year old son, named X, to the meeting, in a move many MAGA supporters found endearing, but which critics, including X's mother and Musk's estranged partner, found irksome. ""He should not be in public like this...But I'm glad he was polite. Sigh."" X's mother, Canadian singer Claire Boucher wrote, after footage of the tete-e-tete surfaced online. While Musk was smearing the federal bureaucracy, X was busy digging his nose and smearing booger on the Resolute Desk.","Elon Musk has been camping out at the EEOB for almost a month since Trump returned to the White House.

Poll Should Defense Deals Be Prioritized Over Other Sectors? No, Economic Growth Matters More Yes, Security Comes First

NEW DELHI: India has formally offered the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems to France at the highest-level, even as it finalises direct acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters from the country and collaboration in construction of three additional Scorpene submarines.During his talks with President Macron, PM Modi invited the French Army to take “a closer look” at the Pinaka, emphasizing that an acquisition of this system by France would be “another milestone” in the bilateral defence ties.India is already exporting the Pinaka to Armenia, while some Asean and African countries have also shown interest in acquiring the system. DRDO has developed a variety of ammunition for the Pinaka, including rockets with 45-km extended range and 75-km guided extended range, and the plan is to further enhance them to 120-km and then to 300-km.The India-France joint statement said both sides also welcomed the ongoing discussions in missiles, helicopter engines and jet engines. A collaboration between French major Safran, which already makes helicopter engines in India, and DRDO to co-develop the 110 Kilonewton jet engine for the Indian fifth-generation stealth fighter project called AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft) is under discussion, as reported by TOI earlier.India’s impending Rs 63,000 crore acquisition of 22 single-seat Rafale-Marine jets and four twin-seat trainers to operate from indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, which is now with the PM-led cabinet committee on security for the final nod, did not find mention in the joint statement.It, however, did refer to the impending Rs 33,500 crore project for construction of three additional diesel-electric Scorpene submarines at the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) in collaboration with the French M/s Naval Group. These three will add to the first six Scorpene or Kalvari-class submarines constructed at MDL for over Rs 23,000 crore.Modi and Macron “commended” the collaboration in construction of Scorpene submarines in India, including indigenization, and in particular the work carried out towards integrating the DRDO-developed air-independent propulsion (AIP) into the Scorpene submarines and the analyses conducted regarding the possible integration of the integrated combat system into the three new boats.Macron also welcomed India’s joining the multi-nation `Eurodrone’ medium-altitude, long-endurance remotely-piloted aircraft programme, which he said is another step forward in the growing strength of our partnership in defence equipment programmes.","India has formally offered the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems to France.

'All of them are some distance away': CDS Anil Chauhan's take on China's sixth-generation fighter aircrafts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-of-them-are-some-distance-away-cds-anil-chauhans-take-on-chinas-sixth-generation-fighter-aircrafts/articleshow/118179831.cms,"China's NEW 6th Gen Fighter Took its First Successful Flight

The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan on Wednesday raised doubts over China's claims about their sixth-generation fighter aircraft, stating that these aircraft are still under development.CDS Chauhan, when questioned about Chinese sixth-generation fighter jet claims, told news agency ANI that while numerous nations are working on sixth-generation programmes, he personally believes all are considerably far from completion. He suggested that nations might be displaying these technologies as part of their tactical approach.""It's very difficult to see these kinds of platforms with six-generation capability. What we are talking about is by external viewing of an aircraft and that too with a few seconds clip which will not give you an idea that this is six generation aircraft. In fact, a large number of countries are pursuing a six-generation program and that's my personal belief that all of them are some distance away. But sometime back we had heard about the capabilities of WS 10 or WS 15 engines which are there on 5th generation aircraft for the Chinese,"" General Chauhan said.""Sometime back, we had also heard about Chinese hiring a number of ex-pilots of the American and the British Air Force. They wanted to refine their drills and their systems, so they just show that they're still in that kind of a development stage. Not only as far as technology is concerned, but also tactics is concerned. So we are there. We have a program for AMCA that's a 5th generation fighter, so that's somewhere down the line. But we are there,"" he added.Additionally, General Chauhan explained his perspective on sixth-generation aircraft, describing it as a platform capable of both manned and unmanned operations .""My understanding of a sixth generation aircraft is that there is no proper globally accepted definition of what a sixth generation aircraft is. Basically, a sixth generation aircraft is a platform which can perform both manned and unmanned teaming. It is kind of an aerial command post which can take control of 2-3 similar kinds of assets, maybe UAVs, maybe drones which are sound drones and then put a combat in a different kind of a manner,"" he said.CDS Chauhan said that such aircraft would incorporate various technologies, including networks, data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance the pilot's decision-making capabilities during combat situations.""So that's the kind of concept of six-generation and it involves number of technologies. It will involve networks, data analytics which will provide that kind of situation awareness to that pilot over there and also command and control of all the assets. He should be able to network himself or spar passage of information through terrestrial or say aerial networks. It will also use artificial intelligence to give him that better decision making ability during combat. It also will have maybe long range smart air-to-air missiles, weapon systems and apart from that stealth technology with self-healing kind of capabilities,"" he concluded.","Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan raised doubts over China's claims about their sixth-generation fighter aircraft.

Official reports said that at least 30 people died and 60 were injured in the January 30 stampede. However, Banerjee claimed the actual numbers were higher.Addressing a press conference after presenting the state budget, Banerjee said, ""So many people died in the Maha Kumbh incident, but they are not releasing the correct death toll. They created such hype around the event, yet there were no proper safety arrangements.""She further alleged that the bodies of Bengal residents who died in the stampede were returned without proper documentation, complicating the compensation process for grieving families.

""Before creating hype, one should ensure proper control,"" she said.The chief minister also aimed at the BJP-led central government, accusing it of ignoring the tragedy. ""No probe panel was sent to investigate the Maha Kumbh stampede. But in Bengal, committees are dispatched immediately after local incidents,"" she said.Banerjee shifted focus to Bengal’s financial struggles, blaming the Centre for withholding funds under key welfare schemes like MGNREGA and Awas Yojana.

JAMMU/HAZARIBAG: Two weddings that were never meant to be. Two soldiers who gave their tomorrows so others could have theirs.In two different homes, one in Jharkhand’s Hazaribag and the other in Samba district of Jammu and Kashmir, families were preparing for April — the month when their sons, both soldiers, would become grooms. The houses were being painted, the invitations were being finalised, and dreams of a new beginning were taking shape. But fate had a cruel twist in store.Captain Karamjit Singh Bakshi , 27, and Naik Mukesh Singh Manhas , 29, were on patrol when terrorists struck near the LoC in Jammu’s Akhnoor sector Tuesday afternoon. An IED blast took them away — two young lives, two unfinished stories, two weddings that would never be.In Hazaribag, Captain Karamjit’s family was caught between anticipation and grief. Just 10 days ago, their son had visited them and broke the news of his engagement to a doctor from Army Medical Corps. April 5 was to be the beginning of his new life.His father Sardar Ajinder Singh Bakshi, a restaurateur, had been overseeing the house repairs. His mother Neelu Bakshi had begun setting aside things for the wedding. Karamjit was their only son.Now, instead of wedding guests, mourners would arrive. Instead of a bride’s entry, a tricolour-draped coffin would return home Thursday night.“He had only been in the Army for five years,” said his uncle Sardar Devinder Singh. “He had so much ahead of him.” Karmajit was attached to Punjab Regimental Centre.Far away in the border village of Bri Kamila in Samba, another family had been preparing for celebration. Naik Mukesh had spent his last holiday putting the final touches on his newly built home — meant for the wife he would bring in April. He had left on Jan 28, his wedding date nearly set for April 20-21.His father Chagatar Singh, a retired policeman, held onto memories of a son who had served more than a decade, braving the icy winds of Siachen, the turmoil of Kashmir, the vigilance of Punjab. “Youngsters in the village looked up to Mukesh,” he said. “He encouraged them to play sports, even gave them cricket and volleyball kits.”Mukesh had joined the Army in 2014 and his younger brother, also in the military, had always looked up to him. Now, the tradition of service in their village had come at an unbearable price.“Almost every home here has sent its son to the armed forces,” said villager Mukhtar Singh. “It has become a tradition.”But some sacrifices are heavier than others. In two households, wedding cards will remain undelivered. The ceremonial turbans will stay folded. The brides, once waiting in anticipation, are now bound to grief.","Captain Karamjit Singh Bakshi, 27, and Naik Mukesh Singh Manhas, 29, were on patrol when terrorists struck near the LoC in Jammu’s Akhnoor sector Tuesday afternoon.

Court warns against political allegations



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday criticised the practice of political parties announcing freebies before elections, questioning whether such handouts were fostering dependency instead of integrating people into the mainstream economy. ""Are we not creating a class of parasites?"" the bench asked while adding that people are ""not willing to work"" because of the freebies.A bench of Justices BR Gavai and Augustine George Masih expressed concerns over the impact of these pre-poll promises, observing that some people were unwilling to work due to free rations and financial aid.""Rather than promoting them to be a part of the mainstream of the society by contributing to the development of the nation, are we not creating a class of parasites?"" Justice Gavai remarked.According to news agency PTI, Gavai further pointed out, ""Unfortunately, because of these freebies, which are declared just on the anvil of elections, like 'Ladki Bahin' and other schemes, people are not willing to work.""The court was hearing a case related to the right to shelter for homeless individuals in urban areas when the issue of election freebies was raised. The bench noted that people were receiving aid without employment and questioned whether a better approach would be to integrate them into the workforce.""We quite appreciate your concern for them, but would it not be better to make them a part of the mainstream of society and permit them to contribute to the development of the nation?"" the bench asked.Meanwhile, advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing one of the petitioners, countered that most people in the country were willing to work if given the opportunity.Justice Gavai, however, responded, ""You must be having only one-sided knowledge. I come from an agricultural family. Because of the freebies in Maharashtra, which they just announced prior to elections, agriculturists are not getting laborers.""While the court refrained from engaging in a broader debate on the issue, it acknowledged that the need for shelter for the homeless was a priority. However, it stressed the importance of balance in welfare policies.""Should it not be balanced?"" the bench asked, emphasizing the need for a structured approach rather than blanket giveaways.Attorney General R Venkataramani informed the court that the Centre was in the process of finalizing an urban poverty alleviation mission, which would include provisions for shelter for the homeless. The court directed him to clarify the time frame for its implementation and to confirm whether the existing National Urban Livelihoods Mission would continue until the new scheme was rolled out.The bench also asked the Centre to gather comprehensive data from all states regarding homeless populations and available shelters to address the issue on a national scale.During the proceedings, one of the petitioners argued that authorities showed more compassion for the wealthy than for the poor. This drew a sharp response from the bench.""Don't make a speech of Ramlila Maidan in this court,"" Justice Gavai said, warning against turning the courtroom into a political battleground. ""And don't make unnecessary allegations. Don't make a political speech here. We won't permit our courtrooms to be converted into a (place of) political battle.""He further challenged the claim that the government was indifferent to the poor, stating, ""How do you say the compassion is shown only for the rich? Even for the government, how can you say this?""Prashant Bhushan presented data indicating that as of December 4, 2024, states and union territories had sanctioned 2,557 shelters, of which 1,995 were operational with a total capacity of 1.16 lakh beds. He also pointed out that Delhi alone had an estimated three lakh urban homeless, while the city's shelter capacity was only 17,000.The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) confirmed that it currently operated 197 shelters with a total capacity of 17,000. However, in the past four years, the highest average occupancy across these shelters had been 5,500.The court directed the Attorney General to verify the accuracy of these figures with the concerned ministry. The case has been scheduled for further hearing in six weeks.In December last year, the apex court had asked states and union territories to submit details on facilities available for homeless individuals, underscoring the need for a long-term solution to urban homelessness.",Justices BR Gavai and Augustine George Masih expressed concerns over the impact of pre-poll promises.

These qualities make them highly desirable for dairy. However, while the breed struggles for attention and preservation in India, countries like Brazil have harnessed its full potential, generating enormous wealth through its fine germplasm.Viatina-19's superior genetic lineage has also earned her the ""Miss South America"" title at the prestigious Cow Champion of the World pageant.She now holds a place in Guinness World Records as the most expensive cow ever sold.

NTA credibility

further

NEW DELHI: A record 12 JEE-Main questions were dropped from the final answer key due to errors, the highest in recent history, raising serious concerns about the National Testing Agency 's ability to conduct a fair and transparent exam of such a large scale.Despite reducing the total number of questions from 90 to 75, the error rate surged to 1.6%, far exceeding historical 0.6% threshold. Adding to the concern is NTA's lack of transparency, with inconsistencies in its claims about the number of dropped questions, raising suspicions of ""under-reporting"" NTA DG P S Kharola did not respond to TOI questions. Education ministry has forwarded a reply from NTA that ignored syllabus discrepancy concerns, deepening scepticism about its accountability.An examination of past answer keys contradicts NTA's claims, revealing multiple instances of error-free papers in previous years. Before 2025, the highest number of dropped questions was six in Session 1 of 2024 and four in Session 2.NTA claimed that six questions were dropped in Session 1 of 2023, 2024 and 2025, but the official answer key for 2025 lists 12 dropped questions. TOI's analysis found five questions were dropped in Session 1 of 2023, while 2022's Session 1 and 2 had four and six dropped questions, respectively. No questions were dropped in the Feb and March 2021 exams. Despite this, the agency defended itself, stating, ""This year's record-low challenge rate and minimal errors reaffirm NTA's commitment to ensuring a fair, transparent, and error-free examination process for engineering aspirants nationwide.""Experts highlight that inconsistencies in language translations further erode trust in the exam process. At least two translation errors were found in the final answer key, causing confusion. Incorrect answers were later marked correct, creating additional discrepancies. Students answering in Hindi and Gujarati had two answer choices, while others had only one, raising concerns about fairness. The inclusion of out-of-syllabus questions further damaged confidence in NTA's reliability.Educators and students have expressed frustration, stating, ""In a prestigious exam like JEE, where students' futures are at stake, such incompetence is unacceptable."" Errors led to confusion, such as a logic gate question from the 22nd Shift 2 paper being dropped after being deemed invalid. Physics questions also contained errors, while translation inconsistencies and marking mistakes persisted.Despite assurances of a well-structured exam, students encountered multiple out-of-syllabus topics.""For example, the Carnot Cycle, removed from the syllabus years ago, appeared unexpectedly in the paper. Likewise, Newton's Law of Cooling, omitted for the past two years, suddenly had 22 related questions. This misalignment between the syllabus and the actual exam content further added to students' distress,"" an educator lamented, adding, ""we expected a better paper this year - one without errors and irrelevant questions. Instead, we got a complete mess.""Students lost valuable time on incorrectly framed questions, with some spending 10-15 minutes struggling with ambiguous problems, affecting performance and rankings. As one student put it, ""It's not just about dropping incorrect questions - it's about the time students wasted on them. That's a huge injustice.""NTA has faced criticism for mismanaging various exams, including last year's NEET-UG and UGC-NET, which were marred by controversies over paper leak allegations and irregularities. Given past failures, expectations were high for improvements in JEE-Main 2025 . However, despite recommendations from the Radhakrishnan Committee categorising JEE-Main as a high-stakes exam, the agency appears to have repeated its mistakes. The committee stated, "" ...It is to be ensured that questions created will have uncontested answers... ""Amid these inconsistencies, JEE-Main faces serious credibility issues due to NTA's continued mismanagement and lack of accountability.","A record 12 JEE-Main questions were dropped from the final answer key due to errors. The error rate surged to 1.6%, far exceeding historical 0.6% threshold.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected the plea of Indrani Mukerjea , an accused in her daughter Sheena Bora murder's case, to travel abroad during pendency of the trial.Expressing doubt whether she will return to the country to face trial, a bench of Justices M M Sundaresh and Rajesh Bindal refused her request to go abroad and directed that the trial be concluded within one year, after which she could seek relief. ""There is no guarantee that you will come back,"" the bench observed.The court had earlier sought response from CBI on Mukerjea's plea to allow her to visit the UK and Spain to activate her bank accounts there and also to change her will after divorce.Mukerjea, a British citizen, alleged that her bank account in Spain had been deactivated and her biometrics were required to get it activated. She approached the apex court through her advocate Sana Raees Khan after Bombay HC quashed the trial court order allowing her to go abroad. She said she needed to get a new Eurobank account to enable her to pay pending taxes and bills in Spain and she was also required to change her will and power of attorney post her divorce.""CBI has realised that there is no case made out against the accused and as such, only with the intention of prolonging the trial, the prosecuting agency has been delaying the trial on one pretext or the other. There is no certainty of the number of witnesses, schedule of witnesses, time of conducting and concluding the trial, so on and so forth. The theory of the prosecution has been established to be nothing but a myth and the agency is completely directionless and clueless, and as such there is no likelihood of an early conclusion of the trial in the near future,"" Mukerjea said in her petition.On July 19, the trial court had allowed Mukerjea's plea to visit the UK and Spain for 10 days. But the order was challenged in Bombay HC which quashed the order on Sept 27, compelling her to approach SC.","Justices M M Sundaresh and Rajesh Bindal refused her request to go abroad.

Can't interpret law in this manner to protect crooks, ED argues in SC

NEW DELHI: Observing that Enforcement Directorate 's attitude should not be to keep an accused in custody, Supreme Court Wednesday granted bail to former bureaucrat Arun Kumar Tripathi despite stiff opposition from the agency, which said ""crooks"" who were damaging the country should not be protected.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan expressed disapproval over ED opposing the bail when the order of the trial court taking cognisance of the offence of money laundering had already been quashed by the high court. It said PMLA was being misused like dowry harassment provisions of IPC Section 498A . ED had arrested Tripathi, an Indian Telecommunications Service officer, on Aug 8, 2024 in a money laundering case connected with the Chhattisgarh liquor scam .Strongly opposing the bail on behalf of ED, additional solicitor general S V Raju said, ""Crooks cannot get away on technical grounds. This is a serious case. Senior bureaucrats are fleecing the country. They are milking the economy and taking money to Dubai and Netherlands. HC did not pass the order on the ground that there was no offence but on a technical ground. Interpretation of law should not be done in such a way to protect crooks.""The bench, however, did not agree. ""The concept of PMLA cannot be to ensure that a person should remain in jail. I tell you frankly, looking at several cases... See what happened in 498A cases, if this is the approach of ED, it is very, very serious,"" the bench told Raju.As the court further raised questions on ED's approach of not taking sanction from the authority concerned despite knowing that it was required, Raju said it could not be said to be the agency's approach but that of an individual officer. Trying to dispel the impression that ED wanted to keep the accused in jail, Raju said HC's order did not mean that there was no offence and that the case against Tripathi had been closed. He told the court that sanction had now been taken.The bench, however, said it could not allow ED to act like this and granted bail to the accused, but asked the trial court to put stringent conditions. It allowed the agency to seek cancellation of bail in case Tripathi did not cooperate in trial proceedings.",Former bureaucrat Arun Kumar Tripathi granted bail by Supreme Court.

Clarity on crypto, agri income in new I-T Bill

NEW DELHI: FM Nirmala Sitharaman is set to move a 622-page Income Tax Bill , with 536 clauses, on Thursday to repeal the current 64-year-old law that runs into 823 pages and has 819 sections. The draft legislation, with simpler language, seeks to do away with ""assessment year"" and sets a definition of "" tax year "" that'll be aligned with financial year.There are no deep structural changes to overhaul existing provisions or a change in deadline for filing. Several experts said the focus is on making the law easier to grasp which will reduce litigation.At several places, the Bill has tables related to TDS provisions, presumptive tax rates and time limit for assessment, aimed at giving clarity. Besides, some formulas have been included. ""Notwithstanding"" has been replaced with ""irrespective of anything"" at several places, tax experts said. Archaic and convoluted language has been largely dropped.While the bill is likely to be referred to a parliamentary panel, the new law is proposed to be implemented from next April, although Sitharaman had said the process of consultation will be followed.""The language is simpler. One excellent change is replacement of the concept of assessment year and previous year with tax year. While innumerable provisos and explanations in the existing Act have been eliminated, various conditions attached to each exemption or deduction continue, but are couched in simpler language,"" said Gautam Nayak of CNK Associates, a Mumbai-based CA firm.The Income Tax Bill will seek to bring all provisions related to areas such as salaries and perquisites together, making it easier for taxpayers to understand.""In the earlier law, there were multiple cross references between sections and rules, which often led to complications for taxpayers. In the new bill, the number of proviso and explanations have been substantially reduced and the references to rules and other sections have been curtailed. This will ensure a taxpayer will be able to gain a sensible understanding of the section by reading the section itself and they do not need to refer to other rules and sections. Further, the old law was amended several times over 60 years and hence, there were ample references to redundant sections, previous dates and years, which have been removed now,"" said Amit Maheshwari, tax partner at consulting firm AKM Global.The bill proposes a taxpayer charter , something that has been rolled out but has failed to provide any firm commitments by the department. It will define crypto assets for the first time, while doing away with definitions such as ""fringe benefit"".Nayak pointed out there is a change in the definition of agricultural income with income derived from saplings or seedlings grown in a nursery also included now, accepting the judicial pronouncements in this regard. ""In quite a few places, the bill clarifies the position better than the existing law - for instance, in stating when a person would be not ordinarily resident in India,"" he added.Maheshwari said the new section mandating that the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) must provide detailed directions, explicitly stating the points of determination, its decision, and the reasons behind it marks a significant shift from the earlier provision, which lacked clarity on the manner of issuing DRP directions. ""DRP orders will now be well-reasoned and adequately explained, ensuring transparency and reducing reliance on past rulings. This will improve quality of dispute resolution.""""The bill's primary objective is to simplify the tax laws, ensuring these are more transparent, easier to interpret and taxpayer friendly. By replacing complex provisions with clearer provisions, it aims to reduce legal disputes and encourage voluntary tax compliance,"" said Rohinton Sidhwa, partner at Deloitte India.","FM Nirmala Sitharaman is set to move a 622-page Income Tax Bill on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: In a big push to Indo-French collaboration on cutting-edge nuclear technology, India and France have agreed to jointly develop a new generation of advanced nuclear reactors as one of the three nuclear agreements signed during PM Narendra Modi ’s visit.The two nations have decided to partner on building advanced modular reactors and small modular reactors (SMRs) for civil use.“PM Modi and President Emmanuel Macron stressed that nuclear energy is an essential part of the energy mix for strengthening energy security and transitioning towards a low-carbon economy ,” an MEA statement said.The three MoUs inked include a Declaration of Intent on establishment of partnership on advanced modular reactors and small modular reactors; renewal of an MoU between department of atomic energy (DAE), India, and CAE, France, concerning cooperation with the Global Center for Nuclear Energy Partnership (GCNEP); and an agreement between DAE and CEA on cooperation between GCNEP, India, and the Institute for Nuclear Science and Technology, France.SMRs typically have a smaller capacity than conventional nuclear reactors and can be manufactured in factories and installed elsewhere. This class of reactors, which can have as much as 300 MW of generating capacity, can be assembled in locations where it’s not feasible to construct larger nuclear facilities. India plans to have at least five SMRs by 2033.The two leaders also acknowledged strong civil nuclear ties and efforts in cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, notably in relation to the Jaitapur nuclear power project.President Macron had earlier mentioned that SMRs are “much safer” and recalled that “always improving safety while reducing costs” remained a priority. At present in France, a small nuclear reactor design called “NUWARD” is under development. This project is supported by the French consortium gathering EDF, CEA, TechnicAtome and Naval Group. This pressurised water reactor (PWR) technology-based solution is intended to meet the growing needs of the low-carbon, safe and competitive electricity market worldwide in the 300-400 MWe power segment.India’s nuclear power generation capacity has grown significantly, nearly doubling from 4,780 MW in 2014 to 8,180 MW in 2024. Union minister for department of atomic energy Jitendra Singh recently said this capacity was projected to triple to 22,480 MW by 2031-32, showcasing India’s commitment to scaling up its nuclear energy infrastructure. At present, nuclear power plants contribute 1.8% of India’s total installed power capacity of 462 GW. This helps save around 41 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.",India and France have agreed to jointly develop a new generation of advanced nuclear reactors.

PM Narendra Modi , accompanied by French President Emmanuel Macron, on Wednesday visited the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project in southern France to witness the development of the Earth’s first “mini Sun” that aims to produce nuclear energy on an industrial scale through the nuclear fusion process.Harnessing the power of nuclear fusion, which powers the Sun and stars, is the goal of ITER as the process is a long-term option for sustainable and non-carbon-emitting energy. India is a key partner in this global programme as it is providing not only 10% of the total cost of the project, but also contributing the biggest component, the refrigerator that houses this unique reactor.ITER is currently under construction at Cadarache and is expected to create its first plasma in the coming years. When it becomes operational, ITER hopes to be the first large-scale fusion reactor to produce more energy than is used to initiate its fusion reaction.During the visit, Modi and Macron appreciated the progress of ITER, including the assembly of the world’s largest Tokamak, a magnetic fusion device where ultimately 500 MW of fusion power will be produced by creating, containing and controlling burning plasma. They also appreciated the dedication of ITER engineers and scientists working on the project, a release stated. This was the first visit by any head of state to ITER.The ITER project was first agreed upon by the US, European Union, Russia, China, India, Japan and South Korea at the Elysée Palace in Paris in 2006. Today, there are 33 countries collaborating on the effort. India is among the seven ITER members contributing to the project over the last two decades. Around 200 Indian scientists and associates, as well as notable industry players such as L&T, Inox India, TCS, TCE, HCL Technologies, among others, are engaged in the ITER project.Thousands of engineers and scientists have contributed to the design of ITER since the idea for an international joint experiment in fusion was first launched in 1985. The ITER members are now engaged in a decades-long collaboration to build and operate the ITER experimental device.ITER will start scientific operation in 2034 and will be able to work on deuterium-deuterium plasmas and with full magnetic energy in 2036 — a delay of three years compared to the original plan. Operation with the relevant fusion fuel deuterium-tritium is scheduled to begin in 2039.",PM Narendra Modi visited the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project in southern France.

No, They’re Mostly Ceremonial Yes, They Reinforce Relations

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM WASHINGTON: Amid wrinkles between India and the US on tariffs and immigration issues, PM Modi will land in a slick and slippery Washington DC on Wednesday, with snow and sleet forecast in the hours before his arrival. Just as well he will be staying at Blair House, the US Presidential guest house right across the road from White House.Six bilateral meetings have been pencilled in from the time Modi arrives in Washington DC on Wednesday evening, culminating in a Trump-Modi meeting in the White House at 4pm Thursday, followed by a private dinner with the US president later in the evening. The two leaders are also expected to talk to the media in the Oval Office either before or after the meeting.Indicative of the sidelining of the legislative wing in what is fast turning out to be an imperial presidency, there is no engagement at US Congress, with sources pointing to the short 36-hour visit as the primary reason for it. The sources also made light of the differences on tariffs and immigration, amid apprehensions about off-the-cuff remarks by Trump, saying larger strategic considerations would trump such issues. PM Modi US Visit Live Updates: PM Modi wraps up France visit, leaves for key US trip Modi is the fourth foreign leader to meet Trump in the White House in less than a month after he took office for a second term, an unprecedented flurry of activity atypical of past US presidents. Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu was the first to visit, followed by Japan's Shigeru Ishiba last week. On Tuesday, Jordan's King Abdullah II rushed to the White House after Trump threatened to cut off aid if Amman didn't accommodate Palestinians from Gaza before its proposed US rebuilding.There are no such exigencies in US-India ties, although there will be pressure on New Delhi on lowering tariffs and buying more US products to bridge the trade deficit between the two countries. The Trump dispensation has also opened a new front that could potentially affect India, with attacks on the Brics group of countries for ostensibly trying to undermine the US dollar as the global reserve currency, a suggestion New Delhi has refuted.","Six bilateral meetings have been pencilled in from the time Modi arrives in Washington DC on Wednesday evening.

Top stock market recommendations : According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Bajaj Finserv , Bharti Airtel and M&M are the top buy and sell stock calls for today. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for February 13, 2025.Nifty has once again taken support from its previous month’s support range of 22650 – 22800 where the index meets its 5 year trendline providing the needed support. After ending for 6 consecutive days in red, the index has now closed above its previous day’s low indicating that this leg's selling pressure might ease for the short term. This ongoing bounce can take the index for a ride to 23300 odd with support seen at 22870 and any dips below 22980 can be looked to add on to long positions.Bank Nifty has been facing profit taking after completing its initial target of 50500 earlier this month. Index has ended in green post it’s 3 day selling streak. A range of 48800 – 49800 now stands developed on the index for this week. While any breakout and closing on either side of this range can allow a further 1000 pt move in similar direction.Unusual buying interest is seen in Bajaj Finserv from the start of this CY wherein the stock is up 14% so far in a matter of 6 weeks compared to a 2-3% downtick on Nifty and Bank Nifty. Stock has given a bullish flag breakout on daily charts. This can allow the ongoing inflow momentum to continue for another 5-7% upside.Bharti Airtel stock has closed at a 3.5 month high showing initial signs of ending its sideways consolidation northwards. A follow up move higher can be seen as the stock has been making higher low formation repeatedly, fresh short covering to commence on sustaining above 1688.LCP: 2987.20SL: 3076TGT: 2851A triple-top formation is visible in M&M, with the stock repeatedly reversing from the supply zone of 3,220 to 3,270 (its 52-week high), failing to provide a decisive close above this level since September 2024. The pattern opens up a potential downside of nearly 5% for the stock where it meets its 200 DMA.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Bajaj Finserv, Bharti Airtel and M&M are the top buy and sell stock calls for today.

Asteroid Hitting Earth: Asteroid 2024 YR4 heading toward Earth: UK scientist warns it might be too late to deflect now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/asteroid-2024-yr4-heading-toward-earth-uk-scientist-warns-it-might-be-too-late-to-deflect-now/articleshow/118188670.cms,"Nasa will be monitoring Asteroid 2024 YR4 which has a slim chance of hitting Earth in 2032.

UK scientist Dr Robin George Andrews , a volcanologist, has warned that it might be now too late to try to deflect ""city killer"" asteroid 2024 YR4 which is coming toward Earth and has a one in 43 chance of striking Earth in 2032. If it does, depending on where the strike lands, there will be catastrophic effects as the asteroid is as tall as the Leaning Tower of Pisa. If it strikes land, it could wipe out cities and if it lands in the ocean, the effects would be minimal.Discovered in December 2024, YR4 currently ranks 3 out of 10 on the Torino Scale. Nasa said it is deploying the James Webb Space Telescope to overserve the asteroid. The asteroid will be at its brightest in March 2025 when the first round of Nasa observations is scheduled. The follow-up will take place in May when YR4 moves away from the Sun. This will be the last opportunity to study it until it returns in 2028.The UK scientist said the DART (the Double Asteroid Redirection Test) was successful in knocking a 580-ft-wide asteroid off course in 2022. But this does not mean that with this process any asteroid can be deflected ""whenever we want"".""The first is that asteroids like Dimorphos, and smaller, tend to be rubble piles: not solid single rocks, but boulders weakly bound by their own gravity. Hitting them just right can produce that debris-like thrust effect, but if you hit them too hard, you'll shatter them,"" he explained.""Nobody wants to accidentally ""disrupt"" an asteroid, because those components can still head for Earth. As I often say, it's like turning a cannonball into a shotgun spray.""""This is chaotic, potentially very destructive—and if DART hit Dimorphos a little harder, it would have broken that asteroid too. You have to be very sure that when you hit an Earthbound asteroid, you are deflecting it, not fragmenting it.""""The second reason DART isn't a silver bullet is that it did not give Dimorphos as much of a deflection as you think. Yes, the orbit shrank a lot. But you know how much Dimorphos actually moved? The change in velocity delivered by the impact was 2.7mm/s,"" the scientist explained.","Asteroid 2024 YR4 has a slim chance of hitting Earth in 2032.

No, it's unnecessary debate Yes, valid points raised

Take a look at the post here



What Dhruv Rathee said about Ranveer Allhabadia’s comments



“I’ve always been strongly against abusive and vulgar language. In the 1000+ videos, shorts and reels that I have made, you won’t find a single abusive word for anyone.

What is being done today in the name of dank comedy is pure nonsense. The only purpose is to shock and disgust audiences for views, which is having a disastrous impact on the moral development of our youth. However, calling for any govt bans for this is not the solution as it may usher in a harsh censorship regime. Instead, we need to pressurize content creators to make better content.

Shows like India’s Got Latent have the same impact on moral decay of society as films like Animal and they need to be called out for it in strong words.”

YouTube removes India’s Got Latent episode after complaint



YouTuber Dhruv Rathee has condemned podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia for making crude remarks on comedian Samay Raina 's show, India's Got Latent . Rathee took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to express his disapproval, arguing that such content, which relies on shock value and offensive humour, negatively impacts young audiences. He also emphasized the importance of responsible content creation and audience accountability, while rejecting government censorship as a solution. This follows Allahbadia's public apology for his inappropriate remarks.In the X post, Rathee wrote: YouTube has removed the episode featuring Allahbadia following directives from the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.The episode was flagged for violating various legal provisions, including the Bhartiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS), the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and the Information Technology (IT) Act.YouTube confirmed the removal after a thorough review, stating that it complies with local laws and its Terms of Service. This comes after Assam Police registered an FIR against Allahbadia and four other influencers for promoting obscenity and engaging in sexually explicit discussions on the show.","YouTuber Dhruv Rathee has condemned podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia for making crude remarks on comedian Samay Raina's show, India's Got Latent.

Competed in National Games only for monetary reward: Jyothi Yarraji,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/athletics/competed-in-national-games-only-for-monetary-reward-jyothi-yarraji/articleshow/118199068.cms,"India's champion hurdler rues lack of financial support, stable state govt job

NEW DELHI: ""I participated at the ongoing National Games for monetary gain. I just wanted to win the cash award declared by the Uttarakhand state govt for medal winners. That was my sole motivation,"" Jyothi Yarraji , India's fastest woman hurdler, the defending Asian champion and Hangzhou Asiad silver medallist, disclosed to TOI.Representing Andhra Pradesh, Jyothi secured gold medals in women's 100m hurdles and 200m — both with fresh meet records — at Ganga athletics ground in Dehradun. For each gold medal won, the 25-year-old from Vizag will receive Rs 5 lakh from the state govt. She also participated in the women's 400m race, but failed to win a medal.Jyothi, who hails from a modest background, indicated that the money she will receive will not only assist her family financially but also partially subsidise her training programme for the forthcoming Asian athletics meet and World Championships – the two key events scheduled this year.""""I won't lie. My only reason to compete here (at the National Games) was money. The event was never part of my athletics calendar and, as you can see, several top athletes skipped the Games to focus on their training abroad for important international championships ahead. When I heard that the Uttarakhand govt was offering cash awards for medals won, I decided to participate. I knew that the field wasn't formidable in both the women's 100m hurdles and 200m events and I stood a good chance to win gold. I have secured better timings than I produced at the Games but I had no other motivation but to earn that money. I am sorry to admit it so candidly but that's the reality of the majority of non-cricket athletes in India,"" Jyothi said.Jyothi has emerged as one of the country's most promising track athletes in recent years. She became the first Indian woman to win a medal (silver) in 100m hurdles at the Asian Games – Hangzhou 2023. In the same year, she secured another first for Indian athletics by pocketing gold at the Asian athletics meet in Bangkok with a timing of 13.08s, before coming up with a silver-medal effort in the women's 200m in the same event, clocking a new personal best of 23.13s. She has rewritten several national and Asian meet records, besides representing the country at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest and Paris Olympics 2024.Jyothi expressed her disappointment at the lack of financial and equipment support from the Andhra govt, which has thus far failed to recognise her achievements.""My father (Suryanarayana) works as a private security guard and earns roughly around Rs 8,000 per month. My elder brother (Suresh) loads goods on vehicles and earns Rs 15,000 per month. My mother (Kumari) used to work as a housekeeping staff in a hotel but has left her job because of ill-health. This combined meagre income of Rs 23,000 isn't sufficient for our family to survive and fund my training as well. None of the govts – be it the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy's govt or the present one headed by N Chandrababu Naidu – have come forward to support me financially despite my achievements. My family lives in a 'kutcha' house and I need money to build a permanent structure for them. The govt neither allotted land to me, nor helped me financially. I wanted a stable state govt job, but there's none. There's only one athletics synthetic track in Andhra. I live in Vizag and there's no synthetic track. This is the precise reason I haven't visited my hometown in years. I stay at Reliance Foundation's high-performance centre in Odisha to continue my training. I am employed with Indian Railways as a junior clerk and get paid Rs 20,000 per month. I deserve something better. My salary is spent on meeting my personal needs, leaving me with nothing in hand. My fellow athletes from other states are receiving substantial funding from their respective govts and are better remunerated by their PSU and private employers,"" she rued.Jyothi was part of the central govt-run Target Olympics Podium Scheme (TOPS) for the Paris Games cycle (2021-2024) and received an out-of-pocket allowance of Rs 50,000 per month. But, for this ongoing Olympics cycle of four years – 2024 till Los Angeles 2028 – the govt is yet to finalise the list of selected athletes in the core group. ""It's been six months since the Paris Games and the govt hasn't come out with the TOPS list. All our training and competition proposals are lying with the Sports Authority of India (SAI) pending approval. I don't know whether I would be part of the fresh list of TOPS athletes or not. This lack of financial support is certainly hampering my training,"" she said.","Jyothi Yarraji won gold in women's 100m hurdles and 200m at the National Games in Dehradun. The 25-year-old from Vizag will receive Rs 5 lakh from the Uttarakhand state govt for each gold medal won.
