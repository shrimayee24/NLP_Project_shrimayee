NEW DELHI: India on Thursday successfully conducted a test launch of the intermediate-range Agni-Prime missile from a rail-based mobile launcher system. This marks the first time such a launch has been carried out using a specially designed platform integrated with the national railway network.Defence minister Rajnath Singh confirmed the successful test in a statement on X, calling it a ""first-of-its-kind launch"" that demonstrates India’s growing strategic deterrence capabilities.“The first-of-its-kind launch carried out today from a specially designed rail-based Mobile Launcher has the capability to move on the Rail network without any preconditions, which allows users to have cross-country mobility and launch within a short reaction time with reduced visibility,” he said.""Congratulations to DRDO , Strategic Forces Command (SFC) and the Armed Forces on the successful test of the Intermediate Range Agni-Prime missile. This successful flight test has put India in the group of select nations having capabilities that have developed a canisterised launch system from a mobile rail network,"" the post added.The Agni-Prime, a next-generation ballistic missile is capable of striking targets at ranges of up to 2,000 kilometers.The test follows the successful launch of the missile in August at Chandipur, Odisha.In March 2024, a trial of Agni-5 was conducted under ‘Mission Divyastra’, showcasing MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle) capability.A MIRV-equipped missile can carry 3–4 nuclear warheads, each aimed at different targets. Currently, the SFC, formed in 2003, operates only single-warhead missiles. The solid-fuelled, three-stage Agni-5 is canister-launched, allowing rapid deployment.","The Agni-Prime, a next-generation ballistic missile is capable of striking targets at ranges of up to 2,000 kilometers.

Yes, that’s necessary No, it might harm local industries

KUALA LUMPUR: Amidst an unsettling global scenario, India is panning its economic heft to resolve the Asean trade disputes. The Asean bloc, after a rather lackluster round of AITIGA (Asean India Trade in Goods Agreement) review in Delhi last month, has offered a new package that will create a ""landing zone"" for India to address the widening trade imbalance concerns. India's trade deficit with Asean stood at approximately $43.57 billion in FY 2022-23.Talking to TOI, Mastura Ahmad Mustafa, deputy secretary general (trade), ministry of investment, trade and industry, Malaysia, said, ""We convened special AEM (Asean Economic Ministers) meetings subsequent to our discussions at the Delhi AITIGA review, to reach key decisions that will help us achieve a substantial conclusion of the review process before this year ends. We have offered a new package to India, a landing zone, which will provide a constructive basis to progress our talks. """"We are encouraged by the positive feedback we have received from India, on the package and we look forward to build on this momentum to deliver meaningful outcomes for both sides,"" she further added. Currently, Malaysia is hosting the 57th AEM & Related Meetings, and the Indian delegation led by minister of state for commerce & industry, Jitin Prasada, has already arrived in Kuala Lumpur for the meetings.Mastura declined to give details of the 'package'. Sources, however, pointed out specifics are being refined and the proposals are designed not merely to address current trade frictions but to harness the vast untapped potential of economic ties.Some of the proposals that could find its way into the final framework would likely be on joint ventures in high-potential sectors like electronics and pharmaceuticals etc.","The Asean bloc, after a rather lackluster round of AITIGA (Asean India Trade in Goods Agreement) review in Delhi last month, has offered a new package that will create a ""landing zone"" for India to address the widening trade imbalance concerns.

Portuguese-era case resolved by Supreme Court 78 yrs after Independence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/portuguese-era-case-resolved-by-supreme-court-78-yrs-after-independence/articleshow/124102488.cms,"Poll Does the Supreme Court's ruling create a precedent for other colonial claims in India? Yes, it opens the door for more cases No, each case should be treated individually

NEW DELHI: After half a century and several rounds of litigation, Supreme Court approved on Wednesday an April 30, 1974, decision of the collector of Dadra and Nagar Haveli to rescind the erstwhile Portuguese govt’s grant of possession rights over land to Indians for cultivation.What rankled a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and N K Singh was that even after 78 years of Independence the highest court is engaged in resolving disputes relating to rights conferred by colonial powers, which exploited India’s wealth and resources.Dadra and Nagar Haveli was liberated from Portuguese occupation in 1954 and was integrated with India in 1961 as a Union Territory.Certain persons were granted inheritable possession rights over vast tracts of land in Dadra and Nagar Haveli by Portuguese govt for an indefinite period, subject to payment of annual rent. Over a century, these landowners’ progeny have divided these lands between them.Indian govt in 1969 rescinded the lands allotted by Portuguese govt and reverted these to administration. These were challenged before Bombay HC.During pendency, D&N Land Reforms Regulation, 1971, was brought in, which stipulated that land allotted by Portuguese govt to persons should have been cultivated regularly.The collector found the land uncultivated and took back the land by an order of April 30, 1974.This was challenged in the trial court by heirs of people who were given possession of land. Trial court quashed the collector’s order in June 1978.Govt appealed against this in HC, which ruled that a 1963 ruling of Lisbon court on rights of such allottees cannot serve as a precedent for Indian courts and govt, in exercise of its sovereign powers, can exercise its powers to resume land allotted by an erstwhile colonial govt.Dismissing appeals against the hcourt’s decision and writing a 79-page judgment, Justice Kant said, “The appellants’ pleas of waiver, acquiescence, delay, impossibility, and condonation have no legal or factual basis, and none of these principles render the Collector’s order, dated April 30, 1974, unsustainable.”“The Collector’s order was not tainted by mala fides and cannot be construed as having been passed with the intent to disentitle the appellants from the statutory benefits under the 1971 Land Reforms Regulation,” the bench said.","Dadra and Nagar Haveli was liberated from Portuguese occupation in 1954.

In a sweeping immigration update, the United Arab Emirates has reportedly halted the issuance of tourist and work visas temporarily for citizens of nine countries spanning Africa and Asia. Though no official confirmation has been publicly released, an internal immigration circular signals a significant policy shift — one with far-reaching economic, diplomatic, and humanitarian consequences. The 2026 UAE visa ban reflects evolving concerns over security, health, and migration governance.According to a confidential immigration circular accessed by multiple outlets, the UAE has imposed a temporary suspension on new visa applications from the following countries:Citizens of these nine nations are barred from applying for both tourist visas and work permits in the UAE as of 2026. The policy remains in effect until further notice, with no announced timeline for reassessment or reversal.It's important to emphasize that this is a visa ban, not a comprehensive travel ban. Nationals of the listed countries who already hold valid UAE visas are not affected and can continue residing or working without issue in the UAE legally.While the UAE government has not released an official explanation, sources and analysts have pointed to several contributing factors behind this decision:The most cited rationale in unofficial reports is national security. The UAE has previously enacted similar measures in response to concerns about:The suspension is described by insiders as a preventive measure to shield the country from potential risks associated with fraudulent or unverified entries.Tense or complex bilateral relations between the UAE and some of the affected nations may also be influencing the visa policy. Past instances suggest that immigration policies are sometimes used to manage or reflect broader diplomatic positions.Residual COVID-19 protocols appear to remain part of the UAE’s visa review process. The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in cross-border health management. Analysts point to concerns over:These health considerations may continue to shape immigration policy well into the post-pandemic era.The visa freeze also closely aligns with broader efforts to streamline documentation, improve identity verification measures, and fully digitize the visa process. The UAE is reportedly working diligently to overhaul its immigration systems to significantly reduce paperwork inconsistencies and identity fraud.The UAE’s visa ban has triggered a chain reaction across multiple sectors:Though indefinite, the UAE visa ban is not permanent. Once lifted, nationals from the listed countries will regain access to the UAE visa application process via:The standard visa requirements will then apply, including:Authorities and businesses across affected countries are awaiting further clarification from the UAE.

MUMBAI: A private jet carrying passengers from Ahmedabad quietly scripted aviation history this weekend, becoming the first aircraft to officially land at the long-awaited Navi Mumbai airport.The jet, operating under a Non-Scheduled Operator Permit (charter), touched down at 10:20am on Saturday and flew back to Ahmedabad past noon the next day, completing the first-ever runway operation at the greenfield airport.Though an IndiGo Airbus 320 aircraft landed on the Navi Mumbai main runway 26 in Dec 2024, it was a validation flight mandated to test the airport's navigation systems.Prior to this, a symbolic touchdown took place in October, when an IAF Airbus C-295, a tactical airlifter, touched down on the main runway without using the airport's ground-based navigation aids.""The Airports Authority of India (AAI) on September 19 granted approval for the landing of a non-scheduled aircraft, marked 'passengers flight' at Navi Mumbai,"" said a source.To accommodate this arrival and departure, AAI cancelled its earlier notice (NOTAM to pilots, airlines) about Navi Mumbai runway's closure till 11:59pm, Sept 20.A new NOTAM was issued on Friday, which announced that the Navi Mumbai airport runway was open from 8:30am to 11am on Saturday and another three hours on Sunday.The private jet, a Pilatus PC-24 (VT-APV), took off from Ahmedabad at 9am to head south, overfly the Gulf of Khambhat, and then the Arabian Sea, from where it turned east to cross into Mumbai over Bandra and Sion, flying south of the busy city airport.It came south of the new Navi Mumbai airport, from where it turned north and then west to carry out an approach on runway 28 and land at 10:20 am. It departed Navi Mumbai airport at 12:40am on Sunday and took the land route to Ahmedabad.Over the weekend, the flight also landed on X, with @hiravaero posting a clip of the landing captured by Sandeep Pilania, a plane spotter. Industry experts pointed out that the new Navi Mumbai airport has other firsts still to come. The most awaited among these will be the first scheduled commercial airline flight.While PM Modi is set to inaugurate the airport and its terminal building on September 30, the commissioning of the airport, after the security sweeping and other procedures, is likely to take a few more months.But the landing or take-off of the first airline flight carrying fare-paying passengers will be the most significant milestone, as it would signal the start of a major capacity boost for Mumbai's overstretched airport infrastructure.","The jet, operating under a Non-Scheduled Operator Permit (charter), touched down at 10:20am on Saturday and flew back to Ahmedabad past noon the next day.

India–Canada Relations Set For Reset; Modi And Carney Seek To Mend Broken Ties | G7 Summit

NEW DELHI: After PM Narendra Modi’s meeting with counterpart Mark Carney in June this year, India and Canada seem set take another decisive step forward to normalise the relationship in the form of a likely visit next month to New Delhi by Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand.This will be the first bilateral visit by the foreign minister of either country since ties nosedived in 2023, following claims by Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau that the Indian government had a role in the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil. Both sides remain in touch to finalise the dates for the visit in October.The breakthrough in Modi-Carney meeting on the margins of the G7 summit in Canada led to the return of the high commissioners to each other’s capital earlier this month. High-level bilateral exchanges also seem to have resumed with Canadian National Security and Intelligence Adviser (NSIA) Nathalie Drouin and deputy foreign minister David Morrison visiting India in September.India and Canada have appointed veteran diplomats, Dinesh Patnaik and Christopher Cooter respectively, as high commissioners. According to Anand, Canada backs step-by-step approach to deepening diplomatic engagement and advancing bilateral cooperation with India.India is seeking a constructive and balanced relationship based on respect for each other’s concerns and sensitivities.India’s foreign ministry and Global Affairs Canada in talks last week reaffirmed the importance of India–Canada ties, anchored in “shared democratic values, respect for the rule of law, and commitment to the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity”. They also agreed to resume bilateral dialogue across key sectors like trade, defence, energy, civil nuclear, security, law enforcement and critical minerals. Amid global uncertainties that have been exacerbated by the US tariff policy, both sides seem keen to expand their economic partnership and build upon people-to-people contacts.Significantly, India and Canada have also agreed to address the shortage of diplomatic staff at their respective missions that resulted from expulsion of diplomats by both sides amid rising tensions last year over Nijjar’s murder. This is important for restoring diplomatic services in both countries for ordinary citizens, students and businesses. In Drouin’s meeting with counterpart Ajit Doval, according to an Indian readout, both sides had acknowledged the “clear momentum” for rebuilding trust and expanding cooperation at the highest levels of political leadership.",India and Canada seem set take another decisive step forward to normalise the relationship in the form of a likely visit next month to New Delhi by Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand.

"No data to contrary, lower age of consent, says amicus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-data-to-contrary-lower-age-of-consent-says-amicus/articleshow/124099789.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: With Supreme Court scheduling day-to-day final hearing from November 12 on petitions seeking lowering of age of consent from 18 to 16 years, amicus curiae and senior advocate Indira Jaising said on Wednesday adolescents, who are attaining puberty sooner than ever, can give mature consent for sexual relationships.With a host of interveners supporting Center's stand against lowering age of consent, Jaising told a bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria that in the present age and time, adolescents increasingly getting sexually aware is part and parcel of natural attraction between sexes leading to development of sexual relationships of choice.The amicus argued that there is no empirical data or research to indicate that persons aged between 16 and 18 are incapable of making mature decisions in relation to their sexual preferences and activities. On the contrary, global trends indicate that decisions in relation to sexual activity can be made from the age of 16.She said decriminalising consensual sexual activity between adolescents in the age bracket of 16-18 years along with focus on sexual education will ensure non-abusive and non-exploitative sexual relationships.""It will also lower cases that every HC in this country has to grapple with, where romantic relationships have been criminalised, leading to incarceration of young adolescent couples, which was never the intention of the statute,"" Jaising said.However, as many as seven interveners, including Dr Ambedkar Jankalyan Samiti and Centre for Social Development, argued that reducing the age of consent would be misused to manipulate young children and take the crime out of Pocso Act, which was enacted to protect them against sexual exploitation. It may also lead to child marriages, they feared.Jaising said criminalising such consensual sexual relationships would force teenagers to get married to avoid prosecution. Citing National Health and Family Survey-5, she said 45% teenage girls in the age group of 15-19 had sexual intercourse.Dr Ambedkar Jankalyan Samiti apprehended that lowering age of consent will also lead to increasing offences of illegal religious conversion and marriage through mala fide inducement. The Samiti and CSD argued that the age of consent and its genuineness can be decided by courts on a case to case basis without giving blanket immunity from Pocso Act.","Supreme Court scheduling day-to-day final hearing from November 12 on petitions seeking lowering of age of consent from 18 to 16 years.

NEW DELHI: The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) has written a letter to the Ministry of Civil Aviation demanding a judicial probe into the June 12 crash of Air India Flight AI 171, alleging that the officials are prematurely pushing a ""pilot error"" narrative.In its letter to the civil aviation minister, dated September 22, the FIP said the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) had ""fundamentally and irrevocably compromised the integrity, impartiality, and legality of the ongoing investigation.""The FIP alleged that the AAIB's conduct has ""moved beyond mere procedural irregularity into the realm of manifest bias and unlawful action. This has rendered the current investigation untenable, and its potential findings are likely to affect the morale of the pilots.""The federation alleged that AAIB officials visited the residence of Capt. Sabharwal’s 91-year-old father on August 30 “under the pretext of offering condolences” but instead made “damaging insinuations”.""During this interaction, these officials made damaging 'insinuations' based on a 'selective CVR interpretation and a so-called 'layered voice analysis,' suggesting that Capt. Sabharwal had deliberately moved the fuel control switches to the CUTOFF position post-take-off,"" the pilot body added.Calling the move “professionally indefensible,” the FIP accused AAIB of breaching rules by leaking protected CVR details to the media. Under Rule 17(5) of the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017, disclosure of cockpit voice recordings is strictly prohibited.The leaks, FIP said, had led to the “character assassination of a decorated professional” with a three-decade career and over 15,000 flying hours.The pilots’ body further stressed that accident probes are meant to prevent future tragedies, not apportion blame, as per Rule 3 of the 2017 Rules.The letter said the probe ""contravenes the spirit and letter of ICAO Annex 13, which obligates member states to conduct independent and impartial investigations.”FIP argued that the flawed handling of the AI 171 probe risks damaging India’s credibility in the global aviation community.Urging immediate intervention, the federation added, ""The FIP submits that the circumstances surrounding the AI 171 investigation make the constitution of a Court of Inquiry not merely 'expedient,' but an absolute and urgent necessity.""Drawing parallels with the 2010 Mangalore crash of Air India Express Flight 812—where a Court of Inquiry was set up—the federation said the present case, with even greater loss of life, warranted no less.It has urged the government to constitute a Court of Inquiry led by a retired Supreme Court judge, supported by independent experts in flight operations, aircraft maintenance, avionics, and human factors.""The Federation of Indian Pilots, and the entire professional pilot community it represents, has a solemn and non-negotiable duty to the victims of Flight AI 171, to their grieving families, and to the future safety of the travelling public,"" the letter concluded.","The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) has written a letter to the Ministry of Civil Aviation demanding a judicial probe into the June 12 crash of Air India Flight AI 171.

A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh issued notice to Centre and the director general of civil aviation (DGCA) on a plea seeking an independent, fair and expeditious probe.The bench examined the July 12 preliminary report, which suggested lapses on the part of pilots in the Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI171.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who is representing the aviation safety NGO, Safety Matters Foundation led by Captain Amit Singh (FRAeS), contended that three members of the probe panel were from the aviation regulator, raising potential conflict-of-interest concerns.He also urged the court to order the release of the flight data recorder (FDR) information to clarify the cause of the accident.The plea highlighted that AAIB's preliminary report attributed the accident to the fuel cutoff switches being moved from ""run"" to ""cutoff,"" effectively implying pilot error.The plea also alleged that the report withholds critical information, including the full Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) output, complete Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) transcripts with time stamps and Electronic Aircraft Fault Recording (EAFR) data.The Apex Court highlighted concerns over confidentiality, privacy, and dignity, while recognizing the necessity for a final report. It cautioned that disclosing certain details could be misused by competing airlines, but emphasized that its notices were solely aimed at ensuring a fair, independent, and impartial investigation.","The Supreme Court on Monday raised serious concerns over the AAIB preliminary report on the June 12 Air India Crash.

CDS Anil Chauhan Reveals Big Operation Sindoor Secret, Reveals Why Army Struck Terror Camps at 1am

NEW DELHI: A little over four months after India conducted deep precision strikes against Pakistan under Operation Sindoor , the govt has approved General Anil Chauhan’s extension of service as the Chief of Defence Staff and secretary of the Department of Military Affairs till May 30 next year when he turns 65.Gen Chauhan, who was commissioned in the 11 Gorkha Rifles in 1981, was appointed the country’s second CDS in Sept 2022 after his predecessor, Gen Bipin Rawat, died in a helicopter crash in Dec 2021.The appointments committee of the cabinet on Wednesday approved the extension of Gen Chauhan, who was the military advisor to national security advisor Ajit Doval before becoming the CDS, till May 2026 “or until further orders, whichever is earlier”.The move was expected since a CDS can serve till 65, unlike the Army, Navy and IAF chiefs who serve till 62 or for three years, whichever is earlier. Moreover, the CDS’ main charter of spearheading the creation of integrated theatre commands (ITCs) to ensure a cost-effective and unified war-fighting machinery remains unfinished.The Modi govt has been pushing for the long-pending creation of the ITCs, in what will be the most radical military reorganization envisaged since Independence.Even the BJP manifesto in the run-up to the 2024 general elections had also promised to “establish military theatre commands for more efficient operations” after creating the CDS post in December 2019.While Gen Chauhan has been working towards bringing in some much-needed synergy among the Army, Navy and IAF in operations, logistics, plans and doctrines as well as inter-service prioritization of capital arms procurements, the progress on ITCs has been very slow.India currently has 17 single-service commands (Army 7, IAF 7 and Navy 3), which do not have the requisite synergy in planning, logistics and operations. The plan is to have two “adversary-specific” ITCs -- one for the northern borders with China at Lucknow and the other for the western front with Pakistan at Jaipur. The Maritime Theatre Command at Thiruvananthapuram, in turn, will be for the Indian Ocean Region as well as the larger Indo-Pacific, as reported by TOI earlier.","General Anil Chauhan was appointed the country’s second CDS in Sept 2022 after his predecessor, Gen Bipin Rawat, died in a helicopter crash in Dec 2021.

NEW DELHI: In a strong message to state regulatory bodies to act responsibly while dealing with complaints against advocates, SC Wednesday imposed a cost of Rs 50,000 each in two cases on Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa (BCMG) for entertaining frivolous complaints against two lawyers and ordering inquiries.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said that as per the law the bar councils concerned must record reasons for its prima facie belief that an advocate has committed misconduct requiring reference of the complaint to the disciplinary committee.It found that in both cases, references of complaints to DC were preceded by 'cryptic & laconic' orders without recording any satisfaction to the effect that the advocates committed misconduct.Interfaith marriage on the basis of fake conversion certificates is illegal, ruled Allahabad HC, adding such marriages could only be registered under Special Marriage Act, reports Rajesh Kumar Pandey. In the case, the petitioner, and a Hindu woman, sought orders directing respondents not to interfere in their marital life.

BENGALURU: Karnataka HC dismissed Wednesday a petition from Elon Musk's X Corp against content takedowns, ruling that American free speech standards can't be transplanted into Indian constitutional thought and no global platform can evade the nation's laws. It said social media is ""a modern amphitheatre of ideas"" that cannot be left to ""anarchic freedom"".""Regulation is a must, more so in cases of offences against women, failing which the right to dignity as ordained in the Constitution gets railroaded,"" Justice M Nagaprasanna said.

A file noting acquired using RTI shows the draft amendment was approved in 2023. However, the file hasn't moved since then.The health ministry told Parliament in Aug - in response to an MP's query asking if there was ""bias in favour of doctors"" in NMC - that the mechanism to handle complaints was provided in clause 8.8 of Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.

Poll Which factor do you think is the most critical in maintaining IAF's combat readiness? Timely delivery of fighter jets Successful weapon trials and testing

NEW DELHI: The largest-ever contract worth Rs 66,500 crore for 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters is now all set to be inked with Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), though the IAF is yet to get even the first such `improved’ jet of the 83 ordered earlier for Rs 46,898 crore in Feb 2021.The mega 97-jet contract for the fourth-generation Tejas could be inked as early as Thursday, a day ahead of the retirement of 36 old MiG-21s that will drag down the IAF to its all-time low of 29 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets), defence sources told TOI.Pakistan, in contrast, is cruising close behind with 25 fighter squadrons, and will get at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation Chinese stealth jets in the near future. China, of course, is leagues ahead, with more than four times the number of fighters, bombers and force-multipliers as compared to India.After Operation Sindoor, which saw Pakistan use Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles with ranges over 200-km, an IAF internal assessment has held it will need far more than even its “authorized” 42.5 fighter squadrons to tackle the collusive and fused threat from its adversaries.The IAF has repeatedly set the alarm bells ringing over the excruciatingly slow development saga of the single-engine Tejas fighters, stressing that operational preparedness cannot be sacrificed at the altar of `atmanirbharta’ (self-reliance) endlessly. Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself said IAF is “very badly off in numbers” and needs to induct at least 40 fighters every year to stay combat ready.All the 83 Tejas Mark-1A jets under the 2021 contract were to be delivered in the Feb 2024-Feb 2028 timeframe. The PM-led cabinet committee on security approved the acquisition of another 97 such jets on Aug 19 this year.“The IAF was insistent the new contract should not be inked before deliveries of the earlier 83 jets begin, with HAL being held accountable. The defence ministry, however, must spend its budget within specified timelines…the initial payment will go to HAL once the contract is signed,” a source said.HAL, on its part, contends it will be able to deliver the first two of the 83 Tejas jets in Oct. Deliveries of the 99 GE-F404 turbofan engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, now appear to be stabilizing, an official said.GE has delivered three engines till now, with another seven slated by Dec. Thereafter, GE is expected to deliver 20 engines every year. For the 97-jet deal, HAL will ink another deal with GE for 113 more such engines for $1 billion, as earlier reported by TOI.The IAF, however, wants to accept the first two fighters only if the ongoing firing trials of Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs from them are successfully completed and properly certified.“The weapon trials and integration with the Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system will take time. I don’t see the delivery happening before year-end unless IAF is forced to accept the fighters without certification,” a senior officer said.HAL has promised to progressively scale up production to 20 Tejas per year, and then to 24-30 per year, with the third production line now fully functional in Nashik to add to the two existing ones at Bengaluru, apart from private sector supply chains","The mega 97-jet contract for the fourth-generation Tejas could be inked as early as Thursday.

Vessels costing less than Rs 100 crore will receive 15% assistance, those over Rs 100 crore 20%, and green or hybrid vessels 25%. At least 30% domestic value addition is required to avail benefits.

Parle-G, after two decades of selling its smallest biscuit pack at Rs 5, has now priced it at Rs 4.45.Other everyday items are also shifting- the Rs 1 candy now costs 88 paise, while a Rs 2 shampoo sachet is priced at Rs 1.77.The changes come as FMCG makers await clarity on how to pass on benefits under the next-generation GST reforms, which come into effect from Monday.The new GST structure, first announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduces tax slabs to two broad rates – 5% and 18% – and moves many food items to the NIL or 0% tax bracket.Ahead of the reforms taking effect, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Sunday, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect. In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival.Companies said they are waiting for government clarity on whether increasing product weight at the same price can be treated as a price cut under the new GST regime.“There will be an initial impact, but we expect consumers to either use UPI (Unified Payments Interface) for exact payments or opt for larger or multiple packs to round off the difference,” said Mayank Shah, vice president at Parle Products, as quoted by ET.“We are still awaiting clarity and hope to be allowed to pass on the tax cut through grammage increases” he added.Mondelez India, the country’s biggest confectionery maker, has moved all its products to nonstandard price tags.Bournvita now sells for Rs 26.69 instead of Rs 30, Oreo cookies at Rs 8.90 instead of Rs 10, and Gems and 5Star at Rs 17.80 instead of Rs 20.The company said the new maximum retail prices include GST benefits and distributors must pass them on to consumers.For decades, FMCG brands kept Rs 5, Rs 10, and Rs 20 packs as “magic price points” by reducing pack sizes during inflation. But with regulatory ambiguity, companies may move away from these low-cost packs temporarily.“The inconvenience of something in between magic price points is just too much for the larger industry,” said Prashant Peres, managing director at Kellanova India and South Asia.“So, in the short term, there will be some slashing of prices that we will do, or many others will do, because we just can't turn around the supply chain fast enough. But in the long term, it will be grammage, and we will go to those price points,” added Peres, as cited by ET.Despite the changes, small affordable packs remain vital for the industry. They contribute 79% of shampoo sales, 64% in biscuits, 58% in chocolates, 44% in salty snacks, and 29% in toothpaste.“At present, for all our existing stock, we have reduced the prices by 13% to establish a clear calculation that we have passed on all the benefits,” said Sushil Kumar Bajpai, president at RSPL Group, which makes Ghadi detergent and Venus soap. “Hence, all the price tags will reflect obscure numbers and the challenge is now to see how we can take a different and more simplified approach on newer stocks.”","Mondelez India, the country’s biggest confectionery maker, has moved all its products to nonstandard price tags. Bournvita now sells for Rs 26.69 instead of Rs 30, Oreo cookies at £8.90 instead of £10, and Gems and 5Star at Rs 17.80 instead of 20.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124061131,imgsize-988276,width-400,resizemode-4/1-45.jpg"

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

In the firing line

Silver lining for laid off tech workers with H-1B visas





Donald Trump’s H-1B visa fee hike may turn out to be a blessing in disguise for techies who have recently been laid off by firms like Oracle, Intel, Microsoft, and AWS. The recent H-1B visa fee hike to $100,000 for new applicants could encourage employers to consider recruiting H-1B holders who have recently been laid off.Since the start of 2025, 533 rounds of layoffs at technology firms have affected 144,926 individuals, according to data from monitoring platform Trueup reported by ET. The platform's data indicates that 2024 saw 1,115 rounds of staff reductions at tech organisations, impacting 238,461 professionals.Individuals on H-1B visas who face layoffs whilst holding an active visa status have a 60-day window to secure alternative employment or depart from the United States.""Some of the ones laid off might be getting a call back,"" said Navneet S Chugh, attorney at US-based immigration law firm Chugh LLC, whilst noting that current H-1B visa workers, renewals, re-entries and employer transfers remain exempt from this fee, as clarified by the White House on Sunday.""For employers that act quickly and navigate compliance effectively, recently laid-off H-1B professionals represent a ready-to-deploy talent pool,"" Sachin Alug, CEO of recruitment company NLB Services, told ET.""Because they already hold H-1B status, they can often transition through a transfer petition without re-entering the lottery, making them highly attractive in terms of speed and cost efficiency. ""Also Read | After $100,000 fee, Trump administration looks to abandon lottery system for H-1B visas; here’s the proposed new selection criteria A product manager in Mountain View, California, whose employment at a consulting organisation ended on September 8, was quoted as saying, ""The moment I heard the news, I thought my days in the US were officially over. But after the clarification, there is a renewed hope. I am aggressively applying and expecting recruitment calls over the next week.""According to Sanketh Chengappa KG, director and business head-professional staffing at Adecco India, many affected professionals might receive opportunities for rehiring or attractive offers from alternative organisations, creating a select pool of readily available talent for crucial positions, particularly in technology, engineering and strategic digital sectors.Major US corporations including Amazon, Meta, and Google are anticipated to benefit primarily from the H-1B visa modifications, as they possess the financial capacity to accommodate increased fees for skilled professionals, according to immigration specialists. The $100,000 fee corresponds to the annual compensation of a standard employee recruited through this programme, they indicated.""The impact on companies remains uncertain at this stage,"" remarked Debarghya Das, partner at US-based Menlo Ventures. ""The expectation is that IT services organisations and employers offering lower wages will bear the brunt, accounting for approximately 40-60% of all H-1B applications.""Also Read | Trump’s H-1B visa fee hike to backfire? Wall Street banks set to rely more on Indian GCCs; may deepen presence in India Technology corporations typically maintain a modest H-1B workforce, with under 15% of staff on these visas, and most applications from major tech firms being renewals, Das noted, adding,""Microsoft, for example, had less than 2,000 net new H-1B last year, which is $200 million in fees, a 0.6% increase in annual R&D (research and development) spend of $30 billion for the company. This may not be enough for them to significantly reduce H-1B hiring.""","Donald Trump’s H-1B visa fee hike may turn out to be a blessing in disguise for techies who have recently been laid off by firms like Oracle, Intel, Microsoft, and AWS.

Slower tax refunds after ITR filing?

ITR filing : What false exemptions claims are being scrutinized?





ITR filing FY 2024-25: Wondering why your income tax refunds for AY 2025-26 are taking a little longer this year? The Income Tax Department is cracking down on false tax exemptions being claimed by people in their Income Tax Returns. Most of these exemptions, under the old income tax regime, are for individuals who earn over Rs 20 lakh.The tax authorities have identified many instances of false exemption claims submitted by taxpayers, leading to enhanced risk evaluation procedures at the Central Processing Centre to stop incorrect refund disbursements, according to an ET report.The tax authority has implemented computerised verification systems to examine taxpayers previously identified for filing inflated claims. The department has enhanced its utilisation of sophisticated data analysis and AI technologies to detect inconsistencies in income declarations by individuals.The fraudulent exemption claims comprise fabricated medical expenses and fictitious donations to political and religious entities, with a significant portion of these claims originating from taxpayers who opted for the old tax structure.Sources knowledgeable about the matter told ET that the attempted tax avoidance through these deceptive practices amounts to approximately ₹700 crore.The processing of refunds might experience delays, particularly for claims exceeding Rs 10 lakh, according to these sources.""During the verification process, we detected that many taxpayers, mostly with income above Rs 20 lakh, were claiming wrongful refunds through fake exemptions. Interestingly, most of them were repeat offenders,"" a senior tax official was quoted as saying.Tax officials have confirmed that notifications are being dispatched to taxpayers, enabling them to amend their returns.“This verification is taking additional time, a reason why the refund process is slower compared to last year,"" the official said, adding that the department is closely monitoring the processing so that other pending income tax returns are cleared at the earliest.According to recent data, the Income Tax Department's refund disbursements decreased by 24% to Rs 1.60 lakh crore as of September 17, compared to Rs 2.10 lakh crore in the previous year.The department launched comprehensive verification exercises across multiple sites in July, targeting those who were helping others file incorrect tax deductions and exemptions in their returns.Following a recent compliance campaign as of June 18, taxpayers withdrew tax deduction claims amounting to Rs 963 crore and submitted additional taxes of Rs 409.50 crore. Additionally, 30,161 taxpayers disclosed foreign assets valued at Rs 29,208 crore and foreign income totalling Rs 1,089 crore.","The tax authorities have identified many instances of false exemption claims submitted by taxpayers.

Rabies outbreak suspected in Coimbatore as 25 stray dogs test positive for viral disease in two months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/rabies-outbreak-suspected-in-coimbatore-as-25-stray-dogs-test-positive-for-viral-disease-in-two-months/articleshow/124098970.cms,"



COIMBATORE: Twenty-five stray dogs have tested positive for rabies in the past two-and-a-half months in Coimbatore and suburbs. While veterinarians suspect an outbreak of the viral disease among community dogs in the city, civic agencies say they have initiated measures for early identification and prevention.The authorities have identified 14 hotspots from where 49 dogs were captured since June following residents’ complaints to Coimbatore Corporation’s helpline about “unhealthy and aggressive” dogs. Four of the dogs were released after vaccination but the rest died in the kennels at Seeranaickenpalayam Animal Birth Control Centre in four to 10 days of their capture.A team from an NGO, Mission Rabies, collected samples from brain tissues of the 45 carcasses and confirmed that 25 were infected with rabies.Coimbatore collector Pavankumar G Giriyappanavar said local bodies are intensifying the free anti-rabies vaccination in hotspots. “The number of animal birth control surgeries has been stepped up in the city corporation and town panchayat areas,” he said.Coimbatore Corporation commissioner M Sivaguru Prabakaran said the civic agency would repeat the tests with help from the animal husbandry department. “We want to ensure standard operating procedures are followed.The results are alarming. We don't want to create panic,” he said.The stray dog population in Coimbatore was estimated to be 1.11 lakh in 2022. In June 2025, the corporation tied up with NGOs Mission Rabies and Humane Animal Society to prevent rabies and control the stray dog population. While the NGOs have been vaccinating stray dogs, the corporation launched a rabies surveillance helpline (98437 89491) and asked residents to report dogs with poor health conditions or suspected of rabies. Since June, the helpline received 326 calls from across the city.""Forty-five of the 49 captured dogs died. Our veterinarian teams collected samples and carried out tests. At least 25 died of rabies,"" said Mubeena Mubarak, rabies surveillance manager, Mission Rabies. The doctors did a lateral flow assay (LFA) — a test to confirm rabies cases on dead animals. Samples were also sent for a direct fluorescent antibody test (dFAT) to Bengaluru for further verification.“All data, including the location of the affected dogs, were documented in the worldwide veterinary service (WVS) application and shared with the govt to ensure transparency,” she said.The number of positive cases is unusually high, necessitating immediate and sustained efforts to control the situation, Mubeena Mubarak said. “Upon identifying positive cases, field inspectors conducted checks for symptomatic animals, followed by vaccination of both stray and pet animals within a four-km radius,” she added.",The authorities have identified 14 hotspots from where 49 dogs were captured since June.

This new fee is expected to disproportionately affect Indian nationals, who receive the majority of H-1B visas.

Mark Zuckerberg’s failed bid for TikTok





Shou Zi Chew, the Singapore-born CEO of TikTok, today leads one of the biggest competitors to Mark Zuckerberg ’s Meta. But few know that at the start of his career, Chew actually worked for Zuckerberg. After earning an economics degree from University College London and later pursuing an MBA at Harvard Business School, Chew spent a summer internship at Facebook (now Meta), then an up-and-coming social media startup.After his brief stint in California, Chew moved through major financial and tech hubs including London, Singapore, and Hong Kong. In 2015, he joined Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi , playing a key role in the company’s public listing three years later as its chief financial officer. His work at Xiaomi positioned him as a rising executive in Asia’s fast-growing technology sector.Shou Zi Chew’s career took a sharp turn in 2021, when he joined ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Initially appointed as CFO, he was later named CEO of TikTok the same year, while briefly holding both roles. Under his leadership, TikTok surged past 1 billion users globally, including an estimated 150 million in the United States, making it one of the few major platforms outside Zuckerberg’s reach.TikTok’s rise has long frustrated Meta. According to reports, Mark Zuckerberg tried to acquire Musical.ly in 2016, a lip-syncing app that later merged into TikTok after ByteDance bought it for $800 million. Meta’s own rival app, Lasso, failed to gain traction and was shut down in 2020.As TikTok’s influence grew in the US, so did the scrutiny in Washington over the app’s Chinese ties. Chew has appeared before US lawmakers to defend the platform from allegations of being a national security risk due to its Chinese ownership. During a 2023 hearing, he drew contrasts with Facebook’s own track record, saying: “American social companies don’t have a good track record with data privacy and user security. ”Zuckerberg has also voiced concerns about TikTok’s control by a foreign government but has also warned that banning the app could set a precedent for restricting online platforms.","Shou Zi Chew is the Singapore-born CEO of TikTok, one of the biggest competitors to Mark Zuckerberg ’s Meta.

Intel may cut over 5,000 jobs



Salesforce staff headcount reduces to 5,000



Google lays off contract workers

Oracle is cutting jobs across US, India, Canada and Europe

Donald Trump announces H-1B visa fee hike







The tech industry continues to be impacted by a wave of layoffs in 2025, following a significant number of job cuts last year. According to the independent tracker Layoffs.fyi, more than 150,000 jobs were eliminated across 549 companies in 2024. This trend has carried into the new year, with over 22,000 workers already facing job reductions across the tech sector. According to a report by TechCrunch, 16,084 of these cuts occurred in February alone.As companies increasingly adopt AI and automation, this ongoing series of layoffs highlights the human impact of rapid technological change and the potential consequences for innovation across the industry. Here are some of the tech giants that have cut the maximum number of jobs this year.Earlier this year, Microsoft announced a plan to cut 9,000 employees, which represents under 4% of its global workforce. This is the latest in a series of reductions for the company this year, following cuts of less than 1% in January, more than 6,000 in May, and at least 300 in June.Chipmaker Intel is reportedly firing more than 5,500 employees across various US states, according to company filings.The tech giant had previously estimated a lower number of cuts, but has now stated the reduction is part of a plan to eliminate 24,000 to 25,000 jobs by the end of 2025. Intel stated the move is ""designed to create a faster-moving, flatter and more agile organization.""Salesforce has laid off another 4,000 employees from its customer support division, reducing its headcount in that department from 9,000 to 5,000. This reduction comes as the company focuses on artificial intelligence (AI), with AI agents now reportedly handling about one million customer conversations. The layoffs occurred despite the company reporting strong financial results.Google has also been affected by the layoff wave, with more than 200 contract workers laid off by GlobalLogic, a firm specialising in handling Google's AI rating projects. These contract workers reportedly believe they were used to train AI models that could eventually make their jobs redundant.US cloud service provider Oracle is continuing its large-scale job-cut drive across its global workforce. The latest round affected at least 254 employees in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to a company filing. Reports also indicate that workers in India, Canada, and parts of Europe have been impacted, including 101 employees in Seattle.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump signed a new executive order that significantly increases the fees for H-1B visas, a move that can shake up hirings in the tech industry. The fee for new H-1B visas has been hiked by to $100,000, a measure aimed at discouraging major tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta from hiring foreign workers.For Indian IT professionals, who have long relied on H-1B sponsorships for US jobs, this new policy presents a dual crisis: fewer available positions and substantially higher barriers to entry. According to the new order, the increased fees and rules will not apply to current H-1B visa holders or those seeking to renew their visas; they will only impact future applicants.","Over 22,000 workers already facing job reductions across tech sector.

Gold prices are likely to continue their strong bullish momentum, and silver too will maintain its stealth trend, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

He shares his views on gold and silver:

Gold and silver price prediction today:MCX Gold is currently exhibiting a strong and sustained uptrend, supported by clear technical evidence on the charts. The price action continues to form higher highs and higher lows, which is a classic indication of bullish momentum. This consistent pattern suggests that the uptrend is likely to persist in the near term.The key support level to watch is around 112,000, which has acted as a reliable floor for prices during recent pullbacks. This level is crucial because it provides traders with a benchmark for risk management—any decisive break below this zone could indicate a potential pause or reversal in the trend.On the upside, the next targets are in the range of 115,500 to 116,000. Given the current bullish structure, these levels are achievable, provided the momentum sustains. Volume patterns and momentum indicators further reinforce this positive bias, pointing to strong buying interest in the market.Overall, the outlook for MCX Gold remains constructive. Traders and investors should monitor support levels closely while keeping an eye on any signs of exhaustion or reversal. For now, maintaining long positions with appropriate stops around 112,000 appears to be a prudent strategy.MCX Silver is currently in a stealth uptrend, quietly building momentum similar to the ongoing rally in MCX Gold. Despite its relatively subdued movement compared to Gold, Silver is showing strong underlying strength, suggesting that the bullish phase is likely to continue in the near term.The price action is well-supported around the 133,000 level, which has acted as a firm base during recent consolidations. This key support zone provides a critical floor for traders to manage downside risk and confirms that buyers are stepping in consistently at this level.On the upside, Silver has the potential to soar towards the 138,000 level, marking the next significant resistance zone. The gradual but steady formation of higher lows indicates sustained buying interest, which could propel prices upward once momentum picks up further.Given the close correlation between Gold and Silver, the positive trend in Gold reinforces the bullish outlook for Silver. Technical indicators and volume patterns also suggest accumulation, pointing to a possible acceleration in the rally.In summary, MCX Silver remains well-positioned in an emerging uptrend. Traders are advised to watch for dips near 133,000 as potential entry points, aiming for a target near 138,000 while maintaining disciplined risk management.","Gold prices are likely to continue their strong bullish momentum, and silver too will maintain its stealth trend, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

PUNE: A Hyderabad-based PhD holder in electronics & telecommunication (E&TC) with degrees from two prominent London universities has been arrested by Pune cyber police for defrauding a city educational institution of Rs 2.46 crore under the pretext of arranging governmentfunded research projects in drones and AI.The accused, identified as Seetaiah Kilaru (34) of Meher Road, Yapral, Hyderabad, allegedly duped the institute between July 25 and Aug 7. Police said he tried similar scams on two other institutes in Pune and Chennai but failed.ACP (crime) Pankaj Deshmukh said, “Kilaru spent `1.50 crore on online betting. We recovered 10 debit cards, 13 passbooks, 15 cheque books, one SIM card, gold receipts, four mobile phones, a laptop, two cars, and cash worth `49.7 lakh from his possession. He gave Rs 25 lakh cash to his father-in-law, which is yet to be recovered, paid a year’s advance rent to his landlord, and bought a car worth Rs 27 lakh.”Asked how the police established his involvement and tracked him down, Deshmukh said, “Kilaru, impersonating an IIT Powai professor, called the former vice-chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and asked him to refer him to an institution to which he could help secure govt funding in projects.The VC, believing him genuine, introduced him to senior officials of the Pune institute. Through follow-up calls and messages, Kilaru convinced the CEO to transfer funds in three installments, promising govt funding in return. When he failed to appear to sign an MoU, the institute grew suspicious.We later tracked his number through the VC’s call records and traced the money trail back to him.” Over the last two years, Kilaru has been named in four cheating and IT Act cases registered by the cybercrime police in Hyderabad, two cases by the Gachibowli police and two more cases by the Medipally police in Medchal Malkajgiri district.Pune police team camped in Hyderabad for two days to track Kilaru’s movements, and nabbed him early on Sunday. The team produced him before a court in Hyderabad, which ordered his transit remand, following which Kilaru was brought to Pune. On Tuesday, the police produced him before a Pune court which ordered his custodial remand till Sept 28.","The accused, identified as Seetaiah Kilaru (34) of Meher Road, Yapral, Hyderabad, allegedly duped the institute between July 25 and Aug 7.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Judge asks DCP to submit a detailed report in 3 months





NEW DELHI: A city court directed police to reopen and expand its probe into allegations of negligence and falsification of records at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, after it rejected a closure report.The matter arises from a 2019 FIR lodged by Sapna Jain, who alleged that her son, born in 2017, suffered irreversible hypoxic brain injury at birth due to negligence.The injury, she said, left the child with cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and in a permanent vegetative state.Jain accused two doctors - Dr Vivek Jain and Dr Akhilesh Singh - of falsely presenting themselves as specialists in neonatology and pediatrics despite lacking the requisite qualifications. She alleged that the hospital tampered with medical records, withheld resuscitation notes, and issued a fabricated ""fitness certificate"" at the time of discharge.Delhi Medical Council, on May 21 this year, barred the doctors from identifying themselves as neonatologists or super specialists.Despite these developments, police submitted a closure report more than four years after the FIR. The complainant argued the probe was perfunctory and collusive, failing to address key issues.The court agreed, observing that the report lacked ""comprehensive investigation"". ""The court cannot be unmindful of the fact that the closure report was filed without thorough inquiry. Allegations of unqualified practice by doctors, falsification, and concealment are serious in nature and warrant thorough investigation,"" the order said.The judge directed the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) concerned to personally supervise reinvestigation and file a detailed report within three months and listed it on Dec 22.The court listed several areas requiring deeper inquiry, including whether Dr Jain, without possessing CCT after MRCPCH (UK), could legally represent himself as a neonatologist in India post the 2008 notification; whether Dr Akhilesh Singh, holding only an MBBS degree, impersonated as a specialist; and whether records were falsified. It also asked investigators to determine the exact cause and timing of the brain injury - before, during, or after birth.The order by Gaurav Katariya, judicial magistrate first class, Rohini court, further called for examination of medical and nursing staff involved in NICU care, recording the statement of another parent alleging similar negligence, and checking for other complaints against the hospital. It also flagged why essential brain screening tests such as EEG, MRI, and USG were not performed on the child. It also directed a fresh medical opinion from a board including at least one pediatric neurologist.Responding to the order, Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, said: ""The proceedings before the trial court in a protest petition were done without hearing the concerned doctors. The order is being examined, and the next steps will be taken as may be legally advised to ensure the rights and interests of all parties are appropriately considered. There are already two expert opinions in respect of the medical treatment rendered to the patient from the Delhi Medical Council and Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital, wherein they found no negligence. Further, the FIR has been challenged before the high court, and the related petition is sub judice. The hospital and dedicated doctors committed to providing the highest standards of medical care will take their remedies in accordance with law.""","A city court directed police to reopen and expand its probe into allegations of negligence and falsification of records at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh. The matter arises from a 2019 FIR lodged by Sapna Jain, who alleged that her son suffered irreversible hypoxic brain injury at birth due to negligence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124103865,imgsize-1041933,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/nicu-representative-image.jpg"
