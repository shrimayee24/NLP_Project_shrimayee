Lancet series warns ultra-processed foods driving India’s surge in obesity and diabetes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lancet-series-warns-ultra-processed-foods-driving-indias-surge-in-obesity-and-diabetes/articleshow/125477017.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Instant noodles, chips, biscuits, packaged drinks and even “healthy” cereals — these ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have quietly become everyday staples in Indian homes. But a new three-paper Lancet Series warns that these factory-made, additive-loaded products are helping drive a global rise in obesity and diabetes — a trend already unfolding rapidly in India.The Series brings together global evidence, including a review of 104 studies, of which 92 linked UPF-heavy diets to chronic diseases. Meta-analyses of 15 health outcomes showed significant associations for 12, including type 2 diabetes, obesity and even depression. India has not conducted such studies, and therefore no Indian data could be included — a gap experts say the country can no longer ignore.For India, the findings demand urgent policy action, says Dr. Vandana Prasad, community paediatrician and technical advisor at Public Health Resource Society. She argues that UPFs cannot be regulated like ordinary junk food. “Companies reduce salt or sugar to dodge High in Fat, Sugar and Salt (HFSS) limits, but the product remains ultra-processed because the additives stay,” she says.She calls for a clear legal definition of UPFs, strong front-of-pack warning labels, advertising restrictions, a UPF tax and subsidies for fresh foods, emphasising that healthy eating cannot depend on willpower alone when the entire food environment is engineered for overconsumption.Adding to this, Dr. Arun Gupta, paediatrician and Series co-author, says India is in the middle of the very shift the Lancet warns against — traditional meals being rapidly replaced by industrial UPFs promoted aggressively, especially to children. With no national data on UPF consumption, he cautions that India will struggle to slow rising obesity and diabetes unless it directly addresses the spread and marketing of such products.The scale of India’s health burden makes the warning even more urgent. The ICMR–INDIAB-17 (2023) study reports obesity in 28.6% of Indians, diabetes in 11.4%, prediabetes in 15.3%, and abdominal obesity in nearly 40%. Childhood obesity has increased as well — from 2.1% to 3.4% between NFHS-4 and NFHS-5.Prof K. Srinath Reddy, Chancellor, PHFI University of Public Health Sciences, notes that UPFs do more than add empty calories. By displacing natural foods, they can weaken immunity, heighten inflammation and worsen chronic disease risk. He supports strict regulation across production and marketing, clear ingredient disclosures, strong front-of-pack warning labels and a ban on celebrity endorsements of UPFs.With UPFs now deeply embedded in Indian diets — from school tiffins to office snacks to rural shops — experts warn that India stands at a critical juncture. The new Lancet evidence sends a clear message: reining in ultra-processed foods must become a national health priority if India hopes to contain rising obesity and diabetes.","A new three-paper Lancet Series warns that these factory-made, additive-loaded products are helping drive a global rise in obesity and diabetes.

"Will strengthen INDIA bloc, says Congress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-strengthen-india-bloc-says-congress/articleshow/125474486.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the rumblings triggered by the opposition's comprehensive defeat in Bihar, Congress said it was committed to INDIA bloc and would double efforts to strengthen the national alliance.AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said the INDIA bloc was put together as an arrangement at the national level for like-minded parties to coordinate their efforts to counter BJP's regressive politics. ""Nothing has changed since it was formed. Congress is committed to INDIA and will make further efforts to boost its efficacy,"" he told TOI. The Congress manager also said the opposition would continue with its coordination in Parliament when the winter session gets under way on Dec 1.Doubts about the fate of the opposition alliance have surfaced on social media after the decimation suffered by the RJD-Congress combine in the recent Bihar elections , where it was roundly defeated by the JDU-BJP coalition. Some Congress netas too have advocated that in future, the party should move independently in Bihar by junking ally RJD. Some of the questions have also been stoked by the likelihood of Congress contesting the upcoming Bombay Municipal Corporation elections separate from NCP and Shiv Sena (UBT), which are its allies in Maha Vikas Aghadi.Venugopal, however, rubbished the speculations.Many Congress netas said the alliance was intrinsic to the politics of the party, as it would soon be fighting in Tamil Nadu as DMK's junior partner, and would go into the future Assam polls as part of a coalition that is already being stitched.Venugopal said municipal and panchayat elections were local contests, where decisions on alliances were made by local units based on political ground realities, like in BMC. ""But even there, the idea would be to defeat BJP,"" he said. The Kerala MP, who is a confidant of Rahul Gandhi, said while nothing had changed since the national alliance was formed, members were aware there would be differences in a few states, like West Bengal and Kerala. ""We will still fight separately in the two states. But the larger alliance will remain intact,"" he said.","Doubts about the fate of the opposition alliance have surfaced on social media after the decimation suffered by the RJD-Congress combine in the recent Bihar elections.

"Bihar: Kurmis & Kushwahas power Nitish Kumar's rise, two decades on",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-kurmis-kushwahas-power-nitish-kumars-rise-two-decades-on/articleshow/125474438.cms,"Marking a Political Milestone, Nitish Kumar Sworn In as Bihar CM for the 10th Time

NEW DELHI: The consolidation of Kurmis and Kushwahas - two intermediary backward castes - behind Nitish Kumar powered his rise two decades back, and as he took take oath for an unprecedented 10th time as Bihar CM on Thursday, their share in the assembly also hit a high.NDA's social coalition, which joins two ends of the caste spectrum by bringing together upper castes and Dalits - with the sprawling non-Yadav backward classes and EBCs in between - was the natural beneficiary of the alliance's sweeping mandate, but the two backward castes have made the biggest gains, largely on the back of nearly 100% rise in the seats of Nitish's JDU In the 243-member assembly, Kurmis account for 25 MLAs, while Kushwahas, also known as Koeris in Bihar, have 26 MLAs. Their numbers were 10 and 16 in the outgoing House.The number of extremely backward classes (EBC) MLAs has seen a jump from 29 to 35 and that of upper castes to 72 from 63.The population of Kushwahas is 4.21% and Kurmis 2.87% in Bihar, according to a caste survey by the state govt. Kushwahas are the second-most numerous caste after Yadavs (14.26%), while Kurmis, who score best among all backward castes on development metrics like education and share in govt jobs, have been politically more organised.Nitish, too, hails from the caste.Manindra Nath Thakur, an associate professor at Centre for Political Studies in JNU, said this is a high moment for the two castes. Both trace their origin to Luv-Kush and have exhibited a shared political purpose, he said, noting that they had broken away under Nitish from a broad social alliance Lalu Prasad had formed to counter the domination of upper castes but was perceived to be hegemonised by Yadavs. Due to a fragmented EBC, which is 26% of population, excluding Muslims, and included dozens of castes, Kurmi-Koeri are in a position to lead this social alliance, he noted.Political analyst Sanjay Kumar, however, cautioned against seeing any long-term implication in the rise of the number of Kurmi-Kushwaha MLAs, saying it was election-specific. It is natural because JDU has performed exceptionally well, and the party enjoys a strong support base in these castes, he added.Enthusiastic backing of the governing alliance by Kushwaha voters also show-ed the suggestion that the community was drifting away was incorrect, he added.If NDA's sweep has taken the share of Kurmi-Kushwaha MLAs to a high, the decimation of RJD-led Mahagathbandhan has had an opposite impact on the numbers of representatives from Muslims and Yadavs, who have been its solid supporters. Muslim MLAs are at an all-time low of 11 in the new assembly, while Yadavs' tally has fallen to 28 from 55.","Kurmis account for 25 MLAs, while Kushwahas, also known as Koeris in Bihar, have 26 MLAs.

5-judge bench agrees with 2-judge bench on only one point: Guv can't sit on bill indefinitely,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-judge-bench-agrees-with-2-judge-bench-on-only-one-point-guv-cant-sit-on-bill-indefinitely/articleshow/125474279.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Tamil Nadu govt's 2023 writ petition accusing the governor of deliberately not acting on 10 bills passed by the state assembly had led a two-judge Supreme Court bench to pen a 415-page judgment on April 8, stripping the constitutional heads of states of the minimal discretionary power conferred on them by the Constitution.Alarmed by the strong forays made by the judiciary into the legislative powers of the constitutional heads of the country and states, the President on May 14 sent a 14-question reference in exercise of her powers under Article 143 to seek SC's opinion, virtually on each ruling of the two-judge bench as also whether the ambit of SC's exclusive powers under Article 142 included granting deemed assent to bills.In its 111-page judgment, a bench of CJI B R Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikran Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar tested the reasoning of the two-judge bench on the constitutional touchstone and found that the directions were beyond the mandate of the Constitution.The only point of convergence of views between the two-judge and the five-judge benches was that the governor could not sit on a bill indefinitely. In such a situation, the five-judge bench said the aggrieved state could move SC. Even then, SC could only ask the governor to act expeditiously and not fix a timeline, it said.The two-judge bench had said, ""There is no expressly specified time-limit for the discharge of the functions by the governor under Article 200 of the Constitution.Despite there being no prescribed time-limit, Article 200 cannot be read in a manner which allows the governor to not act upon bills which are presented to him for assent and thereby delay and essentially roadblock the lawmaking machinery in the state.""Assuring itself that prescribing a timeline for the governor was not akin to amending the Constitution, the two-judge bench had said, ""In case of either withholding of assent or reservation of the bill for the consideration of the President, upon the aid and advice of the state council of ministers, the governor is expected to take such an action forthwith, subject to a maximum period of one month."" It had said the governor must return the bill to the House, if he was withholding assent, within three months or decide within the same timeline reserving it for President's consideration.Turning to the President, the two-judge bench had said, ""There is no 'pocket veto' or 'absolute veto' available to the President in discharge of functions under Article 201. The use of the expression 'shall declare' makes it mandatory for the President to make a choice between the two options available under the substantive part of Article 201, that is, to either grant assent or to withhold assent to a bill.""The two-judge bench fixed a three-month timeline for the President and then granted deemed assent to the 10 Tamil Nadu Bills.In declaring all the above components of the two-judge bench's rulings as impermissible under the Constitutional scheme, the five-judge bench said, ""The governor enjoys discretion in choosing from these three constitutional options and is not bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers, while exercising his function under Article 200. The discharge of the governor's function under Article 200, is not justiciable. The court cannot enter a merits review of the decision so taken.""However, in case of glaring circumstances of inaction that is prolonged, unexplained and indefinite, ""the court can issue a limited mandamus for the governor to discharge his function under Article 200 within a reasonable time, without making any observations on the merits of the exercise of his discretion"".It said, ""The President, too, cannot be bound by judicially prescribed timelines in the discharge of functions under Article 201...the President's assent under Article 201 too, is not justiciable.""Annulling another ruling by the two-judge bench making it virtually mandatory for the President to seek the court's opinion on bills whose constitutionally she doubts, the five-judge bench said, ""In our constitutional scheme, the President is not required to seek advice of this court by way of reference under Article 143, every time a governor reserves a bill for the President's assent.""",The Tamil Nadu govt's 2023 writ petition accusing the governor of deliberately not acting on 10 bills passed by the state assembly had led a two-judge Supreme Court bench to pen a 415-page judgment on April 8.

GURGAON: The CEO of a city-based startup has been named in an FIR along with a former employee of Shikhar Dhawan for allegedly cheating the ex-India cricketer and using his photos illegally for endorsement during the Asia Cup earlier this year in Dubai.The case was registered after a complaint was filed by a representative of Dhawan's Da One Group. The complainant accused the duo of misrepresenting themselves as Dhawan's official agents and fraudulently renewing an expired deal with a cricket application for financial gain. The former employee named in the complaint runs a company called Elevate Athletes Creators Ecosystem.According to the complaint, Dhawan, who attended the recently concluded Asia Cup, was stunned to see his photographs and videos prominently displayed across stadium screens, endorsing the app, Crex, when it had no active contract with him at the time. Da One claimed it came to know from Parthtech Developers, which operates the application, that the endorsement had been renewed for a year through an agreement signed on March 10, 2025 with Elevate Athletes.Parthtech, believing the documents presented by the startup founder and Dhawan's employee to be legitimate, paid Rs 40 lakh for the extension — money that, according to the complaint, was pocketed entirely by the duo.According to complaint, Dhawan's original agreement with Parthtech was valid from April 16, 2024 to April 15, 2025, and was signed by the ex-employee during his tenure as CEO of Da One Group. He was authorised to act only within specific limits defined by a board resolution, and his authority ceased both when he left the company in Sept 2024 and when the contract expired in April 2025, according to the complaint.However, it added, the ex-employee continued projecting himself publicly as Dhawan's authorised representative and accused the startup founder and him of producing a forged ""representation agreement"" dated Dec 20, 2024 to falsely claiming to Parthtech that Elevate had been granted exclusive rights to manage Dhawan's endorsements.Da One Group also expressed concern that the duo may still be in possession of forged and fabricated documents to mislead clients and urged police to recover these documents immediately.Based on the complaint, the FIR has been filed under sections 316 (2) (criminal breach of trust), 318 (4) (cheating), 336 (3) (forgery), 338 (forgery of valuable documents like wills), 340 (using forged documents as genuine) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) of BNS.""After receiving the complaint, we have registered the FIR. The individuals concerned will be called to join the investigation and appropriate legal action will be taken against them,"" a senior police officer said.Talking to TOI, the startup founder refuted the allegations. ""Since we all are from the same industry, it cannot happen that we endorsed him without informing him,"" he said.",The case was registered after a complaint was filed by a representative of Dhawan's Da One Group.

MCX Gold has been exhibiting a steady upward momentum, and this positive trend has opened the possibility of prices moving toward the ₹1,27,000 level in the near term. The recent price action suggests strong buying interest, supported by favorable global cues and renewed investor confidence. However, this optimism must be balanced with caution, as the upcoming week is expected to be data-heavy. A series of key economic releases from the United States—delayed due to the recent government shutdown—could inject volatility into global markets, including commodities like gold.Given this backdrop, traders are advised to maintain disciplined risk management. A strict stop-loss at ₹1,22,000 is recommended to protect long positions. This level has been acting as a crucial support zone; a break below it could indicate a shift in sentiment.If prices fall below this stop-loss, gold may witness a deeper correction, potentially dragging it down toward the ₹1,18,000 mark, where the next major support lies.Overall, while the broader outlook remains constructive, traders should stay vigilant and responsive to global macro developments. With significant US economic data on the way, adopting a cautious yet strategic approach will be essential for navigating short-term market fluctuations.MCX Silver has shown strong upward momentum, successfully moving above the ₹1,58,000 mark and gradually approaching its previous swing high near ₹1,65,800. This breakout reflects renewed strength in the bullion market, supported by improving sentiment, global uncertainty, and steady buying interest from investors seeking safety. The price action suggests that silver may continue its upward journey if bullish conditions persist, especially with supportive cues from international markets.However, despite the encouraging trend, traders should remain cautious. Much like gold, silver is also sensitive to global economic data, currency movements, and macro-level developments. With several important economic indicators expected from the US this week—following delays caused by the recent government shutdown—volatility may rise across precious metals.To manage this potential risk, it is advisable to maintain a strict stop-loss at ₹1,55,500. This level serves as a crucial support area and helps protect against sudden downside moves. If silver fails to sustain above this threshold, it could trigger profit-booking or aggressive selling pressure, which may drag prices down toward the ₹1,45,000 level, where the next major support exists.Overall, while the broader trend remains constructive, adopting disciplined risk management and monitoring global cues closely will be essential for navigating the short-term movements in MCX Silver.","Gold prices may move towards Rs 1,27,000 levels in the near term, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

New Delhi: Dr Umar un Nabi, the suicide bomber behind the Nov 10 Delhi car blast, had met a Syrian terror operative in Turkiye in 2022 along with co-accused Dr Muzammil Shakeel Ganai and Dr Muzzafar Rather, supposedly on the directions of their Pakistani handler Ukasha, sources connected with the investigation told TOI on Thursday.The agencies are trying to dig deeper into what transpired during the meeting. Muzammil, who was arrested by NIA Thursday with three other accused - Dr Adeel Ahmed Rather, Dr Shaheen Saeed and Mufti Irfan Ahmad Wagay - is expected to be interrogated by NIA to take forward the probe into international linkages of the conspiracy.Intelligence sources told TOI the three doctors - Umar, Muzammil and Muzzafar (Adeel Rather's brother) - had stayed in Turkiye for around 20 days. Though they had travelled there to see Ukasha, who is said to be based along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, the meeting never happened, as per the accused. Instead, Ukasha directed them to meet the Syrian national.Muzaffar went on to travel via UAE to Afghanistan and is said to have joined al-Qaida.Sources said Umar was also keen to travel to Afghanistan from Turkiye but was told by Ukasha to return to India to execute Jaish's ""bigger"" terror plans there.He followed the direction, and it was only after his return that he joined Al Falah University and gave shape to the terror module that had been amassing explosives for future attacks when it was busted.""Muzammil, Adeel and Umer were constantly in touch with three Pakistan-based handlers Faisal, Hashim and Ukasha via Telegram, who would give them instructions, radicalisation material and bomb making videos,"" an officer told TOI.NIA said on Thursday that the three doctors and Shopian cleric Mufti Irfan arrested by it had played a key role in the Delhi terror attack and were also conspiring to carry out similar pan-India strikes.Earlier, NIA had arrested Amir Rashid Ali, a plumber from Pampore, and Jasir Bilal Wani who hails from Qazigund. Amir had facilitated purchase of the vehicle used in the Delhi car blast and was aware of the suicide bombing plan. Umar had visited Pampore a week before buying the car to arrange the money and then travelled back to Haryana with Amir. Amir stayed with Umar for around a week, bought the car in his name, and then returned to Pampore days before the blast.Jasir is accused of being an active co-conspirator who had provided technical support for carrying out terror attacks by modifying drones into rockets for use in terror attacks.All the accused were earlier in custody of J&K police, which had, in a painstaking investigation that started with spotting of some Jaish posters in Nowgam, unravelled a chilling Jaish terror conspiracy involving highly-radicalised doctors working at Al-Falah University in Faridabad.","Dr Umar un Nabi, the suicide bomber behind the Nov 10 Delhi car blast, had met a Syrian terror operative in Turkiye in 2022 along with co-accused Dr Muzammil Shakeel Ganai and Dr Muzzafar Rather.

"Talaak-e-Hasan explained: Why it’s under scrutiny, and how it differs from triple talaq",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/talaak-e-hasan-explained-why-its-under-scrutiny-and-how-it-differs-from-triple-talaq/articleshow/125464201.cms,"Explained: Difference between Talaq-e-Hasan and Triple Talaq

What is Talaak-e-Hasan





Why Talaak-e-Hasan is challenged now





What happened in the 2017 case





How is teen talaq different from Talaak-e-Hasan





Where the debate stands now





NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court, while hearing a petition challenging the unilateral use of Talaq-e-Hasan, on Wednesday questioned the validity of a growing practice in which Muslim men authorise lawyers to issue monthly talaq notices on their behalf. Examining the case of journalist Benazeer Heena, the bench observed that such notices, issued without the husband’s signature, could not be treated as a valid dissolution of marriage. The Court warned that delegating talaq to lawyers or third parties exposes women to serious legal vulnerabilities, including the possibility of being accused of polyandry if they enter another marriage under the mistaken belief that the first marriage has been legally dissolved. The matter, already before the apex court through multiple petitions, has now brought renewed attention to the constitutional and procedural validity of Talaak-e-Hasan.The bench of Chief Justice-designate Surya Kant, along with Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and N K Singh, expressed strong reservations about this emerging practice, reiterating that talaq requires the husband’s direct pronouncement and signature.When senior advocate M R Shamshad, appearing for the husband, argued that such delegation was a customary practice within the community, the bench firmly rejected the claim. Justice Kant asked, “How can this be a valid practice? The notices for talaq and talaqnama must have the signature of the husband. How can a third party give the woman notice on behalf of her husband?” The bench further noted that clients often disown their lawyers’ actions, leaving women legally stranded. “Is this legal? How are such innovations made to give talaq? How is the community promoting such practices? We will not permit such processes to harm the dignity of the Muslim women,” the Court said.Also read - 3 talaqs sent through lawyer not valid: Supreme Court Benazeer, who was present in court, narrated how she had been abandoned by her husband after paying a total alimony of Rs 17,000 and forced to run from “pillar to post”. The Court directed her to file an application specifying the welfare needs of her child, assuring, “We will do the needful.” The bench also praised her courage, stating, “We salute her for gathering courage to move the court challenging the unilateral Talaq-e-Hasan process of divorce. Think of the condition of millions of Muslim women, illiterate and living in rural areas. What would be their plight?”The Court’s remarks indicated that the issue extends beyond individual grievances and affects thousands of Muslim women who may lack awareness, access or legal protection. The bench said it would examine the validity of Talaak-e-Hasan after detailed arguments, a move that has set the stage for a significant judicial review of practices that have long existed within Muslim personal law.Talaak-e-Hasan (TEH) is one of the classical Islamic methods of divorce recognised under Sunni Muslim personal law. Unlike instant triple talaq , which the Supreme Court struck down in 2017, TEH is a staggered process carried out over three months. The husband pronounces “talaq” once every month, typically during a period when the wife is not menstruating, and each pronouncement is intended to be separated by at least one complete menstrual cycle or lunar month. This timing is not arbitrary; it is grounded in Islamic jurisprudence, which emphasises reflection, restraint and opportunities for reconciliation between the spouses.The first pronouncement initiates the process, but the divorce does not become final. During the month that follows, the couple is expected to attempt reconciliation. If they resume cohabitation in any form before the second pronouncement, or if the husband changes his mind, the declaration becomes void. The second pronouncement follows the same pattern. Only if the third pronouncement is made in the third consecutive month, without any resumption of marital relations, does the divorce become final and irrevocable. This structure is closely tied to the Islamic concept of iddat, a mandatory waiting period observed by the wife after divorce or widowhood. The iddat serves several theological and practical functions, including providing time for reflection and clarifying pregnancy status.Within Islamic jurisprudence, TEH is seen as a measured and reversible form of divorce, distinct from the abruptness of instant triple talaq. Nevertheless, critics argue that despite its structured nature, TEH remains a unilateral and extra-judicial mechanism controlled solely by the husband. While Muslim women do have options such as khula—a wife-initiated divorce that requires returning the mehar—or mubarat, where both parties mutually agree to end the marriage, these processes can be inhibited by social pressure, family influence and lack of legal support. As a result, women often remain at a disadvantage when navigating marital dissolution within personal law.The challenge to TEH arises not merely from its theological structure but from how it is being applied today. The Supreme Court’s current examination stems from allegations that husbands are misusing the process by issuing talaq notices through lawyers instead of personally pronouncing the divorce. In the case of Benazeer Heena, her husband allegedly sent three talaq notices through his lawyer, completed a divorce and remarried another woman. Her counsel, senior advocate Rizwan Ahmed, told the Court that “when a talaqnama does not bear the husband’s signature, it is not a valid divorce document.” He cautioned that if a woman remarries under the belief that she is divorced, only to later learn that her husband denies having signed or authorised the talaq, she could be accused of polyandry. He further noted that potential suitors may refuse to marry her out of fear that the earlier divorce may not be legally valid.The bench reacted strongly to this argument. It rejected the claim that delegation of talaq is a widespread or acceptable practice. The judges observed that the integrity of the process collapses when a third party issues notices, especially when the husband can later deny authorising them. They expressed astonishment at the idea that a husband would ask someone else to divorce his wife, asking pointedly, “How can a third party give the woman notice on behalf of her husband?” The bench insisted that talaq must be executed strictly in accordance with religious law and not through intermediaries.The misuse of TEH is not limited to this case. Another petitioner, Nazri Nisha, appeared in person to narrate her difficulties, saying her husband attempted to divorce her through an irregular method. She explained that the lack of a valid divorce document had made it nearly impossible to access essential services such as school admissions and passports for her child. The Supreme Court asked her to file an application so that directions could be issued to protect her rights, emphasising that husbands cannot “enjoy their own life while destroying their wife’s. ”These cases have added to a broader argument that TEH, even when executed in good faith, gives unilateral and disproportionate power to husbands. The petitions challenge this imbalance, arguing that TEH remains discriminatory and violates Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. They contend that the practice lacks judicial oversight and allows men to dissolve marriages without ensuring financial security, due process or legal validation. The Court’s willingness to examine these claims signals its recognition of the deeper systemic issues at play.The current debate cannot be understood without reference to the Supreme Court’s landmark 2017 judgment in the Shayara Bano case, which struck down instant triple talaq (Talaq-e-biddat) as unconstitutional. The case began when Shayara Bano challenged the talaqnama her husband sent to her in 2015, arguing that triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy violated her fundamental rights. Her petition triggered a nationwide debate on Muslim women’s rights and the nature of personal law.Many women joined the litigation, including Ishrat Jahan, whose husband divorced her over a phone call from Dubai; Gulshan Parween, who received her talaq on a stamp paper; Aafreen Rehman from Jaipur; and Atiya Sabri from Saharanpur. The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) also filed a petition, arguing that triple talaq lacked Quranic sanction and violated women’s rights to equality, non-discrimination and dignity.The practice was defended by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and organisations like the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind. They contended that Muslim personal laws are protected under Article 25 and constitute essential religious practices. They argued that although triple talaq was “bad in theology”, it was “good in law” and valid under the Hanafi school of jurisprudence. They urged the Court to leave any reform to Parliament instead of judicial intervention.In a historic 3:2 verdict, the Supreme Court struck down instant triple talaq as arbitrary and unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that the practice violated Article 14 by granting husbands unilateral power without any possibility of reconciliation. The verdict was followed by the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, which criminalised the pronouncement of instant triple talaq.Significantly, however, the 2017 ruling did not address Talaak-e-Hasan or Talaak-e-Ahsan. These practices were considered more acceptable because they provided time for reflection and potential reconciliation. This omission left unanswered questions that have now resurfaced through petitions filed by women who argue that unilateral talaq—whether instant or staggered—remains discriminatory in practice.Teen talaq, or Talaq-e-biddat, is fundamentally different from Talaak-e-Hasan both in process and principle. Teen talaq involves the husband pronouncing “talaq” three times in one sitting, leading to the immediate termination of marriage. It does not require a waiting period, the wife’s presence or acknowledgement, or any attempt at reconciliation. Historically, the practice became infamous for being delivered through letters, phone calls, text messages and even social media. This instant, irrevocable nature was the chief reason it was struck down as unconstitutional.Talaak-e-Hasan, by contrast, is a three-step process over three months. Each pronouncement is separated by a significant interval, creating space for reflection and reconciliation. The first and second pronouncements are revocable, meaning the marriage continues if the couple resumes cohabitation. Only after the third pronouncement does the divorce become final. Scholars argue that TEH aligns with Quranic principles, which discourage hasty dissolution of marriage and emphasise attempts to reconcile.Also read - Explained: Why did SC say 'Talaq-e-Hasan' is different from triple talaq The Supreme Court itself has recognised this distinction. In a 2022 hearing on a related petition, the Court observed, “This is not triple talaq. You (women) also have option of Khula.” The Court noted that women have alternative routes such as khula, separation by mutual consent through mubarat and judicial remedies, whereas teen talaq offered no such opportunities for women.Yet, critics point out that despite these theoretical safeguards, TEH remains unilateral and extra-judicial. They argue that waiting periods or reconciliation windows do not compensate for the fact that the husband alone controls the process. The petitions before the Court contend that even staggered unilateral divorce violates the principles of equality and dignity enshrined in the Constitution.The Supreme Court’s latest observations do not equate TEH with instant triple talaq. The bench made it clear that TEH is not “so improper” as to be immediately struck down. However, the judges also signalled that procedural misuse, especially through delegated notices, cannot be tolerated. They emphasised that any valid divorce must comply strictly with Sharia procedures and must not compromise the dignity and security of women.The Court will now examine TEH in detail on 26 November, when it hears a batch of petitions challenging unilateral talaq practices. The issues before the Court include whether TEH is constitutionally valid, whether unilateral extra-judicial divorce violates women’s fundamental rights, and whether Parliament or the judiciary should reform personal laws that affect millions of Indian Muslim families.Whatever the eventual decision, the case marks an important moment in India’s evolving dialogue on personal laws, gender justice and constitutional morality. The Court’s findings will likely shape the future of marital rights for Muslim women and further clarify the balance between religious freedom and the right to equality.","Supreme Court questions validity of a growing practice in which Muslim men authorise lawyers to issue monthly talaq notices on their behalf. The Court warned that delegating talaq to lawyers exposes women to serious legal vulnerabilities. The matter, already before the apex court through multiple petitions, has brought renewed attention to the constitutional and procedural validity of Talaak-e-Hasan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125464721,imgsize-1242631,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

PRL scientists observed 3I/ATLAS in imaging and spectroscopic modes with the 1.2-metre telescope, located at an altitude of 1,680 metre in Mount Abu. PRL made these observations between Nov 12 and 15.On Wednesday, Nasa also released fresh images of 3I/ATLAS and dismissed speculation that it is an alien spacecraft. “It definitely behaves like a comet. We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” Nicola Fox, associate administrator of Nasa's science mission directorate, said, while referring to the comet as “our friendly solar system visitor”.Fox said Nasa has studied 3I/ATLAS with over a dozen scientific platforms, including Hubble and James Webb space telescopes and satellites orbiting Mars.NASA associate administrator Amit Kshatriya also said, “It looks and behaves like a comet. And all evidence points to it being a comet.” The new Nasa images showed it with a blurry appearance but with the clear presence of a telltale coma — the hazy cloud of gas and dust around its nucleus — and the tail of dust following its orbit.According to Indian scientists, the images of PRL observation show a near-circular coma. The coma of a comet is the large, glowing atmosphere of gas and dust that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the Sun. It is created when the Sun's heat causes the frozen ices on the nucleus to vaporise, or ‘sublimate’, releasing gas and dust that form a large, diffused cloud. Indian scientists have also acquired a spectrum of the light from the comet. The result shows prominent emission features commonly seen in solar system comets — CN, C2 and C3 bands in the shorter wavelength side of the spectrum, the Isro statement said.In case of 3I/ATLAS, the production rates for the prominent bands (emissions pertaining to the constituent molecules) were computed with limiting values around 1025 molecules/sec. The production rate ratios seem to place this comet in the class of ‘typical comets’ of the solar system. Further observations will be continued as the comet gradually comes into the darker part of the night, it said.",Indian and Nasa space scientists have captured fresh images of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS and confirmed that it has all the characteristics of a “comet” While dismissing some astronomers’ theory that it could be an “alien ship”.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125471883,imgsize-932429,width-400,resizemode-4/image-of-comet-3iatlas-captured-by-physical-research-laboratory-scientists-with-the-help-of-12m-telescope-mounted-at-mount-abu.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Russia has expressed its readiness to support India’s future fighter aircraft needs, offering unrestricted technology transfer for the Su-57 fifth-generation stealth fighter, with all demands from the Indian side described as “completely acceptable,” reported ANI citing officials.Speaking on the sidelines of the Dubai air show 2025, Sergey Chemezov, CEO of Russian defence conglomerate Rostec, highlighted the long-standing defence partnership, saying, ""India and Russia have been partners for many years. Even when India was under sanctions, we supplied the country with weapons to ensure its security.""He added, ""today, we continue the same approach as in previous years, supplying India with whatever military equipment it needs and ensuring our mutual interests in developing cooperation.""Vadim Badekha, director general of united aircraft corporation (UAC), a Rostec subsidiary, confirmed that all technical demands from India regarding the Su-57 have been received positively and that the Russian side remains in close contact with Indian officials.A senior Rosoboronexport representative said the offer includes both production of Su-57 aircraft in Russia and a gradual transfer of production to India, along with licensing for air weapons integration.The proposal also covers “technology transfer” for engines, optics, AESA radar, AI elements, low-signature technologies, and modern air weapons. A two-seat Su-57 variant is also included under the potential joint development plan.Officials underlined that the deal would allow India to manufacture critical components domestically without concerns over international sanctions, while providing scope for long-term upgrades through software and systems improvements. The move reinforces more than six decades of defence cooperation, which Russia described as “reliable and transparent” in technology transfer.The announcement comes ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India next month.

US Approves Major Arms Deal For India With Javelins And Excalibur To Counter Regional Threats

NEW DELHI: India is now set to ink another two arms deals with the US for Excalibur precision strike artillery munitions and man-portable Javelin anti-tank missiles worth $93 million (Rs 826 crore), even as the two countries try to work out a trade deal that would address the hefty 50% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Indian goods.The two new deals come soon after India earlier this month signed the over $1 billion (Rs 8,900 crore) contract with US major General Electric for another 113 GE-F404 engines to power the indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters.However, another major deal for India to acquire six more advanced P-8I long-range maritime patrol and submarine-hunting aircraft – Navy already has 12 such planes bought for over $3.2 billion – is still stuck in negotiations due to the high price being demanded by the US.Approving the two FMS (foreign military sale) cases “requested” by India on Wednesday, the Trump administration notified the US Congress and said the proposed deals will support the US foreign policy and national security objectives by strengthening the bilateral strategic relationship. India, a major defence partner, continues to be an important force for political stability, peace and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions, it said.The first is for 216 Excalibur tactical projectiles, along with associated equipment, for $47.1 million. The Army had deployed M-777 ultra-light howitzers, imported from the US, to fire Excalibur `smart’ extended range artillery shells to pound Pak Army and terror targets during Operation Sindoor in May. “The Excalibur munitions, with a 40-km range, proved very effective. The fresh supply will replenish stocks,” an officer said.The second deal is for 100 shoulder-launched FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), which have a 4-km range, along with 25 command launch units and other equipment for $45.7 million. This comes even as the two countries are also working to finalize a much larger project to jointly manufacture the fire-and-forget Javelin missile systems in India.With a huge deficiency in different kinds of shoulder, vehicle and helicopter-launched ATGMs, the Indian armed forces have been demanding third and fourth-generation ATGMs with longer ranges and greater armour-penetration capabilities for well over a decade now.The Army and IAF have also gone in for a limited number of Israeli Spike ATGMs, both man-portable as well as helicopter-launch ones, over the last few years in the absence of viable indigenous options.DRDO, on its part, says its man-portable ATGM, which has a 2-3 km range, is now fully ready. The ATGM, which is equipped with day/night and top attack capabilities to penetrate modern armour-protected tanks, has been field evaluated in different flight configurations many times, it adds.",India is set to ink another two arms deals with the US for Excalibur precision strike artillery munitions and man-portable Javelin anti-tank missiles.

'One Wrong Can't Justify...': Bangladesh Expert On Elections After Sheikh Hasina Death Penalty

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Mahua Moitra on Wednesday courted controversy when she shared an old photo of the arrest of Bangladesh’s former poll commissioner in an election-manipulation case, saying it was a sign of ""things to come” in an apparent reference to the INDIA bloc’s allegation that the Election Commission of India (ECI) chief is ""colluding with the ruling BJP to rig elections"".Moitra, who is also the Lok Sabha MP, drew sharp retort from the BJP, which slammed her for speaking ""like an enemy of the country"".Lashing out at Mohua Moitra, BJP's national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said: “Mahua Moitra is a Member of Parliament of India, but she speaks like an enemy of the country. The kind of tweet she has posted now— is she trying to say that India’s democracy is like that of Bangladesh?""""Earlier too, we saw RJD leaders saying that if they lose the election, they will turn the country into Bangladesh or Nepal, creating such a situation. We have also seen Rahul Gandhi say that their fight is against the Indian State,” he told news agency ANI.Even Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the ECI-led Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise during a meeting with AICC office-bearers from 12 states and Union Territories where the electoral roll revision is under way.He told party leaders that the Congress must counter the drive “politically, organisationally and legally,” according to sources quoted by PTI.Rahul, the sources said, argued that while the Election Commission is responsible for maintaining accurate voter rolls, it appeared to be shifting the burden onto political parties.He also questioned how the SIR was being implemented, warning that it “could lead to the removal of legitimate voters.”Several other Congress leaders echoed his fears, reviving their familiar “vote-chori” charge or calling the SIR a “sinister attempt to destroy Democracy”.Even as the opposition ramps up its resistance, the Election Commission reported that it has already distributed 50.25 crore enumeration forms across the 12 states and UTs, covering 98.54 per cent of the 50.97 crore eligible voters. The first phase spans Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Puducherry, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep.Four of these, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and West Bengal, head to the polls in 2026. Assam, also set for elections in 2026, received approval for a “special revision” of rolls on Monday.The second phase of SIR began on November 4 and will run until December 4.Rahul, meanwhile, has continued questioning the recent electoral outcomes. Last week, he termed the Bihar results “surprising” and cast doubt on the fairness of the process, saying the Congress and the INDIA bloc would scrutinise the outcome in detail. The party later alleged that the verdict reflected “vote chori on a gigantic scale, masterminded by the prime minister, the home minister, the EC”."," Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Mahua Moitra shared an old photo of the arrest of Bangladesh’s former poll commissioner in an election-manipulation case.

PM Modi Predicts Major Congress Split After NDA’s Bihar Win And Warns Allies Of Growing Instability

NEW DELHI: A group of 272 eminent citizens, including 16 judges, 123 retired bureaucrats, 14 former ambassadors and 133 retired armed forces officers, issued an open letter accusing leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and the Congress of trying to erode public faith in the Election Commission and other constitutional institutions.The letter, titled ""Assault on National Constitutional Authorities,"" alleged that opposition leaders were attempting to manufacture a sense of institutional breakdown through what it described as “venomous rhetoric” and “provocative but unsubstantiated accusations.”The letter said: “Some political leaders, instead of offering genuine policy alternative, resort to provocative but unsubstantiated accusations in their theatrical political strategy. After their attempts to tarnish the Indian Armed Forces by questioning their valour and accomplishments, and the Judiciary by questioning its fairness, Parliament, and its constitutional functionaries, now it is the turn of Election Commission of India to face systematic and conspiratorial attacks on its integrity and reputation.”The signatories singled out Rahul Gandhi for repeatedly alleging vote theft while, they said, failing to file a formal complaint or sworn affidavit to back his claims. They pointed to his assertions that he had “100 per cent proof” and an “atom bomb” against the Commission, alongside accusations of “treason,” and argued that such remarks came “without the prescribed sworn affidavit” required for accountability.The letter also noted that similar accusations had been amplified by Congress leaders, opposition parties and allied NGOs, including claims that the Election Commission had acted like the “B-team of the BJP.” It argued these assertions collapsed under scrutiny, pointing to the ECI’s public release of its methodology and verification done under court oversight.It said, “Moreover, several senior figures of Congress and other political parties, leftist NGOs, ideologically opinionated scholars, and a few attention seekers in other walks of life, have joined in with similarly blistering rhetoric against SIR, even declaring that the Commission has descended into complete shamelessness by acting like the ‘B-team of the BJP.’ Such fiery rhetoric may be emotionally powerful but it collapses under scrutiny, because the ECI has publicly shared its SIR methodology, overseen verification by court-sanctioned means, removed ineligible names in a compliant manner, and added new eligible voters. ”The signatories described this pattern of criticism as “impotent rage,” stating that leaders who faced electoral setbacks “lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility.”The letter said, “This pattern of behaviour reflects what might be called ‘impotent rage’ deep anger born of repeated electoral failure and frustration, without a concrete plan to reconnect with the people. When political leaders lose touch with the aspirations of ordinary citizens, they lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility. Theatrics replace analysis. Public spectacle takes the place of public service. ”Invoking the legacy of former chief election commissioners TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, the letter said, “Today, thinking of ECI, the country also remembers the likes of TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, whose unyielding leadership transformed the Election Commission into a formidable constitutional sentinel. They did not court popularity. They did not chase headlines. They enforced the rules fearlessly, impartially, relentlessly. ”Calling for transparency, legal accountability and respectful political conduct, the letter concluded by saying, “We call upon the Election Commission to continue its path of transparency and rigour. Publish complete data, defend itself through legal channels when necessary, and reject politics dressed up as victimhood. We call upon political leaders to respect the constitutional process, to compete not through baseless accusation but through policy articulation, and to accept democratic verdicts with grace. ”"," 272 eminent citizens, including 16 judges, 123 retired bureaucrats, 14 former ambassadors and 133 retired armed forces officers, issued an open letter.

"10 yrs of JJ Act: 55% pendency, 1 in 4 boards has no full bench",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10-yrs-of-jj-act-55-pendency-1-in-4-boards-has-no-full-bench/articleshow/125472964.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ten years after the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 came into force, a new study by the India Justice Report has exposed how the country's juvenile justice system is crumbling under the same ills that plague adult courts - massive delays, crippling vacancies and shocking opacity. Children in conflict with the law, the very group the Act swore to protect in their ""best interest"", are paying the heaviest price.As of Oct 31, 2023, more than 55,000 children were waiting for their cases to be decided, with 55% of the total cases pending before Juvenile Justice Boards (JJBs) across 18 states and two Union Territories. Out of 1,00,904 cases that came up before 362 JJBs in the year ending Oct 2023 (including 50,627 carried over from previous years), only 45,097 - a mere 45% - were disposed of. In Odisha the pendency rate touched a staggering 83%, while Karnataka managed to keep it at 35%. Nationally, the picture is grim: nearly one in every two cases simply rolls over to the next year.The report, titled ""Juvenile Justice and Children in Conflict with the Law: A Study of Capacity at the Frontlines"", is based on parliamentary answers, a year-long RTI inquiry and data from states (Nov 2022 to Oct 2023) . It reveals that one in every four JJBs - 24% or 111 out of 470 boards that responded - is functioning without the mandatory full bench of a principal magistrate and two social worker members.Only three states and Union Territories - Odisha, Sikkim and Jammu & Kashmir - have 100% fully constituted benches. With an average of 154 pending cases per board, the incomplete benches mean slower hearings, less child-sensitive decisions and prolonged institutionalisation of children.Perhaps the most alarming finding is that only 11 districts across the entire country meet the basic minimum standards required to deliver justice in a child's best interest. Out of 292 districts that provided usable data on seven critical parameters - presence of a JJB, child welfare institution, special juvenile police unit, legal aid clinic, probation officer, staff strength and manageable pendency - just 11 cleared the bar. Eight of these are in Mizoram.Residential infrastructure for children in conflict with the law is equally dismal. Fourteen states, including large ones like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, have not established even a single ""Place of Safety"" for 16 -18-year-olds accused of heinous offences - a mandatory requirement under the Act. Facilities for girls are particularly scarce: only 40 homes nationwide can accommodate girls in conflict with the law, including those that house both genders.The study warns that the absence of proper facilities forces children to be shifted far from their families, making access to guardians and legal representation difficult and sometimes leading to unsafe mixing of age groups and offence categories - the very evils the 2015 Act was meant to end.Ten years on, the report concludes, India still cannot produce routine, public, time-series data to prove that its juvenile justice system is working optimally for the child. Instead, thousands of children remain trapped in limbo, bearing the brunt of a system that looks disturbingly similar to the broken adult criminal justice machinery it was supposed to be different from.","India's juvenile justice system is crumbling under the same ills that plague adult courts.

NEW DELHI: To protect the Aravali hills and ranges - the only barrier against desertification of the Gangetic plains - Supreme Court Thursday barred grant of mining leases, but allowed existing ones to operate, while asking the Centre to prepare a management plan for sustainable mining for the entire range spread across four states.This is the last judgment to be authored by CJI B R Gavai, who as head of the green bench had zealously protected environment, ecology and forests while balancing the court's directions with sustainable development principles.The bench of CJI Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria accepted the definition of Aravali hills and ranges recommended by an expert committee and prohibited mining in core/inviolate areas, with certain exceptions. The committee had recommended prohibition of mining in core/inviolate areas, except for extraction of critical, strategic and atomic minerals.While accepting the recommendations for sustainable mining in the Aravali hills and ranges, and prevention of illegal mining, the bench directed the environment and forest ministry to prepare an MPSM through the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education for the entire Aravalis, which is spread across Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi.The Management Plan for Sustainable Mining (MPSM) must identify ""permissible areas for mining, ecologically sensitive, conservation-critical and restoration-priority areas within the Aravali landscape where mining shall be strictly prohibited or permitted only under exceptional and scientifically justified circumstances"", it said. The plan must also incorporate a thorough analysis of cumulative environmental impacts and the ecological carrying capacity of the region and include detailed post-mining restoration and rehabilitation measures, the bench said.""We further direct that till MPSM is finalised by MoEF&CC through ICFRE, no new mining leases should be granted,"" the bench said, adding that allotment of new mining leases would be considered by govts concerned only after MPSM is prepared and identifies areas in Aravali where sustainable mining could be permitted. ""In the meantime, mining activities in the mines which are already in operation would be continued in strict compliance with the recommendations made by the (expert) committee,"" it said.SC said the Aravali mountain range faces ""escalating degradation pressures"" because of several factors - deforestation, unsustainable grazing, illegal and excessive mining, and urban encroachment - cumulatively causing widespread damage to the ecosystem.SC said the Aravali hills and ranges harbour rich biodiversity, with 22 wildlife sanctuaries, four tiger reserves, Keoladeo National Park, along with wetlands like Sultanpur, Sambhar, Siliserh and Asola Bhati, and aquifers that recharge river systems, including the ones at Chambal, Sabarmati, Luni, Mahi, and Banas, and insisted on preparation of MPSM.","Aravali hills and ranges are the only barrier against desertification of the Gangetic plains. Supreme Court barred grant of mining leases, but allowed existing ones to operate. It asked the Centre to prepare a management plan for sustainable mining for the entire range.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125472156,imgsize-1301297,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
SC: Can't impose timelines on governors to clear bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-cant-impose-timelines-on-governors-to-clear-bills/articleshow/125471926.cms,"‘Court can only issue limited mandamus under Art 200’

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court unanimously ruled Thursday that it has no jurisdiction or power to set a timeline for a governor or the President to take a decision on bills passed by state assemblies, ask the President to seek SC's opinion on bills reserved for her and involving constitutional questions, and grant 'deemed assent' to bills pending with a governor.This ruling by a bench of CJI B R Gavai, CJI-designate Surya Kant, and Justices Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar dismantled the April 8 judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, which had led the President to seek SC's opinion on questions regarding the apex court's intrusion onto the turf of constitutional heads, and virtually challenged the constitutionality of the two-judge bench verdict.The two-judge bench had fixed timelines for governors and the President for taking a decision on bills passed by state assemblies, suggested to the President to seek SC's opinion on bills reserved for her and involving complex constitutional questions, and, using SC's exclusive powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, granted deemed assent to 10 bills pending with the Tamil Nadu governor.SC termed the rulings by the two-judge bench as constitutionally impermissible.It said the Constitution confers wide discretion on a governor in deciding whether to grant assent, withhold and return a bill with comments to the House for reconsideration, or reserve it for the President’s consideration. In exercise of this power under Article 200, a governor is not bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers led by the CM, SC said.It said SC is constitutionally barred from scrutinising a governor’s decision to grant or withhold assent to a bill or reserve it for President’s consideration. “The discharge of a governor’s function under Article 200 (and by the President under Article 201), is not justiciable,” it said, accepting the entire range of arguments advanced by solicitor general Tushar Mehta on behalf of the govt.“The court cannot enter into a merits review of the decision so taken. However, in glaring circumstances of inaction that is prolonged, unexplained, and indefinite — the court can issue a limited mandamus for a governor to discharge his function under Article 200 within a reasonable time, without making any observations on the merits of the exercise of his discretion,” it said.The bench said the Constitution does not prescribe a time limit for the President or governors within which they must take a decision on a bill. “It would not be appropriate for this court to judicially prescribe timelines for the exercise of powers under Article 200,” it said.It bench said, “The President is not required to seek advice of this court by way of reference under Article 143, every time a governor reserves a bill for the President’s assent.” It said the President has absolute discretion when to seek SC’s opinion and on what issue.It said SC can adjudicate validity of a bill only after it becomes law on receiving governor’s or President’s assent and notified by the govt concerned. “It is impermissible for courts to undertake judicial adjudication over the contents of a bill, in any manner, before it becomes law. Pertinently, discharge of its role under Article 143, does not constitute ‘judicial adjudication’,” the bench said.Frowning upon the grant of ‘deemed assent’ to 10 TN bills, the five-judge bench said it is the exclusive constitutional power of governors and the President to grant or refuse assent to a bill and SC cannot usurp the powers conferred on constitutional heads of the country and states. “The governor’s legislative role under Article 200 cannot be supplanted by another constitutional authority,” it said. Terming the concept of ‘deemed assent’ alien to the Constitution, the bench said, “The exercise of constitutional powers and the orders of the President/governor cannot be substituted in any manner under Article 142, and we hereby clarify that the Constitution, specifically Article 142 even, does not allow for the concept of ‘deemed assent’ of bills. ”Rejecting the parallels that counsels for opposition govts drew with constitutional heads like the British crown, who is only a figurehead, SC said it will give a ‘swadeshi’ interpretation to the constitutional provisions regarding powers of the President and governors on bills.Mehta conveyed to the bench the gratitude of the President and the Union govt for “an illuminating judgment” throwing light on several constitutional fields related to the powers of the President and governors.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who had supported the two-judge bench decision fixing timelines but did not agree with its decision on deemed assent, thanked the bench for a “very circumspect and thoughtful” decision.",Ruling dismantled April 8 judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan. Two-judge bench had fixed timelines for governors and the President for taking a decision on bills passed by state assemblies. It suggested to the President to seek SC's opinion on bills reserved for her and involving constitutional questions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125471932,imgsize-1044622,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

The authority said that several companies continue to flout those orders, selling products across e-commerce platforms, grocery stores, pharmacies, supermarkets and other modern trade outlets in violation of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.To curb the malpractice, states/UTs have been instructed to launch urgent inspection and verification drives, identify non-compliant products, ensure their immediate removal from sale, and initiate regulatory action against violators. A detailed action-taken report listing inspections, violations found, corrective steps taken, and status of product removal must be submitted to FSSAI at the earliest.In a significant clarification aimed at preventing field-level confusion, the regulator cautioned officials not to interfere with sales of genuine WHO-recommended Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS), which are classified as drugs under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.Such ORS products, used against dehydration and for diarrhoeal management, fall outside FSSAI's jurisdiction and must not be sampled, seized or removed from stores.The authority noted instances where enforcement teams had mistakenly targeted legitimate ORS products, and reiterated that its crackdown applies strictly to food and beverage products misleadingly marketed as ORS and not to medical ORS formulations.","The directive, issued on Nov 19, follows FSSAI's earlier orders on Oct 14 and 15 withdrawing permission to use ""ORS"" in the names of food and drink products.

"Parts of Lokpal law need tweaks, feel sections within government",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parts-of-lokpal-law-need-tweaks-feel-sections-within-government/articleshow/125470905.cms,"NEW DELHI: Twelve years after UPA govt enacted the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, followed by its rollout by NDA regime, a feeling seems to be growing among certain quarters in govt that some of its key provisions may need a relook in light of experience gathered during its enforcement.Sources in govt said ambiguities in the working as well as scope for discretion in certain provisions of the Act may be impairing the effective functioning of Lokpal. “The ambiguities may have been inadvertent and discretion relied upon in good faith while framing the law,” a govt functionary told TOI.For instance, the current chairperson has preferred to work through a single bench comprising all members and headed by him, notwithstanding the provision, conceived with an idea of facilitating division of labour, in Lokpal Act for benches to be constituted by the chairperson with two or more members.According to sources, the law allows the chairperson discretion regarding constitution of benches, the operative word being ‘may’ in Section 16(1)(a) that states “the jurisdiction of Lokpal may be exercised by benches thereof”. Sources said while the last chairperson, Justice (Retd) Pinaki Chandra Ghose, had constituted benches, current chairperson Justice A M Khanwilkar has other ideas. The purported reasoning is the chairperson’s keenness to have all members on board while deciding each complaint.Govt sources, however, indicated this means the chairperson gets to preside over each case, rather than allow diverse opinions to be presented by smaller benches. Benches also expedite disposal of complaints, sources added.TOI has learnt that the chairperson has been reluctant to route files through the Lokpal secretary.The law allows Lokpal to take up corruption complaints against the PM, Union ministers, MPs and govt officials. Lokpal cannot suo motu take up corruption cases.There is also a concern over Lokpal’s powers to overrule the opinion of the competent authority on granting prosecution sanction in corruption cases. “There is a view the competent authority is in a better position to take this call,” said a govt functionary.Though the law empowers Lokpal to independently conduct investigation and prosecution in corruption complaints, govt is yet to set up the inquiry and prosecution wings provided under the Act. Govt sources indicated CBI and CVC, which currently perform these functions under the direction and supervision of Lokpal, already have the competence, experienced staff and resources to do so.Unlike CBI and CVC, which do not examine the respondents at preliminary inquiry (PI) stage, the law gives Lokpal leeway to investigate a person at any stage, including soon after receiving the complaint. “The intent of the law is to strike a balance between probity and letting a public servant discharge their duties freely, without the sword of scrutiny hanging over them. Examination before PI risks loss of the respondent’s reputation,” said an officer.",Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act was enacted by UPA and rolled out by NDA. Some quarters in govt feel some of its key provisions may need a relook. The current chairperson has preferred to work through a single bench comprising all members.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125470937,imgsize-659073,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Calling for long-term peace in Manipur RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat , in his first visit to the state on Thursday said stability in the state will require “patience, collective effort, and social discipline,” adding that “destruction takes minutes, but construction requires years, especially when done inclusively and without harming anyone. ”Opening his three-day visit to Manipur with an address in Imphal, Bhagwat said efforts were underway at “community and societal level” to restore stability and stressed that responsibility could not rest with the government alone. “Awareness of the general public is the main factor. Everything should not be expected from the government, the responsibility of the society is very much required,” he said.He noted that the RSS was often discussed through “perceptions and propaganda,” and urged people to understand the organisation by observing its grassroots functioning. “There is no organisation comparable to the RSS, just as the sea, the sky, and the ocean have no comparison… To understand one has to visit Shakha,” he said, adding that the Sangh’s growth had been “organic” since its early years.Recalling founder KB Hedgewar’s life and role in the freedom movement, Bhagwat said Hedgewar’s “realisation of the need for a united and qualitatively improved society led to the creation of the RSS.”He described the organisation as a “man-making methodology” and reiterated that its objective was to “organise the whole Hindu society including those who oppose the Sangh, not creating a power centre within the society. ”Bhagwat said “Hindu” was a cultural and civilisational descriptor rather than a religious identity. Emphasising unity and social cohesion, he cited “Ekam Sat Vipra Bahudha Vadanti” and said diversity was “the manifestation of inherent unity within the society.”Outlining the RSS centenary-year “Panch Parivartan” initiatives - social harmony, family strengthening, environmental protection, swadeshi orientation and civic duty - he commended Manipur’s strong cultural traditions and encouraged their wider practice.Bhagwat added that strong social capital and skill development were essential for a self-reliant society, concluding with the Sangh’s long-standing ideal of “Sampoorna Samaj ka Sangathan by Sajjan Shakti.”","Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat is on a three-day visit to Manipur.

World Leaders In Shock As Clashes Erupt In Brazil, COP30 Stormed By Violent Indigenous Protesters

NEW DELHI: Pitching for expanding a unique model where bilateral cooperation can reinforce multilateral objectives, India has called an existing ‘joint crediting mechanism’ a key tool for global climate action, and urged countries to join this cooperative approach to collectively reduce their carbon footprints.The benefit of the mechanism was flagged by Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on the sidelines of the ongoing 30th session of the UN climate conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil on Wednesday.India is one of the 31 partner countries of the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), spearheaded by Japan, which provides a clear framework for both governments and the private sector to jointly develop mitigation projects, mobilise finance, deploy advanced technologies, and transparently allocate the resulting emission reductions credit among themselves.It’s a bilateral mechanism which is being implemented in accordance with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement that facilitates the creation and functioning of carbon markets as an emission reduction tool. India had joined the mechanism with Japan in August as part of the country’s first bilateral cooperation under the Paris Agreement. JCM is expected to serve as a model for achieving rapid economic growth while simultaneously addressing environmental challenges.Participating in the 11th JCM partner countries’ meeting, chaired by Japan’s environment minister Hirotaka Ishihara, Yadav highlighted the importance of cooperative mechanisms at a time when the world seeks scalable, equitable and technology-driven climate solutions. He underlined that the mechanism represents “a significant approach in strengthening efforts for climate action while supporting national priorities, particularly for developing countries”.Noting that the JCM would contribute directly to India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term low emission development strategy, Yadav said the move would help develop a domestic ecosystem and localise high-technology interventions, while also contributing to the country’s sustainable development goals.","India has called an existing ‘joint crediting mechanism’ a key tool for global climate action.

Bihar Assembly Poll Results: NDA Touches 200-Seat Lead, Congress Intensifies SIR, Vote Chori Attacks

NEW DELHI: Describing the ongoing Special Intensive Revision in West Bengal as “unplanned, chaotic, and dangerous,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday that the situation had reached an “alarming stage” following the deaths of multiple booth-level officers (BLOs), including an anganwadi worker in Jalpaiguri.In a letter addressed to CEC Gyanesh Kumar, Banerjee said she had “time and again flagged my serious concerns” but had now been “compelled to write” as the situation had deteriorated sharply.She wrote that the manner in which the EC had pushed the SIR onto officials and residents was “not only unplanned and chaotic, but also dangerous”, alleging the absence of basic preparedness, clear communication, or adequate planning.According to her, the process has been “crippled from day one” by poor training, confusion over mandatory documentation, and the near impossibility of meeting voters during their work hours.She warned that the credibility of the voter roll itself was at risk, saying BLOs were being forced to work “far beyond human limits” while balancing their principal duties as teachers and frontline workers.Banerjee said most BLOs were struggling with online submissions because of server failures and repeated data mismatches, making it “almost certain” that accurate voter data could not be uploaded by the 4 December deadline.She added that many BLOs, under fear of punitive action, were being pushed to submit incorrect entries, “risking disenfranchisement of genuine voters”.Mamata's letter came after, Shanti Muni Ekka, had repeatedly asked to be relieved from duties but was denied, her family said. Her inability to read or write Bengali and the need to visit tea garden workers late at night had left her “mentally devastated”, according to her son. Another BLO died earlier this month after a stroke allegedly linked to pressure to meet distribution targets.Earlier, on Wednesday the West Bengal CM had condemned what she describes as the “inhuman” pressure placed on field workers, following the death of a BLO in Jalpaiguri.She claimed 28 personnel have died since the SIR began and urged the ECI to suspend the drive, though opposition parties have dismissed her allegations.The national revision exercise, now in its second phase, has seen more than 50 crore enumeration forms distributed across 12 states and Union territories.The Election Commission of India (ECI) has urged the Nadia administration in West Bengal to complete digitising records from the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls by 26 November, as the state advances its preparations for forthcoming elections.

Despite the improvement, the air quality remained in the 'very poor' category, with several areas recording severe pollution levels, prompting authorities to maintain strict measures.Various monitoring stations across Delhi recorded concerning AQI levels. IGI Airport T3 registered 307, ITO showed 378, and Punjabi Bagh recorded 379. Other locations like Najafgarh, North Campus DU, Aya Nagar, and CRRI Mathura Road continued experiencing very poor air quality with readings between 340 and 385.Some areas in the capital faced severe air quality conditions. Anand Vihar recorded 418, while Ashok Vihar reported 411. Rohini and RK Puram registered even higher levels at 424 and 401 respectively.The air quality classification defines readings of 0-50 as 'good', 51-100 as 'satisfactory', 101-200 as 'moderate', 201-300 as 'poor', 301-400 as 'very poor', and 401-500 as 'severe'. Popular locations like India Gate, Akshardham, and Kartavya Path remained engulfed in dense smog on Friday morning.The Delhi high court addressed the situation by directing the Delhi Government to restrict outdoor sports activities for schoolchildren during the polluted winter months from November to January. Justice Sachin Datta emphasized the need to protect children's health by modifying the annual sports calendar.The Supreme Court took action by ordering subsistence allowances for construction workers who lost work due to the implementation of GRAP-3 in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. Chief Justice BR Gavai's bench instructed these state governments to implement preventive measures and conduct regular reviews of air pollution.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) implemented GRAP III on November 11 across the national capital. The measures include stricter restrictions on construction activities, vehicular movement, and industrial operations to control emissions in the region.The situation had remained consistently poor, with Delhi recording an AQI of 399 on Thursday morning and 392 on Wednesday, both falling in the ""very poor"" category.

Trump Admits Soft Spot for Elon Musk Despite Explosive Rift, Epstein Claims, and Public Attacks

Why Musk’s presence at Trump’s dinner is gaining attention







Tesla CEO Elon Musk was among the industry leaders and other guests who attended a high-profile dinner hosted by US President Donald Trump at the White House, marking a public reunion for the two powerful figures following a bitter public feud earlier this year. The gathering appears to signal a potential reunion between the billionaire business leader and the President.Musk had a dramatic falling out with the President earlier in the year. The CEO publicly attacked Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill as “fiscally reckless” and threatened to form a new political party. Trump responded by threatening to cut billions of dollars in federal subsidies received by Musk's companies. Public appearances of both together have been rare since the conflict. Previously, Musk was spotted shaking hands with Trump at a memorial event in September. This dinner is the second public appearance of both of them together after the feud, which was cited by analysts as a factor that negatively impacted Tesla's brand, sales, and stock price.Musk was an early supporter and close advisor to the Trump administration, even leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and overseeing federal cuts.Musk’s attendance at Tuesday night’s dinner – his first public White House visit since the fallout – drew immediate attention. A video shared widely on X captured the moment President Trump, accompanied by Melania Trump and the Saudi Crown Prince, spotted Musk.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Record earnings









Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed the growing concerns about an AI bubble. In recent months, investors and analysts have raised alarms about a potential AI bubble, warning that soaring spending by cloud providers and tech giants may prove unsustainable. Concerns have centered on whether the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure could mirror past boom-and-bust cycles in technology. Huang feels that the industry is presently undergoing some structural transformations and that it will sustain growth for the years to come. Speaking at the company’s earnings call, Huang said, “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.” The remarks made by Huang in AI bubble were quite expected as his company is presently at the centre of the artificial intelligence boom. Almost all the major cloud service provider such as Google, Amazon, Oracle are Nvidia’s customers.During the earnings call, Huang also laid down three major transitions which are fueling the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs.- From CPUs to GPUs - Firstly, Huang talked about the slow down of Moore’s law.He said that traditional computing is built around central processors and it is reaching its limit. Industries ranging from data processing to search and ad recommendations are shifting toward GPU-powered systems, which are uniquely suited to handle the massive computational demands of AI.- AI as a creator of new applications - Secondly Huang feels that AI is not just improving the existing tools but it is now unlocking completely new categories of applications. From generative models reshaping search and recommendations to advanced engineering solutions, AI is becoming the foundation for innovations that didn’t exist before.- Rise of Agentic and Physical AI - Lastly, Huang pointed out that the next-generation AI systems are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting and require minimal human intervention. These “agentic” and “physical” AI applications, such as coding assistants and robotics, will require unprecedented levels of computing power, further driving demand for Nvidia’s architecture.Huang believes that Nvidia’s singular architecture supports all three transitions across every industry and modality of AI, making the company uniquely positioned to power this next wave of infrastructure growth.Nvidia reported a record quarter with $57 billion revenue which is up by 62% year-over-year, and forecasted $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The shares of the company rose by 5% in after-hours trading. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress reinforced the bullish outlook, noting, “The clouds are sold out. Our GPU installed base is fully utilized.”","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed the growing concerns about an AI bubble.

"Verizon layoffs: America’s largest telecom company to cut 13,000 jobs, what CEO Dan Schulman said in internal memo",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/verizon-layoffs-americas-largest-telecom-company-to-cut-13000-jobs-what-ceo-dan-schulman-said-in-internal-memo/articleshow/125465746.cms,"Verizon layoffs 2025

How this compares to Verizon's previous layoffs









: Verizon has announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history, a report has said, adding that the job cuts come as the country’s largest wireless carrier struggles with competitive pressures and a shrinking customer base. CEO Dan Schulman, who took the helm in October after serving on Verizon’s board since 2018, cited the need to streamline operations and reduce costs that are limiting the company's ability to invest in customer value.“Our current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,"" Schulman wrote in an internal memo obtained by news agency Reuters. “We must simplify our operations to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers”.The telecom giant plans to significantly reduce not only its direct workforce but also outsourced and external labour expenses, the report noted. Additionally, Verizon will convert 179 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations and close one location.Meanwhile, a company spokesperson told CNBC that the job cuts are “an opportunity for Verizon to reset, restructure and realign our priorities on ways that will help us regain our leadership as a communications provider.”This represents Verizon's largest-ever single job cut. The company had approximately 1,00,000 US employees at the end of 2024, including around 70,000 non-union workers. Over the previous three years, Verizon had already eliminated nearly 20,000 positions, making the current reduction particularly dramatic.Verizon is establishing a $20 million career transition fund specifically for laid-off workers, focusing on “opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI.” The company emphasised that the job cuts were not driven by AI implementation.Reports say that Verizon is facing competition from established rivals offering cheaper plans and cable operators entering the wireless market. The company added just 44,000 monthly bill-paying wireless subscribers in the third quarter, significantly trailing AT&T and far behind T-Mobile, which led the industry with over 1 million net subscriber additions.Schulman inherited substantial challenges from his predecessor at PayPal, arriving amid aggressive promotions from AT&T and T-Mobile surrounding new iPhone launches. Despite massive investments—including $52 billion for 5G spectrum in 2021, a $20 billion Frontier Communications acquisition, and $6 billion for TracFone Wireless—Verizon continues to lose ground in the competitive landscape.","Verizon announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history.

A room full of startup founders and investors at the world's biggest AI conference votes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI among 'likely flops',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-biggest-ai-conference-votes-sam-altmans-openai-among-likely-flops/articleshow/125364076.cms,"Representative Image

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’





OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference.

"'Privilege, not a right': UK plans to make some legal migrants wait 20 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/privilege-not-a-right-uk-plans-to-make-some-legal-migrants-wait-20-years-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125476411.cms,"Crackdown amid political pressure

Longer waits for indefinite leave to remain

Concerns over migration 'scale'

Reform UK pushes further Right

Albanian leader slams 'Far-Right rhetoric'





Britain’s Labour government plans to require some legal migrants to wait up to 20 years before applying for permanent settlement, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced on Thursday. The move is part of a broader strategy to curb legal migration and follows recent changes to rules governing irregular arrivals.The dual tightening of legal and irregular migration rules comes as public support grows for the hardline Reform UK party, led by anti-immigration campaigner Nigel Farage, and amid concerns over pressure on overstretched public services.“To settle in this country forever is not a right, but a privilege, and it must be earned,” Mahmood — herself the daughter of immigrants — told parliament.The government had already signalled plans to double the qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) from five to 10 years. On Thursday, Mahmood set out additional steps: migrants using regular routes who have claimed benefits for more than 12 months will face a 20-year wait for ILR. For those entering irregularly, the waiting period rises to 30 years.Some low-skilled workers on post-Brexit health and social care visas, as well as migrants with under 12 months of benefit claims, will face a 15-year wait.Doctors, nurses and other public service workers can still qualify after five years, while high earners may become eligible in three, the interior ministry said.The proposals, now open to a 12-week consultation, are intended to take effect from next April.Mahmood said migration would “always be a vital part of Britain’s story” but argued the recent “scale” of arrivals had been “destabilising.” Government estimates suggest that roughly 1.6 million people could become eligible for ILR between 2026 and 2030 due to rising net migration.Under the new rules, ILR applicants must have a clean criminal record, high-level English proficiency, no debts and at least three years of social security tax payments. ILR status allows individuals to live, work and study in the UK without restriction and is a key step toward citizenship.Reform UK -- which has led Labour in some polls this year -- has pledged to abolish ILR altogether and make migrants reapply for visas every five years, including those already granted permanent status. Mahmood stressed that Labour’s proposals would not affect people who currently hold settled status.Earlier in the week, she announced reductions in refugee protections and threatened visa bans for countries refusing to take back irregular migrants arriving by small boats. These measures have drawn criticism from refugee groups and triggered concern within Labour’s left flank.Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama accused Mahmood of echoing “the rhetoric of the populist far-right” and engaging in “ethnic stereotyping” after she highlighted “700 Albanian families living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims.”","Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announces changes to immigration rules.

US President Donald Trump has withdrawn steep tariffs on a wide range of Brazilian food products — including beef, coffee, cocoa, fruits and tomatoes — in a major reversal of policies that had sharply increased costs for American consumers.The decision, announced on Thursday, removes the 40% duties that were imposed in July as retaliation for Brazil’s prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro, as per news agency AFP.According to the executive order published by the White House, the exemptions will apply to Brazilian shipments arriving in the United States on or after November 13.The move may also require Washington to refund duties collected while the tariffs were still in force.Rollback widens a growing list of exclusions from tariff regimes introduced in recent months, as Trump faces voter frustration over the rising cost of living.Brazil supplies around one-third of the coffee consumed in the United States — the world’s largest coffee market — and has become an increasingly important source of beef, particularly the kind used for burgers, reported Reuters.US retail coffee prices climbed as much as 40% this year, driven by the tariffs and weather-related production shortages.Trump’s falling approval ratings have been closely tied to food inflation, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.Importers reacted quickly to the announcement. Commodities analyst Judith Ganes was quoted by Reuters as saying, ""You can expect some thousands of bags of Brazilian coffee that were sitting in bonded warehouses to start moving quickly to US roasters.""Many importers had stored goods in such facilities, which allow products to be held without paying duties, in the hope that the tariffs would eventually be reversed.Brazil’s beef industry welcomed the decision. The trade group ABIEC was cited by Reuters as saying, ""The decision (to lift Brazil tariffs) shows the effectiveness of the trade negotiations,"" adding that it intends to keep pushing to expand its access to the US market.Trump’s order did not address the sanctions he imposed earlier this year on Brazilian officials involved in the prosecution of Bolsonaro, who was convicted in September for plotting to overturn the 2022 election result.Brazil’s Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes and his wife were previously sanctioned under the Global Magnitsky Act, and some officials had their US visas revoked.Officials cited by AFP justified the new tariff exemptions by saying that there had been “initial progress in negotiations with the Government of Brazil.”An annex to the order lists the agricultural items no longer subject to the additional 40% duty, with exclusions backdated to November 13.Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva welcomed the shift, saying he was pleased that the punitive tariff had been removed, reported Reuters.",US President Donald Trump has withdrawn steep tariffs on a wide range of Brazilian food products.

We will have to wait and see how this volatile phase unfolds.”“There is excessive speculative trading in many stocks in India, particularly in some newly listed stocks. Retail investors better avoid such speculative trades which usually end in tears for the vast majority.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Visa Breach Ends India Visit for Blacklisted UK Scholar and Hindi Literature Expert Francesca Orsini





: PoK-origin UK home secretary Shabana Mahmood announced Monday that Trump-style visa bans will be imposed on countries unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants, as she revealed further sweeping reforms to tackle illegal immigration.The first countries to face such a ban are Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo whose nationals will no longer be granted UK visas unless their govts rapidly improve cooperation on removals. “These countries face penalties for their unacceptably low co-operation and obstructive returns processes. Thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from these nations are currently in the UK,” the home office said.Non-cooperation includes embassies failing to process removals paperwork in time and requiring individuals to sign their own documentation — allowing them to block their own deportation.India is thought to be one of several other countries most resistant to taking back illegal migrants and could join the list over the coming year, the Times (UK) reported.Human rights laws will also be overhauled to scale up deportations and prevent migrants from “gaming the system”.UK’s govt will legislate to reform how Article 8 (the right to family and private life) is interpreted by the courts to make clear a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child — blocking people from using dubious connections to stay in the UK. It will also work with partners at the Council of Europe to address the “over-expansive application” of Article 3 (protection against inhuman and degrading treatments) which migrants are also using to block their removal and introduce new legislation to crack down on “migrants making last-minute bogus modern slavery claims”. Migrants will be restricted to arguing all legal grounds within a single appeal and, if they lose, they will be forced to leave.New capped work and study routes for genuine refugees will be created who will be referred through partners such as the UNHCR. British people will be encouraged to house them, as they have done for Ukrainians, to end the reliance on asylum hotels, which cost £2.1 billion in 2024-2025.In the year ending June 2025 a total of 5,475 Indian nationals claimed asylum in the UK making them the sixth-largest nationality. Of these, 346 Indians arrived by small boat illegally. The other Indians were mostly on visas, with student visas being the most common. The top nationality to claim asylum was Pakistani; followed by nationals from Afghanistan, Iran, Eritrea and Bangladesh.Only 20 Indians were granted asylum in the year ending June 2025, and 2,691 had their claims refused.","Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo will face visa bans unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants.
