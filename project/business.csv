'Business-like approach unlikely to succeed': India cautions UNGA over Afghanistan; abstains on draft resolution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-cautions-against-business-like-approach-for-afghanistan-abstains-in-unga-draft-resolution-passed/articleshow/122309439.cms,"India's UN envoy P Harish (File Photo)

India on Monday abstained in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on a draft resolution on Afghanistan, with its envoy to the UN noting that a “business as usual” approach is unlikely to deliver outcomes which the global community envisions for the Afghan people.The UNGA adopted the Germany-introduced draft resolution on the situation in the Asian nation. It was passed with 116 votes in favour; two against and 12 abstentions, including India.Explaining the decision, the country's UN Permanent Representative P Harish said, ""Any coherent policy to address a post-conflict situation must combine a mix of policy instruments – incentivising positive behaviour and disincentivising harmful actions. A 'business as usual' approach, without new and targeted initiatives, is unlikely to deliver the outcomes the international community envisions for the Afghan people. ""The diplomat added that no new policy instruments have been introduced to address the worsening humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan since August 2021, when the Taliban again took over the reins in Kabul.“An approach focused only on punitive measures, in our view, is unlikely to succeed.The United Nations and the broader international community have adopted more balanced and nuanced approaches in other post-conflict contexts,” Harish asserted.Further, he stressed that New Delhi is ""closely monitoring"" the security situation in Afghanistan, and underscored that the international community must direct its coordinated efforts towards ensuring that entities and individuals designated by the UN Security Council no longer exploit the Afghan territory for terrorist activities - a veiled reference to Pakistan.Reiterating India’s historic ties with the people of Afghanistan and its enduring commitment to meeting their humanitarian and developmental needs, he stated that while New Delhi remains committed to continued engagement with all relevant stakeholders and broadly supports the international community’s efforts towards a stable, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan, “India has decided to abstain on this resolution. ”","The UNGA adopted the Germany-introduced draft resolution on the situation in the Asian nation.

Ram Madhav:

VP Dhankhar Jokes About Being ‘Punching Bag’ in RS | Humorous Jibe at Cong, Govt Sparks Laughter

What will drive national growth in this new environment?

Madhav:

What about defense manufacturing?

Madhav:

You spoke of building “Brand Bharat.” What does that entail?

Madhav:

You’ve also used the term ‘dharmocracy’. Can you explain that?

Madhav:

Can foreign universities in India help promote Brand Bharat?

Madhav:

RSS is entering its 100th year. What is the vision going forward?

Madhav:

You have worked extensively in the Northeast. What explains the political shift there?

Madhav:

And RSS's role there?

Madhav:

In a wide-ranging conversation with the Times of India, Ram Madhav , senior RSS member, outlines the strategic reorientation India must undertake to navigate a changing global order. From foreign policy to technology, economic growth to ideological values, and the Northeast to dharmocracy, Madhav, who also heads the think tank India Foundation, reflects on India's opportunities and challenges in the coming decades.There is a big churn happening globally. The world is heading towards a completely different order after seven decades of a certain kind of geopolitical atmosphere. When you're confronted with a new order, you must shed some of the old habits and practices. I often cite Mao's infamous Cultural Revolution — not to endorse it, but as a metaphor. You need to think afresh.Historically, Indians have been very comfortable looking West — towards Europe and America. We do have strong ties with them. But a shift began with Narasimha Rao and taken further by Vajpayee through the Look East policy, which Modi upgraded to Act East. However, we still remain predominantly westward-facing. Meanwhile, the entire Eurasian region is in turmoil — the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Gaza-Israel tensions, and the Iran-Israel-US confrontation. These conflicts may end, but their impact will last for decades. In such a scenario, India must turn to its immediate and extended neighbourhood — Southeast Asia, ASEAN, and then the Global South, including Africa and Latin America.In the past, trade — especially in goods — powered national growth. Now, it will be technology. Prime Minister Modi has rightly focused on this with initiatives like the National Research Foundation and an emphasis on areas like quantum technology. But we still have a lot of ground to cover. Domestically, we must prioritise the economy over the next 20 years — something like what Bill Clinton famously said: “It’s the economy, stupid. ”Take China — between 1980 and 2000, it focused solely on economic growth. Deng Xiaoping even put communism on hold to prioritise economic development. India must aim for sustained 9–10% growth. The current 8% is good, but we must aspire for more.That’s a massive opportunity. Everyone talks about India's weakness in manufacturing, and it's true. But manufacturing has saturated globally, defense manufacturing has huge potential. India itself is a major consumer of defense equipment. Given the current global war-like environment, every nation is ramping up its defense. This is a golden opportunity not just for ‘Make in India’ but ‘Make for the World’. That’s where we can become a manufacturing powerhouse.In the outgoing world order — post-World War II — Western powers created institutions aligned with their interests and were able to set their agenda. But today, the West is no longer in a position to dictate the global agenda. If India doesn’t take a proactive role, others like China will. India must assert itself not just as an economic and technological power, but also ideologically.Democracy is one such idea. The Chinese model offers economic freedom but not political freedom. Ours is different — full freedoms, rooted in pluralism, respect for sovereignty, patriotism, and sustainability. These are values India must articulate. Take yoga — that’s one idea we gave to the world. The last profound political idea from India was Gandhi’s non-violence. We must now think of the next idea. That’s what I mean by Brand Bharat.Democracy, in its Western sense, often equates to majoritarianism — majority wins, period. In a dharmocracy, the majority may form a government, but governance must be through consensus. Gandhi’s idea of Ram Rajya was not a theocracy — it was a model where the weakest had as much power as the strongest. Deendayal Upadhyaya also said that elections are majoritarian, but governance must be consensus-driven. That’s the Indian model — dharmocracy.Absolutely. Earlier, foreign dignitaries visiting India were taken to Qutub Minar or Red Fort — symbols of our subjugation. Today, they also visit temples, attend Ganga Aarti. That’s our civilizational identity. But we can build up on that. With nearly 100 foreign institutions now allowed to open campuses in India, they will engage with India from the inside. However, they will mostly teach Indian students. So our education system must consciously integrate Brand Bharat thinking.Formal centenary celebrations begin in October. The Sarsanghchalak will share the vision then. But as someone associated with RSS for decades, I can say this: it’s a unique organisation. In 100 years, there has been no split, no dissidence, no weakening — only growth. It's entirely voluntary. No one is paid. It’s run by those who see it as a duty.Its openness, adaptability, and relevance in every era are its strengths. Whether during the 1962 war, the Emergency, or the Ram Janmabhoomi movement — RSS remained central to India’s national life. It is an organisation that deserves academic study in itself.I don’t believe in right-left binaries. But yes, the rise of BJP and nationalist sentiments in the Northeast, especially in the last 10 years, has brought emotional integration with the rest of India. Earlier, people there felt Delhi was another country. That has changed. Under PM Modi, every week a minister visited some state. This continuous engagement built a sense of belonging.When we contested in Nagaland in 2017, even in remote villages, BJP flags were seen. We won 12 out of 20 seats we contested. Such change signals, besides representing BJP’s appeal, a deep emotional integration.RSS has worked there under extremely difficult conditions. Cadres were kidnapped, tortured, even killed. Yet they went from across India — from Kerala, Maharashtra — to serve those areas, often with no knowledge of local languages or familiarity of food habits. Organisations like Vivekananda Kendra and Ramakrishna Mission played vital roles in tribal education and cultural pride.Today, Arunachal Pradesh, for instance, communicates in Hindi. That wasn’t imposed — it evolved naturally due to years of engagement. That silent foundational work held the region together in its most fragile times.","Senior RSS member Ram Madhav outlines the strategic reorientation India must undertake to navigate a changing global order.

Voter roll revision: What is special intensive revision of Bihar voter list and what's the controversy - Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/voter-roll-revision-what-is-special-intensive-revision-of-bihar-voter-list-and-whats-the-controversy-explained/articleshow/122308956.cms,"Representative image

Why the revision?

Migrants need not panic

Why not Aadhaar, MGNREGA or ration cards?

Documents accepted eligible voters may submit any of the following

Govt-issued pension order Pre1987 official document from any govt or PSU Birth certificate Passport matriculation orother school certificates Permanent residence certificate Forest rights certificate Caste certificate NRC (where available) Family register from local authorities Land or house allotment certificate from govt agencies

Oppn demands & concerns

EC response

A special revision of Bihar’s electoral rolls has triggered political friction before this year’s assembly elections, with opposition parties questioning the document requirements and timing. Supreme Court will hear petitions on July 10 challenging EC’s decision to carry out the exercise in the poll-bound state .EC says the special intensive revision (SIR) aims to eliminate duplicate and bogus voters, especially those listed both at permanent and current addresses. EC insists that only residents currently living in an area should be on its voter rolls, in accordance with constitutional norms ensuring that only Indian citizens can vote. The exercise, last conducted in 2003, targets updated enrolment and removal of ineligible entries. Bihar currently has around 7.9 crore registered voters.Millions of Bihar residents have migrated elsewhere for work or education but remain enrolled in their native constituencies. EC clarifies that names already in the 2003 electoral rolls — available at https:// voters.eci.gov.in — or of their descendants need no documentary proof of ancestry when submitting the fresh enumeration forms being distributed by boothlevel officers.EC excludes Aadhaar, ration, and MGNREGA cards from valid proof, citing concerns that illegal immigrants, especially from Bangladesh, may have obtained these documents. Govt fears such entries in border regions like Seemanchal, near Bengal and Nepal. Aadhaar-based documents are seen as vulnerable to misuse and suspected foreigners flagged by officials can be referred under Citizenship Act.Opposition parties argue that most accepted documents require Aadhaar-based verification. They also cite the 2011 socio-economic census showing that 65.58% of rural households in Bihar own no land - making land-linked documents inaccessible to many . Critics say the short deadline - less than a month - is insufficient, especially for those lacking birth or school certificates.CEC Gyanesh Kumar said the process would ensure inclusion of all eligible voters. EC clarified that if documents are found lacking after the draft rolls are published on Aug 1, voters will have another opportunity to submit them during the scrutiny phase.","EC excludes Aadhar, ration, and MGNREGA cards from valid proof.

NEW DELHI: Several areas of Delhi experienced rainfall on Monday morning, bringing much-needed relief from the hot and humid weather that had gripped the city over the past few days.The rain began early, with low-hanging clouds blanketing the skies across the capital. The showers helped lower temperatures and ease the lingering humidity.However, the persistent rain also led to waterlogging in some parts of the city, including the Mehrauli-Badarpur Road. Vehicles were seen navigating through the flooded streets, causing traffic disruptions in affected areas.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Monday, warning of thunderstorms, lightning, and squalls across all districts of Delhi.The advisory covers north, north-east, north-west, south, south-west, south-east, and west Delhi, where storm activity is expected today.As of now, no weather alerts have been issued for the coming days.In a press statement released on July 6, IMD Delhi said, “Generally cloudy skies. Light to moderate rain with thunderstorm/lightning likely in the next 48 hours.”Earlier on Sunday morning, parts of Delhi experienced rainfall.The IMD also noted that the monsoon trough at mean sea level currently stretches from Suratgarh, Sirsa, Delhi, Lucknow, Varanasi, Daltonganj, Bankura, Digha, and extends southeastward to the northeast Bay of Bengal. Additionally, an upper-air cyclonic circulation has formed over Himachal Pradesh and adjoining Punjab at approximately 1.5 km above sea level.In light of the weather conditions, Delhi airport issued a passenger advisory at 06:51 hours, urging travelers to use the metro or other public transport options to reach the airport.Meanwhile, Himachal Pradesh continues to reel under a severe monsoon spell, with the cumulative death toll reaching 75. This includes 45 fatalities directly linked to rain and 30 accidental deaths caused by road mishaps, electrocution, and even a gas cylinder blast, as per data from the State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC).","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Monday, warning of thunderstorms, lightning, and squalls across all districts of Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The alertness of Delhi air traffic control (ATC) and pilots operating a SWISS flight to IGIA late Sunday (July 6) saved the day when another aircraft ahead of the European airliner first slowed down in air and then didn't vacate the runway from the first available rapid exit taxiway. As a result, the spacing between the two arriving aircraft in air reduced from the four nautical miles that was being maintained by ATC at that time and then the other plane was on the runway for 25-30 seconds longer than it should have. The ATC asked pilots of the SWISS Airbus A330 to go around when it was at an altitude of about 1,400 feet and it then landed safely in the second attempt.This happened after 11.40 pm on Sunday when SWISS LX 146 was flying in from Zurich and an Indian carrier’s A320 from Phuket was ahead of it in the sequence of landing. According to senior ATC officials, the aircraft flying in from Phuket was “four nautical miles (NM) from touchdown on runway 11R and LX 146 behind it was about eight NM from touchdown. The other aircraft reduced speed on final approach. Subsequently, Swiss was also asked to reduce speed to minimum speed by the approach controller. ”ATC asked the SWISS flight to “continue approach” because even this slightly reduced horizontal separation would have been enough for it to land had the other plane landed and vacated runway 11R using the first rapid exit taxiway.Made at 120 degrees to the runway, this alignment of the Y1 rapid exit taxiway would have made it possible for the aircraft to vacate the runway on landing roll itself and then LX 146 touching down.“After landing, tower controller (ATC) asked pilot of the other plane to vacate the runway via rapid exit taxiway Y1. But the pilot informed that the aircraft will vacate the runway by Y2, which is further down the runway and farther away from Y1. This resulted in increased runway occupancy time by 25-30 seconds,” said the official.Since this flight could not vacate the runway in time, the tower controller asked the SWISS flight to “go around” or carry out a missed approach for “safety reasons.” Flight tracking sites show the Lufthansa group airliner did so when it was at an altitude of 1,400 feet. It landed safely in its second attempt at 11.51 pm, as per flight tracking sites.At that time, Delhi was witnessing easterly winds — which is a common during monsoon. IGIA’s main runway 10/28 has been closed for repairs since June 15. With three operational runways (minus 10/28) and easterly winds, Delhi can handle a maximum of up to 32 arrivals in an hour. While learning from the fiasco earlier this summer, number of flights has been cut at Delhi. Still ATC and pilots have to be extra careful to operate in circumstances to maximise aircraft movement.“We are operating amid a shortage of experienced manpower. Whether it is Delhi or Mumbai, the crunch situation leaves low margin for error. An aircraft slowing down or taking longer than anticipated to vacate the runway, means quick decisions in real time to ensure safety,” said multiple air traffic controllers.","The alertness of Delhi air traffic control (ATC) and pilots operating a SWISS flight to IGIA late Sunday (July 6) saved the day. Another aircraft ahead of the European airliner first slowed down in air and then didn't vacate the runway from the first available rapid exit taxiway. As a result, the spacing between the two arriving aircraft in air reduced from the four nautical miles that was being maintained by ATC.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122305062,imgsize-1182571,width-400,resizemode-4/122305062.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of batting for Chinese military hardware and said that Raebareli MP has a knack for ending up on the wrong side of the patriotic discourse.BJP IT chief Amit Malviya on Monday claimed that in 2021, Rahul Gandhi questioned why Indian forces did not use Chinese-style surveillance drones and even praised the PLA’s tactics during the Ladakh standoff.""At an academic interaction in London (2023), he claimed China is winning the “technology race” and urged India to learn from Chinese military innovation, including drone warfare,"" Malviya said in a post on X and added that Rahul Gandhi has a curious obsession with Chinese military tech.""During a 2022 closed-door discussion with defence ‘experts’, Rahul reportedly pressed for India to 'explore options' similar to China’s tactical drone deployment in border areas.

NEW DELHI: In a move that will help owners of electric vehicles (EVs) get precise details of the batteries being used, India will soon have its own ""Battery Passport"" regime. Under the system, the specifications of every battery, including its origin, performance, composition, end of life and the entire supply cycle will be captured digitally and embedded in a QR code. Niti Aayog has started deliberations with ministries and govt departments on the proposed framework, sources said. Officials highlighted that a battery passport serves as an Aadhaar identity of sorts, with every battery having a unique ID that provides all information on the product.The initiative will not only improve safety and quality standards but also accelerate export of EVs from India. Significantly, India is offering incentives to global EV players to set up plants and export their vehicles from India. It will also be crucial when govt rolls out a battery swapping policy for vehicles, allowing owners to access details of batteries by scanning the QR code printed on them.The need for such a regime was first felt after a series of fire incidents involving electric two-wheelers and cars. Industry insiders said there had been instances of companies importing battery cells of different vintages and using them as part of the same modules.""When cells made in different years are joined together, there is more load on new cells, as the older ones are closer to their expiry date. Such a module impacts performance and can be a safety hazard,"" said a source.Officials privy to govt's plan said once the battery passport system is implemented, it will be possible to ensure that cells in any battery are manufactured in the same year. Through it, users will get to know about the lifecycle and performance of batteries, which is key considering they account for nearly 40% of the costs of EVs, an official said.A source said, ""This move will help achieve three major goals: trade (export of electric vehicles), safety and quality"".The European Union in 2023 enacted the Battery Regulation making it mandatory for every industrial or EV battery in EU with a capacity of over 2 kWh to have a battery passport. It will come into force on Feb 1, 2027. The battery passports will require inputs from mining and refining companies, cell and battery producers, vehicle brands, and battery servicing, refurbishing, and recycling companies.The EU rules specify that the battery passport must contain all information, including unique identifier, basic characteristics of the battery including type and model, updated statistics on performance and durability, and carbon footprint specific to the manufacturing site and batch of batteries. This information will need to be selectively shared with three groups: the general public, regulatory bodies, and battery service and end-of-life processors.","The specifications of every battery, including its origin, performance, composition, end of life and the entire supply cycle will be captured digitally and embedded in a QR code.

NEW DELHI: India's education system continues to struggle with critical gaps in foundational literacy and numeracy, teacher training and financing, even as it shows consistent gains in gender parity, school completion rates and digital infrastructure. As per the 2025 Unesco SDG 4 scorecard, the country remains off-track in upper secondary and tertiary participation, lags behind global spending benchmarks, and has significant shortfalls in training qualified pre-primary teachers, though it has nearly universalised primary and lower secondary education and is improving internet connectivity in schools.India's performance on foundational learning is a key area of concern, with the report saying that countries, including India, are ""off track by 11 percentage points"" from the benchmark for achieving minimum reading proficiency by the end of primary education. India's benchmark for this indicator is 56%, but the actual achievement is substantially lower.In contrast, high-income countries reported reading proficiency levels nearing 99%, while South Asia's regional average stood at 49%. ""The large gap...is likely result of limited experience in setting realistic targets on learning outcomes, which reflects low data availability,"" it said.Gender parity is one area where India has made notable progress.The report classifies India among countries that have shown ""fast progress"" in narrowing the gender gap in upper secondary completion. India's 2025 benchmark reflects a gap of 2.3 percentage points, compared to a regional average of 3.4. ""Countries which started with a disadvantage at the expense of girls are moving towards parity,"" the report said, adding that India is aligned with this trend.Upper secondary and tertiary participation remains a serious concern. India's 2025 benchmark for upper secondary completion is 67%, but the projected out-of-school rate for youth in the 15-17 age group is still 21%. South Asia performs slightly better with a projected 13% out-of-school rate, while high-income countries have nearly achieved universal participation with rates under 2%. The report observed that ""already by 2025, it is projected that countries were off track by. ..six percentage points for upper secondary school age youth"".India's public expenditure on education was 3.1% of GDP in 2023, below the SDG benchmark of 4% and far from the National Education Policy's aspirational target of 6%. This places India below the South Asian average of 3.4% and significantly behind high-income countries, which spend between 4.8% and 5.5% of GDP. The scorecard showed, ""Countries are moving backwards in terms of public education spending, which was further away from the twin thresholds of 4% of GDP and 15% of total public expenditure in 2023 than in 2015. ""India has also not met its target for trained pre-primary teachers. The 2025 benchmark is set at 88%, but progress is slow and data limited. The report said, ""Countries are furthest behind from their 2025 national targets in training pre-primary school teachers"", with a global shortfall of seven percentage points.However, India's primary and lower secondary completion rates remain strong. The 2025 benchmarks for completion are 92% and 84%, respectively, placing India above the South Asia average of 91% for primary and 88% for lower secondary, though trailing high-income countries where completion is near-universal.While many low- and lower-middle-income countries struggle with data and implementation, India has submitted benchmarks for net connectivity in schools and is moving forward through programmes aligned with NEP. As 2030 SDG deadline approaches, the report urged countries to accelerate action.","India's education system continues to struggle with critical gaps in foundational literacy and numeracy.

Data shows that there has been a more than five-fold increase in booking by drivers in June compared to the April-May period.While there were 3,348 bookings in April-May or 55 per day during the two months, this surged to 16,559 bookings or 552 per day in June. Govt expects that as the number offacilities increase, there will be a further rise in the number of bookings. The scheme was launched to address the hardship faced by drivers who often slept in trucks or at dhahas due to lack of good and affordable places along highways.Officials said over 65,000 drivers have downloaded the Apna Ghar mobile app and registered on it. To attract more users, a scheme offering free dormitory stays was introduced in June 2025 with the condition that drivers have to buy 50 litres of high-speed diesel from Apna Ghar sites. The promotional scheme will run for three months, they said.As of June, 368 Apna Ghar have been set up by oil marketing companies (OMCs) including four on the under-construction Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. The entire expressway have 30 such facilities.Petroleum and natural gas minister Hardeep Singh Puri on X said, ""Most of the accidents on highways are caused by drivers not taking rest and not getting enough sleep.

Shortage of surgeons & retrieval centres hinders organ transplants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shortage-of-surgeons-retrieval-centres-hinders-organ-transplants/articleshow/122308355.cms,"AI-generated image

NEW DELHI: India requires to perform at least one lakh kidney transplants in a year. However, data shows that only 13,476 kidney transplants could be carried out in 2024, meaning that the rest of individuals in need continued to suffer with kidney dysfunction or, in some cases, succumbed due to complications. Similarly, patients suffering from end-stage failure of other organ systems face the same crisis. Recently, govt held a review meeting to assess what ails the organ transplant process in the country.A government report, accessed by TOI, is based on a recent review of organ transplantation activities in government hospitals by the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO). It suggests mandating govt medical colleges and associated hospitals, including trauma centres, to establish organ retrieval facilities even if they do not perform transplants themselves.Also, it has been strongly recommended that liver and heart transplants, including the lifelong costs of immunosuppressants for transplant recipients, be comprehensively included under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.The review meeting was chaired by NOTTO head Dr Anil Kumar. More than 130 medical superintendents, nodal officers for transplant centres and transplant surgeons, among others, participated.Govt hospitals, with their extensive infrastructure and high patient volumes, particularly in trauma and critical care units, are in a position to expand the national deceased organ donation programme. However, it was noted at the meeting many govt institutions that have been granted licences for organ transplants were not performing them in adequate numbers, with number of deceased donations being either nil or very low.For example, while govt institutions like IKDRC Ahmedabad (508 total organ transplants in 2024, including 195 cadaveric transplants), PGIMER Chandigarh (320 total organ transplants in 2024, including 55 cadaveric transplants) performed adequately well, institutions like GB Pant Hospital in New Delhi did not carry out any transplant despite having the physical infrastructure and licence.It is important that before considering financial support for establishing new transplant/retrieval centres, the status of existing transplant/retrieval centres and the factors which impede their performance are ascertained, the NOTTO meeting concluded.Some centres reported inadequate funds to initiate or restart specialised transplant programmes such as lung transplantation, which requires expensive equipment and preservatives. The issue of high cost of immunosuppressant drugs, which patients must take for life, was also raised at the meeting.The national organ transplant body has suggested the introduction of a system of financial incentives for key organ donation and transplant team members (surgeons, coordinators, etc.) for each successful transplant and/or organ retrieval case.","Data shows that only 13,476 kidney transplants could be carried out in 2024.

NEW DELHI: Hailing the armed forces for the valour they displayed during Operation Sindoor post the Pahalgam terror attack , defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday that “peace time is an illusion and India must remain prepared for any uncertainty”.The defence minister praised the armed forces for Operation Sindoor but said the larger geopolitical situation leaves no scope for complacency in the effort to enhance preparedness. “A single delay or error in financial processes can directly affect operational preparedness,” said the minister while addressing the Controllers Conference of the Defence Accounts Department (DAD).Talking about rising demand for desi weapons of late, Rajnath said, “The world is looking at our defence sector with new respect. Operation Sindoor has boosted global demand for our indigenous armaments. Most of the equipment we once imported is now being made in India. Our reforms are succeeding because of the clarity of vision and commitment at the highest level. Sudden developments can force a complete shift in our financial and operational posture. ” The minister spoke in the presence of Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi, Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K.Tripathi, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh and defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh at the conference.The govt has over the past few years allowed the armed forces to procure arms and ammunition through the “emergency” route. Post-Operation Sindoor, it cleared a range of acquisitions for the armed forces.The armed forces have consistently complained, often publicly, about acquisitions being delayed because of the rigid approach of the bureaucracy and auditors. Rajnath called on DAD to evolve from a “controller” to a “facilitator” in sync with increasing participation of the private sector in defence. He praised DAD’s new motto “Alert, Agile, Adaptive” and noted that these are not mere words, but a reflection of the work culture required in today's rapidly evolving defence environment. “Whether it’s stepping up equipment production or adapting financial processes, we must be ready with innovative techniques and responsive systems at all times,” the minister said.Citing the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute report, which said global military expenditure reached $2.7 trillion in 2024, Rajnath said, “This opens up tremendous opportunities for India's indigenous defence industries.”The minister also said that gone were the days when expenditure in the defence sector was only considered necessary and never viewed as an economic catalyst. “Now, it is being seen as a spending which has a multiplier impact on the economy,” he said. “Earlier, there was no assessment of the economic impact of expenditure on security but things have changed now when investment in re-armament is rising exponentially. We need to pay special attention to defence economics,” he said.Singh said India, along with the rest of the world, is entering a new phase of re-armament, marked by capital-intensive investments in the defence sector. He called upon DAD to incorporate defence economics in their planning and assessments, including social impact analysis of R&D projects and dual-use technologies.Highlighting the increasing strategic and economic significance of the defence sector, Rajnath called for a shift in perception from defence spending as mere expenditure to an economic investment with multiplier impact. “Until recently, defence budgets were not seen as part of the national economy. Today, they are growth drivers,” he said.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday that “peace time is an illusion and India must remain prepared for any uncertainty’ He was addressing the Controllers Conference of the Defence Accounts Department (DAD) “A single delay or error in financial processes can directly affect operational preparedness,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122307770,imgsize-1846138,width-400,resizemode-4/122307770.jpg"

If two arms of govt are taking a different stance, how is the offence possible?"" he asked.ED alleges that Young Indian, in which Sonia Gandhi Rahul Gandhi owned 76% stakes, fraudulently usurped AJL's assets valued at Rs 2,000 crore in exchange for a loan of Rs 90 crore. ED's counsel had earlier said that AICC released Rs 90 to AJL with the intent to take over its properties through Young Indian.Another accused, Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd, argued that the ED wrongly proceeded in the case as it registered an ECIR (equivalent to FIR) on June 30, 2021, without obtaining a registered copy of the original complaint by Subramanian Swamy.","Young Indian Private Ltd, one of the defendants, contending that ED's chargesheet contradicted the income tax department's finding.

AHMEDABAD: Around 21 years after the death of private firm employee, Sureshchandra, his wife Varsha Shukla and their son Vikrant will receive his Provident Fund (PF), following a 15-year-long legal battle.Sureshchandra's other wife, Hinarani, and daughter Vilaspati had objected to Varsha's PF claim. Last week, city civil court granted a succession certificate to Varsha and Vikrant, stating the deceased employee's PF amount of over Rs 10 lakh should be handed over to them.Sureshchandra died in May 2004 without a will. In Jan 2009, Varsha received a letter from the commissioner of EPFO, informing her that Hinarani had claimed Sureshchandra's PF amount as his widow. When Varsha objected, EPFO insisted she obtain a succession certificate. In 2010, a city civil court ordered issuance of the certificate in their names.Hirarani and Vilaspati then moved Gujarat HC in 2016, claiming they were Sureshchandra's legitimate heirs. They argued that Varsha and Vikrant had suppressed details about pending litigation in UP, and wrongfully obtained the succession certificate. In 2017, HC quashed the succession certificate and directed the city civil court to decide the issue afresh after hearing both parties.Over time, Vilaspati remained the only objector to Varsha and Vikrant's claim. In 2022, the court was told Vilaspati had died and she had no heir. The court then allowed Varsha and Vikrant's application, ordering that they be paid the PF amount along with accrued interest.","Sureshchandra died in May 2004 without a will.

KOLKATA: Candidates specified as tainted in the 2016 Bengal's School Service Commission (SSC) panel (hirings) will not be allowed to participate in a fresh school recruitment process for 35,726 vacancies, Calcutta high court held Monday and directed SSC to cancel applications by such candidates. SSC had earlier submitted a list of 'tainted candidates' before the Supreme Court.The HC bench of Justice Saugata Bhattacharyya also refused to interfere with issues of marks allotment and age relaxation in the fresh recruitment process as that would disrupt the timeline set by the apex court. The SC had directed that a fresh recruitment notification be issued by May 31 and the recruitment process completed by Dec 31.Multiple writ petitions were filed before the HC after the SSC issued the recruitment notification on May 30. While some of the petitioners claimed tainted candidates were being allowed to participate in the process others challenged extra marks for previous teaching experience and age relaxation for untainted candidates.Representing SSC, senior lawyer and TMC MP Kalyan Bandopadhyay, said the fresh recruitment process was open to all - tainted, untainted, and unsuccessful.""Can there be double punishment? Refund of salary has been directed, and service has been terminated with no age benefit. Then can they not sit for the examination? How many times will these people be penalised?"" he argued.The senior advocate said the only difference between tainted and untainted candidates in the new process was in terms of relaxation - untainted candidates were allowed an age relaxation but tainted candidates were not.Bandopadhyay argued that if tainted candidates were barred, then unsuccessful candidates should also be barred.Representing the state, advocate-general Kishore Datta argued that the ""SC judgment does not say tainted candidates will not be allowed to participate"".Senior advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya argued that according to an high court division bench order, upheld by the apex court, SSC was supposed to recruit afresh according to the 2016 rules. Bhattacharya specified that only two categories were allowed age relaxation, untainted candidates and disabled candidates.Justice Bhattacharyya made it clear that the court will not interfere in allotment of marks because it's a policy decision. ""What is troubling the court is whether tainted will be permitted to apply. Keeping the selection process alive in terms of the time schedule fixed by the Supreme Court, the court can debar the tainted candidates from participating.""","Bengal's School Service Commission (SSC) panel (hirings) will not be allowed to participate in fresh school recruitment process for 35,726 vacancies.

'Judicial Activism Must Not Become' Chief Justice BR Gavai's Powerful Message Against Overreach

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India B R Gavai lamented that in the recent past, the principle of ""bail is the rule, and jail is the exception"" has been forgotten. Though judicial pronouncements over the decades have integrated this norm, it has not been implemented in true spirit in recent years, he said.Delivering the Justice V R Krishna Iyer Memorial Law Lecture in Kochi on Sunday, the CJI said he tried to reestablish the principle while granting bail in various cases, paving the way for high courts and lower courts to follow suit.""I am happy to state that I had the opportunity in the last year, 2024, to reiterate this legal principle in the cases of Prabir Purkayastha, Manish Sisodia, and Kavita vs ED,"" Justice Gavai said.Justice Iyer's contribution was immense in protecting the rights of marginalised communities, he said.The SC in recent years passed a series of orders to protect the rights of undertrial prisoners and held that delay in trial and long incarceration were grounds to grant bail even in serious offences under the PMLA and the UAPA, A, despite stringent bail conditions under the special laws. It opened the gate for bail to accused in money launder- ing and unlawful activities cases.The CJI also recalled Justice Iyer’s strong opposition to undertrials being kept in jail for long periods without trial. In an important ruling in Aug last year, SC had held that the conventional idea of “bail is the rule, jail is an exception” should be applicable not only to IPC offences but also to other offences for which special statutes have been enacted, such as UAPA, if the conditions prescribed under that law are fulfilled.SC in its various orders had appealed to HCs and lower courts to be liberal in granting bail and asked them not to hesitate in granting the relief in serious offences also if a case is made out for bail.","Chief Justice of India B R Gavai lamented that in the recent past, the principle of ""bail is the rule, and jail is the exception"" has been forgotten.

NEW DELHI: There are ""compelling national security considerations"" that led the Centre to revoke security clearances of a Turkish-owned entity for handling airport-related operations, Delhi high court said on Monday, upholding the move.It dismissed Celebi Airport Services Private Ltd's plea challenging the aviation watchdog BCAS's decision to revoke its security clearance, noting that ""once national security considerations are found to exist, it was not for the court to 'second guess' the same"".Bureau of Civil Aviation Safety (BCAS) on May 15 revoked the security clearance, days after Turkey backed Pakistan and condemned India's strikes on terror camps in the neighbouring country. Justice Sachin Datta also pointed out that ""ground handling services at airports offer deep access to airside operations, aircraft, cargo, passenger information systems, and security zones. Such unbridled access to vital installations and infrastructure naturally elevates the need for strict security vetting for operators and their foreign affiliations. This is particularly true in the wake of contemporary challenges faced by the country in the security domain, and the escalations/incidents witnessed in the recent past, with geopolitical factors at play"".While the firm argued it was not even heard and the move was arbitrary, the HC found ""compelling national security considerations involved"" after the govt furnished material in a sealed cover for the court.""While it would not be appropriate for this court to make a verbatim reference to the relevant information/inputs, suffice it to say, that there is a necessity to eliminate the possibility of espionage and/or dual use of logistics capabilities which would be highly detrimental to the security of the country, especially in the event of an external conflict,"" the HC noted.Celebi Airport Services India Pvt Ltd and Celebi Delhi Cargo Terminal Management India Pvt Ltd oversee ground handling and cargo terminal functions at various airports in the country. HC rejected the contention of the petitioners on the denial of principles of natural justice. “No doubt, the principles of natural justice are sacrosanct; however, it is a compelling constitutional truth that security of the realm is the pre-condition for enjoyment of all other rights,” the court said in its 94-page verdict. It said the authorities are justified in taking prompt and definitive action to completely obviate the possibility of the country’s civil aviation and national security being compromised. The HC said it was also “acutely conscious” that the state must not be allowed to invoke national security as a ruse to deny procedural due process.“Any action taken by the Director General of the Bureau of Civil Aviation for the purpose of revocation of any security clearance on the basis of inputs received from the law enforcement/intelligence agency cannot be considered to be an act inconsistent with the Aircraft Rules 2023, contrary to what has been contended on behalf of the petitioners,” it said. Celebi said the Centre's move was against the principles of natural justice and in violation of the procedure under the Aircraft Security Rules. Celebi, operating in the Indian aviation sector for over 15 years and employing over 10,000 people, offers its services at nine airports.","Celebi Airport Services Private Ltd challenged the aviation watchdog's decision to revoke its security clearance.

Drug regulator issues list of 17 drugs which should be flushed down if unused or expired,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/drug-regulator-issues-list-of-17-drugs-which-should-be-flushed-down-if-unused-or-expired/articleshow/122305871.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: India's top drug regulatory body, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), has released a list of 17 drugs which, it says, should be flushed down the sink if lying unused or expired at home.This includes fentanyl, Tramadol and several other painkiller drugs and Diazepam which is an anti-anxiety medication.According to the CDSCO, these drugs may be especially harmful and, in some cases, fatal with just one dose if they are used by someone other than the person for whom the medicine was prescribed. If these drugs are kept unwanted, unused or expired, the drug regulatory body says, they should be flushed down the sink or toilet to prevent danger to people and pets in the home. However, for most other medications used commonly by people, the drug regulatory body in its latest guidelines on disposal of unused/expired drugs recommends that scientific disposal is needed to prevent environmental pollution.For that, it suggests the initiation of 'drug take back' initiative that could be led by either the state drug control department or local chemists initially but eventually, the CDSCO recommends, the state govt in coordination with local bodies needs to establish the methodology and facility for the collection of and disposal of unused or expired drugs as per the provision of Biomedical Waste Management Rules.""Initially, state drugs control departments and concerned chemists and druggists' associations may jointly launch 'drug take back' site programme at designated locations, where people can drop expired or unused drugs from their homes and that can be disposed finally by such associations under intimation to concerned state drug licencing authority with the help of registered/licenced external agencies.The CDSCO guideline follows multiple reports and studies that show how unscientific disposal of unused or unexpired drugs is causing environmental pollution, eventually affecting human life.A study by led by Dr T Velpandian of AIIMS' ocular pharmacology division that analysed water samples from seven places in Yamuna river, including the entry and exit points, 35 bore wells in Delhi NCR and the water percolating from waste at Ghazipur landfill site in 2018 showed drugs thrown in the waste bins end up in the environment and contribute to the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens.The study showed presence of antibiotics and other drugs in the surface water of river Yamuna and in areas adjacent to the Ghazipur landfill. “The govt move to formulate a guideline on disposal of unused or expired drugs is commendable indeed. We also plan to develop a pamphlet on how to dispose of drugs that will be given to all patients while being discharged from the hospital to create more awareness on the subject,” Devarati Majumdar, director and chief of pharmacy at Max healthcare said. She added that the drugs mentioned by the CDSCO in the ‘flush list’ contain mostly the narcotic drugs that are addictive and vulnerable for misuse and that’s why the govt may have suggested they be flushed down.","India's top drug regulatory body has released a list of 17 drugs which, it says, should be flushed down the sink if lying unused or expired at home.

MUMBAI: Bombay high court said on Monday that the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 will not apply to complaints by advocates to bar councils as there is no employer-employee relationship between them. Hearing a petition seeking direction to bar councils to set up committees to address sexual harassment complaints against advocates, a bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Sandeep Marne said POSH Act will apply to cases where there is an employer-employee relationship, and bar councils cannot be said to be ""employer of advocates"".The petition also sought the implementation of the POSH Act and a committee of lawyers, NGOs, and retired women judges to review and look into lacunas in the Act. The bench were hearing a petition by UNS Women Association seeking direction to the Bar Council of India and Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa to constitute a permanent grievance redressal committee of female advocates in all state bar council offices and bar associations to address sexual harassment complaints against advocates as per Supreme Court's Oct 2012 directions in Medha Kotwal Lele's case. The petition also sought the implementation of POSH Act and a committee of lawyers, NGOs, and retired female judges to review and look into lacunas in the Act.Senior advocate Milind Sathe, for BCMG, and advocate Shekhar Jagtap, for BCI, submitted that there is no employer-employee relationship between advocates and bar councils. Hence, the establishment of an internal complaints committee is not applicable as per POSH Act. They said there is a provision for local committees headed by the district collector to receive complaints of sexual harassment for a workplace having fewer than 10 employees. However, neither ICC nor the local committees can be invoked by female advocates. Sathe said under Section 35 of the Advocates Act, 1961, there is remedy for professional and other misconduct.The judges referred to sections of the POSH Act relating to the constitution of ICC and local committees and also considered the definition of employer. In the order, they said it is evident that these provisions will apply to a case where there is a relationship of employer and employee. Therefore, neither BCI nor BCMG “can be said to be employer of advocates” and “therefore the 2013 Act will not apply to advocates”, they added. However, POSH Act will be applicable to employees of BCI and BCMG.Sathe and Jagtap said BCMG and BCI have constituted ICCs to address grievances of their employees. Additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan said local committees have also been established. The judges noted that as far as the grievance of female advocates is concerned, there is a forum available under Section 35 of the Advocates Act, which provides for lodging complaints tantamount to professional and other misconduct."," Bombay high court said Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013 will not apply to complaints by advocates to bar councils.

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday lashed out at Union Minister Kiren Rijiju after the BJP leader claimed that minorities in India enjoy more benefits and protections than the majority.In a long post on X, Owaisi said Rijiju was not showing the true picture of what Indian Muslims go through and reminded him to follow his duties as a minister under the Constitution.Rijiju on X had stated that “India is the only country where the minorities get more benefits and protections than the majority community!”This remark triggered a strong response from Owaisi.Owaisi claimed that Rijiju was speaking like a ruler instead of someone holding a constitutional post.""You are a Minister of the Indian Republic, not a monarch. Kiren Rijiju, you hold a constitutional post, not a throne. Minority rights are fundamental rights, not charity,"" he said.He questioned Rijiju’s idea of ‘benefits’ by pointing to the abuse and violence Muslims face.""Is it a ‘benefit’ to be called Pakistani, Bangladeshi, jihadi, or Rohingya every single day? Is it ‘protection’ to be lynched? Is it protection that Indian citizens were kidnapped and pushed into Bangladesh?"" Owaisi questioned.The Hyderabad MP also raised concerns over the bulldozing of Muslim properties.""Is it a privilege to watch our homes, masjids, and mazaars being bulldozed illegally?

No. But your Waqf Amendment Act forces non-Muslims onto Waqf Boards — and allows them to form a majority,"" Owaisi said.The AIMIM leader accused the government of slashing key scholarships for Muslim students. He cited government data and said that Muslims are being left behind.""You discontinued the Maulana Azad National Fellowship. You defunded the pre-matric scholarship. You limited the post-matric and merit-cum-means scholarships. All because they benefited Muslim students,"" he wrote.""Muslims are now the only group whose numbers have fallen in higher education.

Maple Leafs expected to trade defenseman for a forward



The Toronto Maple Leafs are navigating a pivotal offseason. General manager Brad Treliving and the front office are assessing every possible option to retool their lineup. With the need to create space for potential additions; possibly even a reunion between Auston Matthews and a former teammate, Toronto may need to make significant roster moves in the coming weeks.Friedman mentioned David Kampf and Calle Jarnkrok as two notable Maple Leafs who could be on the way out. Kampf, a depth center signed through 2027, carries a $2.4 million annual cap hit. While reliable on the penalty kill and defensively sound, his offensive contributions have been limited, potentially making him a expendable player.Although not directly confirmed, Friedman also hinted at the possibility that Nicholas Robertson might be a trade candidate, but refrained from mentioning his name due to personal reasons. Still, it suggests that younger talent may also be in play, especially if the Leafs aim to bolster their roster with more seasoned options.A third area of focus could be on the blue line. Friedman noted that the Maple Leafs may be looking to swap a defenseman for a forward, though he did not specify who. Previous trade chatter included links to Buffalo Sabres winger JJ Peterka, suggesting Toronto's intent to boost their offensive depth.The Leafs’ back end has long been considered a concern. If the right opportunity arises to exchange a defenseman for a more impactful forward, it’s a route management seems willing to take. Toronto has no urgency with training camp still months away, but if a new signing is imminent, the front office may need to accelerate trade discussions.The Toronto Maple Leafs have several key players to address this offseason. With names like David Kampf and Calle Jarnkrok reportedly on the trading block and whispers of a defenseman possibly being moved, Toronto’s roster could look significantly different by opening night. The strategic reshuffle is expected to create cap space and bring in the right fit for a deeper postseason run in 2025.Also Read: Johnny Gaudreau’s wife, Meredith Gaudreau Meredith Gaudreau hosts a river cruise bachelorette for Odette Frye","David Kampf and Calle Jarnkrok linked to possible trades.

Denver Nuggets

Jonas Valanciunas

The Backup Center Dilemma Surrounding Jonas Valaciunas

The Three-Word Message: ""Honor Your Contract""

Why This Matters for the Denver Nuggets and Jokic

Entertaining the Drama

Therecently sent a stern three-word message to, the newly-acquired backup center for their superstar Nikola Jokic , underscoring their firm stance amid a complex offseason situation.For years, the Denver Nuggets have struggled to find a reliable backup for Jokic, the three-time NBA MVP whose unique skill set is central to Denver’s offense. When Jokic rests, the team’s offense often stagnates, making the backup center position critical for maintaining competitiveness during the regular season. This offseason, Denver finally addressed this issue by trading for Jonas Valanciunas from the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Dario Saric.Valanciunas, a 6-foot-11, 265-pound veteran, is a versatile big man capable of scoring from multiple levels, rebounding aggressively, and providing solid defense. Last season, he averaged 10.4 points and 7.7 rebounds in just 20.1 minutes per game, making him an ideal candidate to keep the Nuggets’ frontcourt strong when Jokic is off the floor.Despite the promising fit, Valanciunas has complicated the situation by expressing a desire to leave the NBA and join Greek powerhouse Panathinaikos in the EuroLeague.He reportedly offered to forfeit his $10.4 million contract to make the move possible. However, the Denver Nuggets have made it crystal clear with their three-word directive to Valanciunas: ""Honor your contract.""Denver has no intention of granting a buyout or releasing Valanciunas from his contract, as they view him as a critical piece to back up Jokic and maintain championship aspirations. This firm stance is also a strategic move to preserve their cap space and avoid reopening the backup center void should Valanciunas depart.The Denver Nuggets’ message is both a warning and a declaration of intent. They are signaling that they expect Valanciunas to fulfill his role and contribute to the team’s success rather than pursuing a European career at this juncture. This is crucial for Jokic, who benefits immensely from having a dependable partner in the paint. With Jokic entering his 30s, managing his minutes and health is vital for Denver’s championship window.Moreover, the Nuggets have bolstered their roster with other key additions like Bruce Brown, Cam Johnson, and Tim Hardaway Jr., aiming to build a deep, versatile team around Jokic. Keeping Valanciunas committed is part of that larger strategy to sustain a strong frontcourt rotation and avoid the offensive freezes that occur when Jokic sits.This offseason saga adds an intriguing layer to the Denver Nuggets’ narrative. Valanciunas, a seasoned NBA veteran, is caught between a lucrative NBA contract and the allure of a European basketball return. The Nuggets’ three-word message is a no-nonsense reminder that business comes first in the NBA, even as players weigh personal and professional crossroads.For fans, this creates a compelling subplot: Will Valanciunas comply and become the steadfast backup Jokic needs, or will the Nuggets have to navigate another backup center crisis? Either way, Denver’s front office is playing hardball, emphasizing team commitment over individual preference.Also read: Bronny James’ Viral Dunk Was So Insane, the Internet Thought the NBA Drug Tested Him In summary, the Denver Nuggets have sent a clear and firm message to Jonas Valanciunas: ""Honor your contract.""

The Nuggets’ stance highlights the high stakes and complex negotiations behind the scenes as they prepare for the 2025-26 NBA season.","Jonas Valanciunas has expressed a desire to leave the NBA and join Greek powerhouse Panathinaikos in the EuroLeague.

What is the Einstein visa? How Melania Trump qualified for a visa reserved for Nobel-level talent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-einstein-visa-how-melania-trump-qualified-for-a-visa-reserved-for-nobel-level-talent/articleshow/122204926.cms,"

What is the EB-1 or 'Einstein' visa?

How did Melania Trump qualify for the Einstein visa?

The larger debate: Loopholes, privilege, and policy





When Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the “Einstein visa,” in 2001, it raised eyebrows and continues to stir debate. Reserved for individuals with “extraordinary ability” in fields such as science, arts, education, business, or athletics, the EB-1 green card is typically associated with Nobel laureates, Olympic medalists, or globally recognized experts. Melania, a Slovenian model at the time, was not widely known for groundbreaking accomplishments, prompting questions about how she met the high bar required. So, what exactly is the Einstein visa, and how did the former First Lady qualify for a program meant for the world’s best and brightest?The EB-1 visa is a US employment-based green card designed for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in specific fields, or who are recognized as outstanding professors, researchers, or multinational executives. Applicants must prove “sustained national or international acclaim” and either win a major international award (like a Nobel Prize) or meet at least three of ten criteria set by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). These include published work, media recognition, contributions to a field of major significance, or commanding a high salary compared to others in the same field.While the standards are rigorous, the process is subjective.Immigration officers ultimately decide if the evidence supports a claim of extraordinary ability. This subjectivity has sparked debate over how consistently the criteria are applied and who benefits most from its loopholes.Melania Trump, then known as Melania Knauss, was living in New York as a model when she applied for the EB-1 visa in 2000. It was approved the following year. Though she was featured in magazines and had some runway experience, she had not received prestigious modeling awards or reached the supermodel status typically associated with international acclaim. Critics argue her qualifications were modest compared to the visa's intent.Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett recently reignited the controversy, questioning whether Melania’s case truly exemplifies merit-based immigration. Her approval has drawn comparisons to other questionable EB-1 recipients, including Playboy models and niche artists who managed to craft narratives aligning with the visa’s requirements.Experts note that while the visa is often seen as exclusive, it can be awarded to applicants whose accomplishments, though not widely known, are well-documented and strategically framed within a narrow field. In Melania’s case, her successful petition may have emphasized uniqueness in her modeling niche, media presence, or professional trajectory.The EB-1 program, limited to around 40,000 visas annually, has been praised for attracting top global talent. But its subjective evaluation process has also made it vulnerable to exploitation. Legal experts and immigration attorneys admit that certain applicants with the right legal guidance can tailor their portfolios to meet the criteria, even without widely celebrated achievements.Adding to the irony, Melania later used her citizenship to sponsor her parents for green cards through “chain migration,” a policy her husband, Donald Trump, has publicly opposed. This contradiction has further politicized her immigration journey and raised broader questions about fairness, privilege, and transparency in the US immigration system.","Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the ‘Einstein visa,’ in 2001.

"Tech Layoffs 2025: Over 1 lakh jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon lead mass firings; is AI to blame",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-layoffs-2025-over-1-lakh-jobs-cut-as-microsoft-google-amazon-lead-mass-firings-is-ai-to-blame/articleshow/122255057.cms,"Tech Layoffs 2025: Over 1 lakh jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Infosys lead mass firings

Microsoft cuts 9,100 jobs in second layoff of the year



Intel slashes factory workforce and shuts automotive unit



Google cuts 25% of Google TV staff amid budget reductions



Amazon begins AI-led downsizing across divisions



Why are so many tech jobs being cut



Shifting to AI and automation: Companies are investing billions in AI, cloud infrastructure, and automation technologies. To fund this shift, they are cutting back on roles that don’t align with their future direction.

Cost cutting: Rising interest rates, inflation, and slower growth have forced many companies to tighten their budgets. Layoffs help reduce immediate costs, especially in departments that are no longer seen as essential.

Reorganizing teams: Many tech firms are changing how their teams work. This includes outsourcing, merging departments, and removing duplicated roles across global offices.

Decline in some product markets: Demand for products like personal computers, gaming consoles, and smart TVs has decreased. This affects business units tied to these categories, making them prime targets for cuts.

Who is being affected?



Mid-level developers and engineers at Intel and Microsoft

Marketing, sales, and legal teams

Gaming and entertainment divisions

Regional offices, especially in the US and India

The global tech industry is facing one of its toughest years in 2025. More than 100,000 jobs have already been cut across major technology companies. Big names like Microsoft, Intel, Google, and Amazon are all reducing their workforces, citing reasons such as slowing growth, rising operational costs, and the need to shift resources toward artificial intelligence (AI) and automation. These job cuts are affecting workers at all levels—from fresh graduates to senior engineers—across different countries and departments.While companies say the layoffs are necessary to streamline operations and prepare for the future, the impact on employees and the broader tech job market is massive. The shake-up is not just about reducing headcount—it signals a major transformation in how the industry is evolving. Businesses are now focused on becoming leaner and more AI-driven, even if that means letting go of long-standing teams or changing their traditional work models.Microsoft has confirmed that it is laying off about 9,100 employees in July 2025. This is the company’s second major round of layoffs this year. In May, Microsoft had already let go of 6,000 workers, mainly from engineering and product roles.This new wave represents nearly 4% of the company’s total workforce and is affecting departments such as Xbox gaming, sales, legal, and teams behind mobile game titles like Candy Crush.Microsoft says these job cuts are part of a broader plan to reorganize and invest in AI infrastructure, for which it is committing around $80 billion over the next few years. The company is also restructuring its sales teams and outsourcing more work to smaller partners.Intel, one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers, is cutting up to 20% of its factory workforce, which translates to over 10,000 jobs. These layoffs are scheduled for mid-July and include 107 roles in Silicon Valley, specifically at Intel’s Santa Clara headquarters.The company is also shutting down its automotive chip division, which shows that even once-promising product lines are being dropped as Intel tightens its spending.Intel says the decision is part of its plan to deal with “financial constraints and affordability goals.” The company has faced falling demand in the PC and server markets and is now trying to shift focus toward AI chips and next-gen computing.At Google, layoffs are affecting more niche product divisions. The Google TV team has seen a 25% reduction, which reportedly accounts for about 75 employees.The budget for the Google TV unit was cut by 10%, prompting the company to downsize its workforce. Additionally, in June, Google began offering buyouts and voluntary exit packages, signalling that more layoffs may follow later this year.These actions come as Google, like many other tech firms, shifts more resources toward AI development and away from smaller or lower-priority products.Amazon has joined the wave of major tech layoffs in 2025, initiating targeted job cuts across several divisions as part of a broader strategy to integrate artificial intelligence into its operations. In June, the company eliminated fewer than 100 roles within its Books division, impacting teams behind Kindle and Goodreads, as it moved to streamline underperforming units. CEO Andy Jassy confirmed in a June memo that Amazon plans to further shrink its corporate workforce, citing the growing role of generative AI in automating repetitive and administrative tasks.Departments such as customer service, software development, human resources, and middle management are expected to face future cuts as AI tools take over internal processes and reduce the need for multiple layers of oversight.Since 2022, Amazon has already laid off more than 27,000 employees, and the trend appears to be continuing as the company prioritizes efficiency and technological advancement in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.There are several reasons behind the widespread layoffs in the tech industry in 2025:These layoffs are impacting a wide range of roles and experience levels, including:This shows that no job category is fully immune. Even high-performing tech employees are vulnerable if their role is not aligned with a company’s new priorities.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is laying off about 9,100 employees in July 2025.

Infosys HR sends 'detailed warning email' to employees: We must work….,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/infosys-hr-sends-detailed-warning-email-to-employees-we-must-work-/articleshow/122264746.cms,"Infosys monitors remote work hours to prevent burnout

Health concerns drive policy shift in Indian IT sector

India's second-largest IT services company Infosys has begun sending personalized warning emails to employees who exceed standard working hours, directly contradicting founder N.R. Narayana Murthy 's recent advocacy for a 70-hour workweek. The Bengaluru-based firm has implemented an automated monitoring system that triggers alerts when employees work beyond 9 hours and 15 minutes daily.""We must work for 9.15 hours a day for five days a week, and if we overshoot this while working remotely, it prompts a trigger,"" an employee told The Economic Times. The company's HR department now tracks remote working hours monthly, sending detailed notifications to staff members who exceed prescribed durations.The monitoring system was introduced following hybrid working arrangements for Infosys's 323,500 employees. When excessive hours are detected, HR sends comprehensive notifications including information about remote working days, total hours worked, and daily averages. The company's workplace policy, implemented in November 2023, requires staff to be present in office for minimum 10 days monthly.""While we appreciate your commitment, we also believe that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial for both your well-being and long-term professional success,"" states the HR communication reviewed by financial dailies. The emails emphasize that prioritizing health and work-life balance benefits both personal wellbeing and professional success.This initiative emerges amid growing concerns about young tech professionals facing health challenges, particularly cardiac issues attributed to irregular dietary and rest patterns. The company's guidance includes specific recommendations: ""Take regular breaks during your workday; Let your manager know if you are feeling overwhelmed or need support with reviewing priorities.""The policy represents a significant departure from Murthy's recent statements calling for Indians to work 70 hours weekly to accelerate economic growth. The move reflects evolving workplace norms in Indian IT sector , where employee mental health and sustainable productivity are gaining prominence over extended working hours.","Infosys has implemented an automated monitoring system that triggers alerts when employees work beyond 9 hours and 15 minutes daily.

KOCHI: The state govt on Monday filed an admiralty suit in the Kerala high court, seeking the arrest of the vessel MSC MV Akiteta II, currently within Indian territorial waters at Vizhinjam Seaport, to recover maritime claims amounting to Rs 9,531 crores for the environmental and economic damage caused by the sinking of the cargo vessel MSC Elsa 3 off the Kerala coast on May 25.The bench of Justice M A Abdul Hakhim, which considered the petition, ordered the interim arrest of MSC Akiteta II until the shipping company deposited Rs 9,531 crore in the high court. The matter will be taken up again on July 10. The petition was brought before the court for consideration around 5.30 pm as an urgent matter, given the likelihood that the vessel could depart from Vizhinjam Port by Tuesday morning.This marks the first instance in the state’s history where a claim seeking compensation of such a magnitude was filed. No court fees were required to be deposited as the petitioner was the state govt. The state has also sought interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the suit until the date of judgment, and 12% per annum thereafter until the realisation of the amount.MSC Elsa 3, a Liberian-flagged vessel, capsized 13 nautical miles off the Thottappally spillway in Alappuzha, while en route from Vizhinjam Port to Kochi Port. The petition was filed by Seeram Sambasiva Rao, special secretary of the environment department, who was designated as the principal impact assessment officer by the department of disaster management.Citing scientific assessments and departmental reports, the petition quantified the maritime claims as follows: Rs 8,626.12 crores towards pollution damage; Rs 378.48 crores for environmental restoration and preventive measures; and Rs 526.51 crores for economic loss suffered by the local fishing community, aggregating to a total claim of Rs 9,531 crores.The state further submitted that MSC Elsa 3 and MSC Akiteta II are “sister vessels” under the common commercial, financial, and technical control of the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) of Geneva, despite their formal registration under separate shell companies. The petition alleged that various vessels, such as MSC Manasa F, MSC Melissa, MSC Flora, etc., follow a similar pattern of registration, while sharing the same operational address and control, indicating a deliberate corporate structure intended to frustrate or evade maritime claim enforcement.The govt contended that such structuring amounts to a fraudulent device to defeat genuine claims. It further asserted that even if MSC were to be treated as a demise charterer, the high court is empowered under Section 5 of the Admiralty (Jurisdiction and Settlement of Maritime Claims) Act, 2017, to arrest the vessel in question.Advocate general K Gopalakrishna Kurup, assisted by govt pleader Parvathy Kottol, represented the State of Kerala.","MSC MV Akiteta II is currently within Indian territorial waters at Vizhinjam Seaport.
