Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Taking, in what it called, an important step towards environmental governance and reducing dependence on foreign certification systems, India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory here at the CSIR–National Physical Laboratory (NPL) that will develop requisite testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment in the country.Currently, most of the instruments used in India for air pollution monitoring are imported. These imported instruments, however, come with production certification from international agencies based on the environmental conditions of the certificate issuing countries.Since environmental conditions of those countries are very different from the conditions prevalent in India, it affects the quality of measurements by the instrument operating for a long time in Indian conditions, CSIR scientists explained. At present, only the UK has such a laboratory.The National Environmental Standard Laboratory, inaugurated by Union science & technology minister Jitendra Singh on 80th Foundation Day celebrations of CSIR–NPL on Monday, will now not only deal with the anomaly arising out of different environmental conditions but also help in manufacturing of standardised monitoring equipment.Domestic production of such instruments will eventually end India’s dependence on import and make it an exporting nation of such equipment to third world countries.The global market value of air pollution monitoring systems is, currently, estimated at $3,997 million.In addition, Singh also inaugurated the National Primary Standard Facility for Solar Cell Calibration, bringing India among a select group of global leaders in photovoltaic measurement standards. Both these facilities will enhance trust in data and drive investment in pollution monitoring and renewable energy.Describing the National Environmental Standard Laboratory as a “critical step towards strengthening India’s environmental governance framework”, Singh said that reliable, India-specific calibration and certification of air pollution monitoring systems was long overdue and would now enable transparent, traceable, and accurate environmental data.The facility will support regulatory bodies, industries, and startups by ensuring that monitoring instruments are tested under Indian climatic conditions. It will thus improve policy enforcement of various schemes including the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).Terming the facility for Solar Cell Calibration (Solar Energy Complex) a “future-ready facility”, Singh said it would reduce India’s dependence on foreign certification agencies, save foreign exchange, shorten turnaround time for calibration, and enhance investor confidence in the country’s rapidly expanding solar sector.","India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory.

"After PM’s tribute to Somnath temple, BJP blames Nehru for distorting history",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-pms-tribute-to-somnath-temple-bjp-blames-nehru-for-distorting-history/articleshow/126363852.cms,"NEW DELHI : After PM Narendra Modi penned a tribute to Somnath temple and described it as a symbol of India’s civilisational resilience and its indomitable spirit, BJP said Monday its destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni 1,000 years back was driven by religious fanaticism and blamed Jawaharlal Nehru and “leftist” historians of portraying the Muslim invader as a mere plunderer.At a presser, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi framed US President Donald Trump’s claim post-Op Sindoor that India and Pakistan had been fighting for 1,000 years against the backdrop of Ghazni’s plundering expeditions to India.“Trump had also said that the conflict between India and Pakistan is 1,000 years old and that Kashmir is linked to that. It’s indeed a 1,000-yearold fight. Pakistan’s missiles are named after Ghazni, Babar and Ghori,” he said.Modi will join the “Somnath Swabhiman Parv” on Jan 11 to celebrate the resilience of the Indian civilisation, lauding its spirit that led to its rebuilding, last time after independence, after being vandalised and looted repeatedly by invaders.Spiritual figures praised Modi for spreading awareness about the Shiva temple, one of the 12 jyotirlingas dedicated to the god, and the programme. It is a centre of the country’s faith, preacher Morari Bapu said, adding joining the endeavour is essential to ensure that the temple does not suffer any attack in future.Swami Avdheshanand of Juna Akhara praised the write-up, saying the temple stands as an ode to Indian civilisation.Attacking past historians, Trivedi said Nehru’s book ‘Discovery of India’ was a source of historical distortions. Nehru had described Mahmoud of Ghazni as far more a warrior than a man of faith who exploited the name of religion for his conquest to earn treasures and materials, He cited work of a historian to claim the invader was very much motivated by religious fanaticism in his destruction of the temple as he wanted to be known as a “but-shikan” (idol-breaker).","PM Narendra Modi penned a tribute to Somnath temple and described it as a symbol of India’s civilisational resilience and its indomitable spirit.

Bank Holidays January 2026: The new year 2026 has just begun and if your to-do list contains a bank visit, it’s a good idea to check when banks will be closed in January. A missed holiday can easily turn a routine bank visit into a wasted trip, especially in the first few days of the year when people are settling back into work and finances.Banks in India observe a mix of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can differ from one state to another.Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.Banks will remain closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu in observance of New Year Celebrations and Mannam Jayanthi.Banks will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh for birthday of Hazrat Ali.Banks in West Bengal will remain closed in observance of birth day of Swami Vivekananda.Banks in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be shut in on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain closed for Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be shut in observance of Thiruvalluvar Day.Banks in Tamil Nadu will remain closed due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha, West Bengal, will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic day.Apart from these holidays, banks also remain closed on every second and fourth Saturday of the month.Knowing bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute delays. However, bank closure does not means that customers can not process their financial transactions during holidays. Even when branches are shut, online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.However, services that require a physical visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and issuing demand drafts, will not be available. To avoid inconvenience, account holders are advised to plan these activities in advance and make the most of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.

NEW DELHI: Amid a tightening security environment shaped by a militarily assertive China and a volatile Pakistan, the defence ministry has cleared military modernisation projects worth nearly Rs 79,000 crore, marking one of the most consequential procurement approvals in recent years. The clearances were accorded by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh , which approved a wide range of systems spanning air defence missiles, combat drones, long-range rockets, air-to-air weapons, aerial refuellers and counter-drone technologies.Senior military officials have repeatedly stressed that future conflicts will be defined by speed, precision and the ability to fight across domains. “Timely induction of critical capabilities is essential to maintain operational readiness in a rapidly evolving threat environment,” the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, said recently, underscoring the urgency behind such decisions. While Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) is only the first step in the procurement process, it formally establishes the armed forces’ requirements and allows detailed tenders, trials and negotiations to begin.Taken together, the latest approvals offer a revealing snapshot of how India’s armed forces are recalibrating for wars that may unfold under the shadow of drone swarms, long-range missiles, electronic warfare and sustained precision strikes. Many of the systems cleared have been shaped by operational lessons from recent crises, assessed against the growing missile and air power capabilities of China and Pakistan, and aligned with a more pragmatic “Make in India with partners” approach rather than doctrinaire import substitution. What follows is not merely a list of acquisitions, but an emerging blueprint for how India plans to deter, and if necessary fight, high-intensity conflicts across its borders in the coming decade.The single largest approval under the latest DAC meeting is the Rs 30,000 crore procurement of a large number of Barak-8 medium-range surface-to-air missiles for the Indian Air Force and Navy. Jointly developed by India and Israel, Barak-8 has become the backbone of India’s medium-tier air defence architecture.With an interception range of over 70 km, Barak-8 is designed to neutralise a wide spectrum of aerial threats, including fighter aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Its advanced active radar seeker and ability to engage multiple targets simultaneously make it critical in countering saturation attacks.The missile system proved its operational value during the cross-border hostilities in May, when Pakistan launched multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles. Barak-8 was part of India’s multi-layered air defence network that successfully intercepted incoming threats, preventing damage to key military installations.For the Navy, Barak-8 is deployed aboard frontline destroyers, frigates and aircraft carriers, providing area air defence against anti-ship missiles and hostile aircraft. For the IAF, ground-based Barak-8 squadrons protect air bases and strategic assets. The new procurement aims to significantly bolster missile stocks, addressing concerns over wartime depletion and sustained engagements.The DAC also approved the Rs 1,600-crore lease of two additional MQ-9B Predator drones for a period of three years. These high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles will supplement the two Predators currently operated by the Navy.MQ-9Bs are capable of flying for over 30 hours at altitudes exceeding 40,000 feet, providing persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance across vast areas. They are particularly valuable for maritime domain awareness in the Indian Ocean Region, tracking hostile naval movements and monitoring choke points.The leased drones are meant to bridge a critical capability gap until India receives 31 armed MQ-9B remotely piloted aircraft systems under the $3.8 billion deal signed with the US in October last year. Deliveries under that deal are expected only in 2029–30.By opting for a lease rather than outright purchase, the military avoids a capability vacuum during a period of heightened regional tensions, particularly in the Indo-Pacific and along the Line of Actual Control with China.Another major clearance is the long-pending acquisition of six mid-air refuelling aircraft for the Indian Air Force at a cost exceeding Rs 9,000 crore. The lack of adequate aerial refuellers has long constrained the IAF’s ability to sustain long-range air operations.Under the approved plan, Israel Aerospace Industries will convert six second-hand Boeing 767 commercial aircraft into aerial tankers. The conversion involves structural reinforcement, installation of refuelling booms, fuel tanks and mission systems.A fresh AoN was required because the tender resulted in a single-vendor situation. Despite that, the urgency of the requirement has pushed the government to move ahead.Mid-air refuellers dramatically extend the operational reach and endurance of fighter jets, transport aircraft and surveillance platforms. They are especially critical for deep-penetration strikes, rapid force mobilisation, and sustained air patrols over contested areas. With China operating a growing fleet of refuellers and Pakistan steadily upgrading its air force, the IAF’s refuelling gap had become increasingly stark.Two crucial indigenous missile projects cleared by the DAC focus on extending India’s air-to-air combat envelope. The first is the Astra Mark-2 air-to-air missile, whose range is being enhanced from the current 100 km to around 200 km.Developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Astra is India’s first indigenous beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. It is already integrated with Su-30MKI fighters and is slated for deployment on Tejas and other platforms.The IAF is expected to place an initial order for 600–700 Astra Mk-2 missiles. In parallel, work is underway on Astra Mark-3, which will have an estimated range of around 350 km, placing it firmly in the long-range interception category.Indigenous long-range air-to-air missiles are increasingly important as aerial combat shifts from close dogfights to stand-off engagements, where detection, tracking and first-shot capability determine outcomes.The DAC’s nod for extending the range of Pinaka guided rocket ammunition marks a major leap in India’s artillery firepower. Pinaka multiple launch rocket systems currently fire rockets up to a range of 75 km, already giving them an edge over older systems.The new guided variants aim to extend that range to 120 km, with future plans to reach up to 300 km. According to officials, the 120-km version was successfully tested on Sunday, demonstrating improved accuracy and lethality.A 300-km Pinaka would fundamentally alter battlefield dynamics, allowing the Army to strike deep into enemy territory without relying on air power. Such capability is particularly relevant along mountainous borders, where terrain and weather often limit air operations.Pinaka’s modular design and compatibility with different warheads make it a versatile system for counter-battery fire, suppression of enemy air defences and destruction of logistics hubs.While indigenous systems form the core of the modernisation drive, the DAC also approved additional procurements of select foreign munitions to plug immediate gaps. This includes more Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles for Rafale fighters.With a range of 120–150 km, Meteor is considered one of the most lethal air-to-air missiles in service today, featuring a ramjet propulsion system that maintains high energy throughout its flight.The council also cleared the acquisition of Israeli guidance kits for SPICE-1000 precision-guided bombs. These kits transform conventional bombs into long-range, highly accurate weapons capable of striking targets from up to 125 km away.Together, these munitions significantly enhance the Rafale’s stand-off strike and air dominance capabilities, allowing it to engage high-value targets without entering heavily defended airspace.Among the most telling approvals is the procurement of 850 kamikaze drones, or loitering munitions, for the Army’s new ‘Shaktibaan’ and ‘Divyastra’ artillery batteries at a cost of around Rs 2,000 crore.Loitering munitions combine surveillance and strike capabilities in a single platform. They can hover over a target area, identify enemy assets and then dive onto the target with an explosive payload.The drones approved under this programme will be manufactured in India, either by domestic firms or through foreign collaboration. Their induction reflects lessons drawn from conflicts such as Ukraine, where loitering munitions have been used extensively for precision strikes against armour, artillery and air defence systems.For the Indian Army, these drones provide a flexible, cost-effective tool for real-time battlefield engagement without risking pilots or high-value aircraft.The DAC also cleared the indigenous Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System Mark-2. Equipped with 30-kilowatt lasers, the system can disable, degrade or destroy small remotely piloted aircraft and swarm drones at ranges of up to 3.5 km.Drone swarms are increasingly viewed as a major threat, capable of overwhelming traditional air defence systems through sheer numbers. Laser-based systems offer a relatively low-cost, rapid-response solution to such threats.The IDD&IS integrates detection, tracking and neutralisation into a single platform, making it suitable for protecting air bases, ammunition depots and critical infrastructure. Its approval signals a recognition that future conflicts will involve contested airspace even at very low altitudes.Beyond new acquisitions, the DAC approved overhauls of Mi-17 helicopters in Russia and T-90S main battle tanks in India. These overhauls aim to extend the service life and operational readiness of existing platforms.Mi-17 helicopters form the backbone of the IAF’s medium-lift fleet, supporting transport, casualty evacuation and special operations. T-90 tanks remain central to the Army’s armoured formations, particularly along the western front.Sustaining these platforms is critical even as newer systems are inducted, ensuring there are no capability gaps during the transition phase.Several smaller but vital projects were also cleared. These include low-level lightweight radars for detecting aerial threats, bollard-pull naval tugs for harbour operations, full mission simulators for Tejas fighter jets, and automatic take-off and landing recording systems for the IAF.The DAC also approved the acquisition of high-frequency software-defined radios to enable secure long-range communications across services. Such systems are essential for network-centric warfare, allowing forces to share data in real time.While less visible than missiles or drones, these enablers are critical for operational effectiveness, training and safety.Taken together, the Rs 79,000 crore modernisation push offers a clear snapshot of how India expects future wars to be fought. The focus is on layered air defence, long-range precision strikes, persistent surveillance, unmanned systems and electronic resilience.Rather than betting on a single platform or technology, the approvals reflect a systems-based approach, integrating missiles, drones, aircraft and sensors into a cohesive combat network. The blend of indigenous development and selective imports suggests a more mature procurement philosophy, driven by operational need rather than ideology.","The defence ministry has cleared military modernisation projects worth nearly Rs 79,000 crore.

Why SC rejected Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam bail?

What are the charges

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the bail pleas of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam -- lodged in Tihar jail under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) linked to 2020 Delhi riots.The bench of justices Aravind Kumar and NV Anjaria said that prosecution material disclosed a prima facie case against Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, thereby attracting the statutory bar to bail under Section 43D(5) of UAPA.The bench added that the Khaild and Imam can pray for bail after one year after the completion of examination of protected witnesses.Meanwhile, the top court granted bail to 5 other accused in the case, adding twelve strict conditions.All seven accused had challenged Delhi high court's order denying them bail on September 2.The top court said that not every accused involved in the case stands on same footing. It said that both Khalid and Imam had a ""formative role"" in the conspiracy .""Umar Khalid and Sharjeel stand on different footing and it can't be ignored in terms of parity and culpability. It becomes a court to examine bail pleas individually to see whether pre-trial liberty is attracted.Liberty is of foundational importance at the same time, the constitution does not conceive liberty in isolation,"" the top court said.""This court is satisfied that the prosecution material disclosed a prima facie allegation against the appellants Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam. The statutory threshold stands attracted qua these appellants. This stage of proceedings does not justify their enlargement on bail. Apart from death or destruction the provision encompasses acts that disrupt services and threaten the economy,"" it added.The court said that in prosecutions under the UAPA, delay in trial does not operate as a ""trump card"" which automatically displaces statutory safeguards.""The UAPA as a special statute represents a legislative judgment as to the conditions on which bail may be granted in pre-trial stage. Delay serves as a trigger for heightened judicial scrutiny. The discussion has been confined to delay and prolonged incarceration. UAPA offences are rarely confined to isolated acts. The statutory scheme reflects this understanding,"" it said.""Section 43D(5) of UAPA departs from general provisions for grant of bail. (But) it does not exclude judicial scrutiny or mandate denial of bail in default,"" it added.Meanwhile, during the hearing, the advocates who appeared for them mostly argued on the delay and the unlikelihood of the commencement of the trial. It was also stated to the court that they have been under custody for over five years in a case in which they are facing serious allegations of committing offences under the UAPA.The contentions were also made that there is no proof of violence that they instigated the riots, even after five years have passed.Khalid along with several others have been charged in connection to an alleged conspiracy behind the communal riots which took place in Delhi in February 2020.Khalid was arrested in September 2020, charging him under several sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act including terrorist activity and conspiracy.Additionally he was also charged under provisions of the Indian Penal Code including murder, rioting, sedition, conspiracy and promoting communal enmity.According to Delhi Police, 53 people died in the violence and more five hundred people were injured.On September 2, the Delhi high court denied bail to Imam, Khalid and seven others -- Mohd Saleem Khan, Shifa Ur Rehman, Athar Khan, Meeran Haider, Shadab Ahmed, Abdul Khalid Saifi and Gulfisha Fatima. On the same day, another high court bench rejected the bail plea of co-accused Tasleem Ahmed.In its order, the high court observed that, prima facie, the role attributed to Imam and Khalid in the alleged conspiracy was “grave”, noting that they had delivered inflammatory speeches along communal lines to “instigate mass mobilisation of members of the Muslim community”.",Supreme Court rejects the bail pleas of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam.

NASIRABAD: At a time when the Centre is pushing for restructuring the defence forces, the Indian Army has carried out one of the biggest ever transformations to meet modern warfare challenges creating a pool of over one lakh drone operatives across the force.Bhairav, the latest Special Force raised by the Indian Army- is being readied to tackle the challenges of modern warfare, as all operatives are capable of handling drones and use them in real operations for targeting bases and formations inside enemy territory.Team visited one of the newly raised Bhairav battalions in the desert sector under the Southern Command, where it witnessed the capabilities of the troops who had been selected from Infantry regiments to raise the Special Force and were being given special training as per the requirements of modern warfare.The Bhairav battalions raised by Army Headquarters with lessons from global and own conflicts in mind, have been created to provide a dedicated force for high-speed, offensive operations to carry out the Special Forces tasking at multiple levels as per requirements.The Indian Army has raised around 15 of these battalions already, and they have been assigned to different formations on both borders and have plans to raise around 25 of them in total in the near future.The Bhairav battalions would also bridge the gap between the Para Special Forces and the regular Infantry battalions. The Bhairav would also be tasked to carry out Special Operations at tactical to operational depth.""Modern warfare is changing at a very rapid pace. The conflicts of today are hybrid in nature, and one needs to be fully equipped with modern technology to be able to deal with the Challenges.

Underwater tunnel across Brahmaputra gets govt nod,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/underwater-tunnel-across-brahmaputra-gets-govt-nod/articleshow/126315989.cms,"The tunnel would be of great strategic significance due to its proximity to Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China. (AI image for representative purpose)

NEW DELHI: In a first, India will get a twin-tube underwater tunnel that will have provision for movement of both vehicle and trains, boosting faster movement of forces and ammunition in case of any exigency, reports Dipak Dash.An inter-ministerial panel, headed by the expenditure secretary has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track.As per design, there will be no vehicular movement when trains run through this tube. It will have ballistic track and the trains will run on electricity. The total project of 33.7km, including the tunnel, approach roads and railway track will cost around Rs 18,600 crore. Once the project is complete, travel time between Gohpur and Numaligarh will reduce from current six-and-half hours to just 30 minutes, shortening the distance from 240km to 34km. This will enhance connectivity to Arunachal, Manipur, and other northeastern states.The project cost will be borne by road transport, railways and defence ministry.Designed as two unidirectional tunnels with two lanes each, these will be built 32m below Brahmaputra's deepest bed level. The project is expected to be completed in five years after the award of work.Officials said the projects will be placed before Union cabinet for approval and this may happen before Assam assembly polls. Last year, finance ministry had green signalled a road tunnel costing around Rs 14,900 crore with provision of 80:20 funding by road transport ministry and defence ministry. But following a decision to build road-cum-railway tunnels where it's feasible, govt had identified three such tunnels for North-East chicken neck corridor, across Brahmaputra in Assam and on Maranahally-Addahole (Shiradi Ghat) stretch in Karnataka, which TOI first reported on Oct 6, 2025.Officials said because of provision of railway track in one tunnel the cost has gone up.","An inter-ministerial panel has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam.

Andhra Pradesh attempting to steal Godavari water: Telangana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/andhra-pradesh-attempting-to-steal-godavari-water-telangana/articleshow/126363384.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sparks flew in SC as Telangana opposed Andhra Pradesh’s Polavaram-Nallamala Sagar Project (PNSP) with A Revanth Reddy-led govt accusing AP of attempting to misappropriate its share of Godavari water and N Chandrababu Naidu-led govt charging Telangana of attempting to stall farmer-friendly projects even after taking erstwhile capital city Hyderabad.Telangana through senior advocate A M Singhvi repeatedly pleaded with a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi for a stay on tendering process for preparation of the detailed project report for PNSP alleging that AP govt has decided to proceed despite the Union govt forming a high powered committee led by chairman of Central Water Commission, which had asked AP not to go ahead with it.The bench asked whether a writ petition by a state was maintainable when the core issue pertained to dispute over implementation of allocation of Godavari river water share between the two states, which also involved Karnataka and Maharashtra. It asked Singhvi to take instruction within a week whether Telangana would prefer filing a suit under Article 131 of the Constitution making all three states — AP, Karnataka and Maharashtra — parties.AP through senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, Jaideep Gupta and Balbir Singh told the court that the project had Telangana’s consent at the time of reorganisation of Andhra Pradesh. Rohatgi said the tender is for preparation of DPR for the irrigation project, which is meant to use only the excess flood water flowing through AP, which is the lower riparian state.Singhvi said there was no means to measure excess flood water and alleged that it was a guise to misappropriate around 200 tmc of water allocated to Telangana, which he said is in the process of building various barrages to utilise its share of 968 tmc water. “It is a huge emotive issue in Telangana as commissioning of the irrigation project would cut the state’s share of Godavari water,” he said.Gupta said, “What is an emotive issue? Can one state stop an irrigation project in another state which is a lower riparian one? Telangana has already taken Hyderabad.” Rohatgi said the project is to take water to drought prone areas & the DPR preparation is being pursued after approval of a pre-feasibility report.",Sparks flew in SC as Telangana opposed Andhra Pradesh’s Polavaram-Nallamala Sagar Project.

Forest encroachment in state smacks of bureaucrat-squatter nexus: Supeme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/forest-encroachment-in-state-smacks-of-bureaucrat-squatter-nexus-supeme-court/articleshow/126363334.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday slammed the Uttarakhand govt for being a silent spectator for two decades to rampant encroachment of forest land in Rishikesh , which was allotted in 1950 to Gandhian Mira Behn by the then UP govt, and said it smacked of nexus between the executive and squatters. The court also sought details of such illegal constructions.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the facts of this case, prima facie, show how private individuals systematically grabbed thousands of acres of forest land while the state govt remained in slumber from 2000 till 2023.Uttarakhand’s deputy advocate general Jatinder Kumar Sethi informed the court that the state had recovered around 500 acres of forest land from encroachers in 2023 and an additional 50 acres in the drive carried out in the last three days at Rishikesh. He said the state would continue the drive against encroachers.However, the bench said the way squatters enjoyed residential rights unauthorisedly over vast tracts of forest land for more than two decades indicated collusion among politicians, bureaucrats and encroachers. It asked the state to file a detailed affidavit describing the extent of encroachment, nature of constructions and the officers who were at the helm of affairs between 2000-2023 for protection of govt land in the area.Of the 2,866 acres of land notified as forest area by the state, a part was leased to Pashulok Sewa Samiti, which was an organization associated with Pashulok Ashram established by British born Mira Behn (Madeleine Slade). The society came under liquidation and surrendered 594 acres of land to the forest department on Oct 23, 1984. Yet certain private individuals took control of the land.The bench in its previous order had said, “What seems shocking to us is that the State of Uttarakhand and its authorities are sitting as silent spectators when the forest land was being systematically grabbed in front of their eyes.” It enlarged the scope of the petition and directed the state’s chief secretary and principal chief conservator of forest to constitute an inquiry committee to examine all issues and submit a report to SC.“Meanwhile, all private individuals are restrained from alienating the land, encumbering it or creating any third-party rights. It goes without saying that no construction activity shall be allowed to take place either. The vacant land (other than the residential houses) shall be taken into possession by the forest department and the collector concerned,” the bench had ordered on Dec 22 last year.",Uttarakhand’s deputy advocate general Jatinder Kumar Sethi informed the court that the state had recovered around 500 acres of forest land from encroachers in 2023.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MLAs on Monday staged a protest inside the Delhi Assembly premises, drawing attention to the worsening air pollution levels in the national capital.Leader of opposition in the Assembly, Atishi, led the protest amid AAP's efforts to press for urgent policy measures and accountability on Delhi's deteriorating air quality.The protest highlighted concerns over public health, particularly for children, the elderly, and people with respiratory issues, as Delhi continues to struggle with hazardous air quality. Party leaders demanded immediate action by the government to implement stricter measures to curb pollution, including emissions from vehicles, industrial discharges, and stubble burning from neighbouring states.Meanwhile, several Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai and Guwahati, woke up to a layer of fog on Monday morning. Air quality varied from 'poor' to very poor' category across several parts of the national capital, while several flights were delayed at the IGI Airport.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi recorded AQI at 260 in the 'Poor' category by 8 am on Monday.Visuals from Akshardham showed the Air Quality Index (AQI) at 294, falling in the 'poor' category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCM).At ITO, the AQI was recorded as 256, also categorised as 'poor', while Anand Vohar reported a sharper decline at 320, placing the area in the 'very poor' bracket.Chandni Chowk remained among the worst-affected areas, recording an AQI of 337, classified as 'very poor'. Reduced visibility due to fog and smog disrupted flight operations at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, with several flights delayed in the early hours.Notably, in Delhi, the Sub-Committee on the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) under the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the NCR and adjoining areas lifted Stage-III restrictions on Friday evening, citing significant air quality improvement due to favourable meteorological conditions.","Aam Aadmi Party MLAs staged a protest inside the Delhi Assembly premises, drawing attention to the worsening air pollution levels in the national capital.

Drug firms get exit from court for minor lapses under new rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/drug-firms-get-exit-from-court-for-minor-lapses-under-new-rules/articleshow/126353725.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Drug makers and medical device firms facing minor regulatory violations can now avoid criminal prosecution and lengthy court battles, with the government rolling out a formal mechanism to settle eligible cases outside courts.The framework, laid out in the Drugs and Cosmetics (Compounding of Offences) Rules, 2025, allows certain offences under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 to be resolved by paying a prescribed compounding amount, instead of facing prosecution, signalling a shift towards compliance-based regulation while retaining safeguards for public health.The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has issued a detailed guidance document spelling out eligibility, timelines and procedures for compounding of offences, and the role of a designated Compounding Authority empowered to grant immunity from prosecution in approved cases.Under the rules, companies or individuals involved in the manufacture, import, sale or distribution of drugs, cosmetics or medical devices may apply for compounding either before or after prosecution is initiated. Applications will be examined after seeking reports from the relevant licensing and enforcement authorities, and the authority may allow or reject the request after review and, where required, a personal hearing.If compounding is permitted, the applicant must pay the compounding amount within the stipulated period, following which immunity from prosecution may be granted. The protection, however, is conditional and can be withdrawn if the authority later finds that material facts were concealed, false information was provided or conditions were violated.Officials said the mechanism is intended to reduce litigation over technical or procedural lapses, allowing regulators and courts to focus on serious violations that pose risks to public health, such as spurious or unsafe drugs.The guidance makes it clear that compounding is discretionary and not a matter of right, and that repeat or serious offenders may not qualify. The rules follow reforms under the Jan Vishwas framework aimed at decriminalising minor offences while maintaining regulatory oversight.","The framework allows certain offences under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 to be resolved by paying a prescribed compounding amount.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Monday refused to stay Lalu Prasad Yadav 's trial in the alleged IRCTC scam case and issued notice to the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) seeking its reply.The single-judge bench of Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma told Yadav’s lawyers, Kapil Sibal and Maninder Singh, that it would not grant a stay without the CBI’s response and fixed January 14 as the next date of hearing.“Let them (CBI) file a reply. You should have come earlier; you didn’t come.

Charges were also framed against 13 other accused, including his wife and former chief minister Rabri Devi, and their son Tejashwi Yadav, a former deputy chief minister of the state.The charges relate to alleged irregularities in the award of operational contracts for two Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) hotels to a private firm during the RJD supremo’s tenure as the Union railway minister between 2004 and 2009.In a scathing observation, the trial court had said the land and share transactions in the case were “possibly an instance of crony capitalism fostered in the garb of eliciting private participation” in the Railways’ hotels at Ranchi in Jharkhand and Puri in Odisha.In its chargesheet, the CBI has alleged that a “conspiracy” was hatched between 2004 and 2014, under which BNR hotels of the Indian Railways, located in Puri and Ranchi, were first transferred to the IRCTC and later leased out for operations, maintenance and upkeep to Sujata Hotels Private Limited, a Patna-based firm.The agency further alleged that the tender process was rigged and manipulated, with conditions tweaked to favour Sujata Hotels, a private entity.","The Delhi high court on Monday refused to stay Lalu Prasad Yadav's trial in the alleged IRCTC scam case.

NEW DELHI: A 25-year-old man walked into Laxmi Nagar Police Station on Monday and confessed to killing his mother, sister and teenage brother.When police reached his home, they found the bodies of his mother, Kavita (46), and two siblings - Meghna (24), a lab staffer, and Mukul (14), a Class 7 student.As the family was religious, the accused son is suspected of mixing heavy sedatives (dhatura) in prasad laddoos. He then strangled them with a muffler, according to the police.The probe revealed the accused, identified as Yashbir Singh, was under severe financial stress. Singh, who earlier worked as a private driver, was unemployed for the past six months. His father, a truck driver, had started living separately in Haryana around the same time. Singh was also allegedly facing marital discord and had sent his wife to her maternal home a day earlier.During questioning, Singh allegedly told police that he took a life insurance policy of around Rs 1.5 crore and attempted suicide 4-5 times in the last 2 months by staging accidents, getting himself bitten by a snake, and even injecting air, but failed each time, police said.He further claimed that he had an argument with his mother a day before the incident. ""He stated that on Sunday his mother confronted him and told him that if he intended to end his life, he should first kill all family members and then face the consequences,"" police said.The accused said that on Sunday morning he brought intoxicating seeds from the Yamuna Bank area, mixed them with food, and fed them to his family members, who were religious. ""As per his version, today morning he went to a Shiv Mandir near Yamuna Bank Metro Station, collected dhatura seeds from a nearby dhatura plant, prepared dhatura laddoos using atta and sugar, and fed them to his family members,"" a senior police officer said, adding that after they lost consciousness, he allegedly strangled them.A police source said that he murdered them between 1.30 pm and 2 pm, and after some time he surrendered before the police. Police will wait for autopsy report to confirm the time of deaths.Police stressed these details are solely based on the accused's confession and are yet to be verified.The family lived on rent on the first floor of a 5-storey house, locals said. The house owner lives on the floors above with his family. Neighbours remember the family, except the accused son, as religious, and said they visited the temple in the lane behind the house daily at least twice.""The last I spoke to the family was on Sunday evening. The younger boy (Mukul) came to light an earthen lamp. He always greeted while passing by, but that is all that is known of the family.

'Can Raise Tariffs Very Quickly': Trump Warns India Over Russian Oil Imports, Praises PM Modi

India’s crude oil imports from Russia & US

Why India Needs To Make Its Stand Clear

US President Donald Trump on Monday warned India of higher tariffs if it doesn’t cooperate with America on the issue of Russian crude oil imports. The warning comes at a time when Indian exports already face heavy trade penalties in the US market. At present, shipments from India are subject to a 50% tariff, with half of that burden directly tied to India’s ongoing purchases of Russian crude oil.Trump said PM Narendra Modi was aware of his dissatisfaction over India’s continued purchases of Russian oil, adding that Washington has the ability to swiftly increase tariffs on Indian goods.Trump made the comments while speaking to reporters on Sunday aboard Air Force One as he travelled from Florida to Washington DC.“They wanted to make me happy, basically. Modi is a very good man; he is a good guy. He knew I was not happy, and it was important to make me happy. They do trade and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly. It would be very bad for them,” Trump said.Trump’s comments have also been by senator Lindsey Graham who is advancing a legislation that would impose stringent secondary tariffs on countries that import Russian oil and gas if Moscow does not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine within a 50 day timeframe.India’s crude oil imports from the United States surged by over 92% year-on-year during the first eight months of the current financial year, even as Russia continued to be the country’s largest crude supplier between April and November 2025.Data from the ministry of commerce and industry show that India imported a total of 178.1 million tonnes of crude oil during April to November 2025. Of this, around 60 million tonnes were sourced from Russia and about 13 million tonnes from the US. In the corresponding period a year earlier, total crude imports stood at 165 million tonnes, including 62.4 million tonnes from Russia and only 7.1 million tonnes from the US.As a result, the US share in India’s crude basket rose to 7.6 percent in the current fiscal period from 4.3 percent a year earlier. Russia’s share, meanwhile, declined to 33.7 percent from 37.9 percent over the same comparison period.The full effect of recent US sanctions on Russian oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil, both key suppliers to India, is yet to be reflected in official figures.Following Trump sanctions imposed in October on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, large refiners such as Reliance Industries, along with several state owned companies, announced plans to stop buying Russian crude to avoid exposure to secondary sanctions.According to Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) founder Ajay Srivastava imports of Russian crude have not stopped entirely, with lower volumes continuing - leaving India in a strategic grey zone.“This approach may be weakening India’s position. If New Delhi plans to stop Russian oil imports, it should do so clearly and decisively. If it intends to continue buying from non-sanctioned Russian suppliers, it must say so openly and support the stance with data. And if it plans to buy even from sanctioned entities, that choice too must be stated plainly. What no longer works is ambiguity,” he says.India’s decision making is further complicated by the absence of any assurance that stopping Russian oil imports would ease pressure from the Trump administration.“Complicating India’s calculus, there is no guarantee that cutting Russian oil will end US pressure. Even a full stop could shift the US demands to agriculture, dairy, digital trade, and data governance,” GTRI says.India must also factor in that the current use of tariffs as leverage is linked to a particular political phase in the United States and may not persist indefinitely, the think tank says. The European Union, Japan and South Korea opted to ease tensions with Washington by sharply reducing their intake of Russian crude.India’s position differs from China’s, which enjoys greater strategic leverage with the US. Despite being the largest buyer of Russian oil, China has largely been spared American pressure, as Washington is wary of the potential fallout.Although India has significantly increased imports of crude oil and petroleum products from the US, this has not translated into any visible softening of Washington’s stance.“Indian exports to the US have already fallen 20.7% between May and November 2025, and further tariff escalation could trigger a steeper decline. As the tariff threat hardens, India must take a clean call on Russian oil—own that decision, and communicate it unambiguously to Washington,” GTRI concludes.",India's crude oil imports from the United States surged by over 92% year-on-year during the first eight months of the current financial year. Russia continued to be the country’s largest crude supplier between April and November 2025. The full effect of recent US sanctions on Russian oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil is yet to be reflected.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126351582,imgsize-57510,width-400,resizemode-4/india-russia-crude-oil-trade.jpg"

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Melinda French Gates is one of the wealthiest women in America but her path to a $17.4 billion fortune began with an unusual advice from hiring manager at IBM .

It was tiny,” French Gates said during an interview.“And she said, ‘If they give you an offer, you should take it.’ And it dumbfounded me,” she added.The manager’s reason was clear: She reportedly said that a young recruit would have the better chance to move up quickly at Microsoft as it was growing rapidly.French Gates took the leap and moved to the West Coast in Seattle.“I didn’t know anybody in Seattle. It was moving to the West Coast, but I was so excited about what they were doing.I was like, ‘I want to be part of that,’” she said. French Gates spent nine years at Microsoft and became the General Manager of Information Products. She was a critical architect of the company’s expansion, which is now a $3.6 trillion software titan.Reflecting on her journey, French Gates now uses her story to encourage other women.“I remind them all the time you can pivot careers.

Manus, a versatile AI agent, achieved rapid growth and significant revenue, prompting Meta to integrate its technology across its platforms. The deal, however, carries geopolitical undertones due to Manus's Chinese origins and subsequent move to Singapore.

Meta's $2.5 billion bet on AI agents signals new era

Chinese roots raise geopolitical concerns despite Singapore move





The co-founder of Manus, the AI startup recently acquired by Meta for $2.5 billion, has drawn parallels between himself and Mark Zuckerberg , highlighting their shared journey as college dropouts who built successful tech companies. Ji Yichao, the 32-year-old chief scientist and co-founder of Manus, shared two photographs on X showing younger versions of himself and Zuckerberg working on laptops in the same room at the ""Facebook House"" in Palo Alto, California. ""21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge,"" Ji wrote following acquisition announcement.According to Chinese media reports, Ji started a computer science degree at Beijing Information Science and Technology University in 2010 but dropped out to pursue entrepreneurship. He later returned to complete his degree in 2018. Zuckerberg famously left Harvard University in 2004 to focus on building Facebook, which eventually became Meta.The deal includes a $500 million retention pool for Manus employees, as Meta ramps up its foray into AI. Manus will be retained as a stand-alone subscription service while weaving in the startup's technology into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.Manus, which debuted in March 2024 as a ""general-purpose"" AI agent capable of independently conducting deep research and vacation planning, and even coding and stock analysis, reached more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than a year and gained millions of users.That deal is also not without geopolitical nuances, given that Manus was founded by Butterfly Effect in Beijing and Wuhan in 2022. Still, it moved to Singapore in mid-2025, apparently to hedge against geopolitical risk as part of the U.S.–China tech rivalry.Meta says there will be “no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI” after the acquisition, adding it would wind down services in China. Manus reportedly laid off most of its Chinese staff and now operates with 105 employees across Singapore, Tokyo, and San Francisco.Earlier, Senator John Cornyn had criticised Silicon Valley venture firm Benchmark for its support of Manus, citing fears of American capital underpinning Chinese technology interests.","Ji Yichao, the 32-year-old chief scientist and co-founder of Manus, shared two photographs on X showing younger versions of himself and Zuckerberg working on laptops in Palo Alto, California.

The company faces lawsuits over alleged harm caused by ChatGPT, while its safety teams have been disbanded. This new role aims to balance rapid AI advancement with crucial safeguards, a challenging task given the technology's unprecedented capabilities and potential dangers.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Safety teams keep vanishing as products multiply

Lawsuits paint darker picture of AI's mental health toll





The man who unleashed ChatGPT on the world is now sounding the alarm about his own creation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is hunting for a Head of Preparedness to tackle what he calls ""real challenges"" emerging from AI systems that have grown so sophisticated they're finding critical security vulnerabilities and impacting users' mental health. The $555,000 role comes as the company that revolutionised generative AI in late 2022 grapples with lawsuits, safety team departures, and the uncomfortable reality that its technology may be causing genuine harm.""Models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges,"" Altman wrote on X. He didn't sugarcoat the position's demands, warning applicants: ""This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.""The new hire will lead OpenAI's preparedness framework, evaluating frontier AI capabilities and coordinating safeguards across cybersecurity, biosecurity, and the prospect of AI systems that can improve themselves—challenges that Altman admits have ""little precedent."" The company specifically needs help figuring out ""how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm.The job opening arrives amid a disturbing pattern at OpenAI: safety teams appear, then disappear. The company's Superalignment team, launched in 2023 with the mission of preventing AI systems ""much smarter than us"" from going rogue, lasted less than a year before being disbanded in May 2024. Co-leader Jan Leike quit with a blistering exit statement, declaring that ""safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products. ""The AGI Readiness team met a similar fate in October 2024, dissolved after advising on the company's preparedness for artificial general intelligence. Meanwhile, Aleksander Madry, OpenAI's previous Head of Preparedness, was reassigned in July 2024 to work on AI reasoning instead—leaving the crucial safety position vacant for months even as the technology advanced.The urgency behind the new position becomes clearer when examining the lawsuits piling up against OpenAI. Multiple families allege ChatGPT reinforced delusions, deepened isolation, and even encouraged suicide. One case involves a 16-year-old California boy; another centers on a 56-year-old Connecticut man who allegedly murdered his mother and killed himself after interactions with the chatbot that fueled his paranoid delusions.OpenAI says it's working to improve ChatGPT's ability to ""recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress,"" but the company hasn't slowed its product velocity. Despite Altman's 2023 signing of a letter warning that AI extinction risks deserve priority alongside ""pandemics and nuclear war,"" OpenAI keeps accelerating. The company, now valued at $157 billion after October's $6.6 billion funding round, is reportedly negotiating with Amazon for another investment exceeding $10 billion.That contradiction—tech leaders prophesying catastrophe while racing to build the very technology they fear—hasn't gone unnoticed. ""If they honestly believe this could bring about human extinction, then why not just stop?"" asked one critic after Altman's Congressional testimony. The new Head of Preparedness will inherit that impossible balancing act: making AI safer while the company that employs them pushes relentlessly forward.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is seeking a Head of Preparedness to address AI's growing security risks and mental health impacts.

The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Global Sikh delegation tours Punjab to build unity and form independent committee for akal takht financial autonomy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/global-sikh-delegation-tours-punjab-to-build-unity-and-form-independent-committee-for-akal-takht-financial-autonomy/articleshow/126365813.cms,"





AMRITSAR : Amid growing allegations of undue influence by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) over Sikh high priests—raising serious concerns about impartiality in their decisions and directives—a global initiative is taking shape.A delegation of prominent Sikh businessmen and intellectuals from across the world is touring Punjab to engage with key Panthic bodies, with an aim to build unity and establish an independent international committee. Its foremost mandate will be to ensure the financial independence of the Akal Takht Secretariat, followed by the transparent and autonomous election of Sikh high priests, freeing them from reliance on the SGPC for honorariums and safeguarding the moral and institutional independence of Sikh high priests.Rajwinder Singh of Switzerland, who is leading the delegation, said the Sikh diaspora is deeply distressed by recurring media reports alleging that certain decisions of Sikh high priests are influenced by the SAD-backed SGPC. He said such allegations caused widespread disappointment and anguish among Sikhs worldwide.“Even at present, the issue of the 328 missing saroops of Sri Guru Granth Sahib brought the Akal Takht and the Punjab govt into direct confrontation—something that should never have occurred.This situation is extremely concerning for Sikhs across the globe,” Rajwinder Singh said.He added that the delegation already held meetings with several Panthic organisations in the Malwa and Doaba regions and is currently touring Majha to engage with more Sikh bodies.“Our objective is to identify Panthic organisations that enjoy the highest level of trust and credibility among Sikhs. These organisations will then collectively form an international committee comprising Sikh businessmen, intellectuals, and respected religious personalities,” he explained, adding that they are open to taking representatives from the SGPC on the committee.Further elaborating, Rajwinder Singh said the delegation deliberated extensively and concluded that making the Akal Takht Secretariat financially independent is essential adding that foreign-based Sikh businessmen have expressed their readiness to make substantial donations for the cause and have committed to doing so.Dr. Sonia Kaur from Sweden said that there have been allegations that decisions of Sikh's supreme temporal authority are allegedly influenced by SGPC or the SAD, so it is crucial to uphold the independence of Akal Takht including transparent process of processes of honorariums and administration . ""Forming an international committee of Sikh intellectuals, scholars, and businessmen could provide guidance and oversight while respecting Sikh traditions"" said she.Surinder Singh from Austria said, “If the Akal Takht Secretariat becomes autonomous, Sikh high priests will no longer need to depend on the SGPC for their honorariums. The income generated from the estates and properties owned by the Akal Takht Secretariat would be sufficient to meet all operational and administrative expenses.”[9:32 am, 6/1/2026] +91 98761 35051: This one",A delegation of prominent Sikh businessmen and intellectuals from across the world is touring Punjab to engage with key Panthic bodies.

GHAZIABAD: The Apartment Owners Association (AOA) of Skytech Magadh Society in Vaishali’s Sector 3 urged residents to stop feeding pigeons in the open, citing significant health and sanitation concerns. The AOA’s president made the appeal after pigeon nets were installed at a cost of Rs 12,000 to prevent feeding in public spaces.Most residents welcomed the decision, and there was strong community support for the installation of pigeon nets at the society’s back gate.The AOA highlighted that pigeon droppings pose serious health risks, leading to fungal diseases, allergies, and lung infections. This concern has been supported by judgments from the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court, emphasising the dangers associated with pigeon feeding. AOA members said that some residents already suffered from lung issues linked to the presence of pigeons.In addition to health risks, the AOA noted that pigeon droppings caused extensive damage to building paint, balconies, grilles, and vehicles parked in open areas. “Residents expressed frustration over the upkeep costs, as many paid extra for car cleaning services to remove pigeon waste,” said AOA president HD Singh.The AOA further urged the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) to address the issue of individuals selling bird feed on govt land, which has contributed to the rising number of pigeons in the area, they said. “These sellers need to be removed as they endanger public health for their profit,” said Singh.Despite previous concerns raised by residents of neighbouring areas, including Indirapuram, Vasundhara, Raj Nagar Extension, no action has been taken by authorities.When contacted, Dr Ashish Tripathi, veterinary doctor and welfare officer of GMC, told TOI that currently, there is no policy for stopping public feeding of pigeons in the city. Tripathi said that only once a policy against public feeding of pigeons is approved by the GMC board can it be implemented and enforced.The doctor cautioned against health hazards from pigeon droppings, such as chlamydiosis, also known as psittacosis or ornithosis, which is a bacterial zoonotic disease. It is primarily transmitted to humans through the inhalation of dust from dried pigeon droppings or respiratory secretions of infected birds, with pigeons being a common source. The disease causes flu-like symptoms, including fever and cough, and can lead to pneumonia.“Vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, young children, and immunocompromised individuals, are at a higher risk for more severe illness. Other issues include respiratory issues, etc,” Dr Tripathi said.In Noida, too, residents say the practice of feeding pigeons in public is rampant, with Dalit Prerna Sthal near Cleo County Society, Sector 121, residential markets, etc, being identified as prime feeding spots","Apartment Owners Association of Skytech Magadh Society in Vaishali’s Sector 3 urged residents to stop feeding pigeons in the open.

Oman announces new fees for citizenship and nationality applications,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/oman-introduces-new-fees-for-citizenship-and-nationality-applications/articleshow/126365443.cms,"Oman now charges OMR 600 for citizenship applications and OMR 200 for nationality withdrawal/Image: X





Applying for Omani citizenship will now come with a clearly defined price tag. In a move aimed at tightening and standardising nationality services, Oman has approved a new fee structure covering both citizenship applications and requests to relinquish nationality, according to details published in the Sultanate’s Official Gazette.Under the revised framework, the fee for submitting an application to obtain Omani citizenship has been set at OMR 600. This charge applies to foreign women married to Omani nationals, as well as widows or divorced spouses of Omanis. The same fee also covers applications submitted on behalf of the minor children of Omani women, ensuring a uniform cost across these family-based eligibility categories.In addition to citizenship applications, the updated regulations introduce an OMR 200 fee for requests related to the withdrawal or relinquishment of Omani nationality. This marks the formal introduction of charges for nationality renunciation, placing it alongside citizenship acquisition within a standardised administrative fee structure.The new fee schedule came into force on January 4, 2026, and applies across the Sultanate. Authorities have made clear that the decision is limited strictly to application and service fees. There are no changes to eligibility criteria, legal requirements, or the laws governing citizenship and nationality matters, and applicants must continue to meet the same conditions as before.Officials say the revised fees form part of broader efforts to streamline and standardise administrative procedures related to nationality services. By clearly outlining costs in the Official Gazette, the government aims to provide applicants with greater transparency, consistency, and certainty when navigating citizenship and nationality processes in Oman.","Oman now charges OMR 600 for citizenship applications and OMR 200 for nationality withdrawal.

According to traders, after the American military operation in Venezuela, US dollar had gained traction globally as investors towards safe-haven assets.Since December 30 last year, when it had ended at 89.75 against the dollar, rupee has fallen 55 paise. In calendar year 2025, the currency plunged almost 5%, marking its weakest momentum since 2022.“The Indian rupee has endured a persistent downward spiral, losing ground in nine out of the past ten trading sessions. This weakness is primarily fueled by ambiguity surrounding bilateral trade agreements between Washington and New Delhi, alongside a sluggish domestic stock market triggered by an exodus of foreign capital,” Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities, told PTI.He added that a surge in geopolitical uncertainty had further boosted the dollar’s appeal. “This flight to safety followed the detention of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro by American military personnel over the weekend,” Parmar said.According to him, the USD-INR spot pair faces resistance near 90.45, while support is expected around the 89.90 level in the near term.In global markets, the dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.27% higher at 98.68.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in green on Tuesday. While Nifty50 was below 26,200, BSE Sensex tanked 300 points. At 9:25 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,193.10, down 57 points or 0.22%. BSE Sensex was at 85,140.05, down 300 points or 0.35%.Analysts are of the view that Indian equity markets will trade with a positive bias in the near term, supported by stronger than anticipated third quarter earnings and expectations of higher capital expenditure announcements ahead of the Union Budget. However, analysts caution that bouts of volatility cannot be ruled out due to ongoing global geopolitical developments.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The US markets have largely ignored the Venezuelan crisis and moved ahead. It seems the market’s verdict is that the economic consequences of this major geopolitical event will not be negative; perhaps it can be even positive from the medium to long-term perspective, when the crude prices decline on increased supply from Venezuela.However, it is too early to take a call on this since further surprises on the geopolitical front are likely. We are in a highly uncertain phase. Therefore, investors can also think of increasing the cash position in their portfolios even while remaining invested. Heightened uncertainty triggered by unprecedented geopolitical events demands a cautious approach to investment supported by higher cash positions to exploit sudden movements in the market.”“The banking sector is moving to a stronger position supported by increasing credit growth even though deposit mobilisation remains a challenge.”Global cues remained supportive after Wall Street closed higher on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average scaled a fresh all-time high, led by sharp gains in financial stocks, while energy shares advanced after a US military operation resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.Asian markets opened marginally higher on Tuesday, extending the recent record-breaking rally in global equities, as investors chose to look beyond geopolitical risks and focused on improving risk appetite.In currency markets, the US dollar hovered near a two-week high in early Asian trade on Tuesday. The easing of immediate market anxiety following US military action in Venezuela, combined with dovish remarks from Federal Reserve officials, helped underpin risk-taking sentiment on Wall Street.On the domestic institutional front, foreign portfolio investors were net sellers of Indian equities worth Rs 36 crore on Monday, according to exchange data. Domestic institutional investors, in contrast, provided strong support to the market with net purchases of Rs 1764 crore.","Nifty50 was below 26,200, BSE Sensex tanked 300 points.

In South Korea, Kospi traded flat with a gain of 6 points around 9:05 AM IST.Oil prices also stabilised after sharp swings linked to political developments in Venezuela.Alongside the global equity rally, attention is shifting to the United States, where a series of economic indicators due this week could shape expectations around the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate decision, which is scheduled for later this month.Market participants brushed aside the surprise US operation in Caracas over the weekend, where Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife were flown to New York to face drug charges.In the US, Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to a new closing high, supported by strong performances from major technology firms including Amazon and Meta, as well as energy companies. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also ended higher.Gains were reinforced by fresh data showing US manufacturing activity contracted for the tenth straight month in December, a trend that could give the Federal Reserve additional scope to cut interest rates. Investors are now awaiting upcoming employment data, which may further influence the central bank’s policy stance, despite indications last month that it could pause easing.In Asia, Hyundai shares initially surged after the South Korean carmaker showcased a prototype of its humanoid robot, Atlas, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, but the stock later trimmed those gains. The company said the AI-powered robot is expected to begin operations at a US manufacturing facility by 2028.Australian equities edged lower, even as BlueScope Steel jumped more than 20% after announcing it was reviewing a US$8.8 billion joint takeover proposal from a US-based rival and a diversified Australian firm.In energy markets, oil prices dipped after rising 1.7% on Monday as investors weighed the potential impact of Venezuela’s political upheaval. While the country holds roughly one-fifth of the world’s oil reserves, analysts noted that any rapid increase in supply would be constrained by ageing infrastructure, low prices and ongoing political uncertainty, even as global markets grapple with an existing supply glut.","In Hong Kong, HSI added 448 points or 1.7% to 26,795.

US hotel that denied rooms to ICE agents was bought by four Indian-Americans for $15 million: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-hotel-that-denied-rooms-to-ice-agents-was-bought-by-four-indian-americans-for-15-million-report/articleshow/126364578.cms,"In Lakeville, Minnesota, a Hampton Inn has sparked controversy after its new Indian ownership turned away reservations from ICE and DHS agents, allegedly guided by a principle of non-cooperation with immigration enforcement. While Hilton clarified that such actions do not align with the company's ethos, both the hotel management and Hilton expressed regret and reaffirmed their dedication to inclusivity.





The Hampton Inn by Hilton in Lakeville, Minnesota, which recently refused reservations to ICE and DHS agents, was purchased last year by four Indian partners, according to public records.The hotel was bought for $15 million through an LLC owned by Parmjit Singh, Amanpreet Hundal, Karandeep Nagra, and Mohinderjeet Kaur, according to filings with the Minnesota secretary of state.The incident stirred a row after emails shared on social media by DHS and ICE alleged that staff at the hotel told federal officers their reservations would not be accepted.One email stated said: “We have noticed an influx of GOV reservations made today that have been for DHS, and we are not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property.”Another added: “Please pass on this info to your coworkers that we are not allowing any immigration agents to house on our property.”A Hilton spokesperson told FOX Business that the hotel is independently owned and that the actions described do not reflect Hilton’s values.“Hilton hotels serve as welcoming places for all. This hotel is independently owned and operated, and the actions referenced are not reflective of Hilton values,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson added that the staff have already apologised for their behaviour: “We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologised for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies. They have taken immediate action to resolve this matter. Hilton’s position is clear: Our properties are open to everyone and we do not tolerate any form of discrimination.”The management company operating the hotel, Everpeak Hospitality, also released a statement affirming its commitment to welcoming all guests and following brand standards and applicable laws: “We are in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated. We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologise to those impacted.”The dispute shows a long-standing policy of Hilton Hotels. In 2020, the company publicly opposed using its properties in connection with immigration detention and reinforced the stance across its US hotels.DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin criticised Hilton’s actions, saying, “Hilton has launched a coordinated campaign in Minneapolis to REFUSE service to DHS law enforcement. When officers attempted to book rooms using official government emails and rates, Hilton Hotels maliciously CANCELLED their reservations. This is UNACCEPTABLE.”The matter remains under investigation by Hilton, which has said it is working with the hotel to ensure compliance with its policies.","Hampton Inn in Lakeville, Minnesota, recently refused reservations to ICE and DHS agents.
