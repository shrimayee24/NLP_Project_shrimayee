NEW DELHI: Not all might be well in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after two of its alliance partners expressed displeasure over the seat-sharing deal ahead of the upcoming Bihar assembly elections.While BJP leaders are drawing parallels between alliance partners and ""Mahabharata's Pandavas"", asserting that ""NDA stands strong"" for the polls, Rashtriya Lok Morcha chief Upendra Kushwaha on Tuesday claimed that ""this time, nothing is well in NDA.""Meanwhile, Union minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi also warned that his party will contest against Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) in Bodh Gaya and Makhdumpur assembly constituencies.""I too will field my candidates in Bodh Gaya and Makhdumpur... Agreeing with the step taken by Nitish Kumar , I am fielding my candidates in two seats. The list is ready,"" Manjhi said.HAM has already announced its candidates for six seats, among whom four are sitting MLAs.This comes as a challenge to Chirag Paswan's LJP, which has been allocated 29 seats. Before the seat-sharing deal was finalised, HAM was demanding at least 15 seats. Meanwhile, Kushwaha is reportedly upset over the Mahua assembly seat, which was initially promised to him but is now being discussed for the LJP (Ram Vilas) quota.On Wednesday, Kushwaha was summoned to Delhi by the BJP top brass to avert the last-minute crisis.""I am going to Delhi. Some pondering needs to be done on the decisions that are being made in the NDA. I am going to Delhi to hold talks on the same. I'm hopeful that everything will be fine,"" Kushwaha said.Amid intense speculation that the NDA seat-sharing deal has left him infuriated, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also gave away JD(U) tickets, bypassing the party's earlier practice of announcing the names of candidates at a press conference, news agency PTI reported.It was not immediately known how many JD(U) candidates were given tickets during the day, as the CM's residence kept bustling with activity, with aspirants turning up after receiving a call from the party chief.In the meantime, rumours spread like wildfire that Nitish, who is known to dump allies and forge new coalitions at will, was angry that his party was not given the lion's share in the deal struck in Delhi on Sunday.Meanwhile, the Mahagathbandhan took a dig at the NDA, terming it ""Naiya Doobegi Abki Baar.""RJD leader Mrityunjay Tiwari said that BJP's intention is to ""finish all regional parties.""""We are saying this since the beginning that BJP's intention is to finish all regional parties... Now, conflicts have started to emerge within BJP as well,"" Tiwari said.""Everything is fine in the Mahagathbandhan, there are no ifs or buts, no conflicts. The Mahagathbandhan is united and is fighting the elections strongly. With immense public support and the blessings of the people, a Tejashwi government is going to be formed in Bihar. This is the farewell of the NDA... Upendra Kushwaha has also said that something is not right somewhere, Jitan Ram Manjhi is upset, Nitish Kumar is upset. .. NDA now stands for 'Naiya Doobegi Abki Baar'... Now, Bihar wants a Tejashwi government,"" he added.Earlier on Sunday, the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) announced seat-sharing arrangements for the upcoming Bihar elections , with the BJP and JD(U) to contest on 101 seats each, the LJP (Ram Vilas) on 29 seats, the Rashtriya Lok Morcha on six seats, and the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) on six seats.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Janata Dal (United) [JD(U)], Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), and Rashtriya Lok Morcha.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share.

Tata Motors demerger: What does it mean for investors & why did the share price drop 40%? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-motors-demerger-what-does-it-mean-for-investors-why-did-the-share-price-drop-40-explained/articleshow/124544495.cms,"The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. (AI image)

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

CHANDIGARH: Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur, in the eye of a storm following the suicide of IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, was on Monday sent on leave.Rajiv Jaitly, media adviser to Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini, confirmed the development but the official order was yet to be released till the filing of this report.The decision came past midnight —a few hours after a mega celebration in Sonipat on Friday to mark a year of the Saini govt was put on hold in view of the deepening tensions over Puran Kumar’s death. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to address the ‘Jan Vishwas-Jan Vikas’ rally.Pressure was mounting on govt to take action against Kapur, as Puran Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, had refused to allow autopsy or cremation until the DGP was removed. The stalemate dragged on for nearly a week.Dalit groups were piling on the pressure and a ‘mahapanchayat’ set up for justice to the family had handed an ultimatum of 48 hours, which expires on Tuesday.The top brass of Haryana govt, including chief principal secretary to CM Rajesh Khullar, held meetings with the family but the deadlock persisted. IPS officer Narendra Bijarniya, who too was named in Puran Kumar’s suicide was removed as Rohtak SP but Amneet stuck to her demand for action against the Haryana DGP.After a series of meetings on Monday that stretched till midnight, it was decided to send Kapur on leave.The aftershocks were felt on another front — govt’s plan to celebrate the first anniversary of the Saini govt.Protests by Dalit groups and growing support of opposition parties for the grieving family were casting long shadows on the event.According to sources, the decision to postpone it was taken after CM Nayab Singh Saini and chief secretary Anurag Rastogi chaired a meeting to review arrangements at the Sonipat venue.After a series of meetings on Monday that stretched till midnight, it was decided to send Kapur on leave. The aftershocks were felt on another front — govt’s plan to celebrate the first anniversary of the Saini govt.Protests by Dalit groups and growing support of opposition parties for the grieving family were casting long shadows on the event.According to sources, the decision to postpone it was taken after CM Nayab Singh Saini and chief secretary Anurag Rastogi chaired a meeting to review arrangements at the Sonipat venue.After the meeting, the CM set off for New Delhi by road where he would have stayed for the night and met dignitaries the next day. He was also due to attend a programme in Nuh on Tuesday.Chandigarh Police, continuing their investigation, have served a notice to IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, widow of the deceased, asking her to submit her late husband’s laptop to the Special Investigation Team (SIT).The laptop is reportedly where Kumar had drafted his suicide note, which remains saved in the device’s drafts.Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi is due to visit the family on Tuesday. So will Union minister from Bihar, Chirag Paswan.Politicians from across the country are making a beeline to visit the Kumar household in Chandigarh to console the grieving family.Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale and Telangana deputy CM Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka met the deceased officer’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, in the morning.After meeting the family, Athawale said he has assured them of all support and that the entire country’s SC community is awaiting action against the officers responsible for Kumar’s suicide. Later, Athawale also met Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini and discussed the case. Both Athawale and Paswan are allies of ruling BJP.The Telangana deputy CM criticised Haryana govt for ‘inaction’ in the case. Puran Kumar was a native of Telangana.“In his dying declaration, the deceased named Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and SP Narendra Bijarnia, accusing them of humiliation and harassment leading to his suicide. As per law, a suicide note is treated as a dying declaration, warranting strict action. However, Haryana authorities have failed to act, which is both pathetic and inhuman. I demand that Haryana and Centre take immediate action against both officers,” Vikramarka said.K Raju, AICC in charge of Jharkhand Congress, alleged that authorities are not complying with the constitutional provision that provides for equality before law. “Action against senior officers responsible for driving the IPS officer to suicide is not being taken as they are high ranking officers. Delay in action is lowering the morale of the educated Dalit youth of the country,” he said.Punjab ministers Harbhajan Singh, Harpal Singh Cheema, Mohinder Bhagat and Dr Ravjot Singh visited the family, along with former Lok Sabha MP Prem Singh Chandumajra. Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) president Abhay Chautala also consoled the family.The Sarva Khap Maha Panchayat has also announced support to the deceased IPS officer’s family. Pawanjeet Bhanwala, spokesperson for Sarv Jatiya Sarv Khap Mahapanchayat and Jat Mahasabha, said that a meeting of Sarv Khap will be held on Tuesday at Narwana in Jind district.","Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur, in the eye of a storm following the suicide of IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, was on Monday sent on leave.

NEW DELHI: A delegation of Afghan Hindus and Sikhs who left their homeland over the decades in the face of persecution and took refuge in India met Taliban foreign affairs minister Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy on Monday and requested that the current regime in Afghanistan facilitate a joint delegation of prominent Hindus and Sikhs leaders from India for the restoration and maintenance of historical gurdwaras and temples located there.The delegation is learnt to have also sought easing of requirements for Afghan Hindus and Sikhs who are now Indian nationals so that they can visit like before without having to apply for a visa, as many would want to go back for business if the regime there ensures safety for minorities.They also sought that the Afghanistan government (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) must consider appointing and engaging Afghan national Hindus or Sikhs in their mission in India too, as this will strengthen the bilateral relations.“As during the previous regime, minorities were given representation in the government and considering the same, at least two persons - one each from the Hindu and Sikh community should be appointed to high-ranking positions in the government,” the delegation conveyed as per a statement issued after the meeting. They also sought restoration of property rights and estate of minorities which were grabbed during the previous regime.The delegation, led by Afghan Minorities Council in coordination with the Indian World Forum, comprised around 30 prominent Hindus and Sikh members of the community who came to India over the decades and many of them now hold Indian citizenship.Indian World Forum President Puneet Chandhok said, “we hope that the present regime will ensure foolproof rights of minorities living there.”After the meeting, Guljeet Singh, a prominent voice from the community, told TOI that “The foreign minister assured us that he will take up all our concerns back home.” Singh said that there are about 5,000 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus in Delhi. While most have acquired Indian citizenship, there would still be around 2,000 people who are Afghan nationals.The exodus over the decades has led a large number of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus to India and from here to various other countries like the United States, Canada, UK and Germany among other countries.",A delegation of Afghan Hindus and Sikhs met Taliban foreign affairs minister Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy on Monday.

Operation Mahadev eliminated perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack, thereby boosting the nation’s confidence in our security forces,” he said.Praising the NSG for its courage and dedication in anti-terror operations during 26/11 attacks and the Akshardham attack, Shah announced govt will bring significant changes to the NSG’s operations in the coming days.

‘BRICS Attack On Dollar’: Trump Loses Cool At Putin’s Allies Over De-dollarisation Bid | Watch





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday detailed his tariff strategy against Brics , claiming the bloc was “against the dollar” and saying countries were “dropping out.”“I told anybody who wants to be in Brics, that's fine, but we're going to put tariffs on your nation,” Trump said. “Everybody dropped out. They're all dropping out of Brics. Brics was an attack on the dollar and I said, you want to play that game, I'm going to put tariffs on all of your products coming into the US. They said, like I said, we're dropping out of Brics...They don't even talk about it anymore.”Just days earlier, India had urged Brics nations to uphold the multilateral trading system and adhere to international law - a move seen as a pushback against the protectionist measures promoted by Trump’s MAGA-driven America. The appeal risks fresh friction with a US President increasingly vocal in his hostility towards the non-Western economic grouping.Trump has repeatedly attacked Brics in the past, portraying it as a challenge to US economic dominance. The grouping, originally formed by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, has now expanded to ten full members: Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE, and Indonesia.Ten others are partner states -- including Belarus, Bolivia, and Malaysia -- while another ten, such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka, have applied for membership.The rapid expansion of Brics has rattled Washington. Trump has cast it as a direct threat to the dollar’s global reserve status, insisting the bloc was “set up to hurt us” and to “degenerate our dollar.”Even as New Delhi clarified that it does not support de-dollarisation, Trump issued a fresh warning -- threatening a 100 percent tariff on Brics nations if they pursued that path.","US President Donald Trump detailed his tariff strategy against Brics, claiming the bloc was “against the dollar” Trump has repeatedly attacked Brics in the past, portraying it as a challenge to US economic dominance.

What’s next: Trump-Xi meeting in South Korea





The US-China trade war took a sharper turn this week, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accusing Chinese President Xi Jinping’s regime of making ""provocative,"" economic moves after Beijing tightened export controls on rare earth minerals.Speaking to Fox Business on Monday, Bessent said the move was a direct challenge to the global economy, ""This is China versus the rest of the world. They announced these export controls that are going to go into effect next month, and we have aggressively pushed back against them. We're not sure where this came from, why the Chinese have decided to do it now.""He added that the US would not allow Beijing to weaponize its dominance in rare earths, that includes vital materials for industries like defense, electric vehicles, and electronics, saying, ""They have pointed a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world. And, you know, we're not going to have it. China is a command and control economy. They are neither going to command [nor] control us. ""Bessent said Washington had already begun coordinating with allies, including India, Europe, and other Asian democracies, to respond collectively to China’s move.""We are going to assert our sovereignty in various ways. We have already been in touch with the allies. We will be meeting with them this week and, you know, I expect that we will get substantial global support from the Europeans, from the Indians, from the democracies in Asia,"" he added.Beijing’s new rules, announced on October 9, require companies — both Chinese and foreign — to obtain government approval to export any product containing more than 0.1% rare earth elements by value. The curbs also expand the list of restricted minerals and ban exports for foreign military use.China controls nearly 70% of the world’s rare earth mining and 90% of processing, giving it outsized leverage in sectors that depend on these materials.Among the most crucial elements is dysprosium (atomic number 66), a key ingredient in electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, semiconductors, and defense systems. Bessent compared the importance of these minerals to baking powder in a bakery, ""used in small quantities, but absolutely essential.""The export controls, which Beijing said are intended to protect national security amid ""frequent military conflict,"" have rattled supply chains globally and prompted the Trump administration’s retaliatory threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting November 1.President Donald Trump escalated tensions on Friday, announcing plans to double tariffs on Chinese imports, raising the total tariff rate to around 130%.He described China’s actions as ""extraordinarily aggressive,"" saying the US would respond with ""strong measures to defend our industries.”However, Trump later sought to calm markets, posting on Truth Social, ""It will all be fine. President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want depression for his country, and neither do I. The USA wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”Trump’s fluctuating stance has led some on Wall Street to dub him ""TACO""— short for ""Trump Always Chickens Out,"" due to his history of walking back tough tariff threats.Bessent further criticised Beijing’s strategy, calling it a sign of economic weakness rather than strength.In an interview with, he remarked, ""This is a sign of how weak their economy is, and they want to pull everybody else down with them. Maybe there is some Leninist business model where hurting your customers is a good idea, but they are the largest supplier to the world. If they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most.""He accused China of being ""in the midst of a recession or depression"" and trying to ""export their way out of it,"" warning that such tactics would only ""exacerbate their standing in the world.""Amid the escalating tensions, Bessent emphasised the importance of building a coordinated global response. He added that the US is ""willing to do whatever it takes ""to stabilise supply chains and negotiate a deal.""""Everything's on the table. I am optimistic that this can be de-escalated … lines of communication have been opened … But, the US will not be deterred here. And, you know, as I said, this is China versus the world. And the Chinese have a different business model than we do. But there is no business model that shows it is a good idea to harm your customers. China is the largest exporter in the world, and they are dependent on trade. We do not want to decouple. We want to de-risk,"" Bessent added.Despite the growing friction, Bessent confirmed that President Trump and Xi Jinping are expected to meet in South Korea later this month, although tensions could affect the schedule.""He will be meeting with Party Chair Xi in Korea, I believe that meeting will still go ahead,"" Bessent told Fox Business.Ahead of that meeting, US and Chinese officials are expected to hold staff-level talks in Washington during the IMF and World Bank meetings, followed by discussions between Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Asia.The coming weeks will test whether both sides can de-escalate the rare earth dispute or whether it becomes another flashpoint in the world’s most consequential trade relationship.","US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accuses China of making ""provocative,"" economic moves after Beijing tightened export controls on rare earth minerals.

It is important to appreciate the fact that the biggest challenge to the market is the poor earnings growth, and this is the fundamental factor behind FII selling. The Q2 results are unlikely to change the sentiments since the postponement of buying following the GST cuts, impacted corporate sales in September. But, post September the story is different.”“Automobiles and white goods are witnessing brisk sales and in the low-interest regime, with more rate cuts to come, this demand will sustain.These positives will be reflected not in the ongoing Q2 results season but in the Q3 results.

It’s a historic low for the US passport! For the first time since Henley Passport Index started releasing passport rankings almost 20 years ago, the US passport has dropped out of the top 10 most powerful or strongest passports in the world rankings!On the other hand, the top 10 list is dominated by Asian countries - with Singapore leading the ranks. A Singapore passport ensures that you have visa-free access to as many as 193 out of 227 destinations tracked by Henley Passport Index. South Korea (190) and Japan (189) follow closely.According to the latest Henley Passport Index data, the US passport has dropped to 12th position, sharing the spot with Malaysia, allowing entry to 180 of 227 destinations.Several factors contributed to the American passport's decline, including Brazil's withdrawal of visa-free entry in April, exclusion from China's expanding visa-free programme, and modifications by Papua New Guinea and Myanmar. Additional changes by Somalia's eVisa system and Vietnam's new visa-free list further affected its standing, according to Henley Passport index.Christian H. Kaelin, Chairman of Henley & Partners, said: ""The declining strength of the US passport over the past decade is more than just a reshuffle in rankings — it signals a fundamental shift in global mobility and soft power dynamics. Nations that embrace openness and cooperation are surging ahead, while those resting on past privilege are being left behind.""The British passport has also experienced a decline, moving from 6th to 8th position since July, despite having led the index in 2015.American passport holders enjoy visa-free access to 180 destinations, whilst the United States permits only 46 nationalities to enter without visas. This positions the US at 77th place on the Henley Openness Index, a measure of national receptiveness to international visitors.The United States demonstrates one of the world's largest disparities between its outbound visa-free privileges and inbound visa requirements, ranking near Australia and marginally ahead of Canada, New Zealand, and Japan, the statement said.Annie Pforzheimer, Senior Associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, ""Even before a second Trump presidency, US policy had turned inward. That isolationist mindset is now being reflected in America's loss of passport power.""Meanwhile, China has achieved notable progress. Its global ranking has improved from 94th in 2015 to 64th in 2025, gaining access to 37 additional visa-free destinations. China's position on the Henley Openness Index reached 65th after providing visa-free entry to 76 nations, surpassing the US by 30 countries.China's diplomatic achievements include recent visa-free arrangements with Russia, Gulf states, South American nations, and European partners, demonstrating its commitment to international engagement.As per the latest rankings, India stands at 85th position with visa-free access to 57 countries. Earlier this year, its rank had risen to 77.","The US passport has dropped to 12th position, sharing the spot with Malaysia, allowing entry to 180 of 227 destinations.

US jobs concern: Jerome Powell sees rising unemployment risks; Federal Reserve may cut rates twice more this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-jobs-concern-jerome-powell-sees-rising-unemployment-risks-federal-reserve-may-cut-rates-twice-more-this-year/articleshow/124558006.cms,"



Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned on Tuesday that the sharp slowdown in US hiring poses increasing risks to the economy, suggesting the central bank may reduce its key interest rate two more times before the year ends.In written remarks ahead of a meeting of the National Association of Business Economics in Philadelphia, Powell noted that despite the federal government shutdown cutting off official economic data, “the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,” when the Fed reduced its key rate for the first time this year, AP reported.At that September meeting, Fed officials forecast two additional rate cuts in 2025 and one in 2026. Lower rates could ease borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business loans.Powell reiterated that the Fed is slightly more concerned about the job market than its other mandate of keeping prices stable. While tariffs have lifted the Fed's preferred measure of inflation to 2.9%, he said, there are no “broader inflationary pressures” that would keep prices elevated.“Rising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks,” Powell said.The Fed chair also indicated that the central bank may soon stop shrinking its roughly $6.6 trillion balance sheet. The Fed has been allowing about $40 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to mature each month without replacing them, a policy that could influence longer-term Treasury yields.Powell spent much of his speech defending the Fed’s earlier purchases of longer-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities during 2020 and 2021, measures intended to lower longer-term rates and support the economy during the pandemic.Those purchases have been criticised by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and some potential Trump administration nominees to replace Powell next May. Critics argue the bond purchases exacerbated inequality by boosting the stock market without materially benefiting the economy and that the Fed continued purchases too long even as inflation surged in late 2021.“With the clarity of hindsight, we could have—and perhaps should have—stopped asset purchases sooner,” Powell said. “Our real-time decisions were intended to serve as insurance against downside risk.”He added that the purchases were also aimed at preventing a breakdown in the Treasury securities market, which could have sent interest rates significantly higher.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned on Tuesday that the sharp slowdown in US hiring poses increasing risks to the economy.

THANE: In order to prevent redevelopment projects from stalling midway and protect residents from displacement without compensation, the state housing department is framing a new policy mandating developers to deposit three years' rent before taking up any redevelopment work, deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde said on Saturday.""Some builders take on redevelopment projects, vacate residents from flats, fail to pay rent or delay construction, sometimes even trading rights with other developers, which leads to stalled projects and inconvenience for residents,"" Shinde said. ""To address this, we are introducing a policy where builders must deposit three years' rent upfront while their project execution capability will also be simultaneously assessed before approval,"" he said during a lottery function for over 5,000 Mhada flats from the Konkan region in Thane.Shinde said the state was committed to reviving stalled redevelopment projects. ""We are aligning with cash-rich govt agencies that have a reputation for completing projects on time and through combined investment with private developers, are expecting to raise Rs 50 lakh crore over the next five years and construct 35 lakh homes in the state,"" he added.Shinde, who also heads the housing department, said after he took over, Mhada started working on a pioneering housing policy for senior citizens, possibly making it the first state in the country to prioritise this segment. In addition, there are plans to develop supply in the affordable housing segment, so that sections such as working women and mill workers benefit and rental homes are available for migrant workers as open-market rates are often unaffordable.","Maha's housing department is introducing a new policy requiring developers to deposit three years' rent upfront for redevelopment projects.

Meet Abel Ariza: How being tipped €300 by Leonardo DiCaprio as a bellboy shaped his journey to CEO of the company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-abel-ariza-how-being-tipped-300-by-leonardo-dicaprio-as-a-bellboy-shaped-his-journey-to-ceo-of-the-company/articleshow/124524321.cms,"How ‘once bellboy’ Abel Ariza learned leadership lessons from Leonardo DiCaprio



Source: LinkedIn

Applying Ritz-Carlton lessons to Everhaus Group’s corporate leadership



From bellboy to CEO: Abel Ariza’s leadership journey







Abel Ariza, the CEO of Singapore-based Everhaus Group, began his professional journey far from the boardroom. At the age of 23, he worked as a bellboy at the Ritz-Carlton Barcelona, managing luggage for some of the world’s most prominent figures, including Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela, Leonardo DiCaprio , and Mariah Carey. While the role may have seemed humble, it became a formative period that instilled critical values in Ariza: discipline, humility, and the importance of valuing people, teamwork, resilience, and adaptability in dynamic environments, lessons that proved invaluable in navigating complex business challenges later in his career.Each interaction offered a lesson in human connection. Handling luggage and attending to guests taught him the significance of presence, attentiveness, and professionalism—qualities that would later shape his leadership philosophy at Everhaus Group.Among the many memorable experiences, Ariza highlighted his encounter with Leonardo DiCaprio as particularly impactful. The actor broke hotel protocol to allow Ariza access to the guest elevator. After assisting him with his luggage, DiCaprio handed Ariza leftover casino chips and said, “Keep it. Build something you believe in.”This gesture left a lasting impression on Ariza. It reinforced the importance of pursuing personal ambitions, believing in one’s vision, and recognising that small acts of encouragement can have a profound impact. Beyond the symbolic value, this moment served as an early guidepost for Ariza’s approach to business leadership: empowering others, fostering trust, and valuing initiative.Other high-profile encounters also shaped his understanding of leadership. Bill Clinton, despite fatigue from travel, personally greeted every staff member, teaching Ariza the power of presence and recognition. Nelson Mandela, who requested his coffee at precisely 6:15 AM, exemplified the role of discipline in achieving broader goals. Even Mariah Carey’s humour and acknowledgment of his efforts demonstrated the importance of empathy, respect, and human connection in building meaningful relationships.Today, as the head of Everhaus Group, operating across Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam, Ariza draws directly on the lessons from his time at the Ritz-Carlton. He emphasises purpose-driven leadership, cross-cultural collaboration, and genuinely valuing people. Whether in luxury hotel corridors or corporate boardrooms, Ariza applies the same principles of attentiveness, discipline, and humility that guided his early career.Ariza’s approach underscores that leadership is not just about authority or decision-making; it is about seeing and acknowledging every individual. By prioritising people, he creates a corporate culture built on trust, motivation, and long-term engagement—echoing the ethos he absorbed from his interactions with global leaders and celebrities.Beyond this singular hotel encounter, Leonardo DiCaprio’s broader work as an actor and philanthropist has also left a lasting impression on Ariza. Known for films such as Titanic, The Revenant, The Wolf of Wall Street, and Inception, DiCaprio is also a committed environmental activist, founder of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, and a United Nations Messenger of Peace. The actor’s dedication to purpose-driven action and creating global impact mirrors the principles Ariza now applies in business leadership.Ariza’s story has resonated with thousands on LinkedIn, where readers emphasised that true leadership begins in small acts of presence, recognition, and discipline. Many noted that even brief encounters with influential figures can shape long-term professional and personal growth. Reflecting on his journey, Ariza wrote, “I built Everhaus on the same principles I learned at the Ritz—discipline, humility, and seeing people, not positions. ”The journey from bellboy to CEO illustrates a powerful truth: early career experiences, combined with guidance from iconic figures, can form the foundation of effective leadership. By integrating humility, attentiveness, and human connection into corporate strategy, leaders can create environments where individuals thrive and organisations succeed.","Abel Ariza worked as a bellboy at the Ritz-Carlton Barcelona at the age of 23.

Who was Konstantin Galish

Konstantin Galish’s death linked to crypto market crash





Ukrainian crypto influencer Konstantin Galish, 2, was found dead inside his Lamborghini in what police believe may be a suicide. Police authorities said he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and the weapon found beside him was registered in his name. In a Telegram post, Kyiv Police said “On the eve of his death, the man informed his relatives about his depressed state due to existing financial difficulties, and also sent them a farewell message.”Konstantin Galish, 32, was a Ukrainian crypto entrepreneur and co-founder of the Cryptology Key Trading Academy. He rose to prominence as one of Ukraine’s most-followed digital asset influencers, sharing trading insights on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NFTs across social media platforms such as YouTube and Telegram.Known online as Kostya Kudo, Galish built a reputation for simplifying complex crypto concepts for retail investors and frequently discussed market trends, risk management, and blockchain adoption. His trading academy, Cryptology Key, attracted thousands of members across Eastern Europe, positioning him as one of the region’s rising crypto educators.Beyond his business ventures, Galish was also recognized for his philanthropic efforts, having donated significant sums to Ukraine’s military and humanitarian relief projects since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Investigators have linked his death to the recent global cryptocurrency market crash, during which Galish reportedly lost around $30 million of investors’ money. Police have ruled out foul play for now but are also probing possible links to extortion and business disputes.“According to the specified fact, criminal proceedings have been initiated under Part 1 of Art. 115 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine — premeditated murder with the additional mark ""suicide"". Currently, a pre-trial investigation is ongoing, all the circumstances of the event are being clarified,” the post reads.The tragedy allegedly came just days after the crypto market saw one of its sharpest crashes in years. On October 10, the global market lost about $19 billion in value within hours, triggered by US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese tech exports and tighter software export rules.Bitcoin dropped 8.4% to $104,782, while Ethereum fell 6.7%. Solana and Cardano saw even deeper declines of up to 30%.","Konstantin Galish, 32, was a Ukrainian crypto entrepreneur and co-founder of the Cryptology Key Trading Academy.

Japan, Korea, China show how national pride powers rapid growth





Zoho founder and Chief Scientist Sridhar Vembu has called on India's educated elite to rediscover their sense of belonging and commitment to the nation, arguing that a patriotic spirit is essential for the country's meaningful development. In an interview with MoneyControl, Vembu warned that globalisation has led many urban Indians to see themselves as ""global citizens"" detached from their roots, and urged them to embrace local languages and regional identities as expressions of true nationalism.""We need, particularly among our educated elite, a sense that we belong to this nation. That patriotic spirit is essential. Without that spirit, development becomes meaningless,"" Vembu told MoneyControl. He called for a revival of cultural and linguistic pride, encouraging people to learn regional languages when moving across states. ""Within Tamil Nadu , I speak Tamil as much as possible. And I tell people, if you are going to move to Bengaluru, learn Kannada. If you're going to move to Mumbai, learn Marathi. All our languages are important,"" he said.Highlighting a sharp contrast between rural and urban India, Vembu said the spirit of belonging remains strong in India's villages and small towns but is fading among the urban elite. ""If you see rural India, if you see our smaller towns, there is that sense of belonging to the nation. Unfortunately, it has gone missing in our hyper-educated elite.Because of exposure, we think, 'I'm a global citizen. I'll live wherever. ' That attitude has to change,"" he said.Vembu linked this nationalistic spirit directly to Zoho's philosophy and growth. The company, headquartered in Tamil Nadu, has built offices and training centres in rural areas to decentralise opportunity and retain local talent. ""The reason Zoho exists is not because I'm a genius. It's because our average employee feels that national spirit, that we have to build it for this nation, in this nation. That spirit is why Zoho is still ticking,"" he said.Vembu also cited countries like Japan, Korea, and China as examples where national pride and self-reliance have powered rapid development. ""They developed because they had that spirit. Without that spirit, all these questions about growth or brain drain become meaningless,"" he added.He emphasised that as globalisation reverses, India must rely on its own vast domestic market, which now stands at over $4 trillion GDP and is growing. He has consistently advocated for a Swadeshi movement in technology, urging India to be self-reliant in tech and trade on equal terms with other nations.","Sridhar Vembu says India's educated elite must rediscover their sense of belonging.

Real-world application matters more than technological supremacy







Alibaba Group chairman Joe Tsai has challenged the prevailing narrative of US-China artificial intelligence competition, arguing that the race has no definitive winner because success should be measured by adoption speed rather than model superiority. ""When it comes to AI, there's no such thing as winning the race. It's a long marathon,"" Tsai said at the All-In Summit 2025 in September, with recordings posted Wednesday. He emphasised that the AI race isn't about who builds the biggest or most powerful model — it's about who can deploy AI faster.Tsai said the US should focus more on adoption and diffusion of AI instead of spending billions on developing larger models. He argued that ""every week there's a model that's leading, but then the next week another model overtakes them,"" making model superiority a fleeting achievement.The contrasting strategies between the two nations highlight fundamental differences in AI development philosophy. US tech companies have been spending billions, with Meta expecting to spend $600 billion on AI infrastructure through 2028, while OpenAI and Oracle announced plans for a $500 billion data center project.Meanwhile, China's AI play focuses on lean, efficient models — cheaper, lighter, and easier to deploy. DeepSeek's R1 model, which disrupted the AI industry and US stock market earlier this year, rivals top competitors but was built at a fraction of the cost.Tsai highlighted China as an example of faster adoption, noting companies are embracing open-source and smaller models optimised for real-world use on mobile devices and laptops.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed similar concerns about America's adoption pace. Huang said China's under-regulation at the industrial level makes the country ""quick in adopting new technology,"" with the country aiming for 70% AI adoption by 2027.""I'm not saying China technologically is winning in the model war, but in terms of the actual application and also people benefiting from AI, it has made a lot of development,"" Tsai stated.Instead of trying to outbuild leading players like OpenAI, China focuses on rolling out AI across everyday tech at breakneck speed, which could prove just as crucial as model quality in determining overall AI competitiveness.",Alibaba Group chairman Joe Tsai has challenged the prevailing narrative of US- China artificial intelligence competition.

The H-1B visa programme has long served as a critical gateway for global talent to contribute to the United States’ economy, particularly in technology, healthcare, and academia, helping to fill key skill gaps and drive innovation. Recently, the Trump administration has signalled sweeping reforms beyond the previously proposed $100,000 mandatory fee, which has raised significant concerns among current H-1B holders, prospective applicants, and industry stakeholders. According to a note from the US Department of Homeland Security titled “Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program,” the administration is considering multiple changes, including revising eligibility for cap exemptions, increasing oversight of employers with prior violations, and tightening regulation of third-party job placements, as widely reported. These proposals are expected to be formally published in December this year, potentially reshaping application processes, affecting international talent mobility, and impacting US competitiveness in the global workforce landscape.Weeks before the proposed rule changes, President Donald Trump announced that employers would be required to pay a $100,000 fee for each H-1B visa application. This declaration caused immediate panic among the Indian diaspora and other foreign workers on H-1B visas.Many visa holders and their families, who were temporarily outside the US for work or travel, scrambled to return within 24 hours to avoid being stranded or denied entry. The situation eased slightly when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that the fee would be a one-time charge applicable only to new petitions and not an annual cost. Despite this clarification, the proposed restrictions continue to generate concern among employers and employees alike, particularly in sectors heavily reliant on foreign talent.H-1B visa holders are not limited to tech roles; roughly a third work in essential sectors such as healthcare, education, religious services, and academia, as highlighted in a recent lawsuit challenging the reforms. Tech companies, in particular, fear that the reforms could disrupt hiring practices, limit access to high-skilled talent, and make the US less competitive on a global scale.Several prominent tech leaders began their US careers under the H-1B visa system, demonstrating its crucial role in fostering innovation and economic growth.Satya Nadella, born in Hyderabad, India, moved to the US in the early 1990s. He secured an H-1B visa to work at Microsoft, where he rose through the ranks to become CEO in 2014. Nadella has consistently highlighted the critical role of skilled immigrants in fostering innovation and growth, emphasizing that many of Microsoft's most transformative projects have been driven by talent brought to the US through the H-1B program.Sundar Pichai, originally from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, moved to the US for higher studies. After completing his education, he transitioned to an H-1B visa, which allowed him to join Google. Over the years, he rose to become CEO of Alphabet, overseeing key innovations in AI, Google Cloud, and hardware like Pixel phones and Nest devices. Pichai has emphasized that immigration has been instrumental in America's technological leadership and Google's success, and he has publicly advocated for policies that expand opportunities for skilled immigrants.Aravind Srinivas, born in Chennai, India, moved to the US for higher education and later transitioned to an H-1B visa. He is the founder and CEO of Perplexity AI, a company specializing in generative AI. Despite challenges posed by immigration policies, Srinivas underscores that the US remains a meritocratic environment where talent and innovation are recognized. He emphasizes that the primary challenge for immigrants is not the increase in H-1B visa fees but finding trustworthy mentors and investors.Jayshree Ullal, originally from London and New Delhi, moved to the US at 16 to pursue higher education. She began her career on an H-1B visa and rose through several top tech companies to become CEO of Arista Networks. Ullal has been a vocal advocate for the H-1B visa program, emphasizing its importance in attracting global talent to the US She has also highlighted the challenges of the US immigration process, noting the long wait times for permanent residence approvals.Arvind Krishna, hailing from Dehradun, India, moved to the US in the 1990s on an H-1B visa. He steadily advanced to become CEO of IBM. Krishna has consistently advocated for the US to remain an international talent hub, stressing that global collaboration and access to foreign talent are essential for innovation and economic competitiveness.The H-1B visa programme has historically enabled the United States to attract some of the world’s brightest minds, driving innovation and economic expansion across multiple sectors. As proposed reforms take shape, leaders like Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Aravind Srinivas, Jayshree Ullal, and Arvind Krishna illustrate the tangible benefits of such a programme. Any policy changes must strike a careful balance between national interests, global competitiveness, and the livelihoods of millions of skilled workers who contribute to the US economy.","The H-1B visa programme has long served as a critical gateway for global talent to contribute to the United States’ economy.

What has made cyber attacks more dangerous





The National Stock Exchange (NSE) reportedly faces approximately 170 million cyberattacks daily, necessitating a dedicated team of ""cyber warriors"" to ensure seamless operations. ""Every day, millions of cyberattacks target the NSE, but our technical teams, supported by advanced systems and specialized software, combat these threats round the clock,"" a senior NSE official told PTI. The official noted that the exchange encounters 150 to 170 million cyberattacks daily, posing a significant challenge for its teams and systems.Recently, a group of journalists from Jammu and Kashmir visited the NSE to observe its management facilities, cyber defense centers, and backup systems. The NSE’s twin cyber defense centers operate in constant battle mode, equipped with upgraded software to neutralize and repel large-scale attacks on the financial market infrastructure 24/7, year-round. ""The robust cybersecurity architecture, combining tech-savvy personnel, machines, and technology, ensures the safety of NSE’s operations,"" the official told PTI.To bolster security, the NSE mandates Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) for all trading members and staff to maintain system integrity.During 'Operation Sindoor,' a DDoS simulation, the NSE recorded an unprecedented 400 million cyberattacks in a single day, the highest ever. Despite this, attackers failed to cause damage due to the coordinated efforts of personnel, machines, and advanced technology. A DDoS attack floods a server with traffic from multiple sources, aiming to crash or make it unavailable to legitimate users, a critical threat to industries like the stock market that rely on uninterrupted operations. As a precaution during this period, the NSE temporarily restricted access to its website for foreign users.Maharashtra Cyber had identified seven Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups responsible for launching over 15 lakh cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure websites across India following the Pahalgam terror strike in April this year. Of these, only 150 attacks were reportedly successful. This means a failure rate of 99.99% or should one say abysmal success rate of 0.01%. The methods used by hackers included malware campaigns, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and GPS spoofing. The defacement of Indian websites was also reported.The NSE leadership said that a breach could impact not only the exchange’s systems but also ""whatever is connected to us,"" highlighting the ripple effect of digital vulnerabilities across interconnected networks. Officials said that growing global interconnectedness and system complexity have heightened the risk of large-scale cyberattacks, posing a significant threat to financial market stability. They further noted that the potential for low-cost, large-scale cyberattacks on financial market infrastructure remains a major global risk.","The National Stock Exchange (NSE) reportedly faces approximately 170 million cyberattacks daily.

Asian stocks today: Markets open on the higher end; Fed cut hopes outweigh trade war fears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-stocks-today-markets-open-on-the-higher-end-fed-cut-hopes-outweigh-trade-war-fears/articleshow/124566741.cms,"Representative AI image





Asian stocks jumped on Wednesday as trade war fears were overshadowed by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who suggested the bank could cut interest rates again this month.Asian markets opened on the higher end (moderately), following Wall Street’s lead. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.3 percent to 47,463.31, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.5 percent to 25,826.42, and Shanghai’s Composite added 0.4 percent to 3,881.03. Taipei, Seoul, Sydney, Singapore, and Wellington also advanced, reflecting renewed investor optimism. Shanghai rose despite data showing Chinese consumer prices fell in September, indicating weak consumer sentiment.After a volatile couple of days marked by fresh flare-ups in US-China tensions, investors returned to markets, resuming a months-long, tech-fuelled rally. Powell has spent most of the year balancing efforts to cap inflation with supporting the labor market, even as President Donald Trump criticised him for not lowering borrowing costs quickly enough.Although price gains continue to exceed the Fed's target, weak economic readings have forced Powell to shift focus toward jobs.The central bank announced its first rate cut since December last month, and on Tuesday, Powell indicated more could follow. ""In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labour market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,"" he said, adding that longer-term inflation expectations remain aligned with the Fed's two-percent goal.Powell also hinted that the Fed could pause reductions in its bond holdings acquired during the pandemic to keep borrowing rates low and support the economy. No official jobs data has been released for September due to the US government shutdown, but private sector figures point to a marked slowdown in hiring.US markets ended mostly lower on Tuesdays but well off morning lows, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4 percent at 46,270.46, and London’s FTSE 100 climbing 0.1 percent to 9,452.77.Powell’s remarks helped investors turn attention away from the latest trade salvos between Washington and Beijing. Last week, Trump had threatened 100-percent tariffs on Chinese rare earths, but he softened his tone on Sunday. China, however, imposed sanctions on five American subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, accusing them of supporting Washington’s shipping industry probe.Trump said, ""We have a fair relationship with China, and I think it'll be fine. And if it's not, that's OK too. We have a lot of punches being thrown, and we've been very successful."" Meanwhile, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer described Monday’s discussions on the rare earth dispute as broadly positive, saying, ""We’ve been pretty successful in finding a path forward with them in the past so we think we'll be able to work through it. ""Currency and commodities also saw small movements. The euro rose to $1.1621, the pound strengthened to $1.3348, and the dollar slipped to 151.17 yen. Oil prices were largely flat, with WTI at $58.71 per barrel and Brent at $62.40 per barrel.","Asian markets opened on the higher end (moderately), following Wall Street's lead.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Pakistan has secured a $1.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund . IMF on Tuesday said that it has reached a staff-level agreement with the South Asian country under its ongoing loan program, paving the way for Islamabad to access $1.2 billion pending approval from the Fund's Executive Board.According to the official statement issued by the IMF, Pakistan will receive $1 billion through the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and another $200 million under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), taking the total disbursements under both programs to about $3.3 billion.""The IMF team has reached a staff-level agreement with the Pakistani authorities on the second review of the 37-month Extended Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the first review of the 28-month arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF). The staff-level agreement is subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board. Upon approval, Pakistan will have access to about US$1.0 billion (SDR 760 million) under the EFF and about US$200 million (SDR 154 million) under the RSF, bringing total disbursements under the two arrangements to about US$3.3 billion,"" the IMF said in an official statement.""Supported by the EFF, Pakistan's economic program is entrenching macroeconomic stability and rebuilding market confidence,"" the IMF said in its statement.The Fund noted that the country's recovery ""remains on track,"" citing contained inflation, stronger external buffers, and improving financial conditions reflected in narrowing sovereign spreads.IMF officials said the next tranche would be released once the board signs off on the review — a standard step in the Fund's lending framework, where loan disbursements follow successful periodic assessments.""The recovery remains on track, with the FY25 current account recording a surplus—the first in 14 years, the fiscal primary balance surpassing the program target, inflation remaining contained, external buffers strengthening, and financial conditions improving as sovereign spreads have narrowed significantly,"" it added.Pakistan has committed to maintaining a tight and data-dependent monetary policy and strengthening climate resilience — a key demand from the IMF after the floods devastated large parts of the country.""The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the EFF- and RSF-supported programs, and to maintaining sound and prudent macroeconomic policies while advancing ongoing structural reforms,"" the statement added.Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said earlier in the day that Pakistan was close to finalising the agreement after an IMF team concluded its review visit last week. ""The staff-level deal marks a major step forward,"" he told reporters, according to Reuters, signalling renewed investor confidence.Aurangzeb also revealed that Pakistan plans to return to international capital markets, starting with its first-ever green bond denominated in Chinese yuan before the end of 2025.

‘Hostile act’: Trump says considering terminating business with China; threatens to end cooking oil trade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hostile-act-trump-says-considering-terminating-business-with-china-threatens-to-end-cooking-oil-trade/articleshow/124561385.cms,"Poll Do you think trade disputes like the US-China soybean issue hurt farmers the most? Yes, farmers face the biggest impact No, it affects the economy more broadly

Why it matters?



Is it soya war or something else







US President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed that China is ""purposefully"" not buying the soybeans from their farmers, and this is the reason they are considering terminating the business with Beijing.Calling China's deliberate work an ""economically hostile act,"" Trump said that they can make the cooking oil themselves and don't need China for that.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""I believe that China purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers, is an Economically Hostile Act. We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution. As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don’t need to purchase it from China.""The United States soya bean harvest is under way, and China, once the biggest buyer of American soybeans, hasn’t booked a single purchase, sending prices tumbling and farmers into panic.The abrupt halt mirrors Beijing's previous use of rare earth exports as leverage in trade wars. Now, it's soybeans.The United States, which exports approximately 61% of the world's soybeans, has recorded zero purchases from China for the current harvest, a sharp decline from Rs 1.05 lakh crore in purchases last year.This shift is part of an escalating trade dispute, with Beijing leveraging economic measures in response to President Trump's renewed tariffs. Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings, stated, “US soybeans now are not that important to China. That’s why Beijing can afford to use the import ban as a bargaining tool.”Additionally, the Trump tariffs have increased costs for fertilizer and equipment, thereby reducing farmers' profit margins. Farmers across the Midwest have begun storing crops, postponing sales, and observing declining futures markets. Morey Hill, a soybean grower from Iowa, told the Wall Street Journal, “There’s no incentive to sell right now.” Hill warned that without a timely agreement with China, the soybean market “might be a bloodbath. ” US farmers are currently grappling with higher expenses and a reduction in buyers.This isn't just about soy. This situation mirrors China's earlier strategy with rare earth minerals, used as leverage in negotiations with the Trump administration over export controls. Now, as the soybean harvest commences, Beijing is repeating this tactic. Lu Ting noted, “Beijing’s new bargaining chip is an import ban on US soybean,” as reported by Bloomberg.While soybeans may not possess the unique qualities of rare earths, they are essential for China's substantial hog and poultry industries. Escalating trade tensions have led China to increase soybean imports from South America, purchasing 2 million tons from Argentina in September alone.Dean Buchholz, a farmer concluding his final crop this year, expressed his discontent to the Wall Street Journal, saying, “I always thought I would farm till they threw dirt on top of me.” He added, “I can’t make it work to where it would be practical to keep going without me spending a boatload of money and keep putting myself into more debt.”Caleb Ragland, 39, a Kentucky farmer and president of the American Soybean Association, commented, ""The frustration is overwhelming."" The timing compounds the issue, as over half of US soybean exports typically occur between October and December, immediately following harvest.China is delaying purchases until February when Brazil's crop becomes available. Sarah Taber, a crop scientist and blogger from North Carolina, remarked, “We knew what Trump would do. And a lot of farmers just voted for him anyway.” Taber warned that if no agreement is reached by December, US soy exports could miss the entire global buying window.","The United States, which exports approximately 61% of the world's soybeans, has recorded zero purchases from China for the current harvest.

Clear messaging to Pakistan



Strategic recalibration: Delhi steps in



Economics, connectivity and regional stakes



Security calculus: Terrorism and recognition



Presence restored, recognition withheld



Regional balancing act



Strategic hedging, not endorsement







NEW DELHI: In a diplomatic manoeuvre that could reshape regional equations, India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s high-profile visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan — the first of its kind that came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Kabul and Islamabad.During the meetings, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that India’s engagement “contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” while announcing a fresh round of development projects across Afghan provinces. The upgrade of India’s technical mission to a full-fledged embassy signals a significant deepening of diplomatic ties without extending formal recognition to the Taliban regime.Later the same day, Muttaqi held a press briefing in New Delhi, sharply condemning Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, calling it a “provocative act” and a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty. “Such issues cannot be resolved by strength.Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he said, stressing the widening rift between Kabul and Islamabad.India had shut its Kabul embassy in August 2021 after the Taliban’s return to power, maintaining only a skeletal presence through a technical team since June 2022 to oversee humanitarian aid. The embassy upgrade marks the deepest level of engagement between India and the Taliban since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government. This move stops short of formal recognition but signals a decisive shift in India’s Afghanistan strategy.The timing of the announcement was significant. It came just hours after Afghanistan’s defence ministry accused Pakistan of bombing civilian areas in Paktika near the Durand Line. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the ministry said in a post on social media. Calling it “an unprecedented, violent, and provocative act”, Kabul warned that defending its territory is its right.From Indian soil, Muttaqi chose to respond sharply. “I think it’s a wrong step by the Pakistan government. Such issues cannot be resolved by strength. Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he told reporters in Delhi. “Some attacks happened in border areas, and we condemn them. We have opened doors for dialogue and diplomacy.”The unusually strong language stressed the widening rift between the Taliban and Pakistan, their uneasy patron for decades. Relations have deteriorated over Islamabad’s military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters allegedly sheltering in Afghanistan. In March 2024, Pakistani airstrikes in Khost and Paktika killed several civilians, triggering warnings from Kabul of “consequences”. This fracture, analysts say, has created a new strategic opening for India.India has historically had a fraught relationship with the Taliban. During the 1990s, New Delhi backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance while Islamabad openly supported the Taliban regime. After 2001, India became one of Afghanistan’s largest regional donors, pledging over USD 3 billion for development projects. But the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 disrupted India’s presence and leverage in the country. New Delhi maintained limited contact, focusing on humanitarian assistance and regional coordination with Iran and Central Asian partners.Now, with Pakistan–Taliban ties fraying, India is recalibrating. By reopening its embassy, hosting Muttaqi, and accepting Taliban-appointed diplomats (though not at the ambassadorial level), India is signalling a willingness to engage without granting formal recognition. Strategic analysts describe this as “hedging” — positioning itself to gain influence should Pakistan’s grip weaken further, while safeguarding its own security concerns.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says this evolving situation presents India with a rare diplomatic opening.“The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly offers an opportunity for India can be a stabilising factor even in the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. India’s presence matters a lot to Afghanistan because it will provide some kind of legitimacy to the Taliban government, even though India is unlikely to recognise the regime as such,” he says.The engagement carried clear economic undertones as well. Muttaqi invited Indian companies to invest in Afghanistan’s mining sector and called for the opening of the Attari–Wagah border for direct India–Afghanistan trade. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all three countries,” he said.Currently, India trades with Afghanistan primarily via Iran’s Chabahar port due to Pakistan’s denial of overland access. But the route faces uncertainty after the United States revoked India’s sanctions waiver for Chabahar in September 2024, complicating transit. While Chabahar remains a strategic hedge, its operational limitations make direct India–Afghanistan connectivity via Pakistan attractive in theory — though politically fraught.India also announced a new slate of development projects: a Thalassemia Centre and 30-bed hospital in Bagrami district, oncology and trauma centres in Kabul, maternity clinics across Paktika, Khost and Paktia, and donations of ambulances, medical equipment and vaccines. These announcements draw on India’s legacy of over 500 development projects across all 34 Afghan provinces, including the Parliament building and the Salma Dam.Security remains at the core of India’s engagement. Without naming Pakistan, both sides “unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries” in their joint statement. Jaishankar said, “We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” Muttaqi, meanwhile, pledged that Afghanistan “won’t allow any group to use the country against others”, identifying Daesh (ISIS) as the main regional threat.For India, the key is ensuring Afghan soil is not used for anti-India activities — a core concern since the IC-814 hijacking in 1999. Prof. Kumar explains this strategic bottom line:“What can happen, and what India is probably thinking, is that the land of Afghanistan may not be used for terrorist activities against India. That would be a huge achievement from the Indian perspective,” he says.India has so far avoided pressing the Taliban hard on human rights. Muttaqi remained vague when asked about women’s rights, saying, “All countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected.” While India has consistently raised rights issues at multilateral forums, officials have avoided making them a precondition for engagement.Perhaps the most consequential element of India’s strategy is its decision to reopen its embassy in Kabul without formally recognising the Taliban regime — a nuanced diplomatic line that gives New Delhi both flexibility and leverage. By restoring a physical diplomatic presence, India can deepen engagement on the ground and signal its relevance in Afghanistan’s evolving power dynamics, without extending official legitimacy to a government that remains internationally unrecognised and controversial for its human rights record.This approach reflects a clear distinction between establishing an embassy and granting diplomatic recognition. India has previously maintained similar diplomatic arrangements, such as with Palestine, where the presence of an embassy does not automatically translate into full diplomatic recognition of a government. In the Afghan context, this allows India to engage pragmatically while aligning its policy with the broader stance of the United Nations, the European Union and Western countries, most of which have opted for functional engagement without recognition.By doing so, New Delhi positions itself strategically. It can build channels of communication, potentially shape outcomes on critical security and connectivity issues, and apply pressure on regional actors like Pakistan and China, both of which are wary of India expanding its influence in Afghanistan. At the same time, India avoids prematurely endorsing a regime whose policies on women’s rights and governance remain at odds with international norms.India’s outreach is also informed by broader regional considerations. Russia and China have already established working relationships with the Taliban. Western governments are engaged in dialogue on counterterrorism and aid. New Delhi, analysts say, does not want to be the outlier.As Prof. Kumar notes, “Since Russia is talking, China is already there, and American and Western governments are also talking, India should not be left out. We may have ideological differences with the Taliban regime, but since other countries are talking to the Taliban in different forms, we should also try to moderate our policy and engage on several issues.”This balancing act is not without challenges. The Taliban regime remains ideologically rigid, especially on women’s rights and governance. Connectivity through Chabahar faces geopolitical headwinds. And there is no guarantee that the Taliban will limit anti-India groups indefinitely. Yet, by opening formal diplomatic channels, India aims to secure a seat at the table rather than watch from the sidelines as others shape Afghanistan’s future.Muttaqi’s visit to Delhi, marked by strong rhetoric against Pakistan, overtures for trade, and assurances on terrorism, reflects Kabul’s attempt to diversify its diplomatic bets. For India, the outreach is less about endorsing the Taliban regime and more about strategic positioning: insulating itself against security risks, reasserting influence in a region long dominated by Pakistan, and adapting to a shifting geopolitical landscape.New Delhi’s approach remains cautious but deliberate. It is engaging the Taliban to pursue its security and strategic objectives, without abandoning its normative concerns or rushing into recognition. In the complex triangle of India–Afghanistan–Pakistan, this marks the beginning of a new phase — one where India is no longer merely reacting to developments in Kabul, but actively shaping them.","India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy.

India Spreading False Narratives About Hindu Attacks in Bangladesh: Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus





A fire broke out at a garment factory and adjoining chemical warehouse in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, killed at least nine people and injured several others on Tuesday, according to fire service officials, reported AP.The blaze erupted in the Mirpur area and is believed to have started on the third floor of a seven-storey building housing a garment facility, said Talha bin Jashim, a senior fire official. The cause of the fire is yet to be confirmed.Rescue workers had recovered nine bodies by late evening and warned that the death toll could rise. “Several other people have been injured,” Jashim said.The fire was brought under control by evening, though rescue and recovery operations were to continuing late into the night.Bangladesh is the second-largest garment exporter globally after China. The sector employs around four million people, the majority of them women, and contributes nearly $40 billion annually to the country’s export earnings, mainly from the US and Europe.The industry has long faced scrutiny for industrial safety standards. Several past accidents, including fires and building collapses, have been attributed to poor oversight and violations of safety and construction codes.(With inputs from agencies)","A fire broke out at a garment factory and adjoining chemical warehouse in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, killed at least nine people and injured several others.
