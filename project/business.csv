H-1B Visa Delays: MEA Says India Has Flagged Issue With US

NEW DELHI: India has flagged concerns over the US expansion of its H-1B visa programme review, saying it has caused hardship to Indian families.MEA said it received representations from nationals facing delays and problems in rescheduling visa appointments.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India had raised the issue with US in New Delhi and DC, hoping disruptions would be addressed.He said prolonged appointment delays stranded people, affecting family life and children’s education. The US expanded H-1B reviews from Dec 15, including H-4 dependents, globally. India remains engaged to minimise disruptions and support affected Indian professionals abroad.","MEA said it received representations from nationals facing delays and problems in rescheduling visa appointments.

Life of Husain's mural insecure at LIC HQ in Mumbai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/life-of-husains-mural-insecure-at-lic-hq-in-mumbai/articleshow/126198434.cms,"M F Husain painted the mural in 1963 after winning a competition. He was paid Rs 1,000 for the work

MUMBAI: Pablo Picasso famously said that ""art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life,"" but at the Yogakshema Building at Nariman Point, which houses the headquarters of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), a wall mural painted by M F Husain appears to be doing the opposite, quietly accumulating dust as visitors and employees offer only fleeting glances while passing through the metal detector at the security screening area.The mural, depicting a female musician, is located on the wall directly opposite the security checking area in the lobby of the building's east wing.It shows visible signs of deterioration, including cracks, tearing and layers of settled dust. Ongoing renovation work, including plastering and the erection of scaffolding, has been carried out close to the artwork, placing it at further risk of damage.Though a metal detector stands next to the mural, there is no name plaque to inform the thousands who pass through the entrance about the value and heritage of the work.Painted in 1963, the mural was created after Husain won a competition organised by LIC to adorn the lobby of its then newly inaugurated headquarters. Husain was paid Rs 1,000 for the commission.Brinda Miller of the Kala Ghoda Arts Association said such neglect was not unusual.""A mosaic mural by Jatin Das was similarly destroyed in a government building years ago. In contrast, another Husain mural inside a restaurant at the Cricket Club of India stands beautifully preserved,"" she said, adding that wall art in India is often undervalued.Conservation architect Vikas Dilawari said the issue extended across institutions. He cited neglect of a K K Hebbar mural at Nair Hospital and noted that Husain painted directly onto the marble wall, requiring protection during construction.Raisa, the artist's daughter, called the situation a ""tragedy"". When contacted, LIC executive director Pradeep Shenoy said he was unaware of the mural's value and would look into providing protection","M F Husain painted the mural in 1963 after winning a competition.

Though the region comes at fifth in the list of 10 in terms of suffering financial loss, it reported the highest number of casualties.Globally, the US - the largest historical carbon emitter - bore the brunt with the fires in California topping the list as the single biggest one-off event at $60 billion in damage (nearly 50% of the total cost globally) and leading to the deaths of more than 400 people.The annual report of Christian Aid, released on Saturday, underlined that most of these estimates are based only on “insured losses”, meaning the true financial costs are likely to be even higher, while the human costs are often uncounted.Second on the list after the US were the cyclones and floods that struck Southeast Asia in Nov, causing $25 billion in damage and killing more than 1,750 people across Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Malaysia. Third were the devastating floods in China which displaced thousands, caused $11.7 billion in damage and killed at least 30.“These disasters are not ‘natural’ — they are the inevitable result of continued fossil fuel expansion and political delay. While the costs run into the billions, the heaviest burden falls on communities with the least resources to recover. Unless govts act now to cut emissions and fund adaptation measures, this misery will only continue,” said Joanna Haigh, emeritus professor of Atmospheric Physics, Imperial College London.Though the top 10 focuses on financial costs, which are usually higher in richer countries because they have higher property values and can afford insurance, some of the most devastating extreme weather events this year hit poorer nations, which have contributed little to causing the climate crisis and have the least resources to respond.“The suffering caused by the climate crisis is a political choice. It is being driven by decisions to continue burning fossil fuels, to allow emissions to rise, and to break promises on climate finance,” said Patrick Watt, Christian Aid CEO, while urging world leaders to act in 2026.","Extreme weather events such as wildfires, heatwaves, floods and cyclonic storms cost the world more than $122 billion in 2025.

Statistics and silence: What trauma leaves undocumented

Every reported crime carries a backstory that never makes it into the case file. Before the FIR, there is the moment of doubt, whether to speak, whom to trust, and what might follow. For countless women in India, that moment ends in silence.That silence is in reality filled with a lot of calculations, the fear that people might not believe them, families asking them to ""let it go"" because of the risk of retaliation or to protect family honour, the cost of legal battles that can go for years, and the silent understanding that the road to justice, even when promised, can be unforgiving. For most women, safety is not a guarantee. It is something worked out every day, by calculation which roads to avoid, staying quiet in unfamiliar spaces, adjusting behaviour, and often living with an abuse that feels easier to manage than to report.In 2025, crime data remains the only way women’s safety in India is judged. These numbers shape headlines, policy debates, and official claims of progress. But they reflect only those cases that enter the criminal justice system.Far more experiences remain outside the record, abuse within homes, harassment in public spaces, threats online, incidents that never become complaints because the cost of speaking up feels higher than the abuse itself.The most recent comprehensive figures from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) are from 2022. Since then, there has been no official dataset available, leaving a gap in understanding more recent trends and ground reality.As per data reported in 2022, India recorded 4,45,256 cases of crimes against women, reflecting a 4 per cent increase from the previous year and translating to an average of 51 complaints every hour. The national crime rate stood at 66.4 cases per lakh women. While these numbers point to the persistence of gender-based violence, they also reveal widely contrasting data across states. Union Territory Delhi reported a crime rate of 144.4 per cent, more than double the national average, while Haryana (118.7) and Telangana (117.6) also recorded significantly higher rates.Such variations raise critical questions: do higher numbers indicate greater prevalence of crime, better reporting mechanisms, or a combination of both?Official statistics, however, capture only those incidents that enter the criminal justice system formally and are reported. A substantial body of evidence suggests that a large proportion of violence against women remains unaccounted for, particularly when it occurs within households or involves perpetrators known to the survivor. Data from the National Family Health Survey–5 (2019–21) paints a starkly different picture of women’s lived experiences.According to the survey, nearly one in three married women in India, 32 per cent, at some point in their lives, have faced physical, sexual, or emotional violence at the hands of their husbands, while 6.1 per cent reported experiencing sexual violence. The contrast between these prevalence-based findings and police-recorded crime figures highlights a persistent gap between reality and reporting.This gap is shaped by multiple factors: fear of retaliation, social pressure that stems from maintaining one’s family’s honour, lack of trust in law enforcement, prolonged judicial processes, and economic dependence. In rural areas and among communities living on the fringes, these barriers are often compounded by limited access to police stations, legal aid, and survivor support services. Even in urban areas, where reporting is relatively higher, cybercrime and workplace harassment may be beyond regulatory scope or are addressed through informal mechanisms rather than criminal complaints.In 2025, crime statistics continue to remain an indispensable tool for understanding trends, allocating resources, and holding institutions accountable. Yet numbers alone cannot capture the full extent of women’s vulnerability, resilience, or the systemic failures that allow violence to persist.An increase in the number of First Information Reports (FIRs) registered does not automatically signal a spike in crime; in many cases, it reflects changes in reporting behaviour, policing frameworks, and legal awareness. This distinction is crucial when interpreting data on crimes against women, where historically low reporting has long masked the true scale of violence.One key factor behind higher FIR counts is improved access to the justice system. Supreme Court rulings mandating the compulsory registration of FIRs for cognisable offences, coupled with women’s help desks at the state-level, online portals for lodging complaints, and dedicated women’s police stations, have lowered procedural barriers that previously discouraged survivors from coming forward. In such contexts, rising FIR numbers may indicate institutional responsiveness rather than an actual rise in such incidents.Shifts in social attitudes also play a significant role. Greater public discussion around gender-based violence, through media coverage, civil society advocacy, and movements demanding accountability, has contributed to increased awareness of legal rights among women.However, it is pertinent to note that increased FIR registration does not eliminate concerns about underreporting. Crimes such as domestic violence, marital sexual abuse, cyber harassment, and trafficking remain highly underrepresented in police data. In many cases, complaints are withdrawn, informally “settled,” or never converted into FIRs due to pressure from families or local authorities. Additionally, rising numbers of FIRs often are not proportionately reflected in advances made to charges and convictions. It raises questions about whether the system is equipped to handle greater reporting effectively.Recent findings from the National Annual Report and Index on Women’s Safety, released by the National Commission for Women (NCW), further underline the limits of relying solely on official crime statistics to assess women’s safety.Based on a survey of 12,770 women across 31 cities, the report seeks to document unreported harassment, everyday experiences, and perceptions of safety that rarely enter police records. India received a national safety score of 65 per cent, with six in ten women saying they felt safe in their city. However, a substantial 40 per cent still described themselves as “not so safe” or “unsafe,” revealing a significant perception gap.The data shows that while educational institutions are viewed as relatively safe by 86 per cent of respondents during the day, feelings of safety decline sharply at night and in off-campus spaces. The survey also found that 7 per cent of women reported experiencing harassment in public spaces in 2024, a figure that rises to 14 per cent among women under 24, identifying young women as a particularly vulnerable group. Crucially, the report highlights pervasive underreporting, with nearly two-thirds of harassment incidents never formally reported, suggesting that NCRB figures capture only a fraction of the problem. Neighbourhoods (38 per cent) and public transport (29 per cent) emerged as the most frequently cited harassment hotspots.Women’s responses to harassment varied widely: 28 per cent confronted the harasser, 25 per cent left the area, and only 20 per cent approached authorities reflecting low confidence in institutional redress. Indeed, just one in three victims filed a formal complaint, pointing to enduring trust deficits in policing and complaint mechanisms, and reinforcing the gap between lived experience and recorded crime.For many survivors of violence, the decision to report an offence is shaped less by the severity of the crime than by the social and institutional costs of speaking out. Policing structures, patriarchal norms, and sustained pressure from families and communities combine to create formidable barriers to reporting, particularly in cases involving sexual violence, domestic abuse, or harassment by known perpetrators. While legal frameworks mandate the registration of complaints, the lived experience of engaging with the criminal justice system often deters survivors from approaching it in the first place.Interactions with the police remain a significant point of friction. Survivors frequently cite fear of being disbelieved, questioned about their character, or pressured into compromise rather than a formal complaint. In cases of domestic violence or sexual assault, women are often encouraged to deal with matters in private spaces, reflecting deeply ingrained attitudes that prioritise social harmony over individual justice. Procedural hurdles, such as repeated visits to police stations, insensitive questioning, or delays in registering First Information Reports, further discourage reporting, especially for women with limited mobility, financial dependence, or caregiving responsibilities.Patriarchal expectations within families and communities add another layer of pressure. Survivors may be warned that reporting violence will bring shame, damage marriage prospects, or invite social ostracism. In intimate partner violence, economic dependence and concern for children’s welfare frequently compel women to endure abuse in silence. Young women, in particular, face heightened scrutiny, with families often prioritising “reputation” over accountability, discouraging formal complaints even when harm is severe.These pressures are compounded by structural weaknesses in survivor support systems.Together, policing practices, patriarchal control, and social pressure create a climate where silence appears safer than disclosure. As a result, official crime data captures only a narrow slice of women’s experiences, masking the depth of violence that continues to shape everyday life.Crime data is designed to count incidents, not to measure the enduring weight of trauma or the complex realities of survival. While statistics can indicate how many cases were reported, registered, or prosecuted, they remain largely silent on what violence does to women’s bodies, minds, livelihoods, and relationships long after the event. The aftermath of abuse, fear, anxiety, depression, disrupted education or employment, and fractured social ties rarely appears in official records, even though these consequences often shape a survivor’s life more profoundly than the crime itself.Numbers also fail to capture the uneven paths to survival. For many women, continuing daily life involves constant negotiation: avoiding certain routes, abandoning jobs, changing schools, or remaining in unsafe homes due to financial dependence or lack of shelter. These acts of adaptation and endurance are invisible in crime statistics, which treat incidents as discrete events rather than ongoing experiences. A closed case or a withdrawn complaint may signal resolution on paper, but it often masks unresolved harm or coercive compromise.Equally absent from the data are the cumulative effects of repeated, low-level violence, verbal abuse, intimidation, stalking, and digital harassment that may not meet reporting thresholds but steadily erode a sense of safety and autonomy. Crime figures can show whether violence is counted, but not whether dignity is restored.Without incorporating survivor-centred perspectives, trauma-informed indicators, and long-term outcomes, data risks reducing deeply personal suffering to abstract totals, obscuring both the cost of violence and the resilience required to live with it.","In 2025, crime data remains the only way women’s safety in India is judged. These numbers shape headlines, policy debates, and official claims of progress. But they reflect only those cases that enter the criminal justice system. Far more experiences remain outside the record, abuse within homes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126190684,imgsize-1336965,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

He mentioned medical care, transport, internet and mobile services.The visitor compared these with costs in the US. According to Jain, his friend ""pays $600 for mobile and data at his house Pays $30k for health insurance for 4!! Per annum Pays 2 percent as property taxes per year..!!""Jain added that while air quality was better in the US, many good things were happening in India.The post drew a range of responses from social media users. One person wrote that many of their friends living in Bengaluru preferred it to New York City.Another user commented that from an outsider’s point of view, India’s main problems came down to a lack of civic sense. ""I am an outsider and I can say that everything wrong with the country has to do only with lack of civic sense among the people,"" he wrote.Someone who said they had lived in the Bay Area and were currently based in New York, agreed that phone bills and insurance costs in the US was high, but said salaries were also much higher, making direct comparisons difficult.The user added that property taxes varied by state and often fund services like public schools and clean roads.

NEW DELHI: The CBI on Friday filed a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi high court’s order suspending the life sentence of the Unnao rape convict and former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar.According to a CBI spokesperson, the decision was taken after examining the order passed by the high court’s division bench.The agency’s move came three days after the HC granted relief to Sengar, an order that sparked widespread outrage and led to protests by the victim, her mother, and women's groups.The survivor of the June 2017 assault had already said she would approach the top court.On Tuesday, a division bench of Justices Subramonium Prasad and Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar ordered the suspension of Sengar’s sentence during the pendency of his appeal against conviction and life imprisonment, subject to the furnishing of a bail bond of Rs 15 lakh. He was also granted conditional bail.The bench directed that the politician shall not enter a five-kilometre radius of the area in Delhi where the survivor resides. He has also been ordered to remain in the national capital and to have no contact with the woman and her family members.Senior advocate N Hariharan, along with advocate SP Tripathi, appeared for Sengar and argued that their client was not a public servant at the time of the offence.They also contended that there were “discrepancies” in documents relating to the survivor’s age and said medical evidence should be relied upon.Opposing the bail plea, advocate Mehmood Pracha, appearing for the victim, submitted that there had been “serious threats” to her life in the past. Pracha pointed out that she had earlier been provided security, which was later withdrawn, and highlighted that her father was assaulted in police custody and later died due to his injuries — a case in which Sengar was separately convicted.The former MLA remains in judicial custody as he has not been granted bail in the second case, for which he was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. He has also challenged his conviction and sentence in that matter.The Uttar Pradesh government transferred the investigation to the CBI in April 2018. In August 2019, the Supreme Court shifted the case and all related proceedings from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi to ensure a fair and speedy trial. Sengar was convicted and sentenced in December that year.","CBI files a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi high court’s order suspending the life sentence of the Unnao rape convict and former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

"Hair-loss drug under lens over threat to infants, eye disorders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hair-loss-drug-under-lens-over-threat-to-infants-eye-disorders/articleshow/126195368.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: Minoxidil, a widely used over-the-counter drug to treat hair loss, has been linked to unintended exposure in infants and a large number of eye-related side effects, according to a global safety analysis that has flagged dozens of baby-related cases and more than 1,600 eye disorder reports worldwide.Researchers identified more than 45 reports of excessive hair growth in infants aged up to 23 months linked to exposure to minoxidil. In several cases, exposure was not due to direct application but occurred unintentionally within the household, including contact with caregivers or contaminated surfaces.Globally, the analysis found 2,664 suspected cases of excessive hair growth linked to minoxidil use during pregnancy. Among infant cases, maternal exposure accounted for 22.2%, accidental exposure for 44.4%, while the route of exposure was unclear in 33.3% of cases.Though no infant cases were reported from India, the authors of the study cautioned that this likely reflected under-reporting rather than absence of risk, given the drug's widespread use.The study also raised concerns about eye health. A total of 1,660 reports of eye-related adverse effects associated with minoxidil use were recorded globally, including 25 reports from India.Frequently reported problems included eyelid swelling and blurred vision.More serious eye conditions were also noted, including central serous chorioretinopathy. After removal of duplicate reports, four serious eye cases remained - three involving central serous chorioretinopathy and one case of retinal artery occlusion.The findings are based on a post-marketing safety analysis of adverse drug reports submitted to VigiBase, the global drug safety database maintained by WHO, covering data up to March 2025.The study was authored by Dr V Kalaiselvan and Dr Jaishree Suresh of the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission, health ministry, and Dr Rohit Saxena of the Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS.Minoxidil was originally developed as an oral medicine to treat high blood pressure. Hair growth was later observed as a side effect, leading to its reformulation as a topical drug used to treat hair loss. Its effectiveness against androgenetic alopecia has since made it one of the most commonly used treatments worldwide.The authors warned easy over-the-counter availability, aggressive online promotion and limited counselling had allowed use to expand faster than safety awareness, particularly among pregnant women and households with infants.The study underlined that minoxidil was contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but awareness of this warning remained low. With topical formulations commonly used at home, unintentional exposure through skin contact or household surfaces may place infants at risk.Calling for action, the authors recommended clearer warning labels, stricter oversight of over-the-counter sales and routine counselling by pharmacists and healthcare providers.Caregivers were advised to store products safely and avoid use around infants and pregnant women.While minoxidil continues to benefit adults using it to treat hair loss, the authors stressed public awareness and pharmacovigilance must keep pace with growing use to prevent avoidable adverse effects.","Minoxidil, a widely used over-the-counter drug to treat hair loss, has been linked to unintended exposure in infants and a large number of eye-related side effects.

Red Line From New Delhi: India Calls Out Yunus Govt As Minority Attacks In Bangladesh Escalate

‘2,900 incidents against minorities have been documented during Yunus government’

NEW DELHI: The acrimonious exchanges between India and Bangladesh in the past few weeks came to a head on Friday with India slamming Dhaka for ""unremitting hostility"" against minorities - including Hindus, Christians and Buddhists - in the country at the hands of extremists.Calling it a matter of grave concern, ministry of external affairs (MEA) condemned the recent killing of a Hindu youth in Mymensingh and stressed that the perpetrators of the crime must be brought to justice.Asked about the return of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman to Dhaka after 17 years, the Indian govt only said it should be seen in the context of India's call for efforts to ensure free, fair and inclusive parliamentary polls in Bangladesh.PM Narendra Modi had earlier expressed concerns about the failing health of Tarique's mother and former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia and offered all possible assistance to her.Tarique returned to Dhaka on Thursday, further energising BNP - which was revived by former PM Sheikh Hasina's ouster last year - ahead of the Feb 12 parliamentary elections.On the security situation in Bangladesh, the ministry said it rejected the false narrative created in the country.""You would understand that law and order or security situation or the developments that are happening in Bangladesh is the responsibility of the govt of Bangladesh, and to portray a narrative where things go in some other direction is completely false and we reject that,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.The official said that more than 2,900 incidents of violence against minorities, including cases of killings, arson, and land grab, have been documented by independent sources during the tenure of the interim govt and these incidents cannot be brushed aside as mere media exaggeration or dismissed as political violence. The interim govt led by chief adviser Muhammad Yunus has repeatedly brushed aside India's concerns as propaganda by the Indian media.""We are all aware of the recent developments in Bangladesh. We have been closely following them. And, as far as the law and order situation is concerned, I have been apprising you from time to time as to what our position has been or should be and is today. The unremitting hostility against minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists at the hands of extremists, is a matter of grave concern,"" said the official.“India wants close and friendly relations with people of Bangladesh which is rooted in Liberation struggle and strengthened through various development and people-to-people initiatives,” he said.BNP had earlier said it wanted balanced ties with India. Indian govt’s response was that it remained committed to the best interests of people of Bangladesh, including peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country and will continue to engage constructively in this regard with all stakeholders.","India slams Dhaka for ""unremitting hostility"" against minorities.

NEW DELHI: In a first, government notified standards for incense sticks (agarbatti) and has laid down quality norms or Indian Standards, specifying a list of substances prohibited for use in their manufacture.The items include certain insecticidal chemicals such as allethrin, permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin and fipronil, as well as synthetic fragrance intermediates like benzyl cyanide, ethyl acrylate and diphenylamine. Many of these substances are restricted or banned internationally due to their potential impact on human health, indoor air quality and ecological safety.The standard, IS 19412:2025, developed by BIS was released by consumer affairs minister Pralhad Joshi on Consumer Rights Day.

NEW DELHI: India is committed to bring back all fugitives who are wanted here to face prosecution, ministry of external affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said Friday at a media briefing.He was replying to a question on the recent videos of fugitives Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya apparently mocking at Indian law enforcement agencies for their failure to get them deported from London.“We remain fully committed that people who are fugitives and who are wanted by law in India, return to the country. For this particular return, we are in talks with several governments, and processes are on,” Jaiswal said.He said the delay (in the Mallya and other extradition cases) is because “in several of these cases there are several layers of legalities involved”. Jaiswal, however, reiterated that the government remained committed to bringing them back to the country so that they can face trial before courts here.Modi and Mallya are facing multiple money laundering charges in India and have taken refuge in London, refusing to return to face trial in cases against them.On Dec 16, Modi hosted a birthday bash at his London residence at Belgrave Square for his friend Mallya with Indian billionaire Kiran Mazumdar Shaw and others in attendance.Modi mocked the enforcement agencies with his “we’re the biggest fugitives” comment as he posed for a picture with Mallya and a woman guest.Two days later, ED announced it has restituted Rs 312 crore from the sale proceeds of Mallya’s Kingfisher Airlines to its former employees towards their long-pending dues. The funds were released from earlier proceeds restituted by ED to SBI from sale of shares of Mallya’s company.Mallya has already lost his appeal against his extradition before the high court in London and has little chances of getting away. He had recently also filed a case in the Bombay high court challenging the constitutional validity of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act. The high court rebuffed his plea asking him to furnish a timeline for his return to the country and that any such appeal cannot be heard in absentia.","India committed to bring back all fugitives who are wanted here to face prosecution, MEA says. “We are in talks with several governments, and processes are on,” Randhir Jaiswal said.

PM Modi Praises Gen Z Confidence, Sees Them Leading Viksit Bharat

NEW DELHI: From 11-year-old Shavan Singh's heartwarming story of social service during Operation Sindoor - regularly delivering water, milk and lassi to Indian soldiers stationed near his home along the Punjab border - to seven-year-old chess prodigy from Gujarat, Vaka Lakshmi Pragnika, the stories of the 20 recipients of Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar reflect resilience, courage and achievement.On Veer Bal Diwas, President Droupadi Murmu Friday, conferred the awards on children from 18 states for exceptional achievements in bravery, social service, environment, sports, art and culture, and science and technology, at an event organised by women and child development ministry.Later, PM Modi interacted with the awardees ahead of addressing a programme at Bharat Mandapam and lauded their achievements.Speaking to TOI, Shavan Singh, a Class IV student from Chak Taran Wali village in Punjab's Ferozepur, said that when drones began flying over his house, he thought of the soldiers stationed on the frontline and asked his parents if he could take essential items for them. Asked if he felt scared, Shavan replied ""bilkul nahin"" (not at all), adding that he wants to join the Army.Another inspiring awardee is Vansh Tayal from Chandigarh, recognised in the social service category.Orphaned during the Covid pandemic in 2021, Vansh lives in a child care institution. Despite his own emotional challenges, he volunteered to care for a six-year-old abandoned child with disabilities and contributed to the child's rehabilitation. Now in Class 12, Vansh said he aspires to become a psychologist.Lauding the children, President Murmu said it is because of talented youngsters like Pragnika that India is considered a chess powerhouse. She also referred to acts of bravery among the awardees.

Pakistan Embarrassed Globally As Saudi Deports 56000 Beggars Despite No Fly Lists And Warnings

Most Indians deported for staying beyond visa validity

HYDERABAD: Over 24,600 Indians were deported from 81 countries in 2025, as per the latest ministry of external affairs data tabled in Rajya Sabha. It wasn't the US but Saudi Arabia that recorded the highest deportations - over 11,000 in 12 months.While in comparison, only 3,800 Indians - mostly private employees - were deported from the US in 2025, these numbers are the highest recorded from the country in the last five years, the report says. Experts attribute it to the recent crackdown and increased scrutiny of documents, visa status, work authorisation, overstays, etc, by the Trump administration.Most deportations from the US were carried out from Washington DC (3,414) and Houston (234).Countries that saw a significant number of deportations of Indians include Myanmar (1,591), UAE (1,469), Bahrain (764), Malaysia (1,485), Thailand (481), and Cambodia (305). According to latest MEA data, common grounds for deportations, especially from Gulf countries, include overstaying visa or residency, working without a valid work permit, violation of labour regulations, absconding from employers, and involvement in civil or criminal cases.""This is a pattern with Gulf countries, which see a large migration of workers from India who either take up jobs as labourers in the construction sector, become caregivers, or work as househelp. Most of them are low-skilled workers who migrate through agents and, in many cases, in an attempt to earn extra money, end up involved in minor offences,"" said Bheema Reddy, vice-chairman of Telangana govt's NRI advisory committee. ""In other instances, lack of awareness about local laws and regulations proves costly,"" he added.In many cases, these migrant workers fall prey to fraud perpetrated by agents back home and are deported once caught by police abroad.Deportations from countries like Myanmar and Cambodia, however, follow a different pattern. ""Most of these are linked to cyber slavery. These countries have emerged as major hubs of a multi-billion dollar cybercrime industry where Indians are lured with promises of high-paying jobs but are later trapped, forced to work in illegal operations, and eventually detained and deported,"" Reddy explained.It is, therefore, important that workers are made aware of rules before they land on foreign shores, said Naga Bharani of Telangana Overseas Manpower Company. ""People should be told to closely track their visa timelines, and comply with local rules. There is always an option to apply for a visa extension,"" she said. Deportation of Indian students was the highest from UK, with 170 sent home in 2025. This was followed by Australia (114), Russia (82) and US (45).","Most deportations from the US were carried out from Washington DC (3,414) and Houston (234) Common grounds for deportations, especially from Gulf countries, include overstaying visa or residency, working without a valid work permit, violation of labour regulations, absconding from employers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126196015,imgsize-86626,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-image.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday called for a countrywide upgrade of the anti-terror infrastructure with the creation of an ""impenetrable anti-terrorism grid"" to protect coming generations from evolving threats and a common anti-terror squad (ATS) structure across states.Inaugurating the 'Anti-Terrorism Conference-2025' in the national capital on Saturday, Shah also announced that a ""360-degree strike"" plan against organised crime was in the works.Appreciating the investigation by the J&K police and other agencies in connection with the blast in Delhi, Shah said that these were not ordinary policing but outstanding examples of watertight investigation. ""This is also a great example of how an alert officer can save the country from such a major crisis by remaining vigilant at all times,"" Shah said referring to how the entire 'doctor module' was busted and three tonne of explosives recovered before they could be detonated as cops dug deeper into some random posters put up in Kashmir.Shah also reiterated that everyone should move forward with the principle of ""Duty to Share"" instead of ""Need to Know"" policy. While acknowledging that the central agencies and state police had made good use of technology at their respective levels, Shah pointed out that technology developed in silos and data collected in silos were ""like a gun without bullets"".Appraising the investigation into the Pahalgam terrorist attack, Shah said that agencies around the world will study it in the coming days and the results of the probe will put Pakistan in the dock on international platforms.Shah revealed that for the first time, Indian forces executed a dual-strategy of retribution.Through ""Operation Sindoor,"" the masterminds who planned the incidents were punished, while ""Operation Mahadev"" saw the elimination of the ground-level executors.During the day, Shah also launched three significant digital tools: an updated NIA crime manual, an Organised Crime Network Database, and a comprehensive database for lost and looted weapons.The home minister also highlighted the inextricable link between organised crime and terrorism. He explained how criminal syndicates involved in extortion often morph into terror facilitators once their leadership moves abroad.To combat this, he announced a ""360-degree strike"" on organised crime, supported by the newly launched databases. He stressed that operational uniformity across states is the only way to ensure accurate threat assessment.""A common ATS structure for the police across the country is extremely essential; the Director Generals of Police of the states should implement it at the earliest,"" Shah remarked.Beyond traditional policing, the home minister touched upon the necessity of ""Trial-in-Absentia"" for fugitives, suggesting that legal pressure must be used to force terrorists hiding abroad to return and face justice.He also advocated for the mandatory use of platforms like NATGRID and NIDAAN. ""As India's economy continues to grow-now standing as the world's fourth largest-Shah warned that internal security challenges would increase proportionately.He called for a ""ruthless approach"" to dismantling terror ecosystems, emphasising that the work done today will define the safety of future generations.","Union home minister Amit Shah called for a countrywide upgrade of the anti- terror infrastructure.

""That is why, for decades after independence, attempts were made to suppress such truths,"" he added.Asserting that India has resolved to free itself from the ""colonial mindset"" once and for all, the seeds of which were sown by British politician Thomas Babington Macaulay in 1835, Modi said that in this effort India's linguistic diversity is emerging as a source of strength.

AMRITSAR: A decision by Punjab's AAP govt to declare Amritsar's Walled City a 'Holy City' with a ban on fish, meat and tobacco sales has triggered deep anxiety among hundreds of families whose livelihoods depend on their trade. Walled City is the zone around the Golden Temple.CM Bhagwant Mann announced the ""historic decision"" in a Dec 21 video message, designating Shri Anandpur Sahib, Talwandi Sabo (Bathinda) and the Walled City of Amritsar as 'holy' cities.While the move has been projected as an effort to preserve the sanctity of the area surrounding the Golden Temple, those at the receiving end say it threatens to wipe out generations-old businesses without offering any alternative.Rajinder Kumar, a fourth-generation fish trader operating inside Hall Gate, paints a grim picture. ""There are 18 suppliers. This was the first wholesale fish market of Punjab and supplies fish to various districts even today. With one order, generations of hard work is being erased,"" Kumar said, adding each shop employs over 40 workers.Manmohan Singh, owner of an eatery inside BK Dutt Gate, questioned the logic behind declaring the entire Walled City a 'Holy City'.""There was already a Galliara around Golden Temple, where such restrictions are followed. Why extend it to the whole Walled City? We have not been given any alternative. Amritsar is not only a religious city. It is also known worldwide for its food,"" Singh said, adding traders were not consulted before the decision.Representatives of the hospitality sector, while welcoming the sentiment behind the decision, acknowledged its uneven impact. AK Chattha, president of Amritsar Hotel and Restaurant Association, said meat, fish and tobacco sellers would bear the brunt, not hotels. ""Hotels can bring meat from outside and adjust their menus. But this decision may instead increase illegal trade and corruption,"" he cautioned.BJP functionary Jagmohan Singh Raju demanded a comprehensive rehabilitation policy. ""Declaring Sri Amritsar a holy city is a historic step, but it must be implemented with foresight. Sanctity cannot come at the cost of livelihoods. Rehabilitation is not a concession - it is a responsibility,"" Raju said in a letter to CM Mann.The governing AAP promised relief. ""Govt will ensure proper rehabilitation. If businesses are removed, alternative arrangements will be made in a phased and planned manner. Authorities will consult those affected, engage with relevant institutions, and work out the best possible and mutually acceptable solution to ensure livelihoods are protected,"" senior AAP functionary Baltej Pannu said.For small vendors like Moti Ram, who runs a pan-cigarette kiosk, the order has shattered any sense of security. ""I have spent my entire life selling pan and cigarettes here.

NEW DELHI: The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has cancelled the registration of an anti-hair loss cosmetic product, QR 678-Neo, after finding that it was being promoted online for treating medical conditions such as post-chemotherapy hair loss, androgenetic alopecia (common, genetic hair loss) and seborrhoeic dermatitis (manageable form of scalp eczema or dandruff) - claims that legally fall under the definition of drugs and are not permitted for cosmetics.The action has been taken against Mumbai-based firm M/s Esthetic Centers International Pvt Ltd, which had imported the product QR 678-Neo after registering it as an anti-hair-loss cosmetic under the Cosmetics Rules, 2020.The registration, granted in April 2022 and valid till 2027, has now been cancelled with immediate effect. While the order applies specifically to this product and firm, officials said it sends a broader regulatory signal to the fast-growing cosmetic and hair-care market, particularly online platforms, where products cleared as cosmetics are increasingly promoted with therapeutic claims.Regulators have repeatedly cautioned that making drug-like claims without approval not only misleads consumers, but also bypasses safety, efficacy and clinical evaluation requirements mandated for medicines. The latest action underscores that cosmetic approvals can not be used as a backdoor for marketing unapproved treatments.According to CDSCO order, scrutiny of the firm's product labels and official website revealed a mismatch between the approved cosmetic claims and the way the product was being marketed online.While the approved label positioned the product as a cosmetic, the website promoted it as a treatment for specific conditions - claims that attract regulation under Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.","Mumbai-based firm M/s Esthetic Centers International Pvt Ltd had imported the product QR 678-Neo.

Prayers And Peace: PM Modi Joins Christmas Service, Shares Message Of Harmony And Unity

PM’s outreach part of continuous efforts to engage with minorities

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday joined a large congregation of Christians at a Christmas service at the Cathedral Church of the Redemption here, as he continued with his outreach to the minority community. ""The service reflected the timeless message of love, peace and compassion. May the spirit of Christmas inspire harmony and goodwill in our society,"" he said.As part of the governing BJP's concerted efforts to strengthen its connect with Christians, party president JP Nadda participated in celebrations at the Christian Higher Secondary School, organised by the Mao Naga Christian Fellowship Delhi (MNCFD), and dwelt at the govt's focus on development in the northeast, a region with significant population of the community.As part of his engagement with Christians, Modi had addressed a Christmas celebration organised by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India in 2024, attended an Easter event at the Sacred Heart Cathedral in 2023, and hosted a programme at his residence to mark Christmas the same year.Opposition was, however, quick to target him for incidents of vandalism and harassment aimed at Christians in some parts of the country.Congress posted on X a video purportedly showing members of right-wing outfits vandalising Christmas decorations in Raipur in BJP-governed Chhattisgarh, alleging it exposed the true face of BJP.BJP’s efforts to reach out to Christians over the last few years have met with limited success as a section of the community continues to harbour distrust due to the Sangh Parivar’s antipathy to conversion, which has led to the enactment of stringent laws in several states as the party’s influence surged since 2014.In terms of absolute numbers, Kerala has the highest Christian population in the country, and the state will be heading to assembly polls in a few months along with Tamil Nadu, which has the second highest population of the community.Their numbers in Kerala and Tamil Nadu are over 18% and 6% respectively, according to the 2011 census.With over 25%, Christians are a significant presence in Goa, but they wield maximum political influence in the northeast due to their dominant majority status in Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya.","PM Narendra Modi attends Christmas morning service at the Cathedral Church of the Redemption in Delhi.

Sami Zayn’s wife on the most important match of his life: Elimination Chamber 2023 Diary

Originally named Rami Sebei, Sami Zayn has made a name for himself as one of the most respected and consistently pushed stars in the WWE Universe. Zayn has been a model of longevity, character work, and stable placement on premium live events, and his stability in that regard has equated to financial security. Industry-wide estimates have his individual net worth in the low millions as of the year 2025, primarily from his WWE contract and associated revenue streams like brand endorsements and deals.Khadija Sebei, wife of Zayn, lives under a very low profile, not being in any public business or entertainment business. It means any public appraisal of the couple's fortunes turns primarily on Zayn's professional earnings (no apparent records of independent commercial income linked to her name per se). Thus, their joint fortune is a poor reflection of the value the wrestler makes over a career, not of two parallel portfolios of income.Sami Zayn likely earned a WWE contract commensurate with his status as an invaluable veteran today who is not necessarily a marquee star. His annual WWE salary is estimated by various industry trackers in the range of $350,000 to $500,000. This number generally consists of a base salary that is guaranteed, bonuses that are based on performance, and pay that is based on premium live events and overseas tours.While it is rumored that emerging talent is on developmental deals, Zayn would be able to negotiate contracts that he has been earning with a consistent presence on television for years. When he is utilized in the many squad storylines and championship programs in a given year, or at the main event level for Pay-Per-Views, his earnings go up. Another benefit is that Zayn has built long-term sustainability as opposed to short-term surges.Sami Zayn also makes money off of merchandise royalties, which still plays an important role for veteran talent, on top of his WWE contract. Recurring revenue all year long comes from T-shirts, collectibles, and special event merchandise associated with major storylines. He has also ventured into limited media and entertainment work, including TV and streaming appearances, as additional sources of income.When all of the combined sources and standout earnings room are combined, responsible estimates place Sami Zayn's net worth at roughly $2 million in 2025. Aside from reportedly landing a three-year modelling contract with the major American brand this year, all fatigue to Khadija Sebei has proven to be a speculative wage, so combined, they can both expect a net worth in the ballpark of $2 million to $2.5 million at the most, to allow space for private investments and debts of others.Also Read: IShowSpeed’s latest YouTube drop features WWE legend Randy Orton","Sami Zayn has been a model of longevity, character work, and stable placement on premium live events.

Carmen Montero Mundt’s professional career and the net worth of the duo

George Russell will have made a significant imprint on the earnings of Formula One by the year 2025. Russell’s revenue path is very much like that of other top drivers, applying to their advantage the sporting success they have through the commercial opportunities that are open. His ability to combine competitive results with being marketable makes it so that he is able to quite steadily grow his wealth, especially as Mercedes has already placed him in the long-term design of their team. Carmen Montero Mundt, who is the partner of George, enables the couple to accumulate wealth together through her career in finance and investment management.George Russell’s new Mercedes contract, covering several years, is roughly £30 million per annum, which puts him in the highest echelon with respect to driver salaries. Besides his basic salary, Russell’s net worth is estimated to be $16 million, which reflects not only his race winnings but also the inflating sponsorships that he has developed.Amongst the brand names attached to Russell are Puma, Bell Helmets, and Mercedes-Benz lifestyle campaigns, where he is the face, which together contribute to Russell being more visible than ever. His image, which is a polished one, together with the steady performances like podiums in Australia and a win in the 2025 Canadian Grand Prix, makes him a priceless brand ambassador.Carmen Montero Mundt has carved out a professional career of her own apart from her husband’s identity. She has worked in the UK, and her London financial firm's reputation is that of a private banker who specializes in wealthy clients' relations. While her net worth is low compared to Russell’s, it is estimated that it is somewhere in the range of $185,000 as the professional earnings in the present year. Apart from this, she also earns from investments and lifestyle collaborations.The total net worth of the couple is estimated to be around $16-$17 million in the present year.

Matt Kalish’s rise from DraftKings success and Adin Ross’ latest claim

Police Hunt Antonio Brown After SHOCKING Shooting At Adin Ross Event; Warrant Out Against NFL Star





The FaZe Clan fallout has once again put the spotlight on Matt Kalish, most widely known as the co-founder of DraftKings. He is also the CEO of HardScope and a major stakeholder in FaZe Media. Kalish invested $11 million into FaZe Media at its formation, instantly becoming its largest stakeholder with a 49% ownership stakeThat kind of influence and control of the company was recently called out by popular streamer Adin Ross, who publicly questioned leadership decisions tied to FaZe Clan’s recent departures. Despite Kalish’s contributions, Ross is seeking clarification regarding certain business strategies and creative decisions within the company.Matt Kalish built his reputation long before FaZe Clan came into the limelight. As one of the original co-founders of DraftKings, he helped shape the fantasy sports industry into a billion-dollar market. He also launched HardScope with the aim of giving influencers more ownership and structure. With that vision, he started up FaZe Clan in 2024 when GameSquare acquired the brand and positioned it as a creator-first media company.His $11 million investment earned him a seat on the board, placing him at the center of important strategic decisions. He was a stabilizing force of the company, especially after years of financial turbulence surrounding the FaZe brand. However, this clean and consumer-friendly image has now shifted after Adin Ross accused company leadership of mishandling creator agreements.In a recent livestream, Ross directly called out Kalish and former FaZe Media CEO Richard “Banks” Bengtson for introducing revenue expectations too late in the process. He minced no words as he said, “Banks and Matt Kalish, you guys messed up, because initially, with the announcement video, you guys were supposed to make them sign… You guys waited two years later. That's the issue…”According to Ross, the reported request for 20% of creator revenue came only after streamers had already built large audiences. This led to former FaZe Clan members, including Lacy, Adapt, and Jasontheween, exiting the company. The issue further deepened when Banks, who left the company in July 2025, called those signings one of the worst decisions of his life. As of now, Matt Kalish has not publicly responded to these significant claims made by Ross.Also read: Adin Ross confirms person allegedly hit by Clavicular’s Tesla Cybertruck is alive",The FaZe Clan fallout has once again put the spotlight on Matt Kalish.

Taylor Swift opens up about Scott Swift’s surgery while dating Travis Kelce and using her wealth for good



Taylor Swift did something deeply personal, and very powerful. The global pop star donated $1 million to the American Heart Association to honor her father, Scott Swift, after his serious heart surgery earlier this year. On Tuesday, Dec. 23, PEOPLE exclusively confirmed the donation. The gift comes after Scott Swift, 73, went through a quintuple bypass surgery, a major heart operation that doctors say can save lives. Taylor Swift’s donation will help fund heart research, better treatment, and life-saving care for people across the United States. According to a press release, the 36-year-old singer’s support will help expand access to care and improve prevention efforts for heart disease. It is a cause that now hits very close to home for her.“Taylor Swift’s remarkable generosity will create lasting change far beyond its financial value,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association, in a statement. Taylor’s decision also comes during a busy time in her life. She is one of the richest artists in the world, with an estimated net worth of aboutaccording to Forbes, and she is also in a high-profile relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce . Even with fame, wealth, and global success, this moment shows a more personal side of Taylor, a daughter standing by her dad.In July, PEOPLE confirmed that Scott Swift had undergone quintuple bypass surgery just over a month earlier and was recovering well. TMZ first reported the surgery.Scott went in for a regular check-up when doctors noticed something unusual. The surgery was not caused by a heart attack. According to the Mayo Clinic, coronary bypass surgery helps blood flow around blocked arteries in the heart.Taylor Swift, her brother Austin Swift, 33, and her mother Andrea Swift, who has been married to Scott for 37 years, stayed with him throughout the surgery and recovery. During Taylor Swift’s first appearance on Travis Kelce’s “New Heights” podcast in August, she spoke about the experience.“It was really intense,” Taylor said. “It all happened really quick.”She shared that her dad always had a “perfect EKG,” but a stress test showed five blockages. Taylor moved in with him during the summer and helped care for him.“My brother and my mom and I were each taking shifts in the ICU and staying with him 24/7,” she said, calling the experience “surreal.” Nancy Brown also highlighted Taylor’s emotional impact beyond money.“Her family’s experience with cardiovascular disease is all too common, affecting nearly half of American adults,” Brown said.“Her commitment to supporting her father will make so many others aware of the need to take their own heart health seriously.”Known for her famous “heart hands,” Taylor Swift is now using that symbol, and her massive platform, to bring real change.Also Read: Is Taylor Swift Pregnant?

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s joinery from Manipal





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Meet Google executive 'responsible' for Sam Altman sending 'Code Red' to OpenAI employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-google-executive-responsible-for-sam-altman-sending-code-red-to-openai-employees/articleshow/126187250.cms,"Google's Josh Woodward has jolted OpenAI, forcing a 'code red' with his Gemini app's rapid success. Gemini's user growth and image generation capabilities have challenged ChatGPT's dominance, leading to a significant shift in the AI landscape. Woodward's ability to cut through bureaucracy and his team's innovative approach are credited for Google's AI resurgence, impacting Alphabet's stock and OpenAI's strategic plans.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The numbers tell a brutal story for ChatGPT

The secret weapon: Breaking Google's legendary bureaucracy





Josh Woodward isn't a household name in Silicon Valley, but the 42-year-old Google veteran has accomplished what seemed impossible just months ago—he's made the world's most powerful AI company sweat. The executive leading Google's Gemini app triggered such alarm at OpenAI that CEO Sam Altman declared an internal ""code red"" in early December, forcing the startup to abandon lucrative projects and scramble to defend its eroding market position.Woodward's impact has been devastating for OpenAI. Since taking charge of the Gemini app in April while simultaneously running Google Labs, he's orchestrated a comeback that's transformed Google from AI afterthought to existential threat. His team's viral Nano Banana image generator crashed Google's own infrastructure in August, generating so much traffic that the company's custom AI chips nearly ""melted,"" according to CNBC reports from a November all-hands meeting.Google's resurgence under Woodward's leadership has fundamentally rewritten the competitive landscape. Gemini's monthly active users grew from 350 million in March to 650 million by October, coming close to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly users. By September, Gemini had dethroned ChatGPT atop Apple's App Store after generating 5 billion images.The impact runs deeper than raw user counts. Data from Similarweb reveals that Gemini has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months, surging from 5.4% to 18.2%.This gain came directly at ChatGPT's expense—OpenAI's flagship product plummeted from commanding 87.2% market share to just 68%, a staggering 19-point drop.The blow came in late November when Google announced Gemini 3, a LLM model that outperformed OpenAI's flagship products on industry benchmarks and sent Alphabet's stock soaring. Within days, Altman issued his ""code red"" memo, delaying OpenAI's planned advertising business, e-commerce expansion, and AI agent development to pour resources into improving ChatGPT's core experience. The desperation was palpable—this was OpenAI's most decisive admission yet of the competitive pressure threatening its $500 billion valuation.Woodward's success stems from an unusual talent in Google's notoriously slow-moving culture. Colleagues told CNBC he's mastered the art of demolishing bureaucratic barriers through systems like ""block,"" where employees flag roadblocks for his team to immediately resolve. Former Google Labs co-lead Clay Bavor says Woodward's ability to ""move fast, break down barriers and execute"" has landed him ""right at the center of the most important work at Google. ""His track record speaks volumes. NotebookLM became an instant hit after its July 2023 launch. His quarterly newsletter grew so influential that Google executives routinely seek his reading recommendations. He responds directly to user complaints on X and Reddit, bringing feedback to engineers for rapid fixes—a level of user engagement that's helped Gemini gain trust and momentum.OpenAI fired back earlier this month with GPT-5.2, claiming benchmark superiority once again. But Woodward holds structural advantages that terrify OpenAI: Google's massive cash reserves, custom AI chips, and nine products with over 1 billion users each. While OpenAI burns through funding rounds to survive, Woodward's operation runs on profits from YouTube and search. Alphabet's 62% stock surge in 2025 outpaced all megacap peers—a dramatic reversal from its brutal first quarter that vindicated Woodward's strategy.","Google's Gemini app has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months.

Indian dairy sector faces tight supply as demand strengthens ahead of 2026: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-dairy-sector-faces-tight-supply-as-demand-strengthens-ahead-of-2026-report/articleshow/126199738.cms,"India's dairy sector is entering a phase of tighter supply and margin recalibration after navigating sharp cycles of disruption, surplus, and recovery over the past three years, according to insights from an expert session hosted by Systematix Institutional Equities.The post-COVID period of 2022-23 proved challenging for the industry, marked by an unreasonable fall in milk prices that failed to cover farmers' production costs.According to the Systematix report, this led to reduced cattle induction and a sharp drop in milk output.From mid-2023, however, renewed farmer engagement by leading cooperatives and private players, including sustainable fodder programs, helped restore confidence and revive supply.These efforts resulted in a sharp rebound during the October 2024-March 2025 flush season, when milk production surged by nearly 25 per cent, creating a temporary surplus.Dairy companies responded by expanding value-added product mixes, strengthening cold-chain infrastructure, and increasing advertising and promotions to absorb excess supply, it noted.Large players also intensified backend investments and last-mile distribution to manage inventories.The surplus, however, was short-lived.In 2025, early and unseasonal rains disrupted the usual summer demand-supply pattern, while geopolitical disturbances, including the India-Pakistan conflict, affected key northern milk belts, including Punjab, Haryana, and Jammu and Kashmir.At the same time, robust festive demand further eroded inventories, leaving the industry with a limited surplus heading into late 2025, according to the expert session.As a result, milk procurement costs have firmed up across regions, even as product prices have largely remained stable following the recent GST cut.Some regional price hikes of Rs 1-1.5 per litre were reported in states such as Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.Industry participants expect procurement cost corrections around April 2026, coinciding with the Ramzan period.Demand has been supported by reduced prices and increased grammage post-GST cut, particularly in small stock-keeping units, though this has pressured margins due to channel disruption and supply-chain costs.According to Systematix, companies are now evaluating selective price hikes or rolling back higher volumes to restore profitability.A notable structural trend is the accelerating shift toward value-added products such as curd, paneer, ghee, and ice cream. Ice cream demand, once concentrated in peak summer months, is now spreading across a wider seasonal window. Dairy products are increasingly purchased on impulse, as consumers shift from carbonated beverages to milk-based alternatives.Distribution dynamics are also evolving rapidly. Quick-commerce and e-commerce platforms are gaining prominence, while general trade is losing share, it observed. Modern trade, despite offering visibility, continues to deliver lower margins, forcing dairy players to make careful decisions.","India's dairy sector is entering a phase of tighter supply and margin recalibration after navigating sharp cycles of disruption, surplus, and recovery over the past three years.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Saudi Arabia is taking a firmer stance against banned and counterfeit pesticides, with a draft regulation proposing jail terms, hefty fines, and strict enforcement measures. The new rules aim to protect public health, the environment, and agriculture, while giving authorities clear powers to penalize repeat offenders.The proposed regulation introduces strict consequences for anyone involved in manufacturing or importing banned or counterfeit pesticides. Under the draft, violators may face up to five years in prison, fines reaching SR10 million, or one of these two penalties. The Public Prosecution will investigate all violations and bring the cases before the competent court to enforce the penalties outlined in the regulation. In situations where the offender repeats the violation, the prosecution is authorized to double the penalties to ensure stronger compliance and deterrence.Not all violations will lead to immediate jail time or fines. The draft clarifies that if a violation is minor and does not cause significant harm to humans, animals, plants, the environment, or public health, the violator will first receive a warning. Authorities may then provide a grace period for the issue to be corrected before applying penalties.The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) will play a central role in reviewing violations related to public health pesticides. Responsibilities of the SFDA under the draft include:Additionally, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture can require violators to remove the cause of the violation. Repeating the offense within three years of a previous violation is considered a repeat offense, which can lead to doubling of fines.The draft also outlines strict measures for dealing with the materials involved in violations. These include:Beyond fines, the draft also allows authorities to temporarily close the facility for up to six months or even permanently shut it down in severe cases. Those penalized have the right to appeal the decision in the Administrative Court in accordance with its regulations.","Saudi Arabia proposes up to five years jail and SR10 million fine for banned pesticides.

The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has taken decisive action against Omda Exchange, revoking its licence and striking the company’s name off the official register of licensed entities. The regulator also imposed a financial penalty of Dh10 million on the foreign exchange firm. This enforcement follows supervisory examinations that uncovered multiple breaches of UAE banking laws and regulations.The move was carried out under the Decretal Federal Law on the Central Bank and the Organisation of Financial Institutions and Activities, which gives the CBUAE the authority to regulate, supervise, and enforce compliance across financial institutions operating in the country.According to official statements and regulatory findings, the CBUAE’s examinations revealed that Omda Exchange failed to comply with core legal and regulatory requirements. While specific details of each breach have not been fully disclosed publicly, the Central Bank’s action fits a broader pattern of strict enforcement against exchange houses that fall short of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and other compliance standards.The move underscores the bank’s mandate to ensure that financial service providers adhere to legal obligations and internal controls that safeguard the integrity of financial transactions in the UAE.You might wonder how a corporate fine affects the average resident sending money home. The impact is actually very positive for the ""common man."" When the Central Bank takes such strict action, it is working to ensure that every dirham you hand over at a counter is safe.This latest enforcement is part of a broader, ongoing trend. In recent months, we have seen the CBUAE impose various fines—ranging from Dh2 million to over Dh100 million, on different financial entities. This consistent ""watchful eye"" is part of the UAE's commitment to aligning with international standards set by global bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).The Central Bank has stated that it will continue to ensure that all exchange houses, their owners, and their staff strictly abide by UAE laws.This isn't just about punishment; it’s about prevention. By maintaining a transparent and high-standard environment, the UAE ensures that its financial system remains one of the most stable and secure in the world for residents and investors alike","The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has taken decisive action against Omda Exchange, revoking its licence and striking the company’s name off the official register of licensed entities.

California’s tech exodus: Entrepreneur warns of a deeper political crisis as tax losses ‘hit $200 billion’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/californias-tech-exodus-entrepreneur-warns-of-a-deeper-political-crisis-as-tax-losses-hit-200-billion/articleshow/126195833.cms,"California’s turning point





How the tax losses add up



A political warning, not just an economic one



Texas and the national reaction

A divided response





Entrepreneur and investor Chamath Palihapitiya has warned that California is facing a deepening political and fiscal crisis as major founders and companies continue to leave the state. In a widely circulated post, Palihapitiya argued that the departures have already cost California tens of billions of dollars in lost tax revenue, with the total potentially rising beyond $200 billion as those businesses expand elsewhere. He linked the losses to what he described as political hostility towards innovation, warning that further exits could weaken the state’s job market and tax base.At the centre of Palihapitiya’s argument is Elon Musk , whose companies Tesla and SpaceX shifted key operations from California to Texas. He traces the roots of that move to tensions during the COVID-19 lockdowns, which he says highlighted a political climate increasingly hostile to major innovators.Palihapitiya pointed to a 2020 social media exchange involving then California Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez, who used profane language against Musk amid disputes over pandemic restrictions. Musk’s brief reply, “Message received,” has since been cited by critics as a symbol of a broader breakdown between California’s political leadership and its most productive business figures.The $200 billion figure cited by Palihapitiya is an estimate and projection rather than an official state calculation. He argues it reflects the long term impact of lost income taxes, capital gains and corporate growth following the departure of founders and the highly paid employees who moved with them. In his view, the number will continue to rise as Tesla grows and if SpaceX eventually goes public while based outside California.Palihapitiya contrasts this outcome with what he believes California could have achieved by working more collaboratively with innovators. He argues that embracing major employers and founders could have generated hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenue over time, helping to sustain public finances rather than deepen deficits.Beyond the financial estimates, Palihapitiya frames the issue as a political failure. He accuses California’s leadership of fiscal mismanagement, overspending and a reluctance to conduct meaningful audits or impose spending restraint. According to him, the state’s response to shrinking revenues has been to seek more money from those who remain, rather than reform how public funds are managed.He warns that if the current trajectory continues and more founders and investors leave, California risks losing high value jobs and further weakening its tax base. Without significant reforms, he suggests the state could face severe financial stress within the next decade.Palihapitiya’s comments quickly drew attention from political figures outside California, including Ted Cruz, who echoed the criticism and publicly invited him to relocate to Texas. Cruz framed the moment as evidence of Texas’s appeal as a low tax, business friendly alternative to California’s regulatory environment.Palihapitiya’s response signalled openness to the idea, reinforcing the perception that competition between US states for talent and capital is intensifying.Reaction to the warning has been sharply split. Supporters argue Palihapitiya is highlighting a real and growing problem, pointing to rising costs and company departures as evidence of policy failure. Critics counter that Musk’s move was driven by personal and financial factors that predated any single political incident, and that the fiscal impact is being overstated.What is clear is that the debate over California’s tech exodus has moved beyond individual companies. As founders, investors and politicians continue to clash, the argument has become a broader test of how California balances regulation, taxation and innovation, and what it risks losing if that balance continues to shift.","Entrepreneur and investor Chamath Palihapitiya has warned that California is facing a deepening political and fiscal crisis.
