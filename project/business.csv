"Junk the ghoonghat, walk the talk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/junk-the-ghoonghat-walk-the-talk/articleshow/118401588.cms,"Married at 16, Ashalata Pandey of Ambajogai — a temple town known as the ‘maternal home of education’ in Maharashtra ’s Beed — had to hide her face after her husband left for a religious trip one fine day, from which he never returned.“Aren’t you sad about the fact that he left you?” “How can you simply move on?”These were just some of the questions that the young mother of two was bombarded with on her way to work at an NGO that fetched a meagre monthly pay of Rs 800, to raise awareness on a range of issues from women’s rights to reproductive health.Stung by such adverse comments, Ashalata quit her job. With no property of her own and no support from her in-laws, she took up the job of an ASHA worker. Covering her head, like a shroud, with the edge of her sari, she took deserted roads on her way to work to ensure she kept those inquisitive glares at bay.It was during one of those solitary walks to work that Ashalata had a chance encounter with Chitratai.Married off at 12 by an alcoholic father to a man desperately looking for dowry, Chitratai aka Chitra Patil was not just a cheerful health worker, but also a newly-minted ‘saheli’ who had freed several villagers from greedy money lenders by creating 14 savings groups that charged a 2% fixed interest rate.Encouraged by Chitratai, Ashalata enrolled herself for the grassroots leadership development programme ( GLDP ) and on the very third day of the course, she realised she was entitled to certain rights, including the right to her husband’s property.“My father-in-law owned a large house. I wanted to co-own it, rightfully. Now, I actually do,” says Ashalata, sharing her expe rience from being an ‘SW’ (single woman) to one of the many vocal, local leaders of Ekal Mahila Sangathana (EMS) -a women’s organisation in Marathwada that galvanises its 22,000-strong marginalised population of abandoned, separated, widowed women into becoming agents of social change.Ashalata is currently working on violence against women across Marathwada.Started a decade ago by 27 single women in Beed, Latur, Osmanabad and Nanded -the rustic western Maharashtra belt -EMS today boasts of nearly 22,000 members.Having rescued droves of single women from social stigma, unemployment and domestic violence, EMS is one of more than 500 organisations across Maharashtra and Rajasthan that have been facilitated by non-profit CORO India.“CORO stands for ‘Jyanche prashna tyanche netrutva’ (the question is the same as the truth). The drive to initiate change should come from within,” says Dr Sujata Khandekar, founder of the 34-yearold holistic community development NGO.Formed in 1989 by people from privileged backgrounds, CORO later evolved into “a people’s organisation, with people not as mere beneficiaries but as leaders of the organisation”, as Mahendra Rokade, the director of CORO, puts it.In the last three decades, its efforts in rural and urban Maharashtra and Rajasthan have created more than 1,688 “grassroots leaders”, of which, 69% are women -including transwomen.Majority of these earthy change-makers hail from notified and denotified tribes, backward classes, minorities and other marginalised communities. These leaders – aged between 20 and 50 – now address issues ranging from gender rights to forest rights.“Since women are constantly and consistently denied permission to do things since childhood and punished for transgressing those boundaries, later in their lives, women themselves start believing that they are lesser humans,” explains Khandekar.Culled over two decades, such insights paved the way for the Grassroots Leadership Training Programme (GLDP) -a syllabus spanning skills such as advocacy and constitutional rights that were inspired by Brazilian educator Paulo Freire’s philosophy of ‘conscientisation’. Meanwhile, EMS, which began working on ensuring safety and access to govt schemes for single women in areas where they were seen as “commodities up for grabs”, has now percolated into remote Rajasthan where Teena Rawat, who survived two suicide attempts after her husband abandoned her, now beams proudly inside a courtroom where she is defending herself as a lawyer. “If you hadn’t abandoned her,” the judge told her former husband against whom she had filed five cases, “this woman would have spent her whole life following you around in a ghoonghat. Instead, she’s a lawyer now. Look at how little you’ve achieved and how much she has done with her life”.CORO recently launched Atta Deep Academy of Grassroots Leadership in Mumbai as an extension of GLDP. “ ‘Atta Deep means selfenlightenment’,” says Khandekar.The arrival of four transwomen has expanded CORO’s lens on gender issues. Case studies in its 2023 annual report point to how issues addressed by grassroots women leaders transcend gender.Udaipur’s Durga -who learned how to open and operate a Facebook account during her fellowship -was surfing the net casually one day when she chanced upon a govt website listing the names of 42 villagers that had received money to build cattle sheds. “None of the people concerned even knew that their applications had been approved,” recalls Durga, who downloaded the receipts and armed with those printouts, the villagers then pressurized the sarpanch into giving them their rightful share.That’s change.

"No mega rocket for crewed Moon mission, Isro to rely on docking",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-mega-rocket-for-crewed-moon-mission-isro-to-rely-on-docking/articleshow/118398404.cms,"Representative image

More docking in mid-March

BENGALURU: India will not build a large rocket for its planned crewed mission to the Moon, but instead rely on multiple launches and satellite docking technology , as per Isro’s current plans for the mission targeted for 2040.“One option is to build a huge rocket and take a single module. But what will you do with that rocket thereafter? Economically, we have to understand and really look at all aspects. So, we are not going to build a huge rocket. We are going to have multiple modules. Maybe right now, our thinking is two modules. You take them separately and dock,” Isro chairman V Narayanan told TOI in an exclusive interview.The approach builds on India’s recent success with the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission, which achieved its first docking manoeuvre on Jan 16. The mission involved two 220-kg satellites initially separated by 11 km, orbiting at approximately 28,400 km per hour.Docking technology is crucial for India’s upcoming space initiatives, including the planned space station project comprising five modules, and the crewed lunar mission . The space station modules too will be launched separately and assembled in orbit, with the first module already receiving govt approval.The technology Isro is developing through SpaDeX will provide valuable insights for future crewed Moon landing missions. While the successful first docking marked a milestone, Isro will conduct multiple manoeuvres at various orientations to thoroughly understand the dynamics involved. Each iteration will provide new insights that will inform the development of future space systems.Narayanan, who took charge as Isro chairman on Jan 13, explained the complexity of the docking process: “Imagine two buses going on the road with each traveling at 100 kilometre per hour speed…And if both have to be get docked, you know, lot of things has to be done. Number one, you have to come exactly within millimetre level.”The satellites, which were previously controlled independently, now function as a single unit. The next phase involves establishing power transfer between the modules, a crucial step for future missions including Chandrayaan-4, where multiple docking operations will be required.While Isro has completed the first crucial docking manoeuvre, SpaDeX will continue for an extended period. “The satellites are currently in an elliptical orbit, where power generation varies based on position. This is not a one-time operation. We’ll conduct multiple docking attempts to demonstrate our capability to perform the procedure reliably and repeatedly beginning mid-March,” Narayanan said.The key objectives are to evaluate: How precisely Isro can execute multiple docking maneuvers, how well the algorithms perform under various conditions, how the integrated inertial systems function and how the propulsion system performs during repeated operations.“This is truly a multidisciplinary endeavor. Through these multiple trials, we will generate extensive data to support future applications. Before conducting any actual experiments, we thoroughly test everything in our ground simulator. We validate our understanding and approach through simulation first, then proceed with the real operation only when we are fully confident. This careful approach is essential to prevent any mistakes,” he said.Isro’s methodical approach involves gathering extensive data to refine the technology for future applications. While the initial docking marked a milestone, Narayanan indicated that the mission would continue for an extended period, with numerous experiments planned to master this complex capability.","India's Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) achieved its first docking manoeuvre on Jan 16.

Bengaluru space firm tests payload in extreme cold conditions in space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengaluru-space-firm-tests-payload-in-extreme-cold-conditions-in-space/articleshow/118398381.cms,"BENGALURU: Space startup GalaxEye, which earlier this year completed analysis of the data from the payload it had deployed and tested aboard Isro’s PSLV Orbital Experiment Module (POEM) platform — on the rocket that launched India’s Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission on Dec 30, 2024 — has achieved another success.The firm, its CEO and co-founder Suyash Singh confirmed to TOI, has successfully tested its SyncFusion Imaging System, which was part of the payload on POEM, in one of the most extreme environments in orbit—the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), a region where Earth's magnetic field is unusually weak.“The POEM platform was going through SAA and we had an opportunity to activate our payload and repeat our test sequence. We weren’t certain of success since it was essentially a prototype payload. There was some uncertainty involved. We’d met our primary objectives the previous month. However, this time we wanted to test under extreme conditions, it’s about -10°C there,” Singh told TOI.The success has prompted the firm to consider testing the payload another time. “SAA has an extreme cold temperature, we’ll now also try to do it on the other side of the temperature, which is in the extreme heat conditions as well. Temperatures could be as high as 150°C,” Singh said.Earlier, the firm had said that its ‘GLX-SQ payload’ onboard POEM was the world’s first fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery in orbit.“Our payload demonstrates an unprecedented capability to merge SAR and optical imaging technologies, enabling unprecedented insights for defence, agriculture, and disaster management applications. The system’s most remarkable feature is its ability to process and compress massive data volumes in less than 10 minutes, delivering real-time, actionable solutions,” the firm said.Singh said this was not just a technological milestone, but the beginning of a journey to redefine the possibilities of remote sensing and space-based solutions.Leveraging Isro’s POEM platform, which converts a PSLV rocket’s fourth stage into an orbital testbed, GalaxEye validated its advanced technologies in a real-world space environment. The successful mission sets the stage for the company’s upcoming Mission Drishti, a flagship multi-sensor satellite project aimed at providing all-weather, high-resolution imaging.Founded in 2021, GalaxEye’s goal is to build the world’s first multi-sensor satellite capable of delivering comprehensive, high-resolution data across various industries.","GalaxEye has successfully tested its SyncFusion Imaging System in one of the most extreme environments in orbit.

‘Why sell excess tickets?’: HC to Railways on New Delhi station stampede,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-sell-excess-tickets-hc-to-railways-on-new-delhi-station-stampede/articleshow/118397969.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the wake of the recent stampede at New Delhi railway station that led to 18 deaths, Delhi high court on Wednesday asked the Indian Railways to address the sale of excess tickets beyond the number of passengers that can be accommodated in a coach.""If you fix the number of passengers to be accommodated in a coach, then why does the number of tickets sold exceed that number? That's the problem,"" a bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyay and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela told Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, representing the Railways.The court was hearing a PIL over the recent stampede at the New Delhi railway station and asked the authorities to file an affidavit giving details of measures taken on these issues. The plea sought the implementation of existing provisions by Railways that may have helped avoid such incidents and cited sections 57 and 147 of the Railway Act that deal with overcrowding.""If you could implement a simple thing, such situations could be avoided... but not fixing the strength to be accommodated in a particular coach, this provision appears to have been neglected all along,"" HC remarked, while referring to Section 57 of the Railways Act, which says every railway administration must fix the maximum number of passengers allowed in each compartment of every carriage type.SG Mehta submitted that the PIL was not taken in an adversarial manner and the Railways is bound to follow the law. He said there was an ""unprecedented"" situation and assured the court that the issues raised in the PIL would be considered at the highest level. ""We are following the law, if there are any lacunae etc that can be taken care of,"" Mehta assured the court.During the hearing, the HC also pointed out that as per rules, the number of passengers that can be carried in each compartment should be ""conspicuously displayed outside each compartment"". It asked the SG to show what steps Railways will take to implement existing laws that limit the number of passengers in coaches and penalise persons entering without authority.""Let the issues raised in the petition be examined, as suggested by the SG, at the highest level at the Railway Board and thereafter an affidavit be filed giving details of the decisions taken by the Railway Board,"" the court directed, posting the matter for next month.HC noted that the PIL - filed by Arth Vidhi, an organisation of legal and business professionals - was not confined to the recent incident of the stampede as it sought implementation of the existing legal provisions with respect to the maximum number of passengers in a compartment and the sale of platform tickets.

I have been commissioned into the 18th battalion, the Jammu and Kashmir rifles, where you have a Masjid, Gurdwara, Durga Mata, and Mahakal, all under one roof.""General Dwivedi recounted how his subedar major, a Maulvi, would perform Durga Mata Puja without any issues, demonstrating the regiment's spirit of mutual respect. When asked about his own spiritual journey, general Dwivedi said after taking over, he first sought blessings from his unit, Bhakti Dhaam, where he received blessings from his Maulvi, Pandit, and Granthi.""My subedar major, who may be a Maulvi, is able to do Durga Mata Puja, which is not an issue at all. Now, if you see, have I visited any Mashoor (famous) place, Golden Temple or Mahakaal or Vaishno Devi, in the initial stages? No. The first thing I went to was to my unit, Bhakti Dham.

These images sparked a sense of curiosity and admiration in young Dwivedi. As he grew older, he began to explore various career options, considering medicine and engineering, just like his brothers.However, the allure of the Army ultimately won him over. General Dwivedi recalled how he initially wanted to become an intelligence officer, but after gaining more exposure, he decided to join the Army first and then explore opportunities in intelligence.""I remember my uncle when he used to ask him, So the copy which he used to bring used to have a soldier's photo. Okay. My father used to always give me the story of freedom fighters or the story of World War II, where we won Vera, who escaped as a pilot. I remember. So all these stories I used to keep reading. And my one brother was a doctor. So I said, no, this is closed. My second brother was an engineer. I said, this is closed. Okay. So third was the army, which was there. I wanted to become an intelligence officer if I can say that. But when I went to school and saw everything, then I said, okay, let me join the Army first, thereafter look at intelligence,"" the Army chief said.He also shared his experience of flying the LCA with air marshal AP Singh during Aero India 2025, praising Singh's leadership and straightforward qualities. He recalled that air marshal Singh was a standout individual even during their National Defence Academy (NDA) days, earning the respect and admiration of his peers.In a nostalgic reflection, Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi reminisced about his school days, when he and his peers would admire all three services - the Army, Navy, and Air Force. He shared that it was simply fate that led him to join the Army.""See, when we were in school, we used to look at all three services. We used to love all three, if I can say that. It just so happened that I came into the army. Let me tell you about AP first. As far as AP is concerned, from NDA days, he is a gold torch. And he is, everybody has a natural liking towards him. He is a man who can collect people together. He is a natural leader. And he takes ownership of a crowd. But he is a very straightforward man. So, I say in the lighter moment, he should have been in the infantry,"" said the Army chief.The Army chief highlighted Air Marshal Singh's ability to bring people together, his natural leadership skills, and his willingness to take ownership of responsibilities. General Dwivedi jokingly added that Air Marshal Singh's straightforward nature and team-bonding skills would have made him an excellent fit for the infantry.""He's so straightforward. And such a team-bonding man, he should have been infantry,"" he added.This lighthearted exchange reflects the camaraderie and mutual respect between General Dwivedi and Air Marshal Singh, underscoring the strong bonds formed during their early days at the NDA.The Army chief’s remarks provide insight into his personal life and military journey, emphasising the significance of respecting all religions and the principles of teamwork and leadership.As the 30th Chief of the Army Staff, he brings extensive experience, having held key positions such as Northern Army Commander and Director General of Infantry.","Indian Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi recently opened up about his multi- religious upbringing and illustrious military career.

BJP, Congress demand probe into 'external interference' in polls



NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday asked the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" and said that the country is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"". This came after Elon Musk-led DOGE’s (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosed that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout.""Why are we giving $21 million to India? They have a lot more money. They are one of the highest taxing countries in the world in terms of us; we can hardly get in there because their tariffs are so high,"" he asked while signing executive orders at Mar-a-Lago.Categorically mentioning that he had ""a lot of respect"" for PM Narendra Modi, Trump questioned the funding. ""I have a lot of respect for India and their prime minister, but giving $21 million for voter turnout?"" he said. The two leaders recently held bilateral talks where they discussed trade, illegal immigration, defence and energy, among other key sectors.The Musk-led department had last week shared a list of areas from where it had decided to revoke the US aid. One of those included -- ""$21M for voter turnout in India"" -- prompting political slugfest between the BJP and the Congress in the country.The BJP has renewed its call for an investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, former CEC SY Quraishi clarified that while the Election Commission had an understanding with USAID, no financial assistance was involved.“So, DOGE has discovered that USAID allocated $21 million for ‘voter turnout’ in India, a euphemism for paying voters to cast their votes to effect regime change. Veena Reddy was sent to India in 2021 (ominous?) as head of USAID’s Indian mission. Post Lok Sabha elections 2024 (presumably her voter turnout mission done), she returned to US. Pity because investigating agencies here could have asked her some questions about who this money was given to for applying it to voter turnout operations,” BJP MP Mahesh Jethmalani said.The Congress party has also condemned foreign interference in India's electoral process, urging the Modi government to probe USAID’s claims and take action if any wrongdoing is uncovered.","US President Donald Trump asked the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" He said that the country is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"" The BJP has renewed its call for an investigation into the matter.

"From 2026, CBSE to hold Class X Boards twice a year",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-2026-cbse-to-hold-class-x-boards-twice-a-year/articleshow/118374476.cms,"AI image (ChatGPT)

NEW DELHI: Hit by the Covid pandemic, albeit later than intended, CBSE will roll out twice-a-year board exams for class X from 2026 and introduce the CBSE Global Curriculum for 260 foreign schools affiliated to it from 2026-2027.The education ministry held a discussion, led by minister Dharmendra Pradhan, with CBSE officials and heads of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) and Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS), where draft schemes, set for public consultation on next Monday, were thoroughly deliberated.Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has announced plans to implement multiple board exams annually, allowing students to take their exams twice and retain their best score. This reform aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which emphasises flexibility and a student centric approach.According to a ministry official, “The initiative aims at reducing the high pressure, one-time examination system and provide students with an opportunity to improve their performance without the stress of a single high-stakes test. By offering multiple attempts, CBSE seeks to create a more supportive learning environment that prioritizes conceptual understanding over rote memorisation.”The policy advocates for competency-based evaluations over traditional summative assessments, shifting focus to formative learning and skill mastery. “CBSE is encouraging a shift towards formative learning, where students can focus on skill mastery and self-improvement rather than mere exam performance. This model also aligns with global best practices, such as the SAT system in the US, which allows students to take tests multiple times and submit their best scores,” said the official.The move also supports NEP’s goal of inclusivity, accommodating students facing challenges such as exam anxiety or illness. Providing multiple attempts ensures students from diverse backgrounds have a fair chance to showcase their abilities. CBSE is also scaling up teacher training to ensure a smooth transition toward this progressive assessment model.Pradhan emphasised that the new format is a crucial step towards a stress free learning environment. “Examination improvement and reform is a key step towards this. This reform will help mitigate exam-related stress and ensure a more balanced evaluation system,” he said.In addition, CBSE will also launch its Global Curriculum for foreign schools in 2026-2027. The curriculum will integrate core Indian subjects.","CBSE will roll out twice-a-year board exams for class X from 2026.

Raids were conducted and accused persons were arrested, including the present three applicants who were taking weapon training along with other accused persons.The court granted bail to the three men under various conditions, including furnishing a bail bond of Rs 50,000 each with two sureties each in the like amount.","A Delhi court granted default bail to three men allegedly part of a terror module linked to al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent.

Poll How Can Water Contamination Risks Be Addressed at Major Events? Raise Public Awareness on Health Risks Improve Water Quality and Monitoring

What is faecal coliform?

'Increase in faecal concentration'

'High levels of faecal and total coliform at various locations'

'Quality of Ganga water not good for bathing'

'People back from Kumbh experiencing medical issues'

'

Respiratory tract infections

due to crowded settings'

NEW DELHI: Water quality at several locations in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj during the ongoing Maha Kumbh did not meet primary bathing standards due to high faecal coliform levels, a report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) informed the National Green Tribunal on Monday.According to the CPCB,—a key indicator of sewage contamination—should not exceed the permissible limit of 2,500 units per 100 ml.Faecal coliform bacteria are a group of microorganisms found in the intestines of humans and animals. Their presence in water indicates contamination from sewage or animal waste. While not all coliform bacteria are harmful, their detection raises concerns about the potential presence of dangerous pathogens like viruses, Salmonella, and E. coli.A tribunal panel, headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Prakash Shrivastava and comprising Judicial Member Justice Sudhir Agarwal and Expert Member A Senthil Vel, reviewed measures to prevent sewage discharge into the Ganga and Yamuna rivers in Prayagraj. The bench took note of a CPCB report dated February 3, highlighting certain non-compliances and violations.""The river water quality was not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to faecal coliform (FC) at all the monitored locations on various occasions. A large number of people bathe in the river at Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh Mela, including on auspicious bathing days, which eventually leads to an increase in faecal concentration,"" the report said.The tribunal noted that UPPCB had not submitted a comprehensive action taken report as previously directed, instead providing only a covering letter with water test results.""Even upon reviewing the documents enclosed with the covering letter dated January 28, 2025, sent by the in-charge of the central laboratory, UPPCB, it is reflected that high levels of faecal and total coliform have been found at various locations,"" it continued.The counsel for Uttar Pradesh received one day to examine and respond to the report. The tribunal instructed the UPPCB Member Secretary and relevant state authority responsible for Ganga water quality at Prayagraj to attend the next virtual hearing scheduled for February 19.Speaking to news agency PTI, Jyotish Peeth Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati said: ""The National Green Tribunal had highlighted this even before the Kumbh started that the quality of Ganga and Yamuna waters was not good for bathing. They had also issued certain directions, especially on controlling the flow drains into the river. 40-50 crore people are taking bath there, it is being advertised all over the world, but the basic facility of clean water for bathing is not being provided.""While in a separate video, a Senior Consultant in Internal Medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Delhi, told news agency ANI: ""We are definitely seeing people with medical problems who are coming back from Kumbh, but obviously in a place which has so many people taking a dip in the water. We would expect that this would happen. The number of people who are coming with medical problems is much less as compared to the volume of people that are going over there.""That way, I think the control is very good, but yes, people are definitely coming with something like what we call gastroenteritis , where they're having loose motions, vomiting, and all that. They're having a fever of unspecific or unspecified origin. Most probably, they're viral fevers that are happening,"" the expert warned.The Senior Consultant said that many people returning from Kumbh are experiencing respiratory tract infections which is a common ailment in crowded settings.""Quite a few people are suffering from respiratory tract infections, like a runny nose, sneezing, cough, and cold, which is obviously very common. When you go to such a crowded place, and then you take a dip, which might be at 3 am in the morning, you can get exposed to this cold,"" he continued.He further advised the ""people to carry their own water, maybe water from home or maybe bottles of water, and they should drink water from a good place or carry their own bottles"".""The second thing is to eat food from a healthy place and eat cooked food rather than raw food, wear a mask and try to keep people at a distance...Do not drink the water while taking a dip in the river,"" the doctor added.","Water quality at several locations in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj during the ongoing Maha Kumbh did not meet primary bathing standards due to high faecal coliform levels, a report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) informed the National Green Tribunal on Monday.

NMC does U-turn on penalising colleges for not paying stipends,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-does-u-turn-on-penalising-colleges-for-not-paying-stipends/articleshow/118398046.cms,"File photo

After threatening penal action against medical colleges that did not pay stipend to MBBS interns or doctors doing post graduate training, National Medical Commission (NMC), has done an about-turn saying that it is up to state authorities to take action. However, the Maintenance of Standards of Medical Education Regulations 2023 gazetted in Sept 2023, give the NMC vast powers to penalise medical colleges monetarily, or by withholding accreditation, or by reducing seats.In Jan 2024, in response to an RTI application NMC refused to share details of what action was taken against the offending colleges claiming that the matter was sub judice. However, in response to yet another RTI application on the same issue, on Tuesday it stated that ""NMC is the regulatory body which issues guidelines, regulations from time to time. The implementation of the guidelines /instruction/advisory is solely at the discretion of the concerned state authorities under which the medical college/institute is located"".On Aug 11, 2023, the NMC issued an advisory on payment of stipend to PG medical students directing all private colleges to pay stipend in keeping with the Post Graduate Medical Education Regulation 2000. ""All the self-financed/private medical colleges are warned that NMC will take strict action for non-compliance of the provisions of the Regulations of PGMER, 2000, if any complaint is received in the future,"" stated the advisory. Supreme Court has ruled in 2022 and 2023 in favour of students stating that stipend has to be paid by govt and private medical colleges.On Nov 28, 2024, NMC issued a show cause notice to 198 colleges (115 govt and 83 private ones) for not submitting details of stipend paid to undergraduate interns, postgraduate residents, senior residents and postgraduates in super specialty courses, as directed through a public notice issued in April 2024. This notice was issued on the direction of SC. The court asked NMC to submit the details of stipend paid to interns and residents in all colleges. The NMC threatened penal action against colleges for their failure to submit the required information.""The NMC is being evasive regarding the action taken against the medical colleges stating it is the discretion of state authorities It is clear that the NMC is solely responsible for non-compliance of regulations by private medical colleges regarding payment of stipend,"" said Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist who filed the request seeking details of the action taken against the colleges.The Aug 2023 advisory was issued by NMC following an online survey among undergraduate and post graduate students in private medical colleges which revealed that hundreds of colleges were not paying stipend equal to that being paid in govt colleges as stipulated. Thousands of students also stated that they were not receiving any stipend. Shockingly, 1,228 students informed NMC that the stipend given was taken back by the college management.","National Medical Commission (NMC) has done an about-turn saying that it is up to state authorities to take action.

The court called this inaction ""alarming"", especially in a case which involved an acid attack survivor's rightful compensation.To prevent such delays in future, HC ordered the UP govt to issue a circular to all DMs, instructing them to ensure timely compensation. Additionally, it instructed the registrar (compliance) to communicate the order to the state govt's principal secretary (home).""With regard to the present case, the district magistrate, Meerut, is directed to ensure compliance with the letter dated Sept 3, 2024, within a period of one week,"" the HC order stated. It further instructed the department concerned of the Central govt to ""act on a war footing"" and process the additional compensation within six weeks of receiving the necessary documents.","A woman from Meerut, 18 at the time, suffered severe burns in an acid attack following a dispute over road construction. The attack left her with 100% disability, affecting her eyes, chest, neck, and face.

Assam tribunal on foreigners can't overturn own finding: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assam-tribunal-on-foreigners-cant-overturn-own-finding-sc/articleshow/118397414.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has ruled that once a designated Foreigners Tribunal rejects Assam govt's claim that a person is an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant who entered the state after March 25, 1971, the tribunal cannot review its own order based on the administration's fresh plea and additional documents.A tribunal had on Feb 15, 2018, after considering oral and documentary evidence in a case filed in 2016, decided that one Rejia Khatun was not a foreigner from Bangladesh who entered India on or after March 25, 1971.There was another case registered in 2012 alleging the same person to be a foreigner from Bangladesh. This was taken up for hearing on Dec 24, 2019, and the tribunal ruled that despite its Feb 15 order, it had the power to scrutinise documents and materials and even its findings in earlier proceedings. This was challenged by Khatun before Gauhati HC, which upheld the power of the tribunal to go into the question afresh notwithstanding the earlier decision declaring Khatun as not a foreigner.Senior advocate Pijush Roy, appearing for Khatun, told a bench of Justices A S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan that the tribunals had no power to review its own orders. Accepting the argument, the bench said state govt was a party to the 2018 order and neither did it seek recall of the order nor challenge it before the HC.""The (Dec 2019) order indicates that the tribunal wants to sit in an appeal against its own concluded judgment and order. Such power can never be exercised by the tribunal. The remedy of the state govt or for that matter the central govt was to challenge the order dated Feb 15, 2018,"" it said.The bench said the tribunal is powerless to reconsider its own orders and set aside the HC order as well as the Dec 24, 2019, decision of the tribunal.

Concerned over ISI team’s visit to Bangladesh: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/concerned-over-isi-teams-visit-to-bangladesh-army-chief/articleshow/118396480.cms,"NEW DELHI: India since 2014 has been ""assertive"" in its communication to Pakistan and ""they have understood that we mean business"", Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said on Wednesday, while also expressing ""concern"" over reports that a Pak Army-ISI delegation recently visited areas in Bangladesh close to 'Chicken's Neck' or the Siliguri Corridor in West Bengal.Gen Dwivedi also said India and China are now looking at how they both can reduce the massive number of troops deployed along the Line of Actual Control after the disengagement at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh last Oct, while reiterating all corps commanders have been ""empowered"" to resolve minor issues related to patrolling and grazing so that they do not ""escalate into violence"".In the backdrop of defence minister Rajnath Singh earlier this month refuting Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's claim that the Army chief had stated Chinese troops were present inside Indian territory, Gen Dwivedi, during a podcast with ANI, said the armed forces should not be dragged into political controversies. Singh had accused Gandhi of misquoting the Army chief and indulging in ""irresponsible politics"" on matters of national security. Gen Dwivedi, on his part, said, ""I think the political answer has been given by the Raksha Mantri (Singh). But the thing which I learnt is that it's important that I must make an endeavour that the Army should not be involved in politics.""On the Pakistan front, the Army chief said the neighbour has been very clearly told that the entire J&K is ""an integral part of India"", with the reading down of Article 370 in Aug 2019. ""There is no compromise with this,"" he said, noting that the number of ""local people"" being recruited as terrorists in J&K has significantly gone down, people no longer have ""confusion"" over their identity and the theme of ensuring the move from ""terrorism to tourism"" was working well on the ground.""India has said very clearly that we will be assertive in our communication (to Pakistan). And if required, we can be aggressive also. So, if you force us, then we will be aggressive enough to communicate our intent,"" he said. Asked about last month's visit of the Pak Army-ISI delegation to Rangpur in Bangladesh, which is close to the Siliguri Corridor in Bengal, Dwivedi said, ""I had used the word epicentre of terrorism for a particular country (Pakistan). Now those countrymen, if they go to any other place and they happen to be our neighbour, as far as I am concerned, I should be concerned about it.."" The Army chief had earlier said India and Bangladesh consider each other ""strategically important"" neighbours and any kind of ""animosity"" between the two countries is not in the interest of either. The relationship between the two militaries is ""very strong"" and ""we are able to exchange notes whenever we want,"" he said.","India since 2014 has been ""assertive"" in its communication to Pakistan, says Army chief.

NEW DELHI: India and Qatar upgraded their ties to a strategic partnership as PM Narendra Modi held bilateral talks with the visiting Qatar Amir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, discussing ways to enhance cooperation in areas like trade, investment, energy and security. Qatar committed to investing $ 10 billion in India, as it announced Qatar Investment Authority will open an office in India.The leaders spoke about signing a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and agreed to double the current $ 14 billion bilateral trade in the next 5 years. Apart from the establishment of strategic partnership, 6 other deals were signed including a revised agreement for avoidance of double taxation and another for financial and economic collaboration. They also agreed agreed to expedite negotiations for the India-Qatar Bilateral Investment Treaty.Qatar is the 5th GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) country with which India has signed a strategic partnership agreement, after UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait.Modi and Al-Thani discussed the West Asia situation, reiterating their respective positions on the Gaza situation and emphasising the need for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve conflicts. Qatar is a key player in Gaza ceasefire efforts and, as US President Donald Trump proposes a takeover of the Strip, its foreign ministry said Tuesday Palestinians will decide the future of Gaza. India has also reiterated its support for the 2-state solution after Trump announced his plan to relocate Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt.The leaders unequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations including cross-border terrorism and agreed to jointly combat the menace through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms.“They agreed to enhance cooperation in information and intelligence sharing, developing and exchanging experiences, best practices and technologies, capacity building and to strengthen cooperation in law enforcement, anti-money laundering, drug-trafficking, Cybercrime and other transnational crimes,’’ said the joint statement.

Modi had personally thanked Al-Thani for their release during his visit to Doha last year but one of the men, Purnendu Tiwari, remains in Qatar because of a financial fraud case against him. A travel ban is said to have been imposed on him.“Regarding the Navy official who is still over there, I would like to just say his matter remains sub judice in the local courts in Qata,’’ said MEA Secretary Arun Chatterjee, who handled overseas Indian affairs. The official added that the PM appreciated the work that Amir has done for the protection and welfare of Indian citizens. Qatar is home to 800,000 Indian nationals.The official said that while talks are underway for an India- GCC FTA, India and Qatar at the bilateral level will look at the possibility of having an FTA in the future.According to the joint statement, Qatar commended the steps taken by India in ensuring a conducive environment for Foreign Direct Investment and Foreign Institutional Investment and expressed interest to explore investment opportunities in different sectors, including infrastructure, technology, manufacturing, food security and hospitality. “In this regard, the Qatar side announced a commitment to invest $ 10 billion in India,’ it said, adding Indian side also appreciated Qatar’s efforts in enhancing its investment environment and its initiatives to attract Foreign Direct Investment.“India also recognized Qatar’s growing role as a regional hub for goods and services, leveraging its strategic location, world-class infrastructure, and business-friendly policies,’’ said the statement.","Qatar committed to investing $ 10 billion in India, as it announced Qatar Investment Authority will open an office in India.

UFC bossrecently shared a personal story about his connection to, a place where he spent cherished summers with his grandparents. Growing up in Connecticut, White developed a strong bond with the area, and it’s clear his affection for the place never faded. In a recent interview with the Bangor Daily News, White revealed that his love for the region led him to make the extraordinary investment as he bought the entire street where he grew up. Dana White who has a whopping $500 million fortune (per Forbes), bought his entire childhood street as he still shares an emotional connection to the place. “My time up there meant so much to me and I loved the place so much that I bought up the whole street that my grandmother and grandfather live on,” White said. He bought up multiple homes along Phillips Road to preserve the spirit of his childhood memories. It was not all, White later made a whopping donation, offering these houses to the Levant Fire Department for controlled burns as part of their training exercises.According to Lieutenant Wyatt Morrison of the Levant Fire Department, one of the homes was burned down about five years ago, while another had been burned nearly a decade earlier. Despite parting with some properties, White still owns a substantial amount of land in the area, including nine homes totaling 60 acres on Phillips Road and additional properties nearby. White further shared that he will continue to purchase more land, saying, “I continue to buy more and more property up there and I will until the day I die.”For White, these properties are more than just investments; they are a way for his children to experience the place. “I wanted my kids to experience the place and the people, and that’s why I invested so much in Maine,” White explained. His Fourth of July celebrations with family in Levant have become a tradition.Also Read: Conor McGregor names his dream bare-knuckle opponents Over the years, he has made significant contributions to the area, including a $100,000 donation to his alma mater, Hermon High School, in 2011 for athletic upgrades.

"Elon Musk Doge Dividend: What is DOGE dividend? Will all Americans get a refund check of $5,000 from Elon Musk?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-doge-dividend-will-all-americans-get-a-refund-check-of-5000-from-elon-musk/articleshow/118389968.cms,"Elon Musk acknowledged a proposal of DOGE dividend and said he will talk to President Donald Trump about it.

Why DOGE should pay any dividend to taxpayers



DOGE dividend is a proposal in which the taxpayers may get a refund check of $5,000 from the money that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency targets to save by its 2026 deadline. The proposal has been floated on X by James Fishback, the CEO of an investment firm and also an outside adviser to DOGE. Elon Musk reacted to the proposal and said he would check this proposal with President Donald Trump.Fishback gave a detailed calculation and showed that if DOGE meets its target and then gives 20 per cent of the savings to the 79 million tax-paying households, then it would amount to a $5,000 return per household. This is what Fishback called the 'DOGE dividend'.DOGE has a target of $2 trillion in savings and the Elon Musk-led department, as on Monday, already achieved $55 billion. DOGE is targeting government departments, frauds and government employees to cut corners for which it drew massive flak for it suggested the deletion of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) that provides funds to war-torn countries, the Department of Education and will put forth their further recommendations. President Trump praised the department and its ""smart"" work done by Elon Musk dismissing any scope of any conflict of interest.According to Fishback's proposal, taxpayers should be compensated as DOGE has been claiming that their hard-earned tax dollars were misused and abused by the former administration. This, the proposal says, would boost tax morale as the taxpayers would feel that they are receiving adequate value in exchange for their tax payments.DOGE dividend would incentivize many to re-enter the labor force in 2025 in order to be eligible for the DOGE dividend.Only tax-paying households should receive unlike any past stimulus checks and so it won't be inflationary, the proposal said. It will be more like a tax refund and should be financed exclusively via spending cuts.

Jagan criticises government over

farmers' struggles

NEW DELHI: Former Andhra Pradesh chief minister and YSR Congress Party leader, YS Jagan Mohan Reddy , stirred emotions during his visit to Vijayawada, as an unexpected, yet deeply touching encounter with a young supporter went viral.As Jagan’s convoy snaked through the bustling streets, thronged by thousands of eager supporters, one young girl’s reaction stood out. Overcome with emotion upon catching a glimpse of her idol, she began calling out “Jagan Anna” while struggling to reach him through the crowd.Moved by her enthusiasm, Jagan’s convoy came to a stop. Without a moment's hesitation, he beckoned her over, kissed her forehead, and then, in a moment of pure connection, took a selfie with the tearful fan.The girl, visibly overwhelmed, embraced him tightly, a gesture that captured the hearts of viewers far beyond the streets of Vijayawada.During his visit to the Mirchi Yard in Guntur, Jagan Mohan Reddy criticised the TDP-led government, saying farmers were suffering because they were not getting fair prices for their crops. Speaking to the media, he claimed that since the new government took over, farmers had been deprived of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and were struggling to find buyers for their produce.He stated, ""Take any crop, whether black gram, green gram, tomato or cotton, farmers are not getting the MSP.""Jagan urged chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu to visit the Mirchi Yard and take steps to help farmers. He pointed out that the price of chillies had dropped sharply from Rs 27,000 to Rs 8,000 per quintal, and the yield per acre had also fallen compared to the previous year. Rising farming costs, he added, were making things worse for tenant farmers.He mentioned that the same problems were affecting farmers in Krishna, NTR, Guntur, Bapatla, Prakasam, Kurnool, and Anantapuram districts. Accusing the government of neglecting farmers, he said, ""Despite such a grave situation, there is no review from the government side, and the Chief Minister and the Agriculture Minister have no concern for farmers, leaving them in the lurch. Chandrababu Naidu and his coalition government have not only let down the farmers but also stopped all the revolutionary reforms brought in by the YSRCP government.""Jagan explained that when his party was in power, MSP was provided for 24 crops, including chillies, turmeric, and onions. ""If the farmers were not getting MSP, our government had provided it, and RBKs were used as an anchor point for farmers. We made the best use of technology to map the prices of commodities across the state through the CM app. Now while chilli farmers are facing hardships, Chandrababu Naidu is least bothered,"" he alleged.He also pointed out that during the YSRCP government, officials helped farmers when their crops were affected by pests. ""Integrated farm labs were there for quality control, during our term, chilli farmers got the maximum price. The present government has reversed many of our decisions, including crop insurance,"" he added.Jagan claimed that cotton farmers were now earning less than Rs 7,000, while under his government, they received Rs 10,000. Tomato farmers, too, were struggling to get fair prices. He urged Chandrababu Naidu to take action and support the farmers.","YS Jagan Mohan Reddy faced an emotional encounter with a young fan during his Vijayawada visit.

guardhas been in recent headlines following his relationship with Kendall Jenner . The high-profile relationship, however, has a twist as her ex- Bad Bunny is apparently in the mix. A recent report revealed that Jenner is still dating Booker despite the Puerto Rican rapper hitting her fashion show. As new details of their relationship emerged from a source close to the couple, discussion among fans sparked online. Kendall Jenner and NBA star Devin Booker are very much together, despite the presence of her high-profile ex, Bad Bunny, at the Calvin Klein runway show during New York Fashion Week. The supermodel, 29, and the Phoenix Suns guard, 28, have had an on-and-off relationship for years, but according to a recent report by US Weekly, the two are currently solid and going strong.While Kendall and Devin have kept their relationship largely private, a source close to the couple confirmed that they are very much together. “Kendall thinks Devin is really funny, and they seem very solid right now,” the insider told US Weekly.The couple was recently spotted in New York City, packing on the PDA at a friend’s dinner party. “They were in NYC recently at a friend’s dinner party, making out and being very affectionate,” the source added, sharing that their rekindled romance is thriving.Reportedly, Kendall has chosen to keep her romance with Devin more low-key. “Kendall and Devin like to keep their relationship private. But they are very touchy-feely when they’re with friends,” the insider shared.Rumors of their reconciliation first surfaced in March 2024, following Kendall’s high-profile romance with music star Bad Bunny. The supermodel and reggaetón sensation, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, dated from February 2023 until December 2024 before briefly rekindling things in the summer of 2024. However, their relationship ultimately came to an end.On Friday, Kendall commanded the runway at Calvin Klein’s New York Fashion Week show, effortlessly strutting in an oversized gray coat over a cream skirt, paired with flats and a handbag. Bad Bunny was seated front-row, watching the show. Fans were quick to speculate about the possible reunion, given his history with Kendall and their complicated romantic timeline. However, sources shared that the former couple remains amicable despite their past.Kendall and Bad Bunny first sparked dating rumors in early 2023 after they were seen on a double date with Hailey and Justin Bieber.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach. It became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.
