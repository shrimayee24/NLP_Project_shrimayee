President Droupadi Murmu at Puri Beach

NEW DELHI: President Droupadi Murmu , currently on a four-day visit to Odisha for the Jagannath Ratha Yatra and other events, took a moment to share her reflections on nature via a series of posts on social media platform X. During her busy schedule, she visited Puri's Golden Beach and shared her thoughts and images from the visit.""There are places that bring us in closer touch with the essence of life and remind us that we are part of nature.Mountains, forests, rivers, and seashores appeal to something deep within us,"" President Murmu posted. ""As I walked along the seashore today, I felt a communion with the surroundings – the gentle wind, the roar of the waves, and the immense expanse of water. It was a meditative experience.""President Murmu also expressed how this connection with nature brought her profound inner peace, similar to her experience during her darshan of Mahaprabhu Shri Jagannathji. ""It brought to me a profound inner peace that I had also felt when I had a darshan of Mahaprabhu Shri Jagannathji yesterday. And I am not alone in having such an experience; all of us can feel that way when we encounter something that is far larger than us, that sustains us and that makes our lives meaningful,"" she wrote.She highlighted the disconnection of humankind from nature due to the hustle and bustle of daily life and the resulting environmental consequences. ""In the hustle and bustle of the daily grind, we lose this connection with Mother Nature. Humankind believes it has mastered nature and is exploiting it for its own short-term benefits. The result is for all to see. This summer, many parts of India suffered a terrible series of heatwaves. Extreme weather events have become more frequent around the globe in recent years. The situation is projected to be far worse in the decades to come,"" she said.President Murmu also pointed out the impact of global warming on oceans and coastal areas , saying, ""More than seventy percent of the surface of the earth is made up of oceans, and global warming is leading to a rise in global sea levels, threatening to submerge coastal areas. The oceans and the rich variety of flora and fauna found there have suffered heavily due to different kinds of pollution.""She concluded with a call for both large-scale and local efforts to protect and conserve the environment, highlighting the traditions of people living close to nature as a guiding example. ""Fortunately, people living in nature’s lap have sustained traditions that can show us the way. Inhabitants of coastal areas, for example, know the language of the winds and waves of the sea. Following our ancestors, they worship the sea as God.""""There are two ways, I believe, to meet the challenge of protection and conservation of the environment; broader steps that can come from governments and international organisations, and smaller, local steps that we can take as citizens. The two are, of course, complementary. Let us pledge to do what we can do – individually, locally – for the sake of a better tomorrow. We owe it to our children,"" she concluded in her posts.",President Droupadi Murmu is currently on a four-day visit to Odisha for the Jagannath Ratha Yatra.

Budget 2024 Income Tax Expectations : Ahead of the Union Budget 2024 presentation by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the government is currently evaluating a proposal to raise the tax-deductible limit on interest income from savings accounts to Rs 25,000.This suggestion was put forward by banks during a recent meeting with key officials from the finance ministry.Banks have been advocating for deposit incentives due to increasing concerns about the widening credit-deposit ratio.""It (the suggestion) is under review, and there could be some relief for banks, which have demanded incentives to shore up deposits,"" a government official was quoted as saying in an ET report by Dheeraj Tiwari. The final decision on the proposal will be made closer to the budget announcement.Under the old tax regime, interest income up to Rs 10,000 per year from savings accounts is tax-exempt under Section 80TTA of the Income Tax Act . For senior citizens aged 60 and above, this limit is set at Rs 50,000 and includes interest income from fixed deposits under Section 80 TTB. However, these benefits were removed under the new tax regime, when it was introduced in the 2020 budget.""Both issues, including enhancement of the old limit and allowing interest income earned from savings accounts in scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) under existing regulations in the new regime, are being deliberated,"" said the person cited above, noting that banks had previously made a presentation on this matter.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) observed in its latest Financial Stability Report that households are diversifying their financial savings, allocating more to non-banks and the capital market.The report highlighted that the growing gap is reflected in the rising credit-deposit (C-D) ratio, which peaked at 78.8% in December 2023 before moderating to 76.8% at the end of March.Recently, HDFC Bank, the country's largest private sector lender, reported a 5% sequential decline in its current account-savings account (CASA) deposits to Rs 8.63 lakh crore during the first quarter of the current financial year.","The government is evaluating a proposal to raise the tax-deductible limit on interest income from savings accounts to Rs 25,000.

NEW DELHI: The colonial legacy of long summer vacations continues in the Supreme Court , but for the first time a record 20 benches were set up during the nearly two-month-long break this year and exhausted the list of cases to be taken up during this period with the consent of counsel for parties.For those unaware of the punishing work schedule of SC judges, often criticised for the long summer break of the court, CJI D Y Chandrachud said, ""People see us sitting in Supreme Court from 10.30am to 4pm daily, when we handle between 40 and 60 cases.The work we do between 10.30am and 4pm is a fraction of the work we do in order to be ready to deal with cases coming up for hearing the next day.""""Every judge spends an equal amount of time reading case files scheduled for the next day. Judgments are reserved on working days. On Saturdays, every judge sits down and dictates judgments. On Sundays, all of us read the cases listed for Monday. So, without exception, every SC judge works seven days a week,"" he said.As Supreme Court resumes normal functioning on Monday after the summer break, CJI-led benches in the next few weeks would be pronouncing judgments, including three by 9-judge benches, two by 7-J benches, and two by 5-J benches.These constitution bench matters have been pending for decades, including a dispute whether industrial alcohol can be categorised as intoxicating liquor and whether privately owned properties can be classified as community property.Interestingly, despite handling a lot of administrative work and attending conferences in India and abroad, CJI D Y Chandrachud has been working on judgments reserved in 18 cases, which have a total of 176 connected petitions, by benches headed by him.""Other SC judges have reserved judgments in 190 cases with 786 connected petitions and they are also working round-the-clock on these judgments so that decisions can be pronounced within a few weeks of the court reopening,"" SC registry told TOI.During the period of six years preceding 2023, on an average 1,380 cases were listed every summer vacation.In 2023 and 2024 as many as 2,261 and 4,160 cases, respectively, were listed before the vacation benches, SC registry told TOI.The disposal during the summer vacation saw a near three-fold increase to 1,170 as compared to data from 2017. ""The average disposal of matter preceding 2023 was around 461 cases per vacation. In the 2023 summer break, the SC disposed of 751 cases, which this year increased to 1,170,"" it said.

"As China flexes muscles in SCS, India to host Quad drill",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-china-flexes-muscles-in-scs-india-to-host-quad-drill/articleshow/111560343.cms,"NEW DELHI: India will host the top-tier Malabar naval exercise with the other `Quad’ countries, the US, Japan and Australia, in the Bay of Bengal this year, amid China’s continuing muscle-flexing in the South China Sea and expanding strategic footprint in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).The 28th edition of the Malabar exercise, with a major focus on advanced anti-submarine warfare, will be conducted on India’s eastern seaboard in October to further enhance military interoperability among the four countries, defence sources told TOI.“Malabar will witness complex surface, anti-air and anti-submarine warfare drills, along with joint manoeuvres and advanced tactical exercises, to hone war-fighting skills. There is no plan to invite a fifth country for the exercise as of now,” a source said.The Malabar, which began as a bilateral exercise between India and the US in 1992 and now includes Japan and Australia as regular participants, was held off Sydney in August last year. Japan, in turn, had hosted the exercise off Yokosuka in 2022.The Malabar this year will come shortly after India will also host its first-ever major multi-nation air combat exercise `Tarang Shakti’ in August-September. Apart from the Quad countries, air forces from other nations like the UK, France, Germany, UAE and Singapore will also participate in the exercise.An aggressive China figures high on the radar screens of most countries. With the world’s largest Navy with 355 warships and submarines, Beijing has been strong-arming its neighbours in the South China Sea, especially the Philippines, with expansionist territorial claims while also building several new artificial islands.Similar Chinese “grey zone” and salami-slicing tactics are evident along the land borders with India. There is also the major concern over China’s growing presence in the IOR, with Beijing hunting for additional logistical turn-around facilities on the east coast of Africa after establishing its first overseas base at Djibouti in August 2017.“China is making moves in several countries like Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar and Comoros. Beijing, of course, has full access to Pakistan’s Gwadar and Karachi ports. Chinese warships, as part of anti-piracy escort forces, are also hanging around in the IOR for a longer time now,” a source said.Then, of course, Chinese survey and research vessels as well as satellite and missile-tracking ships are almost always present in the IOR to map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations. “China is boosting its underwater domain awareness in the IOR in order to operate here with a much greater degree of efficiency,” he added.India, of course, has been steadily ramping up its military ties with the Quad and several other countries, both bilaterally as well as multilaterally. India also has military logistics agreements, which provide for reciprocal refuelling, repair and berthing facilities for warships and aircraft, with the US, Australia, France, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. A similar pact with Russia is now on the anvil.Ahead of the Malabar, India’s 6000-tonne multi-role stealth frigate INS Shivalik, on a long-range deployment to the South China Sea and North Pacific Ocean, and a P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft are currently participating in the world’s largest naval exercise RIMPAC at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii. “RIMPAC is taking place 9,000 nautical miles from the Indian coast. An Indian submarine, INS Vagir, had also gone all the way to the west coast of Australia in an extended deployment last year for the first time,” another source said.“Malabar is all about the strong cooperation, shared values and the collective ability of the four nations to ensure a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, which China is trying to disrupt,” he added.","The 28th edition of the Malabar exercise, with a major focus on advanced anti- submarine warfare, will be conducted on India’s eastern seaboard in October.

(red eye).The Congress chief shared a media report with satellite images to claim that China's military is digging in for the long haul in the area around Pangong Lake in eastern Ladakh, having constructed underground bunkers to store weapons and fuel and hardened shelters for armoured vehicles at a key base in the region.""How can China build a military base near Pangong Tso on land which was under Indian occupation until May 2020,"" Kharge said.In his post, Kharge said, ""Even as we enter the fifth year of the 'CLEAN CHIT"" given by PM Narendra Modi on Galwan, where our brave soldiers sacrificed their lives, China continues to impinge upon our territorial integrity !""""Just to recall - 10th April 2024 - PM Modi in an interview to foreign press failed to put forth India's case strongly at the global stage"".""13th April 2024 - EAM's statement that 'China has not occupied any of our land' exposed Modi government 's meek policy towards China!""""4th July 2024 - Even though EAM meets his Chinese counterpart and says, 'Respecting the LAC and ensuring peace and tranquility in the border areas is essential',"" he wrote on X.""China continues to be belligerent in occupying our territory and constructing a military base at Sirijap, reportedly a land that was under Indian control,"" Kharge said.He alleged that the Modi government is responsible for ""not maintaining the status quo ante at the Line of Actual Control "".""We have lost possession of 26 Patrolling Points (PP) out of 65 including points in Depsang Plains, Demchok and Gogra Hot Springs area,"" he alleged.""'Modi Ki Chinese Guarantee' continues as his government wears 56-inch big Chinese blinkers on its 'Laal Aankh'!"" Kharge said.The Indian National Congress ""once again reiterates its demand to take the nation into confidence on the border situation at LAC"", he said.""We stand shoulder to shoulder with our valiant soldiers,"" Kharge asserted.While there was no immediate reaction from the BJP or the government on Kharge's post, the government have in the past rejected all allegations of Chinese incursion being levelled by the Congress.The Indian and Chinese armed forces have been engaged in a prolonged confrontation in eastern Ladakh since May 2020.Despite disengaging from several points of contention, a comprehensive resolution to the border dispute remains elusive.The relationship between the two nations suffered a severe setback following the intense skirmish in the Galwan Valley in June 2020, which represented the most significant military clash between the two countries in recent history.India has consistently maintained its stance that normal relations with China are contingent upon the restoration of peace along the border regions.In an effort to address the ongoing standoff, the two sides have conducted 21 rounds of Corps Commander-level talks thus far.However, a mutually acceptable solution to the border issue has yet to be achieved, and the process of negotiation and dialogue continues in the hope of finding a peaceful resolution to this long-standing dispute.","Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday once again put PM Narendra Modi in the docks.

Controversy erupts over Rahul’s interaction with loco pilots as Northern Railway denies they were from Delhi Division,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/controversy-erupts-over-rahuls-interaction-with-loco-pilots-as-northern-railway-denies-they-were-from-delhi-division/articleshow/111557889.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi ’s interaction with loco pilots at the New Delhi station has snowballed into a big controversy after Northern Railway said the drivers were not from the Delhi Division. Officials said the loco pilots and crew members shown in the video posted by Congress were either from other divisions or were brought.However, the All India Loco Running Staff Association (AILRSA) of South Zone said it’s immaterial to focus on which division the loco pilots were from as long as they have raised grievances that are common to all such divisions.“The issues raised by the crew members related to adequate rest and night duty concerns of everyone. So, it doesn’t matter crew members from which division raised the issue with the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha. We have also given a memorandum to him highlighting matters, including serious safety issues,” said R Kumaresan, president of South Zone AILRSA.Rahul’s visit to the station and interaction with train crew members came barely hours after railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw charged opposition parties of creating “false narratives” with old video clips and trying to “demotivate” railway personnel. He urged leaders to refrain from doing this.The video posted by Congress on its social media handle shows Rahul visiting the crew lobby, interacting with loco pilots and others, and trying to understand their issues.Hours later, spokesperson of Northern Railway, Deepak Kumar said, “Rahul Gandhi visited the railway station along with 7-8 cameramen. They visited the crew lobby and understood how it works. He interacted with loco pilots who were not from our lobby. It seems they were from outside or were brought. The camera persons were making some films and reels as well.”The video shared by Congress claims that the main complaint that loco pilots raised before Rahul was not getting enough rest, which is one of the main causes of accidents. It said they are demanding 46 hours’ rest in a week as per rules and shortage of loco pilots.Kumaresan said they had written to leaders of political parties, including Rahul, highlighting their issues. They were informed on Friday that he would meet loco pilots. “We had a meeting here and hence there were people from different divisions. We had written to the railway minister and Railway Board chairperson. Honouring their words that our grievances would be resolved we had withdrawn agitation. But there is no progress so far,” he added.Highlighting the plight of train drivers, the memorandum note given to Rahul mentions that loco pilots, especially those who drive goods trains, work 14-16 hours a day and get to go home after three or four days. It said drivers work for more than four consecutive nights and instead of getting weekly rest, they are given rest once in 10 days.The memorandum also said that a railway task force on safety in 2017 found that overshooting of red signals happens mostly when loco pilots return after “inadequate weekly rest”. It said, “Whereas all staff are entitled to a weekly rest between 40 and 64 hours but loco pilots are entitled to only 30.”",The All India Loco Running Staff Association (AILRSA) of South Zone said it’s immaterial to focus on which division the loco pilots were from as long as they have raised grievances.

Why BNSS offers slim hope of early disposal of pending cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-bnss-offers-slim-hope-of-early-disposal-of-pending-cases/articleshow/111440968.cms,"NEW DELHI: The laws on adjournments under Section 346 of the just-implemented Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and Section 309 of the erstwhile Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) remain identical, giving little hope for expeditious disposal of huge pendency of cases across all courts.Repeated adjournments have been the single largest factor contributing to over five crore cases clogging the three-tier judicial system , where 4.5 crore cases are pending only in the subordinate courts , pendency in high courts touching 62 lakh, and those in Supreme Court having crossed 83,800 cases as of July 1.The provisions under 346 of BNSS provides that ""in every inquiry or trial the proceedings shall be continued from day-to-day basis until all the witnesses in attendance have been examined, unless the court finds the adjournment of the same beyond the following day to be necessary for reasons to be recorded"".CrPC, which has now been replaced with BNSS, under Section 309 had the same provisions as the newly-enacted law, including the procedure to be followed for rape cases in which the inquiry or trial shall be completed within a period of two months from the date of filing of chargesheet.""The provisions relating to postponement or adjournment of hearings, as provided in Section 309 of CrPC and now in Section 346 of BNSS is only a legitimate expectation. Due to large pendency of cases in the courts, disproportionate ratio of judges vis-a-vis population, routine adjournment of cases merely on asking of an advocate and lack of use of technology, more particularly in lower courts, are big constraint in maintaining the timelines provided in the law for deciding cases,"" said former law secretary PK Malhotra.Though Section 346(2) of BNSS gives unfettered powers to a judge to adjourn hearings even after commencement of trial ""for such time as it considers reasonable..."", in Section 346(2)b, the BNSS for the first time limits the adjournments to two: ""where the circumstances are beyond the control of a party, not more than two adjournments may be granted by the court after hearing the objections of the other party and for the reasons to be recorded in writing.""The directives to limit adjournments have been issued earlier too by the apex court to subordinate courts but these are seldom followed.Quoting from the findings of a 2017 study by Bengaluru-based legal think tank Daksh, TOI had earlier reported that an average 87 cases got listed each day before a subordinate court judge, and almost half of them were adjourned. ""This is far too many, given that the judge sits in an open court for only about five-and-a-half hours. This means on an average, judges have a little more than three-and-a-half minutes on each case,"" the study had noted.",The laws on adjournments under Section 346 of the just-implemented Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and Section 309 of the erstwhile Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) remain identical.

"Yesterday once more: Cities decide time can't stand still, get historic clocks ticking",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/yesterday-once-more-cities-decide-time-cant-stand-still-get-historic-clocks-ticking/articleshow/111561477.cms,"Repairs can cost ₹3L per clock, crowdfunding makes it all tick

Guardians of Time:

Ticks of Their Hands:

Chimes of Time:

In Kolkata, a city where the past is revered and the future eagerly awaited, the passage of time strikes a delicate balance between the ticking of modern timepieces and the resonant chimes of British-era public clocks. Perched high on stately buildings, these clocks mark the pulse of daily life.These historic clocks evoke a sense of nostalgia, inviting passers-by to pause and reflect.A traffic constable recently stopped under the shadow of the pristine white St Andrew's Church, struck by a familiar sound - the rhythmic gongs, dormant for over a decade, cascading through Dalhousie Square. ""Hearing this sound after many years,"" he said.A traffic constable who recently stopped under the shadow of the pristine white St Andrew's Church was struck by a familiar sound from the rhythmic gongs of a clock manufactured by James McCabe Royal Exchange of London in 1835.The clock's chiming mechanism had fallen silent more than 10 years ago, its stillness contrasting with the unceasing flow of life. Thanks to the concerted efforts of Kolkata Restorers, a citizens' collective bound by a shared passion for their city, the clock now stands revived, adding to the allure of the historic precinct.Kolkata Restorers has engaged restoration specialists Swapan Dutta and his son Satyajit to nurse defunct clocks back to health, one chime at a time. Among the notable timepieces the father-son duo maintains is a clock along the banks of the Ganga at Har ki Pauri in Haridwar, dating back to 1938. Another, a four-faced clock at Government Senior Secondary School in Kapurthala, installed 161 years ago by Maharaja Jagjit Singh, owes its continued operation to their meticulous care. They also maintain a clock at the Patna secretariat, installed in 1924. ""Repairing and overhauling a mechanical clock is a labour of love,"" said Swapan. ""Most of these clocks are of British or German origin. Though they have withstood the passage of time, some parts inevitably wear out and need replacing. We replace bushes, fabricate missing parts, fix alignments, and set the teeth and interlocking systems right to breathe life back into these clocks.""The Duttas' lineage of clockmakers spans five generations and nearly 200 years, beginning with Swapan's great-grandfather Dharani Dhar Dutta. ""He repaired large public clocks and grandfather clocks in aristocratic homes,"" Swapan said. Their workshop on Madan Gopal Lane near Kolkata Medical College and Hospital showcases the rhythmic ticking and tocking of mechanisms, a tribute to the Duttas' dedication to their craft.Kolkata Restorers, comprising people from various walks of life, is on a mission to resurrect the forgotten melodies of Kolkata's past. It started with a plan to illuminate some prominent buildings in the city, but the sight of dysfunctional clocks spurred them to action. ""When we illuminated a building with a clock, it enhanced the imperfection of the dysfunctional clock. We thus felt we had to work on the clocks,"" recalled Mudar Patheria, a member of the group.Crowd-funding has been instrumental in their efforts, gathering contributions to cover repair costs, which can exceed Rs 3 lakh. They have successfully restored clocks at Sacred Heart Church, Dharmatala, and are working on others at Holy Trinity Church and Magen David Synagogue. Next on their radar are clocks at Our Lady of Dolours Church in Sealdah and the GPO, which has remained silent for years.Architect Abin Chaudhuri, another member, highlighted the importance of preserving the historical quarter of Dalhousie Square, where St Andrew's Church is located. ""Dalhousie Square includes Writers' Building (from where the British governed India for two centuries); GPO (India's first general post office); and Old Telegraph Office (known as Dead Letter Building as it stores letters that had for some reason never been delivered)...,"" Chaudhuri said.According to direct tax consultant Miraj Shah, the endeavour was to add value to the city instead of complaining about things that govt or the civic body wasn't doing. ""It is a demonstration that a little bit of money with proper intent, time and effort can bring about change,"" he said.Public clocks across the urban landscape serve as timeless keepers of history. Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Port, formerly Kolkata Port Trust, maintains three historic clocks. The first, at its headquarters in Dalhousie Square, was set up in 1877 by Flerken Smith & Sons. The second, at Indenture Memorial in Kidderpore Port, was made in 1899 by Cooke & Kelvey of London. The third, at Netaji Subhas Dock, was made in 1928 by Flerken Smith & Sons and has served as a timekeeper for nearly a century.In Darjeeling, the iconic turret clock at Capitol Hall, the historic seat of Darjeeling Municipality, mirrors the immutable flow of time. Originally installed by GT Gent and Co of the UK in the 1920s, it suffered damage in a 1996 fire and was later restored by Rotary Club of Darjeeling. These timeless keepers of time bend under the weight of history, much like Dali's fluid clocks, yet persist like Pink Floyd's haunting melody that captures the seconds, minutes, and hours: ""Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day.""(inputs from Roshan Gupta, Siliguri)","Kolkata Restorers is a citizens' collective bound by a shared passion for their city.

BMRCL: Silk Board Double-Decker Flyover: Commuters Demand Immediate Opening,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/double-decker-flyover-awaits-vip-launch-commuters-irked/articleshow/111443589.cms,"BENGALURU: Commuters facing daily traffic woes at Silk Board junction have one demand: Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd ( BMRCL ) must open to motorists the lower deck of the rail-cum-road double-decker flyover between Ragigudda and Silk Board and three ramps at Silk Board junction without further delay.They argue that if the road infrastructure is ready, there should be no reason for delaying the opening, as formal inauguration by VIPs shouldn’t be a priority.Last year, BMRCL had to drop its plans to formally launch two stations of the Purple Line at Challaghatta and Benniganahalli after public outrage. The stations were operationalised and virtually inaugurated at a later stage.As part of Yellow Line Metro, BMRCL has built a 3km road-cum-rail flyover from Ragigudda to Silk Board. Initially, BMRCL planned to open the road infrastructure to vehicle users by the end of 2023, but the deadline was revised to May 2024 and then pushed to June. It is said the Metro authority is awaiting approval from the central and state govts, both partners in BMRCL, to set a formal opening date.While the lower deck was ready 1.5 years ago, construction of the ramps at Silk Board junction was finished recently. At present, the infrastructure is partially ready to accommodate traffic flow from Ragigudda and BTM Layout side to HSR Layout and Hosur Road. Work to ready the flyover to accommodate traffic flow in the opposite direction will take another year for completion.The alignment of the flyover passes through Jayadeva hospital junction, where the city’s tallest Metro station — providing interchange facilities for the upcoming Yellow and Pink lines — has been built. At Silk Board, BMRCL has built three ramps traversing over a flyover located at the junction. These ramps will allow motorists coming from Ragigudda and BTM Layout to reach HSR Layout (ORR side) and Electronics City (Hosur Road) without stopping at the signal.In 2016-17, BMRCL modified the design of the elevated Metro corridor to accommodate the city’s first double-decker flyover. The road infrastructure has cost Rs 449 crore.Those travelling from Jayanagar and Bannerghatta Road to Silk Board endured daily traffic snarls for years during the construction work. In 2019, BMRCL demolished the Jayadeva flyover to facilitate the work, and traffic diversions were put in place for years.Transport minister Ramalinga Reddy, who also represents BTM Layout assembly constituency, said, “As per the information I have, the road infrastructure is ready. BMRCL is waiting for consent from the ministry of housing and ministry of urban development for its formal inauguration. The road flyover and ramps at Silk Board will ease congestion on this busy corridor. Once the ramps from HSR Layout towards BTM Layout get ready, congestion will drastically come down at the junction.”BMRCL officials remained tight-lipped on the issue. A senior official simply stated, “The date of opening the road infrastructure will be communicated shortly.”","BMRCL has built a 3km road-cum-rail flyover from Ragigudda to Silk Board.

Banks on alert! The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks , following credible intelligence reports. Banks have been instructed to actively monitor their systems round the clock to detect any threats.In an advisory issued on June 24, the RBI said, ""In the light of credible threat intelligence received regarding potential cyberattacks, regulated entities are advised to put in place enhanced state of surveillance and resilience capabilities to guard against these threats.""According to an ET report, RBI's communication preceded a social media post suggesting that LulzSec , a group notorious for several high-profile attacks, was targeting Indian banks.The group, which was thought to have become inactive, is said to have resurfaced.Banks are required to continuously monitor network activities and server logs to identify any malicious intrusions. Additionally, they must keep a close watch on critical payment systems, including SWIFT (the messaging system for international fund transfers), card networks (facilitating card payments), and domestic real-time fund transfer frameworks such as RTGS, NEFT, and UPI.RBI has issued a reminder to banks, urging them to implement standard controls to safeguard against threats such as DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. These attacks involve hackers launching a coordinated assault on a bank's systems, overwhelming them with a flood of queries that hinder the processing of legitimate customer requests and transactions on the website and online services.In addition to DDoS protection, banks are required to impose restrictions on remote logins and access to critical systems.

How scammers are using social media to target Indian users

Various reports in the past have suggested how fraudsters are targeting Indians with investment scams. They defraud people by offering high returns, convincing them to invest huge amounts of money and the victims later realise that they have been scammed. According to a report, social media platforms like WhatsApp , Facebook , X (earlier Twitter) and Telegram have seen a rise in investment scams over the last few months.“The landscape of investment scams in India has evolved significantly with the rise of social media messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. Fraudsters are leveraging the identities of reputed financial professionals, fund managers, and influencers to deceive unsuspecting investors into joining fake investment groups promising quick returns,” cybersecurity company CloudSEK has revealedCloudSEK says that its threat intelligence report outlines the modus operandi and tactics associated with these fraudulent activities targeting Global countries, especially India.CloudSEK claims that it has discovered over 29,000 malicious investment advertisements on Facebook and 81,000 fake investment WhatsApp groups during the period of January to June, 2024.The report said that a scammer who has been in the business for over six years has been earning around $ 50,000 (around 41 lakh) per month. The personal data is available for purchase at $100 for 10,000 lines of data containing details such as phone numbers and names.The fraudsters are using sophisticated tactics, including impersonating reputed financial institutions and professionals, to lure unsuspecting investors into fake investment groups. They promise quick and substantial returns.“Within these groups, scammers manipulate victims by providing fake proof of earnings and promising high returns. They then disappear with the investments, leaving victims with significant financial losses,” said the report.These scam operations involve stolen data, fake profiles, and rigged trading platforms to steal money from unsuspecting victims.As a part of a well-organised structure, criminals purchase hacked stock trading data from brokers who source it from underground forums, the report noted.“These brokers sell the data to organised crime groups that operate large-scale trading scams. The crime groups employ handlers and actors to execute scams, posing as successful investors and using social media platforms to lure victims into WhatsApp groups,” said the report.Apart from India, geographies such as Malaysia, USA, Thailand and Vietnam are among the primary targets of these investment scams.","Investment scams in India have evolved significantly with the rise of social media messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Canada Police believes that the gold stolen last year in Canada's biggest-ever gold heist must have gone to India and Dubai gold markets. Over 6,500 gold bars disappeared overseas after being stolen from an airport, the department believes. ""We believe a large portion has gone overseas to markets that are flush with gold,"" lead investigator Det. Sgt. Mike Mavity said.""That would be Dubai, or India, where you can take gold with serial numbers on it, and they will still honor it and melt it down,"" the investigator said.Nine individuals were arrested in connection with the meticulously planned heist including a former Air Canada manager and a jewelry store owner. The suspects used a completed bill for a seafood pick-up to forge paperwork that was given to a warehouse attendant. A small amount of precious metal was probably melted down in the basement of a Mississauga jewelry store immediately after the heist. Only 90,000 Canadian dollars were recovered from the heist.Canada cops described the heist as Netflix material as a lot of daring planning went behind it. The robbery was staged in an Air Canada cargo facility within the Toronto Pearson International Airport.A man gained entry to an Air Canada cargo terminal with a duplicate waybill for a shipment of seafood and then drove off with a palette full of gold bars. The heist was busted a year later. India-origin men Parmpal Sidhu, Archit Grover, Amit Jalota were among the arrested.The gold container arrived on the Air Canada flight from Switzerland to Toronto. It had 22 million Canadian dollars in gold bars and foreign currency. A day after the cargo arrived, it was reported missing. Police said at least two former Air Canada employees assisted the theft.Parmpal Sidhu was working at the Air Canada Cargo terminal during the heist; Archit Grover is a longtime friend of Sidhu and Amit Jalota is Grover's cousin.","Over 6,500 gold bars disappeared overseas after being stolen from an airport.

A massive heat wave is set to bring a new set of record-breaking temperatures to the US West Coast , while millions of Americans endure a heat dome that is also affecting Arizona and Nevada.The national weather service reported on Sunday that around 36 million people, or about 10% of the nation's population, are under excessive heat warnings resulting from the heat dome centered over California.Research indicates that climate change is responsible for driving extreme heat waves worldwide and will persist in delivering hazardous weather for years to come.An additional 36 million people are under heat advisories, while approximately 1 million people face excessive heat watches, including areas in eastern Oregon, northeastern Nevada, and southwestern Idaho.According to NWS meteorologist Bryan Jackson, temperatures in locations such as Redding, a city in northern California that reached an all-time high of 119 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) on Saturday, are running up to 20 degrees above normal for this time of year.""We're expecting it to merely drift east through the early part of next week and basically persist through the week, so we've got a real expansive and extreme heat wave ongoing, and it's expected to continue this week,"" he said.In places like Washington state, Oregon, California, northern Arizona, and central Idaho, high temperatures are predicted to meet or surpass daily high records.Heat warnings indicate that conditions are imminent, which is different from watches that are issued when conditions are predicted in the upcoming days.Last week, the administration of US President Joe Biden proposed the first-ever safety standard aimed at protecting workers and communities from the effects of extreme heat.Earth experienced record-high temperatures for 13 consecutive months, with June 2024 marking the 12th straight month of global temperatures 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to Copernicus. This streak underscores the urgency of the Paris Agreement’s warming limit. Despite hopes that the record-setting heat may subside, climate disruptions will persist.The June global temperature averaged 62°F, the highest for any June, and the third hottest month recorded. Extreme heat affected regions like southeast Europe and the US The oceans have also been breaking heat records for 15 months. Long-term greenhouse gas emissions and factors like El Niño contribute to the rising temperatures. Scientists warn that the planet is on a path to 3°C warming unless emissions are curbed. This crisis highlights the growing impact of climate change, with more frequent and severe weather events, posing risks to both the wealthy and the poor.","Earth experienced record-high temperatures for 13 consecutive months, with June 2024 marking the 12th straight month of global temperatures 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

The banks are de-risking to meet financial regulations but the trend undermines the financial resilience of Pacific Island countries, according to experts.Nelson told those attending the meeting that the US recognised and is committed to addressing bank de-risking across the Pacific.""There is a lot to be gained by promoting financial integration around the world. But conversely, when correspondent banking relationships dwindle, the consequences can be substantial,"" he added.Nelson said data suggests that over the past decade the number of correspondent banking relationships in the Pacific had declined at twice the rate of the global average. The World Bank and Asia Development Bank is working on programmes to try and improving corresponding banking relations.Jane Yellen, US Treasury Secretary said in a virtual address to the meeting that the US focus was on supporting the Pacific region's economic resilience, including through strengthening access to correspondent banks.""The United States is committed to an Indo-Pacific that is free and open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient.

Barron was also considering New York University but the new TikTok post makes it clear that Barron has kept his doors open. He may also take a gap year given this is a crucial year for his family.""He's tall, good-looking ... guy's a very good student. And he's applied to colleges and gets into everywhere he goes.

He has great marks. He's going to be going to college soon. And we're looking at some colleges that are different [than] they were two months ago,"" Trump said in May.Though Barron Trump remains far away from politics, he is Internet's curiosity and more so recently because of a controversy over cryptocurrency DJT meme coin which was attributed to Barron Trump without any evidence. It was reported that Barron Trump amassed a huge amount of money through the crypto token.Barron was last seen with his father at the Golf Course where his father was hurling abuses on Joe Biden and Kamala Harris -- as seen in a leaked video. Though Barron was seen sitting silently beside his father, social media at least got to know that Barron probably shares father's hobby of golf.It is for Barron that Melania Trump is very concerned and does not want to be a full time first lady if Trump re-enters the White House.

Persistent heat wave in the US expected to shatter new records as it bakes West and swelters in East,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/persistent-heat-wave-in-the-us-expected-to-shatter-new-records-as-it-bakes-west-and-swelters-in-east/articleshow/111559376.cms,"A long-running heat wave that has already shattered previous records across the US will persist, baking parts of the West with dangerous temperatures that will soar into the 100s and holding the East in its hot and humid grip throughout the week, forecasters said Sunday.An excessive heat warning - the National Weather Service's highest alert - was in effect for about 36 million people, or about 10% of the population, said NWS meteorologist Bryan Jackson.He said he expected dozens of locations in the West and Pacific Northwest to tie or break previous heat records.That was certainly the case on Saturday: Many areas in Northern California surpassed 110 degrees (43.3 C), with the city of Redding topping out at a record 119 (48.3 C). Las Vegas tied the record of 115 F (46 C), last reached in 2007, and Phoenix topped out at 114 F (45.5 C), just shy of the record of 116 F (46.7 C) dating to 1942.Marko Boscovich said the best way to beat the heat in Las Vegas is in a seat at a slot machine with a cold beer inside an air-conditioned casino.""But you know, after it hits triple digits it's about all the same to me,"" said Boscovich, who was visiting from Sparks, Nevada, to see a Dead & Company concert Saturday night at the Sphere. ""Maybe they'll play one of my favorites - 'Cold Rain and Snow.'""Temperatures in Oregon were expected to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius) on Sunday and soar as high as 115 degrees (46.1 C) in some parts of California, Jackson said. On the more-humid East Coast, temperatures above 100 degrees were expected, though no excessive heat advisories were in effect for the region on Sunday.On Saturday, Raleigh, North Carolina, reached an all-time record high of 106 degrees F (41.1 C), with a maximum heat index of 118 F (47.7 C), he said.""Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors,"" read a National Weather Service advisory for the Baltimore area. ""Young children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any circumstances.""Heat records shattered across the Southwest Rare heat advisories were extended even into higher elevations including around Lake Tahoe, on the border of California and Nevada, with the National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada, warning of ""major heat risk impacts, even in the mountains.""""How hot are we talking? Well, high temperatures across (western Nevada and northeastern California) won't get below 100 degrees (37.8 C) until next weekend,"" the service posted online. ""And unfortunately, there won't be much relief overnight either.""Indeed, Reno hit a high of 104 F (40 C) on Saturday, smashing the old record of 101 F (38.3 C).More extreme highs are in the near forecast, including 129 F (53.8 C) for Sunday at Furnace Creek, California, in Death Valley National Park, and then around 130 F (54.4 C) through Wednesday.The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, eastern California, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.Deaths are starting to mount In Arizona 's Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, there have been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year, along with more than 160 other deaths suspected of being related to heat that are still under investigation, according to a recent report.That does not include the death of a 10-year-old boy last week in Phoenix who suffered a ""heat-related medical event"" while hiking with family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to police.California wildfires fanned by low humidity, high temperatures Firefighters dispatched aircraft and helicopters to drop water or retardant on a series of wildfires in California.In Santa Barbara County, northwest of Los Angeles, the Lake Fire has scorched more than 19 square miles (49 square kilometers) of grass, brush and timber. Firefighters said the blaze was displaying ""extreme fire behavior"" and had the ""potential for large growth"" with high temperatures and low humidity.Festival revelers meet the heat with cold water and shade At the Waterfront Blues Festival in Portland, Oregon, music fans coped by drinking cold water, seeking shade or freshening up under water misters. Organizers of the weekend revelries also advertised free access to air conditioning in a nearby hotel.Angelica Quiroz, 31, kept her scarf and hat wet and applied sunscreen.""Definitely a difference between the shade and the sun,"" Quiroz said Friday. ""But when you're in the sun, it feels like you're cooking.""","An excessive heat warning is in effect for about 36 million people, or about 10% of the population. Forecasters expect dozens of locations in the West and Pacific Northwest to tie or break heat records. On the more-humid East Coast, temperatures above 100 degrees are expected.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111559402,imgsize-852374,width-400,resizemode-4/111559402.jpg"
Prince Harry: Prince Harry is 'bored' in California; does not see his friends anymore because...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prince-harry-is-bored-in-california-does-not-see-his-friends-anymore-because-/articleshow/111559254.cms,"Amid reports that Prince Harry was looking to extend an olive branch to the royal family, it is now being claimed that Harry is bored in California and does not see his friends anymore because they don't like his wife Meghan Markle . “Harry is increasingly bored and looking back across the Atlantic where most of his army and school friends still live and whom he never sees because they won’t visit him in the States because they find Meghan difficult,” royal expert Tom Quinn told The Mirror.Harry reportedly has a pre-Meghan and post-Meghan world and the two worlds do not merge. Harry was in England in May for the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games -- founded by Prince Harry -- but did not plan to see his friends as they are part of the pre-Meghan world which Harry hates to revisit. Harry's friends too do not reach out to the lonely prince because they feel betrayed by the way Harry wrote about his military service in his memoir 'Spare'.Harry's old friends blame Meghan for transforming Harry into Harry the Hippy, Quinn claimed.“The truth is that Harry has reinvented himself in a way that just doesn’t work for his family or for friends from the past when he was a very different character,” the royal expert added.While Harry is seemingly unhappy in his new home California, Meghan too feels ""under siege"" as her life has not been going in the direction that she planned.Meghan hates that she is not of much interest in AmericaQuinn said Meghan loves media attention and is not liking it in the US as the spotlight is not on her and Harry. Since stepping down as a senior member of the British royal family in 2020, Meghan tried her hand at a number of projects but the success that she was aiming at remained elusive. Her own lifestyle brand American Riviera Orchard which she recently launched also did not grab eyeballs.“Like her husband, she feels that people are unfairly picking on her – she cannot understand why people don’t admire her work,"" Quinn said.",Harry reportedly has a pre-Meghan and post-Megan world and the two worlds do not merge. Harry was in England in May for the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games -- founded by Prince Harry -- but did not plan to see his friends.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111559241,imgsize-1256906,width-400,resizemode-4/111559241.jpg"
