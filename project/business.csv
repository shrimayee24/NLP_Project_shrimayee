No commitment to US on tariffs: Govt to Parlimantary panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-commitment-to-us-on-tariffs-govt-to-parlimantary-panel/articleshow/118865487.cms,"US President Donald Trump

US talks could also prove beneficial for us: Commerce secretary

NEW DELHI: Two days after Donald Trump’s claim that India had committed to bring tariffs “way down”, govt on Monday told a parliamentary panel that no commitments on the issue had been made to the US and it has sought time until Sept to address the issue that is being repeatedly flagged by the American president.Appearing before the parliamentary standing committee on external affairs, commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal is learnt to have said that India and the US were working towards a mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement, focusing on long-term trade cooperation instead of merely seeking immediate tariff adjustments.He also sought to allay concerns over tariff actions against India, arguing that New Delhi was engaged with Washington on a trade deal, in sharp contrast to China, Canada and Mexico — where Trump has announced tariff actions, some of which have already kicked in.Some opposition MPs like AIMIM ’s Asaduddin Owaisi , Congress’s Deepender Hooda and TMC’s Sagarika Ghosh are learnt to have questioned the commerce secretary on reciprocal tariffs, which Trump has threatened to impose from April 2 against countries with high tariffs. According to sources, Barthwal responded by suggesting that India may escape reciprocal tariffs for the moment.Some opposition MPs like AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi, Congress’s Deepender Hooda and TMC’s Sagarika Ghosh are learnt to have questioned the commerce secretary on reciprocal tariffs, which Trump has threatened to impose from April 2 against countries with high tariffs.The parliamentary panel, headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , had asked commerce secretary and foreign secretary Vikram Misri to appear before it and explain recent developments, including media reports quoting Trump that India had agreed to lower its tariffs.Earlier in the day, Misri presented govt’s view to panel members about reports of constructions on China border and assured lawmakers that the two countries were in constant touch and there was nothing to be concerned about.Trade issues and Trump’s repeated threats of tariff actions are learnt to have dominated the meeting Monday, where Barthwal made it clear that the country’s interests would be safeguarded during talks for trade deal. He said govt could only react after Trump administration had taken some steps, which was not the case so far.The commerce secretary is learnt to have pointed out that the talks could also prove to be beneficial for India. There is a section in govt which believes higher tariffs on countries such as China will open the doors for India in certain sectors in addition to the proposed bilateral agreement helping export of Indian textiles and leather products.Last week, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had suggested that Trump’s stance on tariffs and foreign policy could throw up openings for India. Commerce department officials have maintained that India and US can complement each other, given the list of products that each produces.Sources said committee members asked Misri many pointed questions on China and the dam on Brahmaputra river. He informed the panel that there was no agreement between India and China, but there was a water agreement between India and Pakistan. “So, any issue with China can be discussed bilaterally only,” a source quoted Misri as saying. He said China wanted to restore full-fledged relations with India, with direct flights, visa for visitors and deployment of journalists. He said talks were continuing, but expressed concern about allowing visitors and scribes.",US talks could also prove beneficial for us: Commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal.

BJP vs DMK

Clash began after DMK MP claimed TN funds ‘diverted’

NEW DELHI: The Modi govt and DMK clashed on the first day of the resumed Budget session , with the latter questioning the govt over the three-language policy and education minister Dharmendra Pradhan accusing the Tamil Nadu govt and the governing party of going back on their commitment to sign the MoU for NEP.The minister attacked DMK with strong words, claiming that TN was ready to implement NEP but reversed its stand because of pressure from some ‘super CM’, and accused the party of being undemocratic and anti-students, leading to protests and a couple of adjournments. He later withdrew his remark on Speaker Om Birla’s initiative, and was expunged. In the evening, DMK filed a privilege motion against Pradhan, accusing him of misleading the House and tarnishing the image of Tamil Nadu.DMK MP K Kanimozhi, in the privilege notice, also alleged that the minister’s conduct attacked her dignity as a woman, and “his indecent remarks” constituted an outrage to modesty and harassment, while sending a “harmful message” that any female member can be attacked verbally, humiliated and harassed.DMK MPs disrupted the proceedings during question hour, opposing the Centre’s three-language policy and linking of the implementation of NEP as a pre-condition for release of central grants. Congress MPs, too, joined DMK, against Pradhan’s remarks. Under NEP, every state has to sign an MoU in order to receive central funds for infrastructure upgrades and other financial assistance.With language policy and delimitation on top of its agenda, DMK used legislative proceedings on the first day to hammer home its talking points, with even the “lading bill” becoming a platform for sniping at BJP. DMK MP Kalanidhi Veeraswamy, speaking on the legislation, caustically said there did not seem to be an equivalent of “lading” in Hindi, because govt had not changed the name of the bill from its earlier version — echoing DMK’s complaint that Modi govt has enacted laws without the customary English titles like the three criminal laws. Veeraswamy said govt should consider Tamils as a part of India. Citing a Tamil proverb, he went on to say that Tamils consider every person in contact as their relatives, but the treasury benches “treat us” as enemies and not political foes.The clash started after DMK MP T Sumathy said around Rs 2,000 crore originally meant for TN for PM-SHRI has been diverted to other states due to its opposition to NEP. She said Centre was using financial allocation for school education as a vengeful tool against the state.During the clash, the Speaker was infuriated at certain remarks made by DMK’s Dayanidhi Maran, who had trooped into the well shouting slogans against the govt. Birla dared Maran to repeat the same words on record from his seat, and action would be taken against him. Birla also urged the treasury benches to bring a motion against Maran’s remarks against the Chair. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju immediately rose to condemn Maran’s behaviour, and promised to bring a related motion.Pradhan said Centre was ready with the funds, but the state must sign an MoU by March 15 to implement NEP. He said Kanimozhi was aware that TN was ready to sign the MoU. “Let her be honest to people of Tamil Nadu that she only came to know today. Their higher education minister wrote to us. They are dishonest... It is unfortunate in democracy. They are trying to cover up their failure and doing politics,” he said.",Clash began after DMK MP claimed TN funds ‘diverted’ from PM-SHRI.

Dogs of war: Russian rumble makes Ukraine top arms buyer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dogs-of-war-russian-rumble-makes-ukraine-top-arms-buyer/articleshow/118865239.cms,"AP photo

With 43% share, UP top exporter

NEW DELHI: Ukraine has displaced India as the world’s largest arms importer in the 2020-24 timeframe, with its imports skyrocketing by nearly 100 times compared to 2015-19 due to its ongoing debilitating war with Russia.India notched up 8.3% of the global arms imports in 2020-24, driven largely by heightened tensions with China and Pakistan, while Ukraine stood at 8.8%, as per as per latest data on international arms transfers released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday.Overall, European arms imports grew by 155%, fueled by fears of Russia’s expansionism after invading Ukraine in Feb 2022 and the prevailing uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy under the new Trump administration.Pakistan’s arms import, incidentally, increased by 61% between 2015-19 and 2020-24. It was placed fifth in the world ranking, with 81% of its weapons coming from China, in yet another indicator of the ever-expanding military collusiveness between India’s two hostile neighbours.There was a small silver lining for India despite its strategically-vulnerable position of being a top arms importer, with SIPRI noting that its imports decreased by 9.3% between 2015-19 and 2020-24, partly due to New Delhi ’s increasing ability to design and produce its own weapons.The figures, however, do not account for deals where deliveries have not yet begun. This includes, for instance, the mega $3.3 billion contract with the US govt for 31 weaponized MQ-9B `Predator’ drones, along with another $520 million contract with manufacturer General Atomics to set up an MRO facility in India, inked last Oct.Russia remains India’s main weapons supplier, accounting for 36% of its arms imports. Russia’s share, however, has steadily declined from 72% in 2010-14 and 55% in 2015-19 because India has increasingly turned to the US, France and Israel. Russian arms exports, in fact, have fallen sharply by 64% in the latest five-year period, with China too relying mainly on its own military-industrial complex.Despite recent declarations from India and Russia that their defence ties remain as robust as ever, SIPR said, “The shift is visible in India’s new and planned orders for major arms, most of which will come from Western suppliers.”France accounts for 33% of India’s imports, with Israel placed third with 13%. India, of course, is getting set to ink two mega deals with France for direct acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters as well as the construction of three additional Scorpene submarines by Mazagon Docks, collectively worth around Euro 10.6 billion (almost Rs 1 lakh crore). India, incidentally, is the biggest arms customer of France, Russia and Israel.The fourth largest military spender after the US, China and Russia, India needs to single-mindedly pursue cutting-edge defence R&D, expand its defence-industrial base and streamline procurement procedures to ensure it gets the biggest bang for its buck.While DRDO, defence PSUs, shipyards and ordnance factories should become much more dynamic instead of wallowing in time and cost overruns, the domestic private sector and foreign armament majors must be further encouraged to enter defence production here in a much bigger way.Not a single “Make in India” project, for instance, has taken off till now under the much-touted strategic partnership model promulgated in May 2017 to boost indigenous defence production through tie-ups with foreign companies for “deep and extensive” technology transfers.","India notched up 8.3% of the global arms imports in 2020-24, driven largely by heightened tensions with China and Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Amid the “frontal attack” by US President Donald Trump, RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) Monday asked govt to ensure that interests of farmers and small businesses are protected during negotiations for bilateral trade deals, including with US.In a statement SJM said at the time of setting up World Trade Organisation, developed countries had agreed to allow developing nations to impose higher tariffs in return for including agriculture, services, investment and intellectual property on agenda and described the US as the biggest beneficiary of multilateral system.It advocated bilateral deals over multilateral agreements.“In view of a frontal attack of US on our exports, on an illegitimate argument that India imposes higher tariffs, and likely increase in tariffs by them, once again underlines the importance of Swadeshi. National Council of Swadeshi Jagran Manch strongly suggests that Bharat should enhance its foreign trade with bilateral trade agreements rather than multilateral trade agreements.However, while entering into bilateral trade agreements with US and other countries, national interests should be protected, especially our farmers & small entrepreneurs,” it said while slamming Trump’s stand on trade.","RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch asks govt to ensure that interests of farmers and small businesses are protected during negotiations for bilateral trade deals.

"Maharashtra budget today: Amid rising debt and fiscal deficit, hike in Ladki Bahin stipend unlikely",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/budget-challenge-how-to-balance-debt-welfare/articleshow/118824155.cms,"The Mahayuti government, facing its first budget since taking power, must balance its extensive debt and fiscal deficit with the continuation of welfare programs.



Stay updated with the latest city news, weather, and Air Quality Index (AQI) updates for major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Noida, and Bengaluru on Times of India.



MUMBAI: As the Mahayuti govt faces its first budget after the assembly polls after coming to power, it will have to walk the tightrope between controlling its massive debt and fiscal deficit while continuing its welfare schemes, with polls to local bodies including municipal corporations and gram panchayats due this year.The govt could focus on keeping its welfare schemes going while scrutinising and trimming beneficiaries as it has done with its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana. It's already apparent that chances of hiking the Ladki Bahin stipend from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,100 per month as promised in the Mahayuti poll manifesto will be unlikely in this budget.With chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announcing a rise in the state's outlay under the Namo Shetkari Samman Nidhi for farmers from Rs 6,000 to Rs 9,000 per year, it's possible that the budget will account for this.The state's debt projection for 2024-25 was already Rs 7.8 lakh crore. Before the polls, it had introduced welfare schemes worth a steep Rs 96,000 crore including the Ladki Bahin Yojana which helped power its electoral victory. Since then, the state has introduced supplementary budgetary demands for additional expenses outside the budget worth Rs 1.37 lakh crore, the highest ever in Maharashtra.At Rs 1.1 lakh crores by July, the state's fiscal deficit had spiralled upwards. By Oct 2024, the state's finance department had warned that the fiscal deficit was estimated at Rs 2 lakh crore and would be impossible to fill. ""The fiscal deficit is beyond 3% of the state's GSDP and will not be possible to fill,"" the department had warned.Senior officials say the state will try and bring the fiscal deficit down to 3% of the GSDP, which is required by budgetary management norms. Fadnavis told TOI in the past that the state will not cut welfare or infrastructure spending but will focus on increasing revenue (TOI, Feb 13). However, the global slowdown will be a challenge to revenue generation. Fadnavis had said the state would focus on raising finances, including through borrowings, monetisation schemes and also through annuity schemes or build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes for infrastructure projects.","Mahayuti govt must balance its extensive debt and fiscal deficit with the continuation of welfare programs.

NEW DELHI: Nearly 300 Indian nationals returned home via Thailand on Monday after being freed from scam centers in Myanmar, as reported by AFP. A crackdown on these illegal online fraud hubs, largely run by Chinese operators, has led to the release of around 7,000 workers from over two dozen countries.Many of the freed individuals, mostly Chinese, remain stranded in poor conditions near the Myanmar-Thai border. Indian officials escorted seven buses carrying 266 men and 17 women—along with three additional buses transporting their luggage—to Thailand’s Mae Sot airport.The government deployed a C-17 transport aircraft to bring them back, with another 257 nationals set to be repatriated the following day.China, which has already repatriated over 2,000 of its citizens, continues efforts to dismantle these scam operations that thrive in Myanmar’s lawless border regions. These centers, part of a billion-dollar industry, exploit foreign workers for online fraud, including romance and investment scams. Many workers report being lured into these jobs under false pretenses and subjected to abuse.China has treated its repatriated nationals as criminal suspects, placing them in handcuffs upon arrival.","Nearly 300 Indian nationals returned home via Thailand on Monday after being freed from scam centers in Myanmar.

Vanuatu PM drops the hammer

Interpol rejection raises eyebrows

NEW DELHI: Just hours after Vanuatu Prime Minister Jotham Napat ordered the cancellation of Lalit Modi’s passport, the former IPL chief shared breathtaking pictures of the island nation, calling it a “heavenly country” and urging people to visit.""Vanuatu is a beautiful country. You must put it on your bucket list. Away from all the pollution and noise. Truly heavenly country,” Modi wrote, seemingly unfazed by the storm brewing over his citizenship.Earlier today, PM Napat directed the Citizenship Commission to revoke Modi’s passport, citing concerns that the fugitive ex-cricket administrator was attempting to dodge extradition.Also read: 'Attempting to avoid extradition': Vanuatu PM orders cancellation of Lalit Modi's passport Modi, who fled India in 2010 and has been living in London, had filed an application on March 7 with the Indian High Commission in London to surrender his Indian passport.

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Sunday sought a report on the fashion show in the ski resort of Gulmarg during the fasting month of Ramzan that received widespread criticism.Expressing disapproval to the pictures, the CM said that the images he had seen showed a complete disregard for local sensitivities.Responding to the post of Kashmir's chief priest Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who called the fashion show ""obscene,"" Omar Abdullah said, ""The shock & anger are totally understandable. The images I have seen show a complete disregard for local sensitivities & that too during this holy month. My office has been in touch with the local authorities & I’ve asked for a report to be submitted within the next 24 hours. Further action, as appropriate, will follow from this report.""The mirwaiz expressed his views on X, stating: ""Outrageous! That in the holy month of Ramzan an obscene fashion show is organised in #Gulmarg, pictures and videos from which have gone viral sparking shock and anger among people. How could it be tolerated in the valley known for its Sufi, saint culture and the deeply religious outlook of its people?""He demanded accountability from the event organisers.""Those involved should be immediately held accountable. Such obscenity in the name of tourism promotion will not be tolerated in #Kashmir!"" the mirwaiz added.Social activist Raja Muzaffar Bhat criticised the event on X, questioning the authorities: ""Who allowed this nude fashion show at Gulmarg in Holy Ramzan?

Why are you hell bound to demolish our moral, ethical, cultural and religious values (sic)?""Elle India has pulled down a controversial reel showcasing a show of fashion from its Instagram following widespread public uproar.The show held under the open sky by ‘Shivan and Narresh’ at the ski resort of Gulmarg on Friday (March 7) to mark the 15th anniversary of the luxury brand.After the controversy, Shivan and Naresh appologised and said their sole intention was to celebrate creativity and the ski & après-ski lifestyle.""Respect for all cultures and traditions is at our heart, and we acknowledge the concerns raised.

Going off-patent

10.1cr Indians live with diabetes, most end up paying out of pocket

NEW DELHI: Several domestic drug companies are set to transform diabetes therapy by launching the blockbuster drug Empagliflozin at a fraction of the innovator’s price.Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin on March 11, industry sources told TOI.The launch of generic Empagliflozin , used to treat diabetes, related comorbidities, including heart failure, promises to slash therapy costs, making it more accessible to millions of diabetics and easing the financial strain of this debilitating disease. Those looking to launch the drug include Mankind Pharma , Torrent, Alkem, Dr Reddy’s and Lupin.Mankind Pharma, India’s fourth-largest firm by market share, plans to offer Empagliflozin at one-tenth the innovator’s Rs 60 per tablet, sources said.Most generic versions will cost Rs 9-14 per tablet, disrupting the high-growth diabetes therapy market valued at nearly Rs 20,000 crore, up 43% from Rs 14,000 crore in 2021.The market was further bolstered by Torrent Pharmaceuticals’ acquisition of three Empagliflozin brands from Boehringer Ingelheim last year. With India facing a staggering public health burden—10.1 crore people live with diabetes, according to International Diabetes Federation— this shift is critical.“This aligns with our philosophy of breaking cost barriers with a high-quality product (raw materials certified by regulators like the USFDA) at an affordable price. Using our own active pharmaceutical ingredient in bulk lowers costs, and we will deploy separate teams to promote two distinct brands, boosting distribution and market share,” said a Mankind Pharma executive.The market size of Empagliflozin and its combinations is estimated at Rs 640 crore. Experts highlight its ability to significantly reduce heart failure hospitalisations, slow chronic kidney disease progression and improve survival in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, though high pricing has long limited access.Metformin remains the first-line treatment for type-2 diabetes, but as the disease progresses, additional medications—such as Sulfonylureas (glimepiride, glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide), DPP-4 Inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin), and SGLT2 Inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin)—are added. Now, newer therapies like semaglutide and tirzepatide enhance management, offering improved glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits.The economic burden of diabetes weighs heavily in India, where most patients pay out-of-pocket due to limited medical reimbursement. Treatment costs escalate with complications, magnifying the challenge.","Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin.

Mark Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau as the Prime Minister of Canada, had promised to strengthen the damaged relationship with India if given the opportunity, in his run-up to the elections.On Sunday, the governing Liberal Party elected Carney as its leader amidst ongoing trade tensions with the US and an upcoming federal election. He secured an overwhelming victory with 85.9% of votes.During a recent media interaction in Calgary, Alberta, regarding US tariffs, Carney told cpac that he intented to expand trade partnerships with like-minded nations, highlighting India as a key opportunity.Responding to questions from the media in Calgary, Alberta, the 59-year old had said, “What Canada will be looking to do is to diversify our trading relationships with like-minded countries, and there are opportunities to rebuild the relationship with India.”“There needs to be a shared sense of values around that commercial relationship, and if I am Prime Minister, I look forward to the opportunity to build that,” he added.The diplomatic relationship between both nations deteriorated after Trudeau's September 18, 2023 statement in the House of Commons regarding 'credible allegations' connecting Indian agents to Hardeep Singh Nijjar's death in Surrey, British Columbia.Trudeau, who stepped down in January, continues as PM until the swearing-in ceremony.","Mark Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau as the Prime Minister of Canada, had promised to strengthen the damaged relationship with India if given the opportunity.

CAG-itated politics: How audit reports upend political fortunes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cag-itated-politics-how-audit-reports-upend-political-fortunes/articleshow/118809663.cms,"The scam that wasn't



'Conscience' shaking scam



Congress and CAG not meant for each other



NEW DELHI: Political parties and CAG reports have shared a hot and cold relationship in Indian politics over the decades. Interestingly, the two become quite inseparable when the elections approach. Delhi witnessed this recently when audit report of exorbitant spending on CM's official residence, injected into public consciousness as 'sheeshmahal' scam, was one of the key reasons that helped the Bharatiya Janata Party seal the fate of Aam Aadmi Party A simple look at the CAG website and the number of reports released in a year shows a drop by almost half, relatively during poll years, exception being 2014. This indicates how the ruling parties have done their best to keep the report away from the public glare, while the opposition has ensured it puts a spotlight on it.So, while several reports were used to shape the collective consciousness of the public towards parties like the Congress and the AAP, many other reports were carefully brushed under the carpet.Any discussion on CAG report and politics would perhaps be incomplete without a mention of the 2G scam and the coal block scam that played a key role in the downfall of Manmohan Singh-led UPA government in 2014.The 2G spectrum ""scam"" that led to the loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crores to the exchequer did not turn out to be a scam after the Supreme Court acquitted everyone.The apex court even pulled up the CBI saying that ""the prosecution miserably failed to prove any charge against any of the accused, made in its well choreographed chargesheet.""No matter the verdict, the ""scam"" did what it was supposed to -- put a final lock on the UPA government's fate -- paving way for the ""Modi wave"".The coal scam that led to the downfall of UPA government was much talked about. Referring to this, the NDA government last year dubbed it as the scam that ""shook the conscience of the nation in 2014"", with a loss of Rs 1.86 lakh crore to the exchequer.""These actions were scrutinised by investigation agencies, and in 2014, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India cancelled the allocation of 204 coal mines/blocks allocated since 1993,"" the central government said and rightly so.After BJP came to power in 2014, it had introduced a revamped coal auction and allocation system, facilitating the distribution of those 204 coal blocks. However, in doing so, it ignored warnings from its own leaders who said that it would lead to corruptions and scams.An investigation by The Reporters’ Collective revealed that the Union government had received early warnings in 2015 that its new coal auction system was vulnerable to corruption. However, no action was taken upon those warnings and the government went ahead with the new coal auction regime.And the two MPs were proved right.In 2016, a new CAG report on the e-auctions conducted in 2015 under the NDA government was released. It exposed irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks. The report documented instances of collusion and potential auction rigging by private firms, which secured coal blocks at prices that yielded suboptimal financial returns to the government.It found that the upfront payments made by successful bidders were undervalued by over Rs 382 crore, raising concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of the coal allocation system.Congress was quick to latch on to this and alleged that rules were tweaked to favour one of the leading businessmen from Gujarat, who they claim is close to the government. It also cited instances where it emerged as the sole bidder. However, this never left any impact on the people enough to upend BJP's fate in 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Two years ago, several CAG reports came out but missed the public eye. One of those was that of Dwarka expressway where the cost of construction reached Rs 250 crore per kilometer against the approved cost of Rs 18.2 crore.Further, anomalies were found in the Ayushman Bharat scheme where the payments were being made to the dead. In 7.5 lakh cases, the beneficiaries were found to be linked to the same mobile number which was invalid.Other irregularities included undue benefits in the Ayodhya Development Project, NHAI collecting Rs 132 crore in toll violations, HAL's faulty aircraft engine designs causing Rs 159 crore in losses, and misuse of pension funds by the rural development ministry for promotions, fraud in the Bharat Mala Project with costs doubling, which were used by the Congress, but remained limited to its website and X handles.Even though the timing was apt and the nature of scams were people-centric, an opportunity to create a '2G' was missed by the grand old party as it refused to leave its grand old ways of connecting with the masses. No Anna Hazare was created, no protests held, no Kejriwal raised slogans and hence, no corruption ever occurred.","CAG reports have a hot and cold relationship in Indian politics over the decades.

KANPUR: The phone rang in a small home in Goyera Mughli village of Banda in UP's Bundelkhand. It was February 15. A voice - familiar yet carrying the weight of impending finality - broke the silence. ""This is my last call,"" said Shahzadi Khan , 33.A hush fell over her family. Her brother Shamsher gripped the phone tighter. ""They asked me about my final wish,"" she said, further adding, ""I asked to speak to ammi and abbu.""Her mother gasped in the background, reaching for a daughter who was facing execution after being convicted of murdering a four-month-old child thousands of miles away in Abu Dhabi - too far to hold, too close to lose. And then, silence. Shahzadi was gone.""We did not hear from her afterward,"" Shamsher said Monday. They searched. They begged for news, combing through bureaucratic barriers, unanswered pleas. ""We filed a writ petition in Delhi high court, where we were informed Monday about her execution,"" the brother said.Executed on February 15 - the same day she made her last call. No one knew how. No one knew where her remains lay. Only that it was over. ""Her last rites will be held on March 5,"" additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said in court.She had left India in search of healing. ""Shahzadi had childhood burn scars on her face,"" said her brother. The scars had always made her self-conscious. ""She wanted to have them removed,"" Shamsher said. When a man named Uzair from Agra reached out on social media, promising help - a chance for plastic surgery in UAE - she dared to dream.She reached Abu Dhabi in Dec 2021 on a legal visa. Upon arrival, Uzair sent her to the home of his relative Faiz, where she was kept as a domestic worker. No surgery, no transformation - only labour and confinement in an unfamiliar world.In Aug 2022, Faiz's wife gave birth to a son and Shahzadi was assigned as the baby's caregiver. Four months later, on Dec 7, the child received routine vaccinations. By nightfall, he was gone.Fazi's grief turned to fury. Shahzadi was accused of killing the infant. She was handed over to Abu Dhabi police on Feb 10, 2023, and was sentenced to death on July 31. She remained in Al Wathba prison until her execution.Her father Shabbir Khan fought relentlessly, sending pleas to anyone who would listen - letters to the President, appeals to the PM. But the clock ran faster than justice. Shamsher demanded his sister's body for a dignified burial at their ancestral home and called for an independent probe, considering their FIR against Uzair for human trafficking ""Uzair deceived my sister with false promises, taking Rs 3 lakh in cash and jewellery from her while also collecting the same amount from his UAE relative to provide them with a maid,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: Kannada actress Harshavardhini Ranya, popularly known as Ranya Rao , has been sent to judicial custody till March 24 in connection with an alleged Rs 12 crore gold smuggling case .The development comes amid fierce political battle in Karnataka, with the ruling Congress and the opposition BJP exchanging accusations over alleged favoritism and cover-ups.The BJP has alleged that a prominent minister in chief minister Siddaramaiah’s government is shielding Ranya Rao, suggesting a deep-rooted nexus in the smuggling operation. Karnataka BJP president B Y Vijayendra , in a post on 'X', called it “one of the biggest gold heists in recent times,” blaming the Congress government for “churning out scandals in increasingly innovative ways.”Vijayendra further claimed that such large-scale smuggling could not have occurred without the involvement of influential figures within the government. He warned that any attempts to suppress the investigation would backfire, especially with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) stepping in.Meanwhile, the Congress has turned the tables on the BJP, revealing that the previous BJP government had allotted 12 acres of land in Sira, Tumakuru, to Ranya Rao’s company, Ksiroda India, for a steel plant in February 2023. Minister M B Patil shared official documents to back the claim, suggesting that the BJP, now raising questions, had granted land to the same individual they were accusing of a crime.State home minister G Parameshwara urged patience, stating that with both state and central agencies involved, the truth would emerge.

merits higher place in both society & academia: BJP

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin came down hard on Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday for calling DMK MPs “uncivilised”.Taking to X, Stalin said, “Dharmendra Pradhan, who thinks he is a king and speaks with arrogance, should mind his words. How can you call Tamil Nadu MPs uncivilised when you are the one who cheated Tamil Nadu by not releasing the funds?”DMK MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, too, expressed strong objection to Pradhan’s comments in LS, following which the Union minister said he would retract his words.During a heated Lok Sabha debate on three-language policy on Monday, Pradhan said DMK MPs were “undemocratic and uncivilised”. Condemning Pradhan’s remark, DMK cadres across Tamil Nadu set fire to Pradhan’s effigies. They raised slogans against the Union minister while beating his effigies with slippers.Referring to Pradhan’s remark, Stalin said Pradhan had insulted people of Tamil Nadu and demanded to know from PM Narendra Modi whether he approved of his minister’s speech.Recalling Pradhan’s letter dated Aug 30, 2024, Stalin said it was the minister who said TN entirely rejected the MoU sent by Union govt on NEP. “DMK functions on people’s wishes and not on directions from Nagpur (RSS headquarters),” said Stalin.Kanimozhi criticised Pradhan for his remarks. Taking to X, she said, “I strongly condemn Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan for his disgraceful remarks calling Tamil Nadu and its people uncivilised. On behalf of DMK and eight crore Tamilians, I demand an immediate apology!” The DMK MP further said, “His words deeply hurt and pained the people of Tamil Nadu. What right does he have to insult TN while happily taking its tax revenue, workforce, & contributions to the nation? BJP govt has no problem reaping benefits from Tamil Nadu, yet it repeatedly disrespects its people.

He urged TN govt to prioritise students’ interests over political considerations. “Just a few days are left before completion of this financial year; govt doesn’t have any issue in providing TN their allocation of PM SHRI but they are not interested in it,” he said, adding, “Those who don’t want to join PM SHRI programme, I appeal to them, it is a scheme for benefit of students, and in TN, the medium of instruction will remain Tamil only. What is their opposition, I do not understand?”Amid protests by DMK members in Lok Sabha over language provisions in National Education Policy , senior BJP MPs Monday staunchly defended promotion of Sanskrit in both academia and society, arguing that its status as one of the oldest languages merits greater recognition.BJP MP Dilip Saikia called for Sanskrit to be made compulsory in universities nationwide, while Nishikant Dubey dismissed DMK’s protests as “politically motivated and attempt to divide the country by inciting passions by opposing NEP and delimitation of parliamentary constituencies”.DMK is opposing NEP and delimitation out of fear of losing the Tamil Nadu assembly polls due next year, he said.“DMK is only inciting passions. Tamil is an ancient language but Sanskrit pre-dates Tamil. Go to any temple across country be it in Tamil-speaking, Telugu-speaking or Kannada-speaking regions — everywhere puja is performed in Sanskrit,” Dubey said.He said in 1973, Congress-led govt increased seats in MP and Bengal in delimitation of parliamentary seats but did not do so in Tamil Nadu. “Despite that, DMK is running govt in partnership with Congress. DMK wants to divide the country by inciting emotions,” Dubey said.",DMK cadres across Tamil Nadu set fire to Pradhan’s effigies.

NEW DELHI: After clogged lavatories affected yet another long haul flight, Air India Monday issued an unusual statement: “Urge passengers to use lavatories only for purposes they are meant for.” Air India found the passengers had flushed polythene bags, rags, and clothes that led to clogged pipes and overflowing toilets.“Our teams have previously also found objects such as blankets, innerwear, and diapers, among other waste, having been flushed down toilets on other flights,” Air India said.AI has long faced this issue, mostly with its old Boeing 777s, used for the North America long hauls. The most recent instance was on March 5 when a Chicago-Delhi flight had to return to US after eight of the 12 lavs on the B777 turned unserviceable.“We are aware of social media posts about the unserviceable lavatories on AI126 operating Chicago to Delhi on March 5, 2025, that caused the flight’s diversion back to its origin, Chicago… As part of our investigation, our teams found polythene bags, rags, and clothes that had been flushed down and stuck in the plumbing. This led the lavatories to become unserviceable,” Air India stated.The airline empathised with passengers who faced discomfort and whose plans were affected by the flight’s diversion, but said the flight departed in time. An hour and forty-five minutes into the flight, the crew reported eight of the 12 lavatories in the aircraft to be unserviceable.“By this time, the aircraft was overflying the Atlantic, leaving points in Europe as potential cities to divert to. However, due to restrictions on night operations at most of the European airports, it was decided to divert back to Chicago,” the airline stated, adding, “The decision to divert was taken entirely in the interest of passenger comfort and safety.”Upon landing at Chicago, all passengers were provided immediate assistance, including hotel accommodation and alternative flight options to continue their journey to Delhi.","Passengers had flushed polythene bags, rags, and clothes that led to clogged pipes and overflowing toilets.

Actor’s arrest in gold case sparks BJP-Congress slugfest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/actors-arrest-in-gold-case-sparks-bjp-congress-slugfest/articleshow/118863736.cms,"Ranya Rao

BENGALURU: Kannada actress Ranya Rao’s alleged involvement in the gold smuggling case has triggered a political slugfest in Karnataka with Congress and BJP trading charges of favouritism and cover-up. Harshavardhini Ranya alias Ranya Rao was arrested a week ago for allegedly smuggling gold worth Rs 12 crore from Dubai.While BJP alleged the involvement of an influential minister in shielding the actress, Congress countered the charge by accusing BJP of allotting 12 acres to Rao to set up a TMT steel bar factory. Karnataka minister M B Patil clarified that the land allotment did not materialise as Rao’s company failed to make the prescribed payment.In a post on ‘X’, BJP Karnataka chief B Y Vijayendra said, “Media reports about involvement of a prominent minister in Siddaramaiah’s govt in one of the biggest gold heists come as no surprise — especially given this govt’s track record of churning out scandals in increasingly “innovative” ways! (sic)” The MLA said the blatant violation of govt protocols that allegedly enabled Rao to smuggle gold could not have happened without support of influential figures within govt.The BJP state chief further added that if these reports were true, then it raised serious concerns about the extent of the alleged nexus.“Any attempt by govt to shield those responsible will backfire, especially with CBI now stepping in. The truth will come out, and any cover-up will only further expose the govt’s complicity in this grievous offence,” he said.State home minister G Parameshwara said probe was underway and with CBI also stepping in, the truth will come out. “Until the probe concludes, we cannot say anything. Neither me nor the govt can offer any such feedback,” the minister told reporters Monday.Minister for medium and large industries, M B Patil, hit back, saying that when BJP was in office, it allotted 12 acres land at Sira in Tumakuru to Ranya Rao’s firm in Feb 2023 to establish a steel plant.Regarding the land allotment, Vijayendra said, “It might have happened during BJP’s tenure. Let them probe. We are not stopping them.”On Monday, Patil’s office said the 12 acres of land sanctioned a company linked to actress Ranya Rao has not been officially allocated as the company failed to make the prescribed payment.",Kannada actress Ranya Rao’s alleged involvement in the gold smuggling case has triggered a political slugfest in Karnataka.

President appoints Justice Bagchi to Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/president-appoints-justice-bagchi-to-sc/articleshow/118863448.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: The President on Monday appointed Calcutta high court ’s Justice Joymalya Bagchi to Supreme Court. Justice Bagchi is scheduled to become the Chief Justice of India on May 26, 2031, the second from Calcutta HC to rise to the top post in 40 years.A short notification from the Union law and justice ministry read: “In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (2) of Article 124 of the Constitution of India , the President is pleased to appoint Justice Joymalya Bagchi, judge of the Calcutta HC, to be a judge of the Supreme Court of India with effect from the date he assumes charge of his office.”Justice Bagchi’s appointment came through within four days of the five-judge SC collegium recommending his name to the Union govt for appointment as a judge of the SC. Despite the appointment process getting completed swiftly by the govt, which normally takes months for appointment of HC judges, Justice Bagchi would be able to take oath only on March 17, when the apex court resumes business after the week-long break for Holi festivities.Prior to Justice Bagchi assuming the top post in the judiciary, Justice Altamas Kabir was the last one from Calcutta HC to have gone on to become the CJI. Justice Kabir, who was appointed as judge of the SC on Sept 9, 2005, became the CJI on Sept 29, 2012, and retired on July 19, 2013, a tenure of nearly 10 months. Before Justice Kabir, it was Justice Sabyasachi Mukherjee , who had become the CJI on Dec 18, 1989, but died on Sept 25, 1990.There is a long list of succession for the CJI post among present judges. After present CJI Sanjiv Khanna’s retirement on May 13, Justice Gavai would be the CJI till Nov 23. He will be succeeded by Justice Surya Kant, who will have a tenure of one year and three months.After Justice Kant, following would be in line to become CJIs — Justices Vikram Nath (tenure of over seven months), B V Nagarathna (37 days), P S Narasimha (over seven months), J B Pardiwala (two years and three months) , K V Viswanathan (over seven months). After Justice Pardiwala’s retirement as the CJI on Aug 11, 2030, Justice Viswanathan will be the CJI till May 25, 2031. He will be succeeded by Justice Bagchi, who would have a short tenure of little over four months, and retire on Oct 2, 2031.","Justice Bagchi is scheduled to become the Chief Justice of India on May 26, 2031.

It noted with concern how actual allocations for many central police forces like CRPF, BSF, etc in 2025-26 have fallen short of projections.Noting that such reductions may hit critical schemes and police modernisation programmes, it recommended home ministry talk to finance ministry to seek increased allocations at revised estimate stage.","A parliamentary committee has recommended that census may be completed at the earliest.

NEW DELHI: At a time when privacy violations in the age of internet and AI concerns many, Justice B R Gavai , the next in line to be CJI, on Monday said protection of personal data in the digital age was an integral part of right to privacy, which in turn was part of right to life.Addressing judges and advocates in the Kenyan Supreme Court, he said there was increasing conflict these days between right to free speech and expression, and reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2) of the Constitution. Justice Gavai is leading a delegation to Kenya that includes Justice Surya Kant.“Courts are increasingly being called upon to balance freedom of speech and expression with the need to curb misinformation and online harassment,” he said.In such a scenario, it was crucial for judiciaries in developing countries like India and Kenya to interpret and define the limits of digital rights , intermediary liability and governmental regulation of online platforms, he said.While hearing the Ranveer Allahbadia case recently, an SC bench led by Justice Kant had asked the Union govt to deliberate and devise the contours of free speech on social media and possible mechanisms to curb vulgarity, obscenity and attempts to belittle traditional norms of societal decency.“Judiciaries around the world will continue to grapple with complex legal questions surrounding privacy, surveillance, AI ethics , and the governance of emerging technologies,” Justice Gavai said.Reflecting on the promising results of technology infusion in the justice delivery system in India through e-Courts project piloted by the SC, he said, “Ensuring that technology serves as an enabler of justice while safeguarding constitutional rights will remain a key challenge in the years ahead.”While proposing closer interaction between judiciaries of the Global South, he said, “India and Kenya can take a lead in forming the Global South Judiciaries Association on Constitutionalism.”Drawing similarities between the two countries, Justice Gavai said, “Both India and Kenya have large populations that face barriers in accessing legal services. Joint initiatives could focus on strengthening legal aid mechanisms , setting up mobile courts in remote areas, increasing pro bono legal work, and leveraging technology to provide online legal aid services. A collaborative approach can ensure that legal aid schemes are efficiently implemented.”","Justice Gavai is leading a delegation to Kenya that includes Justice Surya Kant.

File report on need for Sambhal masjid whitewash: HC to ASI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/file-report-on-need-for-sambhal-masjid-whitewash-hc-to-asi/articleshow/118862057.cms,"Allahabad high court

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court directed Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on Monday to file a specific reply on whether whitewashing, extra lighting and decorative lights were required outside the disputed Jama Masjid in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal.It directed ASI to file its reply in an affidavit within 24 hours, fixing March 12 as the next hearing date. This followed a plea by the mosque management committee for whitewashing, cleaning and lighting. The Mughal-era structure shot into national spotlight after four deaths in unrest on Nov 24, 2024 over a survey on a local court’s orders.On Monday, Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal directed that in case there was need for further examining the structure for whitewashing and other related works, ASI was free to send its team there. The court directed UP advocate-general Ajay Kumar Misra to seek a copy of an agreement alleged to have been executed between mutawallis (keepers) of Jama Masjid and the state on Jan 19, 1927. The agreement reportedly defines the roles of various agencies in the upkeep of the structure.Mosque committee senior advocate SFA Naqvi contended that ASI had not specified clearly that it was opposed to whitewashing along with extra lighting. No painting is required in the inner part of the site, Naqvi said.ASI’s counsel Manoj Kumar Singh pointed out though there was some flaking on the outer portion of the monument, a final call could only be taken after a proper survey by archaeologists and experts. Even so, there is no need for whitewashing, Singh argued. The HC then pointed out that this position was not clearly spelt out in ASI’s affidavits.","Allahabad high court directed Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to file a specific reply on whether whitewashing, extra lighting and decorative lights were required outside the disputed Jama Masjid.

NEW DELHI: Twelve years after being convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for allegedly burning his wife to death in Tamil Nadu, apex court has acquitted the man after noting that there was inconsistency in dying declarations of the deceased and also there was no other evidence to prove his culpability.A bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Ahsanuddin Amanullah said that conviction could not happen if there were major contradictions in the dying declaration of the deceased and there was no other substantial evidence against the accused.“If a dying declaration is surrounded by doubt or there are inconsistent dying declarations by the deceased, then courts must look for corroborative evidence to find out which dying declaration is to be believed. This will depend upon the facts of the case and courts are required to act cautiously in such cases. The matter at hand is one such case. In the present case, the deceased had given two statements which are totally different from her subsequent statements including the statement made before judicial magistrate, which has been considered a dying declaration based on which the appellant has been convicted,” the bench said.In this case, the deceased, in her first statement did not blame her husband and said she caught fire while cooking but later on told the magistrate that her husband had poured kerosene on her and set her on fire. After examining statements of other witnesses including the doctors who examined her, the court said there was no smell of kerosene emanating from her body when she was brought to the hospital and did not give credence to her dying declarations.“There is no doubt regarding the well settled position of law that a dying declaration is an important piece of evidence and a conviction can be made by relying solely on a dying declaration alone as it holds immense importance in criminal law. However, such reliance should be placed after ascertaining quality of the dying declaration and considering the facts of a case,” the bench said.",A bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Ahsanuddin Amanullah said that conviction could not happen if there were major contradictions in the dying declaration of the deceased.

A stone was thrown at an Enforcement Directorate (ED) vehicle as its team was leaving the residence of former Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Monday after conducting raids in connection with an alleged liquor scam. Officials said their vehicles were blocked by Congress supporters gathered outside Baghel’s home, and one vehicle’s windshield was hit by a stone. The agency is considering filing a police complaint regarding the incident.The ED carried out searches at 14 locations in Durg district, including the Bhilai premises of Baghel’s son Chaitanya Baghel and his alleged associate Laxmi Narayan Bansal alias Pappu Bansal. The searches, conducted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), began around 7 am with CRPF personnel providing security.Officials allegeED raids Chhattisgarh ex-CM Bhupesh Baghel’s son Chaitanya Baghel, others in liquor 'scam' probed that Chaitanya Baghel, who shares the Bhilai residence with his father, was a ""recipient"" of the proceeds of crime from the liquor scam.

He also questioned the legitimacy of the investigation, saying, ""I asked them for the ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report) number, but they said there was none. Then what is this investigation about?""As the raids unfolded, Congress leaders and workers staged protests outside Baghel’s residence, calling it a politically motivated move by the BJP-led central government. The party alleged that the raids were meant to distract from critical issues being raised in Parliament as the Budget session reconvened.The Enforcement Directorate has claimed that the alleged liquor scam in Chhattisgarh led to losses of over Rs 2,100 crore to the state exchequer. The agency has already arrested several individuals in the case, including former minister Kawasi Lakhma, businessman Anwar Dhebar (brother of Raipur Mayor Aijaz Dhebar), former IAS officer Anil Tuteja, and telecom service officer Arunpati Tripathi.The alleged scam took place between 2019 and 2022 when Chhattisgarh was under the Congress government led by Baghel. The ED has so far attached assets worth Rs 205 crore in the case.The Supreme Court had earlier quashed the ED’s first ECIR in this case, which was based on an Income Tax Department complaint. However, the agency later filed a fresh case after urging the Chhattisgarh Economic Offences Wing (EOW) and Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to register a new FIR based on material shared by the ED. The EOW/ACB filed this FIR on January 17 last year, shortly after the Congress lost the Chhattisgarh assembly elections to the BJP. The case names 70 individuals and companies, including former excise minister Kawasi Lakhma and former chief secretary Vivek Dhand.According to the ED, illegal liquor sales generated massive commissions that were allegedly distributed ""as per the directions from the highest political executives of the state.""With the ED’s actions intensifying, the investigation has further escalated political tensions in Chhattisgarh, setting the stage for a fresh confrontation between the Congress and the BJP-led Centre.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) conducted raids at 14 locations linked to the son of former Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel.

NEW DELHI: The first rear fuselage for the Tejas Mark-1A jet produced by the private sector was handed over to defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), which is struggling to produce the indigenous fighter, in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh in Bengaluru on Sunday.“This is a testimony to India’s progress towards Aatmanirbharta in defence and the govt’s commitment towards enhanced public-private partnership. HAL and the private sector are playing a key role in strengthening the armed forces with the latest platforms and technologies,” Singh said, in the presence of IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh. “HAL, through its integrated model and strategies, is not only bolstering India’s defence capabilities but also adding new dimensions to Indian defence manufacturing ,” Singh added.HAL had placed orders with various Indian private companies such as L&T, Alpha Tocol Engineering Services, Tata Advanced Systems Ltd, VEM Technologies and Lakshmi Mission Works for supplying major modules for the Tejas Mark-1A fighters.This comes even as the IAF chief has publicly lashed out at HAL in recent weeks.The IAF till now has got 38 of the first 40 Tejas Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010. The first “improved” Tejas Mark-1A jet, out of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021, is yet to be delivered. The order for another 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore is also in the pipeline. The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-404 engines by US firm General Electric is one of the main reasons for the delay in the Tejas fighters.The MoD, on its part, said HAL has already manufactured 12 rear fuselages for the Tejas Mark-1A fighters, which are on the aircraft in the manufacturing line. “With this supply, a major structure module produced by an Indian private partner will be integrated into the Mark-1A aircraft, enabling HAL to meet additional delivery commitments for the IAF from 2025-26 onwards,” an official said.","The first rear fuselage for the Tejas Mark-1A jet produced by the private sector was handed over to defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Sunday.

Travis Kelce’s romance with Taylor Swift appears to be molding not only his career and wardrobe but also his life

Love can change things, and for NFL super star Travis Kelce , his relationship with Taylor Swift seems to be influencing more than the way he plays and dresses. Over the winter, he did something remarkable beyond opulence by converting a $3.3 million Kansas City mansion into a space with a greater purpose.The 6,500-square-foot home now houses a refuge for homeless teenagers . Run by nonprofit Foster Love, the house gives homeless teens a much-needed stable environment and access to resources so they can get a new beginning.Love has the ability to change individuals, and for NFL player Travis Kelce, his romance with Taylor Swift appears to be molding not only his career and wardrobe but also his life. This year, he made a big leap toward making an enduring difference by turning a $3.3 million Kansas City estate into something much greater than an upscale residence—a sanctuary for homeless adolescents.Rather than being merely another luxury property, the six-bedroom, 6,500-square-foot home is currently a transitional living home run by the non-profit Foster Love. Intended to bring stability and support, the home boasts five bathrooms, a large kitchen, and welcoming outdoor areas, such as a garden, patio, and fire pit.Far from simply a cozy setting, it provides young individuals in need a place to reconstruct their lives and gain a sense of security. Speaking on the impact, the foundation stated, “The facility also includes a game room and study area, giving young residents a place to relax and focus on their future.”Kelce bought the property in January and formally donated it in March, but why did he do so? Some think Taylor Swift's altruistic power was involved. The pop icon is famous for giving back to charity with the money she makes, and her kindness has been well-documented.As recently as last year, Swift was in the news for awarding enormous bonuses to her Eras Tour staff and donating $250,000 to Operation Breakthrough, a Kansas City-based charity supported by Kelce for many years. Most recently, she gave to ten various organizations offering relief to the victims of the Los Angeles wildfires. Given her long history of giving back, it wouldn't be surprising if Swift's dedication to philanthropy urged Kelce to make a positive impact in his own manner.Kelce and Swift's generosity is commendable, but the ethics of hoarding such wealth are questioned. Swift's net worth of $1.6 billion raises questions about the system, as it takes the average American over 16,000 years to reach $1 billion. It raises questions about the broken system that allows a pop star to achieve such wealth in just over a decade.Also Read: “A hot date night in NYC”: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce spotted together for the first time since Super Bowl LVIII Swift and Kelce's charitable actions demonstrate that wealth can be used for good, benefiting vulnerable youth in Kansas City.

MUMBAI: Mahayuti government’s populist pre-poll sops last July had left the state saddled with a massive debt. On Monday, it tabled its first Budget after its landslide win in the assembly polls. It reveals that the state faces the highest debt projection in its history at Rs 9.3 lakh crore and the steepest revenue deficit (gap between income and expenditure) at an estimated Rs 45,891 crores for 25-26.With little financial elbow room, the Budget does not offer new big-ticket schemes. Promises in Mahayuti poll manifesto, including a hike in stipend of its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,100 per month and a farm loan waiver, have been kept aside for another day. Instead, the Budget has focused on keeping existing schemes going and in trying to keep its debt and fiscal deficit within prescribed limits.Indeed, the estimated outlay for the Ladki Bahin scheme, whose beneficiaries are being scrutinised and trimmed, is Rs 10,000 crore lower than last year. The estimated allocation is Rs 36,000 crore for Rs 2025-26.With local body polls looming, the Budget has hiked the district annual plan by 11% from Rs 18,165 crore to an estimated Rs 20,165 crore. In a gesture towards social justice, it has hiked the proposed scheduled caste component of the annual plan by 42% and the tribal component by an estimated 40%. It proposes new taxes, mainly related to motor vehicles, which are expected to generate revenue of Rs 1,125 crore. It has also hiked stamp duty on certain transactions.The financial strain is apparent in the figures. The debt projection is Rs 2 lakh crore, higher than it was in 2024-25 when the figure was Rs 7.1 lakh crore. It is almost thrice as high as it was a decade ago. Its revenue deficit – the gap between the state’s income and expenditure — is more than twice the estimate last year, which was Rs 20,051 crore.However, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who controls the finance portfolio, emphasised that the debt and fiscal deficit were within fiscal limits.The state’s fiscal deficit is estimated at 2.76% of its GSDP. Also, the estimated debt is 18.7% of GSDP while the prescribed limit is 25%.The infrastructure projects are mainly ongoing projects for which no fresh outlay has been mentioned.","Mahayuti government’s populist pre-poll sops last July had left the state saddled with a massive debt.

Will Michelle speak about 'divorce'?



Former first lady Michelle Obama will host a new weekly podcast series starting this month -- with her brother Craig Robinson which will have a special guest every episode from the world of entertainment, sports, health and business. Names of some of the guests have already been revealed. Actors Issa Rae and Keke Palmer and psychologist Dr Orna Guralnik, filmmakers Seth and Lauren Rogan; soccer star Abby Wambach; authors Jay Shetty, Glennon Doyle and Logan Ury; editor Elaine Welteroth; radio personality Angie Martinez; media mogul Tyler Perry; actor Tracee Ellis Ross; husband-and-wife athlete and actor Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union; and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky are lined up, a press release said.“IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson” will address “everyday questions shaping our lives, relationships and the world around us,” according to the press release. IMO stands for “in my opinion.”The first two episodes — the first is an introductory one and the second features Rae — will premiere on March 12. New episodes will be released weekly and will be available on all audio platforms and YouTube.The news of the new podcast came as Michelle Obama has been missing in action for long and Barack Obama has been spotted solo at least on three occasions. As the scenario led to divorce rumors and rumors of Barack Obama's affair with Jennifer Anniston, the Obamas kept on posting sweet posts for each other on birthdays, and Valentine's Day but were not seen together.In the first two episodes, as reviewed by the New York Times, Michelle Obama spoke about divorce -- his brother's divorce from his first wife Janis Robinson that took place in 2000. Craig is the executive director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches.NYT reported that the brother-sister duo also discussed Michelle's marriage with Obama in the first two episodes and Michelle's relationship with politics. And politics is not something the podcast will serve owing to Michelle's strong aversion to it. Michelle and Robinson talked about their tough upbringing in Chacogo where they shared a room in a small apartment.","Former first lady Michelle Obama will host a new weekly podcast series starting this month with her brother Craig Robinson.
