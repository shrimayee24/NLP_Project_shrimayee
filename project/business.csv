PM Modi's LiFE mission to combat climate change , digital inclusion, and financial inclusion of marginalised communities are also key focus areas.

India plans to share achievements, including women-led development and digital infrastructure like UPI, with Brics members.

Kumar emphasised, ""India is a founding member of Brics and is committed to economic cooperation within the framework of Brics, which was a very foundational principle.""

During his two-day visit, PM Modi will participate in the Brics summit and hold bilateral meetings, including one with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Cultural cooperation remains a key aspect of India-Russia relations , with Kumar mentioning the popularity of Indian films and cultural exchanges. The announcement of an Indian consulate in Kazan aims to enhance this cooperation further.

Areas Of Strategic Value

On Boil Since

2020 Clashes

A Wide-Ranging Dispute

After long negotiations, India and China have finally agreed to return to the patrolling arrangements along the LAC in eastern Ladakh that were in place before the Galwan clashes in 2020. The agreement covers the areas of Depsang and Demchok.External affairs minister S Jaishankar had recently said that about 75 per cent of “disengagement problems” with China had been sorted out and that the key issue was the increasing militarisation of the frontier .“Now, those negotiations are going on. We made some progress... We still have some things to do,” he had said.Following the foreign ministry’s announcement, EAM Jaishankar said the two countries had “gone back to where the situation was in 2020”. “We can say that the disengagement process with China has been completed... There are areas which for various reasons after 2020 because they had blocked us so we had blocked them. So what has happened is we have reached an understanding, which will allow the patrolling,” he said.There was no specific mention of the withdrawal of tens of thousands of additional troops stationed by the two countries along the border in Ladakh and there was neither any statement from Beijing on the matter.Demchok is close to the southernmost part of the LAC in Ladakh (see map), near the state border with Himachal Pradesh. A village in the region was the site of a Chinese incursion during the 1962 conflict but PLA troops did not venture beyond. It was the first place where China prevented Indian authorities from building civic infrastructure, including a road.Depsang Plains is a flat area near Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) in the northwest portion of the disputed Aksai Chin region in UT Ladakh. The disputed area had been occupied by China until India began making headway into the region and now has a road leading to it. Because of the flat terrain, it allows for easy movement of troops and vehicles, including tanks.Galwan Valley , where Shyok and Galwan rivers meet, was the site of clashes in 1962 and is a key strategic area. India’s Darbuk-Shyok-DBO (DSDBO) road, which leads to DBO — a military base with an airstrip — passes near the valley. For China, the Galwan region provides a vantage point overlooking the road to DBO.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said on Monday the agreement was thrashed out by Indian and Chinese negotiators after weeks of talks aimed at resolving the issues that arose after the Chinese military’s action in eastern Ladakh in 2020.Indian and Chinese troops first clashed on May 5, 2020, on the north bank of the Pangong Tso lake. There was a major clash on the night of June 15 between an Indian patrol and PLA troops in Galwan Valley with casualties on both sides.Amid claims and counter-claims regarding the capture of Indian territory in May and June 2020, there were satellite images showing China constructing bunkers and trenches and setting up tents along Pangong Tso lake. It even reportedly built a pier on the lake for boats. After the 2020 clashes, China aggressively built up its presence along the LAC in Ladakh, including by bringing in troops and armoured vehicles.LAC came into existence following the 1962 Sino-Indian war. But it is not properly demarcated and has been the focus of a long-standing dispute between the two neighbours, involving areas stretching from Arunachal in the east to Ladakh in the north.LAC divides the areas of physical control rather than territorial claims. According to India, the de facto border is 3,488km long, but China says it is considerably shorter. Beijing claims about 90,000sqkm of India’s territory in the northeast, including in Arunachal, while New Delhi says 38,000sqkm of land in China-occupied Aksai Chin should be part of Ladakh.The 2020 clashes led to a troop build-up by both India and China, but they have since withdrawn forces from some areas on the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso lake, Gogra and Galwan Valley.","Indian and Chinese troops first clashed on May 5, 2020, on the north bank of the Pangong Tso lake.

DEHRADUN: A traders’ body that had issued a resolution asking 15 Muslim families to leave Khansar town in Chamoli by December 31 backtracked on its stance on Monday soon after All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi condemned the move and sought answers from the Uttarakhand government.Around 15 Muslim families are living in Maithan’s market area, some of whom have been there for over 30 years.These families, many of whom work as muleteers, masons, and daily wage labourers, had reportedly not faced any issues until recently.In a post on a social media platform, Owaisi criticised the resolution, saying, “Members of the community are being treated as untouchables in India,” and directly asked the state authorities to respond. On Monday, Khansar’s Vyapar Mandal Maithan representatives were summoned to the Gairsain police station to discuss the issue. After the meeting, the association claimed they were not targeting any specific religion or caste.Vikram Singh Negi, the association’s president, said, “Our message was meant for those who have been living here without proper police verification or under false identities. The deadline was for them to complete their verification, as well as for landlords to ensure that their tenants’ details were verified.”Negi also said the resolution had been “misinterpreted.” He added, “We have lived here in peace and harmony for years. Our aim is to maintain that harmony and avoid any unfortunate incidents in the future.”Chamoli SP Sarvesh Panwar told TOI, “When we summoned the traders’ representatives, they denied targeting any specific community. We have made it clear that no one will be allowed to take the law into their own hands and disturb the peace.”",Traders' body had issued a resolution asking 15 Muslim families to leave Khansar town in Chamoli by December 31.

More than a thousand kilometres away, his bride Andleep Zahra also radiated in a red sharara paired with shimmering jewellery.The only thing amiss was the quintessential pomp and show of the nikah ceremony.Amid strained relations between India and Pakistan, the elder son of Tahseen Shahid, a BJP corporator from Jaunpur , married a resident of Lahore in an online nikah following visa delay. In yet another example of cross-border love , Shahid had fixed the marriage of his son, employed with an Indian e-commerce company, with his elder sister's daughter, a professor with a private university in Lahore. Despite applying for visa, Haider was heartbroken as he couldn't obtain it due to the diplomatic deep freeze between the two nations.The situation turned worse for the families when Zahra's mother, Rana Yasmin Zaidi, was admitted to the ICU of a Pakistan hospital following health concerns. Left with no choice, Shahid had to conduct the ceremony online at an imambara on Oct 18. Shia religious leader Maulana Mahfoozul Hasan Khan officiated the nikah, with the bride present in Lahore saying ""Qubool Hai"" in a virtual ceremony. Both the families exchanged pleasantries through video conferencing. An LED screen with a laptop was also installed at the venue.Maulana Mahfoozul Hasan Khan said virtual nikah is only possible when maulanas from both sides are able to conduct the ceremony together. Just like a traditional nikah, the woman's consent is also essential for online ceremony.Talking to TOI over phone, Shahid said: ""My ‘phuphu' (paternal aunty's husband) shifted to Lahore during the Partition. In 1986, my elder sister got married to his son. To take the relation forward, I decided to marry my elder son to Zahra.""Talking about the hostile relations between the two countries and no signs of a thaw in the strained ties, he said: ""Our personal relations should not come in the way of cross-border tension.""He said: ""By applying for a visa with the Indian nikahnama, we hope to facilitate the process.... Allah is benevolent… We pray that my ‘bahu' gets her Indian visa without any hassle.""The groom said, ""We will request the government to offer a hassle-free visa process. This will not only help people like us but also boost the tourism of both the countries.""BJP MLC Brijesh Singh Prishu and other guests attended the wedding ceremony and congratulated the groom's family.","The elder son of Tahseen Shahid, a BJP corporator from Jaunpur, married a resident of Lahore in an online nikah.

Uttarakhand UCC: Live-in relationship registration mandatory within one month of implementation in Uttarakhand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/uniform-civil-code-ucc-live-in-relationship-registration-mandatory-within-one-month-of-implementation-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/114394251.cms,"CM Pushkar Singh Dhami

Key points:

DEHRADUN: The Uniform Civil Code ( UCC ), expected to be implemented on November 9, the state foundation day, this year, includes provisions that make it mandatory for couples to register their marriages within a six-month time span. A month's time has been given to live-in couples to register themselves from the time the law comes into existence in the Himalayan state.A source, on the condition of anonymity, confirmed to TOI, “It would be mandatory for couples to get their live-in relationship registered within one month of notification, or they would face punishment as per the provisions. Besides, the proposed law also suggests the role of landlords and house owners who are renting their property to such couples. If they deliberately hide facts, action may be initiated against them too.”The UCC also suggests action against those who either delay the registration, provide false information, or do not register their live-in relationship.The law mentions, “Whoever stays in a live-in relationship for more than one month from the date of entering into such a relationship without submitting the statement of such relationship shall be punished on conviction by a Judicial Magistrate with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months or with a fine not exceeding Rs 10,000 or with both.”Similarly, false information can draw imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months, or with a fine not exceeding Rs 25,000, or with both. In instances where a couple fails to provide information, there is a provision of a jail term which may extend to six months or with a fine not exceeding Rs 25,000, or with both.Any child of a live-in relationship shall be a legitimate child of the couple, and in case a woman is deserted, she can seek maintenance. While the secrecy of live-in couples would be maintained, authorities would inform the parents of such couples who are in the age bracket of 18 to 21 years.Similarly, couples not registering their marriage within six months of the UCC notification would not be eligible for the benefits of govt schemes. Even those who have already registered their marriages in other states would be required to update their record in Uttarakhand too. “It is a simple process which can be easily done through the mobile app developed by the authorities. One will not have to take circles of govt offices to get themselves registered,” he added.Besides, the report submitted to the CM suggests that parents would also get a share in the movable and immovable property of their children in case of death.“The panel received thousands of suggestions, in which elderly people claimed that after the death of their son, the entire property went to their daughter-in-law, and they were left alone in villages. The problem is profound in Uttarakhand as youngsters of the hills migrate to cities and other states in search of jobs. Thousands of such parents raised this issue before the panel. Now the panel has suggested property rights to parents as well in such cases,” the source said, adding, “In case of the death of an earning son, his wife, two children, and parents would be regarded as different units. Therefore, the movable and immovable assets would be divided into four parts. The move has been initiated under the UCC to ensure that the parents are not left ignored.”The will-making process has been made simple and easier through a mobile app. “The process has been made so simple that a person can make changes easily at any time while using the mobile app. However, all these matters are being scrutinised by the state legal department , and they can make the required changes,” he added.The panel, headed by Shatrughan Singh, already handed over its report to CM Pushkar Singh Dhami on October 18, and it has been forwarded to the legal department for scrutiny. The next step would be the training of govt officials and employees, and following the cabinet approval, the law would be notified in the state. The UCC Bill was tabled in the state assembly on February 6 and passed on February 7. Governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (Retd) gave his nod on February 28, and President Droupadi Murmu gave her approval on March 11.1. All marriages need to be registered within six month of UCC notification2. Live-in relationships to be registered within one month3. Responsibility on house owners, landlords also to inform authorities about tenants in live-in relationship4. In case of death of earning child, parents also to get share in property5.

Son’s IAS dream shattered in Kashmir; Karva Chauth turns to mourning in Jammu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sons-ias-dream-shattered-in-kashmir-karva-chauth-turns-to-mourning-in-jammu/articleshow/114437131.cms,"Photo/Agencies

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: Amid grief and disbelief, two families — one from Kashmir ’s Budgam district and the other from Jammu — find themselves bound by an unimaginable tragedy. What was meant to be a festive time of Karva Chauth for architectural designer Shashi Bhushan Abrol’s wife and children, and a hopeful return to routine life for Dr Shahnawaz Ahmed Dar’s family, has now become a period of mourning and shattered dreams.Sunday’s terrorist attack in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district robbed them of their loved ones, plunging moments of joy into an abyss of sorrow. Abrol and Dar were employees of construction company APCO Infratech and among the seven killed at the Z-Morh tunnel campsite on the Srinagar-Leh highway.In Naidgam village of Budgam, the air was heavy with grief as 52-year-old Dar was laid to rest in his ancestral graveyard Monday. His family — his mother, wife, and three children — remained stunned by the loss. “My son, where have you gone?” wailed his mother.One of the most heartbreaking moments came from his teenage son Mohsin Dar, who revealed how his father had been his greatest supporter. “I wanted to become an IAS officer , and he had promised to help me fulfill this dream. Now that dream is gone,” he said.The timing of the physician’s death added another layer of heartbreak — just days earlier, he had celebrated the wedding of his daughter. He had been scheduled to return home to Budgam to participate in after-wedding ceremonies, but fate had other plans.The loss has shaken the entire community. “Dr Sahib was a man of honour, a professional who served us with humility and faith,” said Ghulam Mohammad Dar, a local elder. “We were just celebrating his daughter’s wedding, and now we’re mourning his death.”The village condemned the attackers and called for justice. “This loss is not just personal; it is a blow to humanity,” said a resident. “The ones responsible must be brought to justice.”Over 300km away, the Abrol family in Jammu is grappling with the same nightmare. Shashi Abrol’s wife Ruchi had kept a Karva Chauth fast, praying for her husband’s long life. But instead of breaking her fast with a loving conversation, she received news of his death.Ruchi, her voice choked with grief, recounted her last conversation with her husband. “He called me in the evening, and everything seemed normal. I told him I would call again after finishing the temple rituals. But after that, his phone went silent.”It was only late that night — as Ruchi eagerly waited for a video call from her husband to break the fast — that the family learned of the tragedy through media reports. “We were all trying to comfort her, but we had no idea what had happened,” Ruchi’s sister-in-law Divya said.Married for 20 years, Shashi leaves behind his parents, wife, and two children.The family is left with not only their grief but also practical challenges. “Shashi was the sole breadwinner,” said his father Jagdish Raj Abrol. “His wife is a simple housewife. How will she raise the children alone?”Divya said Shashi’s dream was to see his son become an engineer. “He last came home two months ago to help with his son’s engineering college admission. His biggest hope was to see him succeed, but now everything is uncertain.”In the midst of their pain, the Abrol and Dar families shared the same plea: that those responsible for this tragedy be held accountable, and that the government extend support to help them rebuild wrecked lives. Still, they know no amount of justice can replace the fathers, sons, and husbands they lost — men whose love, dreams, and hopes for their families were stolen in a moment of senseless violence.","Shashi Bhushan Abrol and Dr Shahnawaz Ahmed Dar were among the seven killed at the Z-Morh tunnel campsite on the Srinagar-Leh highway.

Khar Gymkhana chief links ‘conversion’ row to managing committee polls later this month

Mumbai: Khar Gymkhana on Sunday terminated the playing membership of India women's team batter Jemimah Rodrigues following allegations that her father booked a club hall using her membership for religious activities. The decision was taken at an AGM on Sunday. Rodrigues, a Bandra resident who has played three Tests, 30 ODIs and 104 T20Is for India, became the first woman cricketer to be granted Khar Gymkhana membership in March 2023.Jemimah and her father Ivan were unavailable for comment.A managing committee member said Ivan, linked to an evangelical group called Brother Manuel Ministries , booked the banquet hall for over a year for ""meetings related to religious conversions"".Khar Gymkhana president Vivek Devnani denied the allegations and accused rivals of indulging in politics ahead of the club’s upcoming elections.Confirming that India batter Jemimah Rodrigues’ membership at Khar Gymkhana was terminated, Devnani said the honorary three-year membership was revoked after a resolution passed at a general body meeting. “A resolution validly passed at such a meeting will always be given effect since the will of our members will always reign supreme,” he said.However, he cautioned that a needless controversy was being created against Ivan and Jemimah as “Khar Gymkhana is scheduled to have its managing committee and trustee elections later this month. These allegations are being made with political motives. No evidence has been offered for any alleged wrongdoing. I would request and trust our wider body of members and the media to be cautious in relying on misrepresentations and falsehoods,” Devnani said.Club members making the allegations are equally firm. Shiv Malhotra, a managing committee member and former vice-president, said, “Though Jemimah was granted the membership, her father exploited this privilege by booking the banquet hall for meetings related to religious conversions. From March 2023 to Nov 2024, the hall was predominantly booked on weekends, preventing other members from securing reservations for their events. This misuse extended to providing discounted rates, and in some cases, security deposit was waived,” he said.He said this issue triggered a backlash from managing committee members. “The president was compelled to recover over Rs 3.5 lakh in arrears from Jemimah for 35 events. Rules of Khar Gymkhana explicitly prohibit use of its facilities for religious propagation,” he added. The action was taken following a motion moved by past president Nitin Gadekar, demanding accountability.“Following discussion, general body unanimously decided to revoke Jemimah’s honorary playing membership due to misuse of privileges extended to her by the club,” Malhotra said.Gadekar said, “How can our club president allow such a thing to happen without the managing committee being aware of any of this?” He said the president had waived the deposit to be paid when these events were booked in the name of Rodrigues. “I took it up at the AGM yesterday. Everyone agreed that while an inquiry must be initiated, Jemimah’s club membership must be terminated immediately,” he added.","India batter Jemimah Rodrigues’ membership at Khar Gymkhana was terminated.

NEW DELHI: The India-China agreement on troop "" patrolling arrangements "" along the LAC, which will lead to disengagement at the remaining major faceoffs at Depsang and Demchok in Ladakh, will begin to take concrete shape on the ground in seven to 10 days.This, however, represents just the first step towards restoring normalcy along LAC.""China should also agree on the subsequent long-drawn process of de-escalation and de-induction of forward deployed troops, which is imperative for the restoration of status quo that existed before April 2020,"" a defence and security establishment source told TOI.The new patrolling pact, in effect, means Chinese troops will stop actively blocking Indian soldiers at the 'Bottleneck' area in the strategically-located Depsang Plains , which is around 18km inside what India considers its own territory, and vice versa, the source said.

Similar disengagement will be carried out at Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok in the south,"" he added.There was no clarity on whether the planned pullback from the military standoff by a few kilometers will allow Indian troops ""full access"" to their traditional patrolling points (PPs) 10, 11, 11A, 12, and 13 in Depsang, which is towards the crucial Daulat Beg Oldie and Karakoram Pass in the north.With both sides having overlapping claims in the region, sources said ""patrolling will be done in all areas"", with the frequency being twice a month. ""The two sides will coordinate patrols and limit it to 15 soldiers each to avoid confrontations,"" said a source.China, incidentally, claims as much as 972 square km of territory in the Depsang region, which is near its critical Western Highway G-219 connecting Tibet to Xinjiang.The two armies had earlier created no-patrol buffer zones, varying from 3km to 10km largely on the Indian side of LAC, after troop disengagements at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, with the last taking place in Sept 2022. The buffer zones, which were supposed to be temporary arrangements, and the confrontation at Depsang and Demchok meant Indian troops could not access 26 of their 65 PPs in eastern Ladakh, which begin from the Karakoram Pass in the north and go down to Chumar in the south.There was also no response to queries on whether China agreed to the new patrolling pact in eastern Ladakh in lieu of India granting some concessions in Arunachal Pradesh. Defence ministry, on being contacted by TOI, refused to comment.After People's Liberation Army 's multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in 2020, China had forward-deployed over 50,000 troops and heavy weapon systems along LAC there. Beijing subsequently upped the ante in the eastern sector (Sikkim, Arunachal) of LAC by deploying another 90,000 soldiers there. ""China continues to maintain its forward deployed troops along LAC,"" another source said.","The India-China agreement on troop "" patrolling arrangements "" along the LAC will lead to disengagement at the remaining major faceoffs at Depsang and Demchok in Ladakh.

Canadian govt had whiff of 1985 Air India bombing plot that killed 329: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canadian-govt-had-whiff-of-1985-air-india-bombing-plot-that-killed-329-report/articleshow/114429608.cms,"File photo

What happened in 1985

A report published by the state-funded Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) claiming that Canada's security agency ""had a mole"" in the group that hatched the plan to bomb an Air India flight in 1985 is going viral on social media.The report published in 2003 claims that the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) ""pulled out the mole at the last minute so he wouldn't be implicated"".This fresh outpour of anger on social media over the 21-year-old report comes at a time when India-Canada bilateral relations have descended to its lowest.The strained relations between Ottawa and New Delhi went several notches lower after Canadian PM Justin Trudeau levelled unsubstantiated charges against Indian envoys, linking them to the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was also a Canadian citizen.The CBC, based on the document released by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) back then, had reported that Canada's CSIS set up a mole named Surjan Singh Gill who described himself as the consul-general of Khalistan The report mentions that Gill was ""involved right from the start and was directed by 'certain people' to stay involved and learn what was going on"".Later, the Canadian authority asked Gill to ""back out"" as he couldn't be seen to be a part of it.""They told him to get out of there. That things are happening and you can't be seen as part of that,"" Sgt. Jim Hunter told CBC.The Canadian state media's documents are based on transcripts of an interview conducted by the RCMP with Ajaib Singh Bagri, one of the accused in Air India bombings. Bagri was arrested in October 2000.Gill eventually left Canada to live in London. He was never charged in the bombing of Air India Flight 182, which took place in 1985, killing 329 people off the coast of Ireland, the CBC report claims.In the same report, it has been claimed that the CSIS destroyed ""hundreds of wiretaps relating to the Air India investigation"".This year in June, contradictory to the CBC report, Canadian law enforcement issued a statement assuring that the probe into the bombing of Air India flight 182, the Kanishka, by Khalistani terrorists, remains active and ongoing.The statement came as the tragedy marked its 39th memorial anniversary.On June 23, 1985, an Air India flight travelling from Canada to India via London exploded off the Irish coast, resulting in the deaths of all 329 passengers and crew on board.The explosion was caused by a bomb hidden in a suitcase that had been transferred onto the flight despite the ticket holder not boarding. Among the victims were 268 Canadian citizens, predominantly of Indian descent, and 24 Indian nationals. Only 131 bodies were recovered from the sea.","Report published in 2003 claims that the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) ""pulled out the mole at the last minute so he wouldn't be implicated"" This fresh outpour of anger on social media over the report comes at a time when India-Canada bilateral relations have descended to its lowest.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114431486,imgsize-296210,width-400,resizemode-4/114431486.jpg"

Jaishankar on Monday criticised certain western nations for struggling to adapt to the emerging multi-polar world order, where the Global South is gaining influence.Speaking at an NDTV summit, the minister specifically condemned Canada's "" double standards "" regarding the expectations placed on Indian diplomats in Canada compared to what Canadian diplomats can do on Indian soil.""Canada asked us to subject our High Commissioner to a police inquiry and we chose to withdraw the High Commissioner and diplomats. They seem to have a problem if Indian diplomats are even trying to make efforts to find out what is happening in Canada on matters which directly pertain to their welfare and security. But look what happens in India. Canadian diplomats have no problem going around collecting information on our military, police, profiling people, targeting people to be stopped in Canada. So apparently, the license that they give themselves is totally different from the kind of restrictions that they impose on diplomats in Canada,"" Jaishankar said, adding that the word ""double-standard is too mild"".""When we tell them you have people openly threatening leaders of India, diplomats of India. Their answer is freedom of speech. When Indian journalists make social media comments, if you threaten the Indian High Commissioner, he is supposed to accept it as freedom of speech. But if an Indian journalist says the Canadian High Commissioner walked out of South Block looking very grumpy, it is apparently foreign interference. There is this thing that we will do it differently at home. We will do it differently abroad. We will do it our way, but that doesn't apply to you. I think these are the larger adjustments which have to happen in this changing world,"" the EAM said.The reaction comes as Justin Trudeau 's government grapples with accusations of failing to provide substantial evidence that India was connected to the killing of Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar.In response to Trudeau's allegations, India has categorically denied any involvement in Nijjar's killing, labeling the claims as ""absurd"" and politically motivated.India also recently expelled 6 Canadian diplomats from New Delhi while recalling its High Commissioner and some diplomats from Ottawa.The external affairs ministry criticised Trudeau for his ""cavalier behavior"", which they said has damaged bilateral relations. The ministry also accused Canada of harboring extremist elements that threaten India's national security.","India's external affairs minister Dr. S.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday trashed a fresh attempt to equate ' Hindutva ' with fundamentalism by outrightly rejecting a PIL by a 65-year-old doctor seeking to get the term, which he claimed was inimical to secular fabric , replaced with 'Bhartiya Samvidhanatva '.This was the third challenge in SC to ""Hindutva"" since 1994 when the apex court, in Ismail Faruqi judgment, said, ""Ordinarily, Hindutva is understood as a way of life or state of mind and it is not to be equated with, or understood as religious Hindu fundamentalism.""On Monday, Dr S N Kundra came up with a different argument: ""The word 'Hinduism' leaves a lot of scope for its misuse by religious fundamentalists of a particular religion, and by those bent upon changing our secular Constitution to a theocratic Constitution (Manusmriti).Thus, inadvertently, SC's observations (that Hinduism is a way of life) are putting our Constitution at peril.""A bench headed by CJI D Y Chandrachud would have none of this and said, ""we will not entertain such petitions"". It even refused permission to the petitioner to place his case, saying the court has better work to do.Kundra had argued, ""Continuous efforts are made by religious fundamentalists of a particular religion, under garb of Hindutva to promote homogenised majority and cultural hegemony in India. Attempts are also made to make Hindutva a mark of nationalism and citizenship.""The petitioner who did not back up the charge with evidence, further said: ""The secular fabric of the nation is being greatly damaged by misusing the term 'Hindutva'. All activities blatantly promoting/propagating a particular religion, are carried out by those holding top constitutional posts using the term 'Hindutva' to throw sand in the eyes of people/media/legal observers"".SC in its Dec 1995 judgment in Ramesh Yeshwant Prabhoo case, had ruled that ""no precise meaning can be ascribed to the terms 'Hindu', 'Hindutva' and 'Hinduism'; and no meaning in the abstract can confine it to the narrow limits of religion alone, excluding the content of Indian culture and heritage. It is also indicated that the term 'Hindutva' or 'Hinduism' per se, in abstract, can be assumed to mean and be equated with narrow fundamentalist Hindu religious bigotry..."" The court had said the terms 'Hindutva' or 'Hinduism' per se cannot be construed to depict hostility, enmity or intolerance towards other religious faiths or professing communalism.In 2016, a 7-judge bench of SC refused to reconsider the 1995 judgment that defined 'Hinduism' as a way of life, rejecting a plea by social worker Teesta Setalvad for redefining the word 'Hindutva' and banning its use in elections.","Supreme Court rejects a PIL by a 65-year-old doctor seeking to get the term 'Hindutva' replaced with 'Bhartiya Samvidhanatva' Dr S N Kundra claimed the term was inimical to secular fabric.

NEW DELHI: Delhi HC Monday closed contempt proceedings against Wikipedia after the platform globally removed a page relating to court proceedings on a defamation suit filed against it.A bench of Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela disposed of a contempt plea filed by a news agency that claimed the page was not taken down despite a 36-hour deadline fixed by the court.During the hearing, HC took a grim view of Wikipedia's stand against disclosure of its users who allegedly made defamatory edits against the news agency on a page.It pointed out that the allegations made against the news agency were scandalous, and what made matters worse was that the agency had no legal remedy as the users who post on the platform remained anonymous. ""Nothing can be worse for a news organisation than being labelled a puppet of an intelligence agency, a stooge of the govt,"" the HC remarked, saying if left ""unrebutted, the credibility goes.""Even as Wikipedia's counsel tried to defend its refusal to disclose information on grounds that they would be targeted once the names are revealed, the court pointed out that the suit filed by the news agency cannot go ahead unless a disclosure is made so that it can serve them notices. It asked the counsel to explore with his client what steps can be taken where the user names are not leaked but can be shared confidentially with the news agency for the suit to carry on.HC was hearing an appeal filed by Wikipedia against a single judge's order on the news agency's defamation suit, which accuses Wikipedia of allowing the defamatory edits referring to the news agency as a ""propaganda tool"" for the government.",Delhi HC disposed of a contempt plea filed by a news agency that claimed the page was not taken down despite a 36-hour deadline.

CHANDIGARH/GURGAON: The new Haryana cabinet 's most experienced member, Anil Vij , lost out Monday on the two high-profile portfolios that he handled in his previous stint in govt as chief minister Nayab Singh Saini kept home for himself and allotted health to first-time MLA and Union minister Rao Inderjit's daughter Arti Singh Rao .Saini, a surprise pick by BJP to replace Manohar Lal Khattar last year but a convincing choice for his first full term as CM after leading the party to an emphatic win, also retained control of 13 departments that include finance, excise and taxation, and town planning.Veteran Vij was entrusted with the energy, transport, and labour portfolios. Panipat Rural MLA Mahipal Dhanda was named the new education minister, while the agriculture and farmers' welfare portfolio went to Shyam Singh Rana, the MLA from Radaur. South Haryana MLAs were allotted important portfolios like revenue, environment, forest, urban local bodies and industries.The region, which has remained a BJP fortress since 2014, has six ministers in the cabinet - three from NCR and one each from Palwal, Mahendergarh and Bhiwani.Badshapur MLA Rao Narbir Singh, who was PWD minister during ex-CM Khattar's first term, was appointed minister for industries and commerce, environment and forest.

CHENNAI: After Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu urged families to have more children, his Tamil Nadu counterpart, M K Stalin , toed a similar line, though not so stridently.Speaking at an event organised by Tamil Nadu’s Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR & CE) department in Chennai on Monday, Stalin questioned the need to restrict families to fewer children since states which effectively implement population control measures are penalised After Naidu, now Stalin bats for more children with fewer Lok Sabha constituencies.“People in olden days used to wish thus: ‘Pathinarum petru peru vazhvu vazhga (Beget sixteen gifts to live a full life).’ Today people wish to have fewer children and live happily,” said Stalin.“In the scenario of a reduction in Lok Sabha constituencies, however, a question arises on the need to restrict ourselves to few children. A situation has risen where we have to say let us also have 16 children,” Stalin said.The statement comes days after Chandrababu Naidu announced that Andhra Pradesh’s government is planning to incentivise families having more children due to the ageing population. He has urged people of south Indian states to have more children.The total fertility rate (TFR), or the number of children born to women between 15 and 49 years of age in Tamil Nadu, is 1.4, one of the lowest in the country, along with Delhi and West Bengal. Tamil Nadu’s population, which was 7.33 crore in 2013, is estimated to be 7.71 crore in 2024. It is expected to peak in 2031 at 7.8 crore and begin to decline thereafter.CMs of two prominent southern states calling for families to have more children come in the wake of reports that the BJP-led Union government is planning to realign constituencies based on population, which, if implemented, would give a decisive political advantage to north Indian states, which have larger populations, as they would get more Lok Sabha seats compared to southern states.","Stalin questioned the need to restrict families to fewer children.

However, Sunday’s terrorist attack on the camp office of the tunnel contractor has prompted government to raise security for the project.The tunnel, which will ensure all-weather connectivity between Srinagar and Sonamarg and further to Kargil, was scheduled to be opened next month.Following the attack, security agencies are now collecting details from highway-building entities to assess risk profile of projects in sensitive areas.The attack — first on a major infra project in J&K — is likely to have adverse impact on other big construction works in the region.“It’s a matter of concern for highway builders. We are committed to carry out infra projects, but government must provide adequate security to the men and machinery at these sites. Government should have a comprehensive security plan for all infra projects in J&K by deploying additional security force, conducting thorough risk assessments, and implementing contingency plans to safeguard workforce,” said a senior executive of National Highway Builders Federation .Meanwhile, an executive involved in the under-construction Zojila tunnel project on the same route said there has been no change in the SOPs and work was continuing smoothly.Once completed, Z-Morh and Zojila tunnels will ensure round-the-year travel from Srinagar to Leh and close to China border, which is crucial for the region’s economic development and for strategic reasons, including faster movement of defence forces and big artillery. Work in progress of Zojila tunnel is little over 50%, sources said.The foundation stone for Z-Morh tunnel was laid in Oct 2012. The project has been delayed several times, including stalemate after IL&FS went bankrupt. In 2020, the remaining work was awarded to APCO Amarnathji Tunnelway to be built at a cost of Rs 2,379 crore in Jan 2020. The two-lane bi-directional tunnel with an escape has been designed to handle around 1,000 vehicles per hour.

NEW DELHI: Concerned that Sunday’s terror attack targeting employees of an infrastructure project in Jammu & Kashmir’s Ganderbal may affect the confidence level of major infrastructure companies executing projects in the UT, LG Manoj Sinha on Monday ordered beefing up of security forces’ presence in residential areas of employees and workers engaged in ongoing projects.Sinha also instructed setting up police nakas on access roads. He instructed the security forces to step up counter-terror operations in the vicinity of infra projects and neutralise all the terrorists who may be active there.Sources in security establishment told TOI that while The Resistance Front (TRF) has claimed responsibility for the gunning down of seven persons on Sunday’s strike, the modus operandi carries imprint of Lashkar-e-Taiba “TRF is just a front created by Pakistan-based LeT to project terror strikes in J&K as ‘local’ acts and help Islamabad maintain deniability in the face of global pressure to rein in terror groups operating from its soil,” an intelligence officer told TOI.While the security forces are still analysing why an infrastructure project was targeted, a possibility being explored is if it was meant to stall or slow down the pace of infra development in J&K.Since the abrogation of Article 370 in J&K in 2019, Centre has undertaken a major infrastructure and connectivity push, leading infrastructure players from all over India to take up projects in the UT. “The attack was possibly meant to create a sense of terror or fear among the companies executing big projects in J&K and their resident staff. The high casualties in Ganderbal could make the private entities somewhat wary of bidding for projects, as a good part of their staff in specialised roles is drawn from outside J&K,” said an intelligence officer.It is to rule out this eventuality that J&K LG Manoj Sinha on Sunday and Monday reviewed security of residential areas of employees and staff engaged in different infrastructure projects in Kashmir and issued instructions that any gaps be identified and immediately plugged.As for timing of the attack, given that recent J&K assembly poll passed off smoothly and peacefully, an officer said “the Ganderbal strike is a message by the terrorists that they are very much active in J&K and will continue targeting non-Kashmiris who come to J&K to earn their livelihood, even if it is for J&K’s own development” .Five of the seven men targeted Sunday were non-locals.",J&K LG Manoj Sinha ordered beefing up of security forces’ presence in residential areas of employees and workers engaged in ongoing projects.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Monday asserted that India does not believe in being ""taken-for-granted"" in international relations , and that the world is realising trust and reliability alone make the foundation for good ties with the country. His remarks come at a time when Canadian PM Justin Trudeau 's brinkmanship has pushed bilateral ties into a deep chill, and amid indications of affinity of sections in a few western capitals for Ottawa.Ties between the countries have soured over Canada's allegations of India's hand in the killing of a pro-Khalistan terrorist, a Canadian citizen. India has denied the charge. Canada has failed to back its claims with evidence.The PM said India has emerged as a hope when most countries are concerned about the future after facing crises. ""India has shown digital innovation, democratic values can coexist; it has shown technology is a tool for inclusion, and not for control, division,"" Modi said and mentioned tech-powered platforms like UPI, PM Gati Shaki and ONDC to make his point.He said the world celebrated India's successful Chadrayaan mission ""like a festival"" as India's growth does not incite envy because its progress benefits the entire world. ""The world draws happiness from India's rise.""The world realises India is a friend in crisis situations, Modi said, noting its supply of medicines and vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic.Modi, speaking at an NDTV event, said his government in its third term is working at an unprecedented speed and scale, and that India has become a source of hope for the world plagued by numerous upheavals, including ongoing conflicts. ""India has a double AI advantage and when the power of 'aspirational India' and 'artificial intelligence' combines, then it is natural for development to take place at a fast pace,"" he said, citing several growth figures.""India had been a force of global growth in history but suffered from slavery and was not able to take advantage of industrial revolutions. Now, this is the time of Industry 4.0. We are not enslaved anymore and are ready for it. India is working on building the skill-set and infrastructure needed for Industry 4.0,"" the PM said.","PM Narendra Modi says India does not believe in being ""taken-for-granted"" in international relations. His remarks come at a time when Canadian PM Justin Trudeau's brinkmanship has pushed bilateral ties into a deep chill. Ties between the countries have soured over Canada's allegations of India's hand in the killing of a pro-Khalistan terrorist.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114438870,imgsize-1112993,width-400,resizemode-4/114438870.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Senior Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Ram Gopal Yadav courted controversy on Monday as he allegedly abused Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud over his ""praying to God for Ram Mandir solution"" remark.When asked about the CJI's statement recalling how he went on to deliver the verdict in the complex Ram Mandir case, the Samajwadi Party MP said: ""When you bring the dead back to life, they turn into ghosts and haunt the public.Many people talk like this, should I take notice of them"".On Sunday, Chandrachud shared his personal experience dealing with the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute and disclosed that he prayed to God for a solution.During a felicitation ceremony in his native village of Kanhersar, the CJI revealed that he had sought divine intervention to pass a verdict in the decades-old case that had been before him for three months.Ram Gopal Yadav, however, backtracked from his statement, saying that ""nobody asked him any question about the CJI"".The SP leader's clarification came after his statement blew up in major controversy, with BJP calling Ram Gopal Yadav's remark ""disregard for the judiciary"".Amit Malviya, BJP's I-T department head, said the SP leader should ""be booked for contempt of Court in this instance"".The pain of seeing a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, after 500 years of struggle, is unbearable for these so called 'secularists', Malviya further wrote on X.""Ram Gopal Yadav has used derogatory language regarding the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , which reflects a disregard for the judiciary. This behaviour shows that the Samajwadi Party does not trust the Constitution of the country or its independent judiciary and resorts to abusive language. It is very unfortunate and condemnable. The Samajwadi Party should take strict action against Ram Gopal Yadav"", BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi told news agency IANS.CJI Chandrachud was part of the five-judge bench, headed by then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi , that delivered the historic verdict on November 9, 2019.The bench settled the long-standing dispute by paving the way for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya while also ruling that a mosque would be built on an alternative five-acre plot in the same city.CJI Chandrachud had also visited the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in July this year and offered prayers.

NEW DELHI: Foreign secretary Vikram Misri announced on Monday that India and China have come to an agreement regarding patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in border areas.""Over the last few weeks, Indian and Chinese negotiators have been in touch with each other,"" Misri said while addressing a press conference.""India and China have reached an agreement on patrolling arrangements along the LAC in border areas leading to disengagement and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in 2020 and we will be taking the next steps on this,"" Misri added while briefing the press.The foreign secretary made these remarks while addressing a special briefing on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to Kazan, Russia for BRICS summit.External affairs minister S Jaishankar called it a ""positive development"" which he said would create a basis for peace and tranquillity along the border areas.""What foreign secretary has said is what I can also say, that we reached an agreement on patrolling and with that we have gone back to where the situation was in 2020. We can say that the disengagement process with China has been completed...There are areas which for various reasons after 2020 because they had blocked us so we had blocked them. So what has happened is we have reached an understanding which will allow the patrolling. I think the understanding to my knowledge is that we will be able to do the patrolling which we were doing in 2020. I think it's a good development. It's a positive development and I would say it's a product of very patient and very persevering diplomacy...,"" Jaishankar said at an NDTV summit.He further said: ""We've been negotiating since September 2020, when I met my counterpart Wang Yi, in Moscow at that time...I think it creates a basis that peace and tranquillity, which there should be in the border areas, which there was before 2020, we will be able to come back to that...""Earlier in August, India and China held a discussion over the situation along the LAC and decided to jointly uphold peace and tranquillity on the ground.The two sides narowed down their differences and sought to find early resolution of the outstanding issues. For this, they further agreed for intensified contact through diplomatic and military channels.The relationship between India and China, two nuclear-armed neighbors, has remained fraught with tension since the deadly clash in Galwan Valley in 2020. This incident marked a turning point, prompting India to increase scrutiny of Chinese investments and suspend several significant projects aimed at enhancing bilateral cooperation.In an effort to resolve the ongoing standoff, both nations have engaged in multiple rounds of corps commanders-level talks. Progress has been slow, but a notable development occurred in September 2022 when both sides undertook disengagement along the LAC. Troops were withdrawn from Patrolling Point-15 in the Gogra-Hot Springs area of Eastern Ladakh, a crucial step towards de-escalation. The establishment of buffer zones along the LAC provided a framework for potential resolutions.The stagnation in diplomatic and military negotiations over the past four years has adversely impacted business relations between the two nations. In response to the continued tensions, India had tightened its scrutiny of investments from Chinese firms and halted several major projects.","Foreign secretary Vikram Misri announced on Monday that India and China have come to an agreement regarding patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Pakistan allocates Rs 10 million for restoration of historic Hindu Temple in Punjab,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-allocates-rs-10-million-for-restoration-of-historic-hindu-temple-in-punjab/articleshow/114425615.cms,"A budget of Rs 10 million has been allocated for the restoration of the Baoli Sahib temple in the Punjab province to address the long-standing demands of the Hindu community in Pakistan This marks the first phase of reconstruction, 64 years after the temple was rendered dysfunctional.The Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), a federal body responsible for overseeing minority worship sites in Pakistan, has commenced work on restoring the Baoli Sahib temple, located in Zafarwal town in Narowal, a city along the western bank of the Ravi River.The temple has been out of service since 1960, according to Dawn News.Currently, there is no functional Hindu temple in the entire Narowal district, forcing the local Hindu population to either conduct religious ceremonies at home or travel to temples in Sialkot and Lahore.Ratan Lal Arya , the former president of the Pak Dharamsthan Committee , explained that the temple became non-functional after the ETPB took control of it. The Hindu community in Narowal, numbering over 1,453 people, has since lacked a proper place to conduct their rituals.Narowal district once had 45 Hindu temples, all of which have fallen into disrepair over time.The restoration work is currently focused on constructing a boundary wall around the four kanals of land, after which the temple will be handed over to the Pak Dharamsthan Committee.Hindus represent the largest minority group in Pakistan. Official estimates suggest that there are around 7.5 million Hindus in the country, though the community claims the number is closer to 9 million. The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population resides in Sindh province, where they share cultural and linguistic ties with their Muslim neighbors.","A budget of Rs 10 million has been allocated for the restoration of the Baoli Sahib temple in Narowal, Punjab province.
