"7 years gone, little action on govt’s 2017 plan on curbing ads for unhealthy foods",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-years-gone-little-action-on-govts-2017-plan-on-curbing-ads-for-unhealthy-foods/articleshow/109742213.cms,"There has been little or no action on key recommendations in govt’s 2017 action plan for prevention and control of common non-communicable diseases which seek strict regulation of advertising, marketing and promotion of unhealthy food to children. Seven years on, there is no regulation on what the plan described as “unchallenged aggressive marketing strategies” of food and beverage companies.Promotion of unhealthy foods high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) came into focus recently when Supreme Court talked of expanding a petition on Patanjali’s misleading ads to include misleading ads “taking the public for a ride, in particular, adversely affecting health and well being of babies, young children, women...who have been consuming the products on the basis of misrepresentation”.National Multisectoral Action Plan-NMAP (2017-22) drawn up in Oct 2017 included enactment of laws and other regulatory measures, launching of IEC (information, education, communication) campaigns, formulation of appropriate policies, and so on for “reduction of risk factors levels in children, adolescents and adults”. Unhealthy diet was one of the key risk factors identified and “change in lifestyle driven by unchallenged aggressive marketing strategies of unhealthy foods and beverages and alcohol industry” was identified as one of the challenges in bringing down NCDs.The plan identified action points for 39 ministries/departments. Ministries of information and broadcasting (I&B), commerce, consumer affairs and food distribution, law and health were supposed to work together to regulate advertisement of demerit goods (like HFSS food products, alcohol, and tobacco) through “amendment of advertisement code of Cable Television Networks Rules and norms of journalist conduct; and Trademark Rules”.Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) under health ministry was supposed to implement interpretative front of pack labelling and detailed nutrition labelling at the back of the pack.“On prevention of NCDs, the national plan contains two key policy provisions — front of pack labelling and prohibition of advertisements of HFSS foods. Both require a definition of HFSS foods. India had a pretty good definition of HFSS in the 2018 draft regulation on front of pack labelling, which matches the definition used in Latin American countries and many other regions. But that draft was dropped. The same definition is there in the Sept 2022 draft too. But after putting the draft in the public domain for comments, it seems to have gone into cold storage as nothing has moved since then,” said Dr Arun Gupta, who has filed several complaints regarding misleading ads for HFSS foods.Other recommendations include regulation to promote reformulation of processed foods to limit the amount of fats, sugar and salt in such products by the food processing ministry and FSSAI, and “guidelines to prohibit sponsorship of sports events/teams/athletes by companies producing products that have negative health externalities” by sports ministry.“We filed RTIs with several ministries but barring a few, most have not done much about the action plan and some were not even aware of it. In one of its responses, the health ministry claimed that there were regular meetings on the plan but failed to provide any minutes of the meetings,” said Dr Nupur Bidla, member of Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest, a national think tank on nutrition.","There has been little or no action on key recommendations in govt’s 2017 action plan for prevention and control of common non-communicable diseases.

Congress is planning to collect more than half- 55% as tax on inheritance (received from parents),"" he claimed.Mocking the Congress, he mentioned that whenever the long-standing party holds power, it embodies five political characteristics - false promises, vote bank politics, support for mafia and criminals, dynastic politics, and corruption.The PM further accused that initially it was BRS that plundered Telangana, and now it is the Congress.","PM Narendra Modi said he will not permit reservation for Muslims based on religion if it comes at the expense of SC, ST, and OBCs.

The question is with regard to the timing of the arrest, which they have pointed out, the timing of the arrest, soon before the general elections,"" Justice Sanjiv Khanna told Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, who is appearing on behalf of the ED.According to LiveLaw, Justice Khanna also asked the ASG: ""Another question is whether there being any adjudicatory proceedings, can you have criminal proceedings being initiated? In terms of what has been held in VMC or otherwise. In this case, there has been no proceeding for attachment. You have to show how petitioner was ... what they believe is threshold of Section 19 is fairly high ... they will be confronted with Section 45 ... that is why they are repeatedly coming against arrest.""The Supreme Court further noted that in the matter linked to former Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia, the investigators have claimed they have found material, but in Kejriwal's case nothing has been brought up.Justice Khanna also questioned the time gap between initiation of the probe and arrest. ""The time gap which is taking place between initiation of proceedings and repeated complaints being filed after some time ... this all has consequences. 365 days ... is upper limit,"" he noted.The Bench reiterated that ""liberty is exceedingly important"" and asked the agency to be ""prepared"" with answers.The ED has been asked to respond by Friday.Kejriwal is currently lodged in the Tihar jail here under judicial custody after his arrest on March 21 in the case.The top court issued ED a notice on April 15 and sought its response to Kejriwal's plea.On April 9, the high court upheld Kejriwal's arrest, saying there was no illegality and the ED was left with ""little option"" after he skipped repeated summonses and refused to join the investigation.The matter pertains to alleged corruption and money laundering in the formulation and execution of the Delhi government's now scrapped excise policy for 2021-22.","Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta questioned the probe agency over the timing of the arrest of Kejriwal.

US report names RAW man involved in alleged plot to take out Pannun,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-report-names-raw-man-involved-in-alleged-plot-to-take-out-pannun/articleshow/109708372.cms,"US Pannun plot probe involves CIA, FBI, others

A report in Washington Post, a US newspaper, has claimed that a Research and Analysis Wing officer, Vikram Yadav , instructed a hired hit team to kill US-based Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun .According to the report, “US intelligence agencies have assessed that the operation targeting Pannun was approved by the RAW chief at the time, Samant Goel .” It adds that Yadav was transferred back to CRPF after the Pannun plot unravelled last year.There was no response by the Indian govt to the assertions made in the report till late Monday night.US authorities had last year indicted an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, for the plot, alleging that he was acting at the behest of an Indian official they referred to in the indictment as CC-1.Gupta is currently in a jail in Prague, where he was detained last year by Czech and US agencies. While India had formed a high-level committee in Nov to probe the information shared by the US about the role of the Indian official, saying it had a bearing on India’s security too, the govt has so far not revealed any of its findings.RAW officer Vikram Yadav, who was on deputation from CRPF, allegedly forwarded details of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, including his address in New York, said a Washington Post report, citing sources and a US indictment. The official is now back with the central paramilitary force.Given his background, Yadav “lacked training and skills” needed for an operation that meant going up against sophisticated US counter-intelligence capabilities, the Post said. According to the report, senior officials at the US justice department and FBI had pushed to prosecute Yadav, a step that would have implicated RAW in a murder-for-hire conspiracy. “But while a US indictment unsealed in November contained the bombshell allegation that the plot was directed by an Indian official, it referred to Yadav as only an unnamed co-conspirator, CC-1, and made no mention of the Indian spy agency,” it said.“Higher-ranking RAW officials have also been implicated, according to current and former Western security officials, as part of a sprawling investigation by the CIA, FBI and other agencies that has mapped potential links to Modi’s inner circle,” the report said.","US authorities had last year indicted an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, for the plot, alleging that he was acting at the behest of an Indian official.

However, assuaging the state government's fear that the entire cabinet may be arrested over the case, the SC stayed a part of the HC's order that had asked the CBI to probe all officials involved in the recruitment of the teachers.The SC expressed serious concern about agency which conducted the recruitment test, destruction of OMR answer sheets, erasing of software about results and inclusion of people who were not part of the selection panel. ""You have to satisfy us how the high court went wrong,"" the CJI said.SC posted the next hearing for May 6.In an order passed last week, the Calcutta high court nullified the appointment of all the 25,753 teachers empanelled in 2016 for various categories of jobs at secondary and higher secondary schools in the state.A division bench of Justices Debangsu Basak and Shabbar Rashidi of the high court ordered that the candidates selected will have to return the entire salary drawn by them, along with an annualised interest of 12 per cent, within the next four weeks.Besides directing the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) to start the recruitment process afresh, it also directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to carry on with its investigation into the matter.Taking cognisance of the state cabinet's decision for the creation of super-numeric posts, the Calcutta high court said that the CBI, if necessary, can question the masterminds behind the creation of the seats in excess of the vacant posts. These super-numeric posts, which have remained under the cloud since the beginning, are perceived to provide room for ineligible candidates recruited illegally.","The Supreme Court on Monday refused to stay the Calcutta high court's order terminating the appointment of 25,000 teachers recruited ""illegally"" in West Bengal.

The total sanctioned strength of judges across all HCs is 1,114, which means 29.4% posts are lying vacant.Large number of vacancies in high courts also means increasing pendency of cases, which has reached almost 62 lakh as on April 30.The total pendency in all courts has crossed 5.1 crore, including 4.5 crore in subordinate and district courts and over 80,000 in Supreme Court.Interestingly, for half of these vacancies, Centre had claimed earlier that no recommendations were made by HC collegiums when the laid down procedure demands initiating proposals well in advance, at least six months before the vacancy arises.Allahabad HC, country’s largest HC, has 69 vacancies against a strength of 160 judges, which means 43% posts are vacant. Gujarat HC has a higher vacancy percentage at 44%, followed by Patna and Rajasthan with 36% each.Punjab & Haryana HC has 30 posts vacant against a sanctioned strength of 85, followed by 26 in Bombay HC where the approved strength is 94. There are 23 vacancies each in Calcutta and Gujarat HCs.In Dec last year, while responding to MPs’ concerns against the large number of vacancies in high courts, Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal had pointed to the slow pace of recommendations reaching the Centre.He had said that HC collegiums were not adhering to timeline on initiation of recommendations against vacancies, adding that for 198 vacancies across HCs, collegiums of these HCs had not made any recommendations till then, leading to a huge backlog.According to the memorandum of procedure (MoP) that guides the appointment of judges to the higher judiciary, a proposal for appointment is initiated by the chief justice of the HC concerned in consultation with two senior-most judges of the HC at least six months before a vacancy occurs. “This timeline is often not adhered to by the high courts,” Meghwal had said.Once these HC collegiums recommend candidates for judgeship, the govt seeks Intelligence Bureau’s inputs and refers them to Supreme Court collegium, which finally selects and recommends names to Centre for notification. In cases where the SC collegium has reservations, those are referred back to the HCs for reconsideration.","Allahabad, Punjab and Haryana, Gujarat, Bombay and Calcutta alone have 171 vacancies.

“Without initiating adjudicatory proceedings (attachment action), can you initiate criminal proceedings?” The court noted that there were no attachment proceedings in the case so far.

“As far as the judgment in Manish Sisodia case is concerned, there are findings in his favour and against him also. Tell us which side this case (Kejriwal’s) lies.”

“How is Section 19 of PMLA to be interpreted, as he (Kejriwal) is coming against his arrest...instead of applying for bail, because he will have to face the higher threshold under Section 45 of PMLA if he takes the latter course? So how do we interpret it? Do we make the threshold much higher and ensure the standard is same to find the person who is guilty?”

CM arrested 18 months after case was filed, says counsel

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday said Enforcement Directorate would have to give an explanation on the timing of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s arrest, which was carried out just before general elections , and observed that the gap between initiation of proceedings in the alleged Delhi excise scam case and his arrest was “bothering” the court.At the conclusion of Kejriwal’s submission by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta asked additional solicitor general S V Raju to be ready with answers on Friday to five questions it raised on the basis of Singhvi’s arguments, including on the timing of arrest and the time-gap in proceedings against the CM.What is bothering us is the time gap between the initiation of proceedings and repeated complaints being filed after some time. If you see Section 8, there is a limit of 365 days. Other option is to not arrest... life and liberty are exceedingly important.”“Why was the arrest made right before Lok Sabha polls?”The agency will respond to the court’s queries on Friday. Singhvi, appearing for the CM, concluded his submission and contended that Kejriwal was arrested 18 months after the case was filed and that too on the basis of “hearsay evidence”. He gave a detailed timeline on how relief was granted to accused-turned-approvers soon after they named Kejriwal and were “forced by the agency to make statements against him”.In his affidavit, the CM has accused ED of working on behalf of the Centre to crush its political opponents ahead of general elections and said his arrest was “illegal, arbitrary and an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on free and fair elections and federalism”.“It is very sad and some kind of farce is going on. The agency is relying upon the statement of co-accused who were made to give statements prior to grant of pardon,” Singhvi said while referring to statements of Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy on the basis of which the chief minister was arrested.He said Reddy gave the statement five months after his son Raghav Reddy was arrested, and once the latter turned approver, ED on the very next day did not object to his bail plea.“The mode, manner and timing of the arrest of the petitioner just before Lok Sabha elections speaks volumes about the arbitrariness of the ED. This timeline establishes the fact that the petitioner has been arrested intentionally with a malafide intent without any necessity to arrest,” Kejriwal said in his affidavit.",Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta asked ED to be ready with answers on Friday.

Patanjali told to pay 27.5cr for GST infraction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/patanjali-told-to-pay-27-5cr-for-gst-infraction/articleshow/109738788.cms,"DEHRADUN/HARIDWAR: In a double blow to Patanjali, the Directorate General of GST Intelligence ( DGGI ) in Chandigarh has imposed a hefty penalty of Rs 27.5 crore on Patanjali Foods for an irregularity in Input Tax Credit ( ITC ). The notice comes a day after the Uttarakhand govt suspended the licences for 14 products sold by Patanjali Ayurved and Divya Pharmacy, including popular offerings Swasari Gold, Mukta Vati Extra Power, and BP Grit.The penalty by DGGI Chandigarh stems from the detection of a Rs 20-crore irregularity in ITC, as GST officials revealed. According to GST officials, in case of a fake ITC claim, a penalty can be imposed up to the amount of the ITC claim along with interest. They said that in this case, the wrong ITC claim was Rs 20 crore, and the penalty amount is Rs 27.5 crore – inclusive of interest — hence, the total amount stands at Rs 47.5 crore. Despite attempts by TOI, Patanjali officials remained unresponsive for comment.Meanwhile, legal tussle escalated as Uttarakhand suspended licences for 14 Patanjali products, including those mentioned above. The state government also demanded the formula for these drugs from Patanjali. Speaking to TOI, Patanjali Ayurved media in-charge S K Tijarawala stated, “We will reply to the notice served by state govt and take legal recourse regarding the action taken against us.”This action follows a case filed by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in the Supreme Court after Patanjali published an advertisement claiming to cure various diseases, which the IMA deemed misleading. The apex court scrutinised govt's response to Patanjali Ayurved’s activities, criticising their passivity. Responding to the court’s queries, the state Ayurvedic and Unani Services department suspended the licences of the mentioned drugs under provisions of the Drug and Cosmetic Act 1945. Dr Mithlesh Kumar, the drug controller, stated, “Manufacturing permission for the mentioned drugs is suspended with immediate effect.”The legal confrontation deepened as the Ayurvedic and Unani services department of the Ayush ministry filed affidavits regarding the action taken against Patanjali. The department sought the apex court’s permission to file revised affidavits, and the case is scheduled for a hearing on May 14.","The penalty stems from the detection of a Rs 20-crore irregularity in ITC, as GST officials revealed.

‘Juvenile’ to suggest national wealth redistribution: SG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/juvenile-to-suggest-national-wealth-redistribution-sg/articleshow/109738521.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid a growing debate on redistribution of wealth, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told Supreme Court on Tuesday that these were “rustic and juvenile” methods to achieve egalitarianism.Outlining that Article 39(b) of the Constitution envisaged distribution of material resources of the community to subserve the common good, Mehta told a nine-judge bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud, “It would be a rustic and juvenile method to propose computing the nation’s wealth by totalling the wealth of every citizen and then distributing it equally among a particular section.Such ideas reflect a lack of understanding of economic development , governance, social welfare and the nation.”Mehta said if a plot of land belonged to an individual and it was needed for construction of a road to subserve the common good of residents of a large area, then that privately-owned land would be classified as material resource to be utilised for greater good of the community. “Article 39(b) based legislation is not meant to take away properties owned by people of a particular community, race or caste for distribution among another class of citizens,” he said.The bench comprising CJI Chandrachud and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, B V Nagarathna, S Dhulia, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, R Bindal, S C Sharma and A G Masih seemed to concur. “It would be rather extreme to interpret Article 39(b) to include privately-owned property as material resources of the community,"" the bench said.“The dynamics of economic development have changed from socialist pattern to a free market economy since the 1990s and now private investments hold the key. If we want to have a productive economy, then private investment must be encouraged. In the 1950s, no one had envisaged that electricity would be distributed by private parties. In the present scenario, it would be extremely unfair to argue that community resources include all private properties,” it added.CJI Chandrachud said when the constitutional court interprets a key provision like Article 39(b) in Directive Principles of State Policy of the Constitution, it must ensure that the interpretation “sends a clear message of what India is and what it aspires to be”.“It is difficult to outrightly categorise all private properties as material resources of the community. But at the same time, we cannot say that material resources can never include any private property,” he said, indicating that a balance needs to be struck between the two extreme views — socialist and capitalist — in the context of India's development.Mehta said Article 39(b) was a measure for developing a welfare state with the goal of achieving common good, where material resources of the community need legislative intervention to be either taken over or controlled for distribution. He said the govt did not advocate either extremes — that all assets of the country vested in the nation or community, or that no private property could ever be categorised as community resources. “It depends on the context of time and purpose,” he said.After hearing Mehta, the bench said, “Your arguments appear to contradict that of attorney general R Venkataramani who had argued that community resources would include private properties.” Mehta said he had nuanced the legal proposition differently. Arguments will conclude on Wednesday.",Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told Supreme Court on Tuesday that these were “rustic and juvenile’ methods to achieve egalitarianism.

NEW DELHI: South India experienced its second hottest April on record in terms of maximum temperatures while the average mean temperature in east and northeast India was the highest for the month in 51 years, IMD data reveals, attesting to the torridly hot conditions that these regions have been witnessing over the past few weeks.The last few days have seen heat records fall in three of India’s biggest cities — Bengaluru, Kolkata and Mumbai.The South as a whole recorded an average maximum temperature of nearly 37.2 degrees Celsius during the month — surpassed only by 37.6 degrees C logged in April 2016 in records going back to 1901 — IMD’s monthly temperature data reveals. Bengaluru witnessed its hottest ever April. The metro, once famous as the Garden City, recorded 13 extremely hot days, including six in a row, during the month.Eastern India has been baking in April heat during a prolonged spell of extreme weather. As per IMD’s data, the average mean temperature in the region (east and NE, as per IMD classification) during the month was the highest since 1973, with the average night temperatures the highest ever in April. Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar have been reeling under extreme heat. On Tuesday, Kolkata (Dum Dum) logged 43 degrees C, its highest temperature in April and fourth highest for any month. It was 43 degrees C at Kolkata’s Alipore as well, less than a degree from the all-time high of 43.9 recorded almost a century ago and only the second time ever that Kolkata’s April temperature had touched the 43-degree mark.Meanwhile, for the first time in the country this season, the mercury crossed the 47-degree mark on Tuesday — Kalaikunda in (Bengal) logged 47.2 degrees C, a whopping 10.4 degrees above normal, and Baharagora in East Singhbhum district of Jharkhand touched 47.1 degrees C. At least three spots in the region — Kalaikunda, Panagarh (Bengal) and Balasore (Odisha) — reported temperatures 10 degrees higher than normal.Odisha, which falls under central India in IMD’s classification, has been reeling under a heat wave for 16 straight days. “This is the highest number of consecutive days of heat wave in Odisha in 10 years. The record for the longest heat wave spell in the state is 26 days, reported in 1998,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, chief of IMD.“The heat waves in several parts of the country weren’t entirely unexpected. El Nino continues to persist in the Pacific and under this condition, south India and adjoining areas are known to witness above normal temperatures in April. A more immediate reason for the heat in eastern India is the presence of an anti-cyclonic circulation in central Bay of Bengal, which is preventing sea breeze from entering the region. As a result, the land has become dry and hot,” Mohapatra said.Another wind circulation, an anti-cyclone over western Arabian Sea, has been pumping up heat along the western coast, particularly the Konkan belt, over the past few days. On Monday, the temperature at Mumbai’s Santa Cruz crossed 39 degrees for the second time this month, making it the second hottest April day in the city in 10 years.IMD expects the heat wave to continue in eastern India till May 2 and for at least another five days in the South.","South India experienced its second hottest April on record in terms of maximum temperatures.

For FCI lower borrowings will translate into an annual interest saving of around Rs 375 crore.FCI sources said that this year too the agency is on course to have more than sufficient stocks to intervene in the market and boost supplies, if required.Up to Monday, it had procured 196 lakh tonnes wheat, which is 10% lower than last year’s, but more than the quantity required for distribution of free foodgrains to 80 crore poor and for other welfare requirements for the entire year.Although arrivals in mandis are lower due to prolonged winter in many parts of north India, FCI is confident of mopping up 300-310 lakh tonnes this year with additional 100 lakh tonnes or so to be used for open market sales. Last year, govt had purchased 261 lakh tonnes.“The arrival of wheat in Punjab and Haryana is very good and procurement in just these two states will help generate around 200 lakh tonnes for the central pool. The annual requirement of Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana and other welfare schemes is 186 lakh tonne,” FCI CMD Ashok K Meena said.Officials said that wheat procurement in Madhya Pradesh has been slow so far at 34.6 lakh tonnes despite commencing MSP operations early and the state is unlikely to achieve the initial target of 80 lakh tonne. In the case of UP, wheat purchase is 5.6 lakh tonnes, a 250% jump compared to last year. This comes amid claims by agriculture ministry officials that the overall wheat production will touch 1,150 lakh tonnes against the earlier estimate of 1,120 lakh tonnes.","FCI sources said that this year too the agency is on course to have more than sufficient stocks to intervene in the market and boost supplies, if required.

Rahul’s yatra volunteers to boost Cong campaign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahuls-yatra-volunteers-to-boost-cong-campaign/articleshow/109737634.cms,"CHANDIGARH: Tapping into the volunteer base generated during Congress leader Rahul Gandhi ’s twin Bharat Joda Yatras, the Congress is now building a grass-root level ‘highly-committed’ volunteer groups in Chandigarh and other parts of the country.The ‘Nyay Yodhas’ that signed up during the yatras are being connected with and enrolled for the party’s door-to-door campaign for disseminating its message targeting youth and women.A group within the team will handle the social media messaging during the campaign.The team is working in parallel and independent of the local Congress units though in collaboration with them. The team heads are directly reporting to the national team based in Delhi.Vivek Kumar, regional convener of the ‘ Jai Jawan ’ initiative, says, “A network of volunteers is being formed in every parliamentary constituency. In Chandigarh, for instance, we have so far selected around 50 volunteers from a list of 250 persons who signed up during the yatra under the ‘Jai Jawan’ initiative. These volunteers in turn will add and connect with more volunteers. The chain will be expanded as they also continue to campaign from door to door. Similarly, in all constituencies of Punjab, we are building up the volunteer base.”Kumar says, “There was an emphasis to fully utilize the interest and associations generated during the Bharat Joda Yatras. In addition to the online duties, it was thought that the crucial door-to-door campaigning should also be entrusted to these volunteers.”To keep the initiative directly under the national team was decided to give greater flexibility and boost initiative in the voluntary group working, says Kumar. The local Congress unit generally provides the details of the volunteers that signed up during the yatra and logistic support to the Jai Jawan Abhiyan team.The team will focus on the young and women voters. Kumar says, “The team will communicate to the women and young voters about party’s stand on crucial issues related to them. For the youth, issues like unemployment, and agniveer scheme will be taken up. For women, issues like job reservation, and security will be taken up.”In Chandigarh, the volunteers will start the groundwork in a couple of days. Chandigarh and Punjab go to polls on June 1.Chandigarh convener of the Jai Jawan Abhiyan Prabhdeep Kaur, who is an advocate and a student of Political Science in Panjab University, says, “We are ready with our team and the grassroot level operations will start in couple of days as collective meeting of the group has been called. The social media team will also start after the meeting.”The team will borrow heavily from the Congress manifesto and the yatra promises on issues related to women and youth.Kaur says, “Our message will be party’s dedication to provide ‘nyay’ to our ‘yuva’, scrapping Agniveer scheme, Right to Apprenticeship and 30 lakh vacancies.”To the women voters, Kaur says, “Party’s promises like Mahalakhsmi scheme, job reservation, doubling the number of aanganwadi workers and ‘Same work, same wages’ for women will be communicated.”",The ‘Nyay Yodhas’ that signed up during the yatras are being connected with and enrolled for the party’s door-to-door campaign.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Report: US drug regulator to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/report-us-drug-regulator-to-reclassify-marijuana-as-a-less-dangerous-drug/articleshow/109742691.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US drug enforcement administration will move to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, AP has learned, a historic shift to generations of American drug policy that could have wide ripple-effects across the country. The DEA ’s proposal, which still must be reviewed by the White House office of management and budget, would recognise the medical uses of cannabis and acknowledge it has less potential for abuse than some of the nation’s most dangerous drugs.However, it would not legalise marijuana outright for recreational use.The agency’s move, confirmed to the AP on Tuesday by five people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity, clears the last significant regulatory hurdle before the agency’s biggest policy change in over 50 years can take effect.Once OMB signs off, the DEA will take public comment on the plan to move marijuana from its current classification as a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin and LSD. It moves pot to Schedule III , alongside ketamine and some anabolic steroids, following a recommendation from the federal health and human services department. After the public-comment period the agency would publish the final rule.It comes after Prez Biden called for a review of federal marijuana law in Oct 2022, and has moved to pardon thousands of Americans convicted federally of simple possession of the drug. He has also called on governors and local leaders to take similar steps to erase marijuana convictions. “Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It’s time that we right these wrongs,” Biden said in Dec. The election year announcement could help Biden, a Democrat, boost flagging support, particularly among younger voters.Schedule III drugs are still controlled substances and subject to rules and regulations, and people who traffic in them without permission could still face federal criminal prosecution. Some critics argue the DEA shouldn’t change course on marijuana, saying rescheduling isn’t necessary and could lead to harmful side effects.","US drug enforcement administration will move to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, AP has learned.

Sierra Nevada secures $13 billion contract to build next-gen 'doomsday plane' for US Air Force,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sierra-nevada-secures-13-billion-contract-to-build-next-gen-doomsday-plane-for-us-air-force/articleshow/109723657.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sierra Nevada Corporation has been awarded a monumental $13 billion contract to develop and produce the new Survivable Airborne Operations Center ( SAOC ), which will replace the US Air Force ’s aging fleet of E-4B Nightwatch aircraft, colloquially known as ""doomsday planes."" The announcement was made by the Department of the Air Force, highlighting the significant step towards modernizing the nation's nuclear command and control capabilities.As per a Defense News report, the E-4B aircraft, which currently serves as the National Airborne Operations Center, is designed to enable the President and other national leaders to manage military operations during a nuclear war or other catastrophic scenarios when ground command centers might be incapacitated. These aircraft have been in service since the 1970s and are nearing the end of their operational lifespan.Under the terms of the new contract, Sierra Nevada will be responsible for the delivery of both engineering and manufacturing development aircraft and production aircraft, along with associated ground systems and interim contract support by July 10, 2036. The initial funding release for the project includes $59 million dedicated to research, development, test, and evaluation to kickstart the SAOC development.An Air Force spokesperson emphasized the significance of the SAOC project, stating, “The development of this critical national security weapon system ensures the department’s nuclear command, control, and communications capability is operationally relevant and secure for decades to come.”The SAOC will be constructed using a hardened, modified version of a commercial derivative aircraft equipped with a modular open system approach. This design strategy will incorporate modern, secure communication and planning capabilities. The ground support system for the SAOC will feature training equipment for aircrews, mission crews, and maintainers, along with necessary support equipment and system integration laboratories, the Defense News report said.Work on the SAOC will be performed across multiple locations, including Englewood, Colorado; Sparks, Nevada; Beavercreek, Ohio; and Vandalia, Ohio. The contract includes various cost mechanisms such as cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, and cost-plus-fixed-fee components, ensuring comprehensive financial oversight and incentivization throughout the development process.This contract not only signifies a pivotal upgrade to America's military capabilities but also showcases Sierra Nevada Corporation’s leading role in aerospace innovation and national defense infrastructure.","Sierra Nevada Corporation has been awarded a monumental $13 billion contract to develop and produce the new Survivable Airborne Operations Center.
