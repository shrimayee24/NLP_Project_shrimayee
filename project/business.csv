When giving is a way of life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-giving-is-a-way-of-life/articleshow/116900675.cms,"(Know about any such inspiring story? Share it with us at changebegins-here@timesofindia.com)

Pranav Sontakke, a banker from Maharashtra’s Amravati district, has shown that one doesn’t need pots of money to give back to society.Growing up in a modest household, his schoolteacher parents had instilled in him the belief that true wealth isn’t measured in money, but in the ability to give.“We’re not rich, but we’ve always been content with what we had,” says the 33-year-old. His journey into philanthropy began almost by accident, five years ago, during a govt fellowship programme, when he worked on India’s first Digital Village project. It was there that he saw first-hand the power of education to transform communities.“Education empowers people,” he says, “and for tribals, it’s a way to uplift entire communities.” Even with a steady job, Sontakke couldn’t forget the families he’d worked with. So, he started channelling his earnings into setting up free libraries and coaching centres for tribal students.Then there’s Gurgaon-based Parag Agarwal, who, after a long career in the corporate sector, including a stint as an adviser at Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, felt increasingly drawn to social causes.“Maybe it was my exposure to Buddhism and meditation. Also, the suffering of children always troubled me,” he reflects, remembering how he would drive past children begging on the streets with his son beside him. “I knew I had to do something for them.”Agarwal went on to start a foundation focused on education for disadvantaged children before a shift in perspective that led him to champion the cause of animal welfare, after he watched videos shared by his niece on the treatment of animals in dairy and leather industries. “It felt like a neglected cause, and I knew I needed to do more to protect animals,” he says.The Good Samaritan streaks in both Sontakke and Agarwal were fuelled by this community called Living My Promise (LMP) that encourages Indians with a net worth of Rs 1 crore or more to pledge at least 50% of their wealth to causes close to their hearts.In 2019, Sontakke and Agarwal joined LMP. Sontakke’s foundation now supports schools with water coolers and digital boards and has helped tribal students secure spots in Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, to prevent migration from disrupting their education.Meanwhile, Agarwal is determined to bring both capital and talent into creating an ecosystem where “animals are treated with the same respect as humans,” he says.As Gunjan Thaney, head of LMP puts it: “We want to show that anyone can give back and make a real impact.” She described how the idea quickly snowballed into a movement by word of mouth and a mutual belief in giving back. The stories of early members struck a chord and now there are 154 of them, going beyond the typical philanthropist circles.“The inspiration for LMP came from Warren Buffet and Bill Gates’ The Giving Pledge, which focuses on billionaires committing to give away most of their wealth. But LMP had a different approach. Conceived by founding promisor Girish Batra and four #DaanUtsav volunteers, it aimed to democratise philanthropy for both beginners and the seasoned,” explains Thaney.Unlike traditional philanthropy, LMP thrives on connections, not corporate structures. “The pledge isn’t legally binding, but a personal commitment to support causes of their choice, either during their lifetime or through their will. Once they join, members become part of a community and are encouraged to share their story publicly to inspire others,” says Thaney.“For most, it’s about wanting to give back in a way that goes beyond just providing for our families,” says Thaney.Interestingly, more than half — around 52% — of LMP members are women, many of whom have made this philanthropic pledge independent of their partners.“These women come from all walks of life and may or may not be single, but what sets them apart is their determination to take control of their finances and philanthropic journey,” Thaney adds.While LMP doesn’t directly suggest causes or organisations, it does connect members to NGOs based on their specific interests — only when they request it.The initiative is careful to remain non-judgmental and refrains from suggesting where to give or which organisations are ‘better.’ The idea is to respect the autonomy and personal motivations of each promisor.One of the standout efforts within the LMP community is the Bundelkhand Integrated Village Development initiative that tackles rural challenges in Uttar Pradesh head-on.Over two years, promisors have supported education for underprivileged children, introduced sustainable livelihoods through agroforestry, and developed a model village in Gaurahari, focused on women empowerment, skillbuilding, and healthcare.Some members have also co-created platforms such as Dolphin Tank (on the lines of Shark Tank) that gives micro grants to inspiring stories and led to unexpected partnerships with NGOs working on education, healthcare, animal welfare, and environmental sustainability.In 2021, Rs 24 lakhs from LMP’s Dolphin Tank helped launch a project with Navoday Foundation in Assam’s Tamulpur district —training women in mushroom cultivation. What started with 200 women, earning Rs 19.2 lakhs collectively, has now grown to 1,200 women, who together earn a staggering Rs 1.2 crore every month, totalling Rs 14 crore annually.","Pranav Sontakke, a banker from Maharashtra’s Amravati district, has shown that one doesn’t need pots of money to give back to society.

Agra's 1 7th-Century Mughal-era haveli razed by 'builder',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agras-17th-century-mughal-era-haveli-razed-by-builder/articleshow/116898547.cms,"Plaque at Agra site indicated Aurangzeb built the monument

AGRA: The 17th-century Mubarak Manzil , a Mughal heritage site also known as Aurangzeb 's Haveli, was largely demolished in Agra just three months after the state archaeological department issued a notification to protect the monument. Over 100 tractors of debris were removed from the site after the demolition drive, local residents said on Thursday. They say a builder, in connivance with officials, demolished it.Mubarak Manzil has a significant place in history, detailed in Austrian historian Ebba Koch's book 'The Complete Taj Mahal and the Riverfront Gardens of Agra'. Built during Aurangzeb's reign, it served as a residence for key Mughal figures, including Shah Jahan, Shuja and Aurangzeb. The structure was modified under British rule, becoming a customs house and salt office. By 1902, it was known as Tara Niwas.In September, the state archaeological department had issued a notification calling for objections to the site being declared a protected monument within a month, but none were raised. And two weeks ago, officials from Lucknow visited the site to initiate preservation measures. However, demolition began shortly after their visit, leaving the historic structure in ruins.Locals alleged that a builder, in connivance with police and administrative officials, carried out the demolition despite objections and the presence of a police outpost near the site along the Yamuna.A local resident, Kapil Vajpayee, told TOI, ""I filed several complaints with the authorities, but no action was taken. So far, 70% of the structure has been destroyed.""Agra DM Aravind Mallappa Bangari confirmed that the authorities were ""aware"" of the issue. ""We have taken cognisance of the matter. Archaeological Survey of India and the revenue department have been directed to conduct a probe. The sub-divisional magistrate has been asked to visit the site and present a report. Meanwhile, no further changes will be allowed at the site,"" Bangari said.Archibald Campbell Carlyle's 1871 report provided detailed insights into the architecture of Mubarak Manzil. A marble plaque at the site indicated it was built by Aurangzeb after his victory at the Battle of Samugarh. Historian Rajkishore Raje added that Aurangzeb renamed Dara Shikoh's palace to commemorate his triumph in the same battle.The 1868 map of Agra places Mubarak Manzil near the pontoon bridge, where the current iron bridge stands. During British rule, the East Indian Railway used it as a goods depot. The structure's red sandstone base, arched lower floors, and minarets reflected a mix of Mughal and British architectural influences.","Mubarak Manzil, a Mughal heritage site also known as Aurangzeb's Haveli, was largely demolished in Agra just three months after the state archaeological department issued a notification to protect the monument.

Government to probe recovery of Starlink devices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-probe-recovery-of-starlink-devices/articleshow/116898510.cms,"'Starlink has refused to provide details citing data privacy laws'



NEW DELHI: Starlink may be heading into fresh regulatory trouble in India with satellite communications devices of the Elon Musk-run company finding its way into the hands of insurgents and smugglers, raising red flags with the home ministry and the department of telecommunications.What has made the situation even more challenging for the government is that Starlink has refused to provide details of those who originally procured the devices, citing data privacy laws. Concerned over an alien, and illegal, communications channel being used by unlawful elements, MHA has now asked DoT to look into the matter immediately and take ""appropriate steps"", sources said. Questions sent to Starlink did not elicit a response.For Starlink, the recovery of satcom devices in India in the hands of unlawful elements comes at a time when the licence application of the company has been pending with government due to security issues.""Government had written to Starlink to know about the ownership of the devices after their recovery with drug smugglers in Andaman & Nicobar Islands, but the company has refused to provide details citing data privacy laws,"" said a source. Government acted after a probe into the biggest drug haul of 6,000kg of methamphetamine in the Andamans showed that smugglers from Myanmar were using the Starlink satellite internet services for navigation.Andamans DGP Hargobinder Singh Dhaliwal said the smugglers directly operated phones with satellites, creating a WiFi hotspot.In the other case in Manipur, Starlink satcom devices were found with insurgents during a raid by Army and Assam Rifles.When a user on X pointed out the recovery of equipment in Manipur and tagged Musk, the billionaire CEO denied operationalisation of the company's services, ""This is false. Starlink satellite beams are turned off over India."" There is a growing concern with the security establishment over instances of the devices finding their way into the hands of unlawful elements.Teams representing Starlink have been meeting officials in DoT and MHA, seeking clarification around any objections while giving out details around their plans. government officials said they have sought fresh details around ""security aspects"" from Starlink and added that permission will be given after government was satisfied with the measures taken to control illegal communication setups as well as data movement.","Starlink has refused to provide details of those who originally procured the devices, citing data privacy laws.

Iran offers help to Kerala nurse on Yemen death row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iran-offers-help-to-kerala-nurse-on-yemen-death-row/articleshow/116898420.cms,"A senior Iranian official said Thursday that Tehran was ready to take up the case of Nimisha Priya , a nurse from Kerala sentenced to death in Yemen for the murder of a Yemeni national. ""We are ready to do whatever we can as it involves a humanitarian issue,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Iran-backed Houthi rebels remain in control of large parts of Yemen, including capital Sanaa.After the Yemen president last month upheld the death sentence of Nimisha, in jail since 2017, India said it was in touch with her family members and was extending all possible help to them in exploring legal options.Iran's offer of help came ahead of another round of foreign office consultations with India in which Tehran is expected to call for revival of trade ties, including resumption of oil supplies to India. Unlike with Iran, India has not just continued to import crude from Russia despite international sanctions but also ramped up Russian supplies.The official also spoke about bilateral ties with India and the need to explore opportunities to enhance trade ties, despite the sanctions Iran is facing. ""We don't want to impose any hardship on India but there are opportunities that can be explored. The nature of sanctions against Iran and Russia are different but it's still a legitimate question why India has continued to import energy from Russia but not Iran. We need to see how this issue can be addressed,"" said the official.Speaking about the conflict in Gaza and the overall West Asia situation, the official said Israel's military actions in Gaza had only worked to further ""internationalise'' the Palestine issue. ""The core issue is the occupation of Palestine and it must be addressed. We want to see an independent Palestine state. Nobody can erase it from the global agenda,"" said the official, who also backed stronger counter-terrorism cooperation with India in the context of recent developments in Syria.Also read: 'Last-min pardon' the hope for kin of nurse on Yemen death row","Iran is ready to take up the case of Nimisha Priya, a nurse from Kerala sentenced to death in Yemen for the murder of a Yemeni national.

Pay current market rate if land compensation delayed: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pay-current-market-rate-if-land-compensation-delayed-supreme-court/articleshow/116898328.cms,"Payout using '03 land rate would be travesty of justice, says SC

Supreme Court on Thursday employed its exclusive powers under Article 142 of Constitution to rule that landowners are entitled to current market value of their plots if payment of compensation for their land acquired by a government is delayed for a long time.The order, which will bring relief and adequate recompense to many farmers and others across the country, was triggered by a petition against Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board, which in 2003 notified the acquisition of thousands of acres of land to construct the Bengaluru-Mysuru Infrastructure Corridor project.While land parcels were taken over, no award for compensation to the owners was passed. It took contempt of court proceedings for the land acquisition officer to pass award for compensation in 2019. However, he based the compensation on rates prevalent in 2003.Ruling that the value of land must be computed as of '19, Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said, ""Right to property ceased to be a fundamental right by the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, 1978. However, it continues to be a human right in a welfare state, and a constitutional right under Article 300A of the Constitution.""Justice Gavai said the landowners have been deprived of their legitimate dues for almost 22 years and if the market value of the land is computed as of 2003, they would stand to lose considerably. ""It is, therefore, of utmost importance that the determination of the award and disbursal of compensation in case of acquisition of land should be made with promptitude,"" he said.In 2019, the landowners protested when the then land acquisition officer based the compensation on rates prevalent in 2003, but lost their challenge before a single judge of Karnataka HC. They appealed the adverse order, but a division bench ruled against them.Setting aside the concurrent judgments of the single judge and division bench of HC and holding Karnataka government and KIADB solely responsible for non-payment of compensation till now, the SC bench said, ""We find that it is a fit case wherein this courtshould direct shifting of the date for determination of the market value of the land in question of the appellants.""Gavai said, ""If the compensation to be awarded at the market value as of the year 2003 is permitted, it would amount to permitting a travesty of justice and making the constitutional provisions under Article 300A a mockery.""In the interest of justice, the bench ordered the land acquisition officer to compute the market value of the acquired land as on April 22, 2019. It permitted the land owners to challenge the award as per law, if they so wished.","The order will bring relief and adequate recompense to many farmers and others across the country.

After murder, Utkarsh typed suicide note on dad's phone to dodge cops

NAGPUR: A 21-year-old third-year engineering student, Utkarsh Dakhole , throttled his mother to death, waited with the body for around 2 hours, and then fatally stabbed his father when he returned to their New Khasala residence near Kamptee Road, on December 26.He was apparently angry over being told to shift to ITI after he failed his physics paper thrice.Utkarsh lied to his sister about their parents going on a meditation trip to Bengaluru, and kept her away from home at a relative's house, till the smell from the decomposing bodies led to the discovery of the gruesome crime on Wednesday. Utkarsh had also penned a fake suicide note, and saved a screenshot of it as a wallpaper, on his father's cellphone.The New Khasala area woke up on the first day of the new year to the news of the double murder of the Dakhole couple by their son. Sources said Utkarsh's father, Leeladhar, an employee with Koradi thermal power station, slapped him on December 25, asking him to give up engineering and shift to their native place at Bailwada. Leeladhar had also told Utkarsh to take admission in ITI, and take up farming on their ancestral agricultural land, as he had failed in physics paper for the last three years.Utkarsh's mother, Aruna, a teacher, too had relentlessly urged him to discontinue engineering. This had angered Utkarsh, who was the younger of two siblings. On December 26, Utkarsh's father had gone to attend some last rites, and his sister had gone to her college. Utkarsh first throttled his mother to death and left her body on the bed in the bedroom of the one-storeyed house.Utkarsh Dakhole (21) allegedly killed his parents at their New Khasala residence near Kamptee Road, on December 26. The crime reportedly stemmed from Utkarsh's anger after being told to shift to ITI following his failure in the physics paper for the third time in engineering.Utkarsh first throttled his mother, Aruna, to death and left her body on the bed in the bedroom. When his father, Leeladhar, returned home two hours later, Utkarsh attacked him from behind as he tried to enter the bathroom. Utkarsh stabbed him with a knife he purchased from Kamal Chowk.Police sources said Leeladhar, even after being stabbed, tried to calm his son down and sort out the matter. A profusely bleeding Leeladhar told Utkarsh to call his mother Aruna, so the three could sit together and discuss a solution. Utkarsh then allegedly revealed that he had murdered his mother.When Utkarsh asked whether his injured father still wanted him to withdraw from engineering college, Leeladhar apparently said he would still insist he discontinue. This was the point where Utkarsh pinned him down and stabbed him repeatedly until he fell motionless. After the murder, Utkarsh typed a suicide note on his father's cellphone and saved it as wallpaper.Utkarsh then called up his sister and picked her up at Automotive Square while on way back from her college. He told her that their parents had left for Bengaluru for a 10-day meditation camp as they got a good package deal.The brother and sister duo then went to their kin's residence at Bailwada. Utkarsh's sister tried calling their father, but his cellphone was switched off, which Utkarsh explained was because of the ban on mobiles at the meditation camp.On Thursday, Utkarsh got a call from the neighbours complaining of a strong stench from their house, which was locked from inside. The neighbours forced the door open after Utkarsh reached the place. The drawing room was found locked from outside.The neighbours were stunned to find Leeladhar dead in the drawing room, and Aruna in the bedroom. The cops were alerted. Kapil Nagar police station in-charge Mahesh Andhale and Zonal DCP Niketan Kadam too reached the place.A cop said, ""Utkarsh had switched off the timeline and location of his father's mobile phone and taken it with him. He placed the cellphone somewhere in the room on returning with the neighbours, and told them he just found it. Police were intrigued why the location service was turned off. Also, the drawing room was locked from outside. Hence, it could not have been a case of suicide.

The number game

'Chacha will be voted out'



NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Wednesday said he was ready to ""forgive and welcome"" Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to the opposition INDIA boc.""Our doors are open (for Nitish). He should also unbolt his gates. This would facilitate movement of people from both sides,"" Lalu Yadav said.Reacting to the RJD chief's remark, CM Nitish Kumar gave no affirmative response.""Kya bol rahe hain (What are you saying)"" was all the JD(U) boss said in response to queries from journalists about Prasad's fresh offer, according to news agency PTI.Meanwhile, former JD(U) president Rajiv Ranjan Singh ""Lalan"" snapped when asked about Lalu Yadav's remark.""The NDA is strong. JD(U) and BJP are united. It is a free society and anybody can say whatever he pleases. It is for Lalu ji to say more on his own utterances"", Lalan Singh said.Nitish Kumar, who ditched the INDIA bloc after spearheading its formation last year, joined the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.With the switch, though Nitish managed to remain the CM, RJD leader and Lalu's son Tejashwi Yadav had to step down as his deputy.Just hours after he resigned, the Janata Dal (United) chief took oath as the chief minister for a record ninth time.Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis also took a dig at Lalu Yadav, saying his ""dream will always remain dreams (Mungeri Lal ke Haseen Sapne hi rahenge). They will never be fulfilled.""Things seemed to fare smoothly for the NDA until the opposition got a shot in the arms after the Lok Sabha poll results.In the parliamentary election, BJP missed out on the majority numbers as it won only 240 seats, 32 less than the halfway mark.Whereas, the JDU won 12 seats in the Lok Sabha elections and emerged as a key ally in the NDA, positioning Nitish Kumar as a crucial player in the ruling alliance.The BJP-led NDA at the Centre majorly hinges on the JDU and Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu's TDP, which won 16 seats for the ruling coalition to cross the majority figure of the 272 seats.If the table turns in Bihar, the INDIA bloc with 235 seats, would have a direct advantage of an additional 12 seats, an opportunity that the opposition has been eying since June 4 results.Unlike his father, Tejaswi Yadav was a little hard-hitting with his remark as he claimed that the new year will mark the ""departure"" of the CM Nitish-led NDA government in Bihar.Tejashwi Yadav, who is now leader of the opposition, was talking to reporters shortly after governor designate Arif Mohammad Khan left his house in Patna.""It is too cold. Keep yourselves warm but do not make any wild guesses.

Poll Which of the following astronomical events are you most excited to witness in early January 2025? The January ‘SuperSun’ and Moon-planet conjunction The Quadrantid meteor shower

Why is it named Quadrantids?

Viewing details

The initial weekend of 2025 presents multiple astronomical occurrences, including a brief meteor display, a January 'SuperSun', and a twilight conjunction of the Moon and a planet.A remarkable celestial display welcomes New Year 2025, as the Quadrantids, visible from December 27 until January 16, reaches maximum intensity on January 3 and 4.A meteor shower is a celestial spectacle that occurs when Earth travels through cosmic debris trails. This natural phenomenon creates streaks of light in the night sky, often referred to as 'shooting stars' by observers.The debris originates primarily from comets, which shed particles as they orbit the sun. These particles, ranging from tiny dust grains to small rocks, remain in space along the comet's orbital path. When Earth intersects these debris trails during its annual orbit, the particles enter our atmosphere at extremely high speeds.While most meteor showers are annual events, their intensity can vary year to year. This variation occurs because Earth passes through different densities of debris trails during each encounter. Some years may produce exceptional displays when Earth passes through particularly dense regions of cosmic debris.Meteor showers are predictable events that occur at specific times each year. Each shower is named after the constellation from which the meteors appear to originate, known as the radiant point. For example, the Perseids appear to come from Perseus, while the Leonids seem to emerge from Leo.This shower's name derives from Quadrans Muralis, an obsolete 18th-century constellation, referencing the quadrant instrument historically used for celestial measurements. Contemporary observers locate the Quadrantids' radiant in Boötes constellation, near the Big Dipper in the northern sky. Discovered in 1825, the shower's source remained unknown until 2003, when a Lowell Observatory astronomer identified asteroid 2003 EH1 as its origin.The intensity of meteor showers varies significantly. Some showers produce only a few meteors per hour, while others can create spectacular displays with hundreds of meteors visible each hour. This rate is known as the Zenithal Hourly Rate (ZHR).The Quadrantid meteors reach their peak on Thursday, with calculations suggesting a ZHR of 80. Viewing conditions are favourable with a 27% waxing crescent Moon. The minimal lunar illumination creates excellent observation conditions for the 2025 'Quads'.The visibility of meteor showers depends on several factors. Dark skies are essential, as artificial light pollution can obscure the meteors. The phase of the moon also plays a crucial role - a new or crescent moon provides darker skies than a full moon. Weather conditions, particularly clear skies, are vital for optimal viewing.The best viewing time is typically between midnight and dawn, when your location on Earth faces the direction of Earth's orbit. This timing means more meteors are likely to be visible as they enter the atmosphere.Meteors may appear any night, but showers occur when Earth passes through comet or asteroid debris orbiting the sun. These particles, sometimes minuscule, create luminous streaks whilst burning in Earth's atmosphere.Annual meteor showers have predictable timeframes lasting days or weeks, with peak activity occurring during Earth's passage through the densest debris sections. Meteors appear to emanate from a single celestial point during observation.Peak activity occurs between 15.00-18.00 Universal Time (UT) on Friday, providing optimal viewing for northern Pacific observers at dawn.North American and European observers should consider watching during the early hours of Friday and Saturday, as peak timing may vary. However, its peak time in India will be on the night between Thursday and Friday.","The Quadrantids meteor shower will be visible from December 27 until January 16.

""J&K and Ladakh Through the Ages""

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said that Article 370 had ""sown the seeds of separatism in the valley"", which ultimately evolved into terrorism. Praising the Modi government's ""strong resolution"" that led to the abrogation of the article, Shah described the decision as the catalyst for establishing a ""Naya Kashmir "".Speaking at the launch of the book, Shah said, ""Article 370 sowed the seeds of separatism in the valley which later turned into terrorism. Article 370 spread a myth that the connection between Kashmir and India is temporary. There was terrorism there for decades and the country kept watching. After the abrogation of Article 370 , terrorism is reduced by 70%. Congress can accuse us of whatever they want.""He further described these articles as major roadblocks to Kashmir's unity with the nation and hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's leadership in abrogating Articles 370 and 35A, which also helped revitalise the languages of Kashmir through the creation of two Union Territories.""We not only controlled the terrorism, but the PM Modi government also demolished the terror eco-system from the valley.

This began the development of Kashmir along with the rest of the country,"" Shah said.""I want to thank PM Modi for giving a new life to the languages of Kashmir by making two Union Territories. PM Modi insisted that every language spoken in Kashmir should be given importance and has to be included. This proves how a PM of any country can be sensitive towards the languages of the country,"" he added.He further asserted that Kashmir is also ""known as the land of Kashyap. It may be possible that it may have been named after him.""According to Shah the bookpresents all factors in detail, from ""the art in the ruins of old temples that proves that Kashmir is a part of India only. All the history from Buddhism, to demolished temples, to the use of Sanskrit, to the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, to Dogra reign, to the mistakes made after 1947 and to their rectification, all the 8000 years of history are included in this book.""On August 5, 2019, Modi government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and reorganised the region into two Union Territories. This decision sparked a huge political and social transformation in a region that had enjoyed special rights since Independence.Earlier speaking to news agency ANI, chief minister Omar Abdullah commented on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir's statehood, stating, ""The BJP should talk about the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir if they are so worried about the state.""","Union home minister Amit Shah said that Article 370 had ""sown the seeds of separatism in the valley"", which ultimately evolved into terrorism.

BHOPAL/INDORE: Trucks carrying hazardous waste left over from the 1984 gas tragedy began rolling out of the abandoned Union Carbide site in Bhopal for a disposal plant in Pithampur, 230km away, on Wednesday night, even as workers of other factories in the industrial estate near Indore voiced concern about their safety.""Transportation to Pithampur has begun. The convoy has been fortified with the highest security protocol ever witnessed in movement of industrial waste in the country,"" said MP gas relief & rehabilitation department director Swatantra Kumar Singh.TOI had reported Wednesday that the trucks were loaded and ready to move. At 9pm, the convoy carrying 337 metric tons of waste in sealed containers set out from Bhopal, escorted by police and emergency vehicles along a green corridor.Forty years of wait and four days of suspense had ended. The scars of the world's worst industrial disaster may never heal, but a chapter from the tragic episode is drawing to a close. It would take about seven hours to reach the final destination, said Singh.The convoy of 40 vehicles stretched over a kilometre. Twelve trucks are carrying the hazardous cargo. It's a no-halt, no-stop journey to Pithampur Waste Management Pvt Ltd, where the waste will be incinerated. Five district administrations are on high alert. Around 700 security personnel have been deployed for the convoy.""The 337 MT of UCIL waste will undergo scientific disposal within three to nine months,"" said Singh.It took strong words from Madhya Pradesh HC to get the administration moving on the long-pending disposal of this toxic waste. ""Are you waiting for another tragedy,"" a division bench of Chief Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Vivek Jain had asked the authorities in their Dec 3 order. HC set a deadline of four weeks to shift the hazardous waste for disposal.Singh has repeatedly assured all safety factors have been taken care of and there is no risk to the environment, land, or people around the disposal plant at Pithampur.On Wednesday, aiming to ease anxiety among Pithampur residents and industrialists about the Union Carbide waste disposal, MP pollution control board regional officer in Indore Shriniwas Dwivedi issued a video statement explaining the safety precautions. ""A special shed has been created with a concrete floor. It is leakproof,"" Dwivedi says in the video, adding: ""No activity will be carried out that will affect the people, farm, property, land or environment.""At Pithampur, however, workers at other plants are worried about potential fallout. ""Employees are scared. We are receiving calls from family members of our employees enquiring about the situation in Pithampur. Some employees have requested leave. The circumstances are extraordinary and everyone is under immense pressure,"" said Dr Darshan Kataria, an industrialist at Pithampur.Another industrialist from Pithampur Sector 2, where the waste disposal factory is situated, said he has lost count of calls made to various govt departments and fellow industrialists regarding contingency measures.""What occurred in Bhopal was an unfortunate accident, but what is happening now can be handled by taking everyone in confidence. It presents a difficult situation and is deeply unsettling for us as we cannot be immune to the problem,"" said Rajendra Modi, director of an engineering products manufacturing unit in Pithampur.Local industrialists say govt officials neither initiated discussions with them nor apprised them about safety measures implemented for industries and residents in proximity to the disposal facility.Swatantra Kumar Singh has, through public statements, repeatedly allayed safety concerns and assured disposal and incineration shall be conducted under expert supervision without any adverse consequences.",Trucks carrying hazardous waste left over from the 1984 gas tragedy began rolling out of the abandoned Union Carbide site in Bhopal.

They are sending goons and murderers across the border. This is an inside job by the BSF, supported by a blueprint from the central government.

Why are you not protesting? The border is in the hands of the BSF. If anyone thinks that they are intruding into Bengal and maligning the Trinamool, let them be warned that the Trinamool Congress does not do these things. Don’t abuse Trinamool by supporting the wrongdoings of BSF,” Banerjee said, as reported by ANI.Her remarks come amidst a growing political slugfest over border management and allegations of partisanship.Banerjee also added that she had repeatedly raised her concerns with the central government but claimed her warnings were ignored. She stated that while the TMC would adhere to the government’s decisions, it would not hesitate to oppose actions that threaten the state’s peace and stability.Meanwhile, BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari accused the West Bengal government of obstructing efforts to acquire land for building BSF outposts along the Bangladesh border earlier this week. Adhikari alleged that the state government’s lack of cooperation with the Centre and the ministry of home affairs was hindering national security .“I gave out the details of how non-cooperation is being done (by the state government) with the Centre and MHA... Joint meetings are not being held, no coordination with central government agencies, and police released all the 1,500 intruders arrested by BSF last year and 1,000 this year,” Adhikari claimed. He further accused the state of withholding land for 17 proposed BSF outposts and using the assembly to pass resolutions against the BSF.Adhikari’s allegations extended to the state’s handling of transborder crime. He alleged that many criminals operating across the border are allegedly shielded by the ruling party. “Politics should be stopped for the sake of the country and the Bengali community,” he said, urging the state to prioritize collaboration with the central government.","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has accused the Border Security Force ( BSF ) of aiding infiltrators to enter India to destabilise the state.Banerjee warned that if such activities persisted, her party would stage protests against the BSF.

Slightly more rainfall than normal in Jan, forecasts IMD

NEW DELHI: 2024 was by far the warmest year on record in the country since 1901, IMD said Wednesday. It also noted that the last three months of the year (Oct-Dec) together were the warmest on record whereas Oct 2024, individually, was the warmest month in 123 years.With an annual mean temperature of 25.75 degrees Celsius, 2024 was 0.65 degree C above the long-term average (1991-2020 period). The previous warmest year, 2016, had an anomaly of 0.54 degree C. As annual averages go, the difference of 0.11 degree C between the mean temperature in 2016 and 2024 is quite huge.The record heat in India was in sync with worldwide rise in annual average temperatures as global warming accelerates. World Meteorological Organisation has observed that 2024 was globally the warmest year on record, exceeding the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degrees C of warming above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels for the first time. This follows on from the record-breaking 1.45 degrees C rise in 2023, the previous globally warmest year on record.Releasing the outlook for January, IMD said monthly minimum (night) temperatures are likely to be ""above normal"" (warmer) over most of India except parts of UP and Rajasthan, some parts of MP and Gujarat and portions of east India such as Bihar, where normal to below normal temperatures are likely.IMD chief M Mohapatra, however, said ""above-normal cold wave days"" are expected over western and northern parts of central India during the month of Jan.Specifically asked about the weather situation in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh (Jan 13-Feb 26), Mohapatra said though there was a possibility of below normal (colder) minimum (night) temperature during the period, IMD would provide more precise forecast closer to the religious festival.Probabilistic forecast map for Jan, released by Met department, shows the possibility of colder day and night (normal to below normal minimum/maximum temperatures) in the region, Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, during the month.Otherwise, the monthly maximum (day) temperatures for Jan are likely to be above normal (warmer) for ""most parts of the country except some parts of the northwest, central and adjoining east India and central parts of South Peninsula"" where it is likely to be normal to below normal.As far as rainfall is concerned, Jan is likely to witness slightly more rainfall than normal rains for the month - a situation which may be helpful for the standing rabi (winter sown) crops during the period if its distribution is uniform.IMD said, ""Monthly rainfall for Jan over north India consisting of seven meteorological subdivisions (East Uttar Pradesh, West Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh) is most likely to be above normal,""It said the monthly rainfall even over the country in Jan is also most likely to be above normal.

Of the Rs 1,592 crore received by TMC through bonds, Rs 542 crore came from Future Gaming.The lottery king contributed Rs 503 crore to DMK, out of the party's total bond income of Rs 632 crore. BJP (Rs 100 crore), YSRCP (Rs 154 crore) and Congress (Rs 50 crore) were among other beneficiaries of his benevolence.The probe further found that Martin had launched more than 350 companies and SPVs (special purpose vehicles) to acquire properties from 'proceeds of crime', many of them purchased by giving prize-winning lotteries to sellers of the property.His relatives and friends were appointed lottery distributors who kept the prize-winning lotteries and later, after the draw, claimed prizes which ranged ""from a few lakhs to crores"" of rupees. These lotteries were neither sold to the public nor returned to the state government s, as mandated by law. The agency found evidence of unsold bundles of tickets, including prize-winning ones.ED's latest findings showed that Martin had sold at least two Assets from the attached assets.

The preface of the book, with the Shiva temple built by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century CE on its cover, says, ""This volume narrates with rare illustrations, many being published for the first time, how the story of India's spiritual and cultural legacy is traceable to the grandeur of ancient Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.""Speaking at the launch in the presence of education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Shah said, ""Kashmir is not just a geographical entity; it is a cultural and spiritual cornerstone of India."" He praised the publication as an effort to challenge ""long-standing myths about India's unity, particularly during the colonial era when a false narrative was pushed about India never being one nation"": a reference to the grouse that the notion about J&K being a distinct entity deserving of special status was manufactured as part of the effort to encourage separatism.""Kashmir has been the land of our sages and other famous Indian cultural figures. Sage Kashyap meditated there for a long time. It is possible that the land was named after him,"" he said.Shah said during the colonial period, efforts were made to ""break the confidence of our people, leading to a myth that India was never one country"", adding history written during the British era might not have necessarily had ill intentions, but due to their limited knowledge, their interpretation was flawed.""Artificial constructs like these do not last long, and PM Modi's firm resolve marked the beginning of a new chapter in Kashmir's development. No power in the world can separate it from us,"" Shah said, reinforcing govt's stance on the region's integration. He also called for a fresh approach to history, urging historians to ""write our history with confidence, based on facts and evidence"", and to embrace the truth of India's legacy. ""It's time to move away from history written to please rulers and reclaim the truth with pride,"" he said, stressing on documenting the nation's past from an Indian perspective.","The Modi government appears to have moved on to project the state as being one of the sources of India's spiritual and cultural tradition.

SIT has filed chargesheet in 11 other cases.This FIR is part of the nine FIRs, which were investigated by the SIT after a lapse of 35 years and closed due to lack of evidence. For PIL petitioner Manjit Singh GK, advocate Jagjit Singh Chhabra had sought copies of these nine FIRs to enable complainants/kins of victims to file protest petitions.Chhabra informed the court that appeals against acquittal of accused in four anti-Sikh riots cases are coming up for hearing before the Allahabad HC on Jan 7, but the complainants and kin of victims are unable to afford good criminal lawyers because of lack of finances.The bench asked the Allahabad HC Legal Services Committee to engage best of the leading private criminal lawyers practicing in the HC to assist the court on behalf of the complainants and kins of victims during the hearing of these appeals. It said the professional fees of these lawyers would be borne by the state government.UP govt also informed the SC that trial in 11 anti-Sikh riot cases is going on and that it has designated two special public prosecutors for the purpose. SC asked the District Legal Services Authority to engage leading criminal lawyers of trial courts to assist the complainants and asked the trial courts to give them adequate opportunity to argue.Chhabra informed the court that some of the complainants and paroikar Surjit Singh Oberoi have faced threats from certain elements. The bench asked the UP government , which said it has nominated four senior police officials, to provide adequate security to the complainants and the paroikar. The court had earlier granted security to Kuldip Singh Bhogal, co-petitioner with Manjit Singh GK, who had moved the SC for reopening of the killings of around 130 Sikhs in Kanpur during the anti-Sikh riots of 1984.","The sketchy details of the FIR, provided by UP govt standing counsel Ruchira Goel to a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan, revealed that on November 1, 1984, a day after the assassination of PM Indira Gandhi, around 150-200 persons barged into the house of retired armed forces personnel Diwan Singh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116894815,imgsize-1428575,width-400,resizemode-4/116894815.jpg"

We continue to pray. We are told the death sentence will be executed within a month of the president's sanction...Can't imagine life without her (Nimisha),"" the Palakkad native's husband Tomy Thomas , an autorickshaw driver from Thodupuzha in Idukki, told TOI Thursday.Nimisha's mother Prema Kumari, who is in the Yemeni capital of Sana'a, made an impassioned appeal to the Indian government the previous day to do whatever it takes to save her daughter's life.Tomy said ""mistakes may have happened"", for which he sought forgiveness and support for his wife's pardon from the family of the victim, Talal Abdo Mahdi. If the victim's family and community leaders in Yemen accept blood money in return for pardon, Nimisha may yet be saved, he said.Tomy spoke to his wife, who is in a central prison, two days before the presidential sanction of her death sentence. ""During our brief conversation over the phone, Nimisha was optimistic and talked about reuniting with us - our daughter Michele, my mother-in-law Prema Kumari, and I,"" he said.Since his wife was imprisoned, the auto driver has been working extra hours to pay for the education of their daughter in a boarding school in Kothamangalam.Tomy described Nimisha as ""gentle, warm, and incapable of harming anyone"".Mahdi, for whose murder Nimisha has been convicted and sentenced, was her business ""sponsor"". She sought Mahdi's help to run her clinic in Sana'a, as mandated by Yemeni law. Mahdi allegedly tortured Nimisha and illegally seized her passport, leading to his murder.A trial court handed her the death sentence in 2018. An appeals court upheld it.""Recently, she told me that her status as a medical caregiver has earned her affection of both inmates and officials at the prison. They celebrated her birthday there, ensuring that her day was special. We didn't even wish her in the midst of the stress, but she said she felt as if she had a family in prison,"" Tomy said.Tomy had accompanied Nimisha to Yemen in 2012, just a year after their marriage. Michele was born there. Father and daughter returned home in 2014 due to the civil war in Yemen. Nimisha stayed back to run her clinic, which she had started by investing her and Tomy's savings. ""We are now in a mess emotionally and financially.

Himanta Biswa Sarma says 'we should not encourage Bangladeshi Hindus to come to India'; Congress hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/himanta-biswa-sarma-says-we-should-not-encourage-bangladeshi-hindus-to-come-to-india-congress-hits-back/articleshow/116859794.cms,"Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma (Pic credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister and senior BJP leader Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday said Hindus staying in Bangladesh should not be encouraged to come to India as they are patriotic Bangladeshis who do not want to leave their land despite ""tremendous atrocities"" they face there. He also praised the Hindus in Bangladesh for acting ""very maturely"" by not coming to India. Sarma's remarks evoked a strong retort from the Congress which accused the BJP and RSS of exploiting the plight of Hindus for their political gains.""I explained why the Hindus are not coming. I think the numbers are very less. Whoever wanted to come must have come earlier, thirty or forty years back. These are the people who do not want to come out of Bangladesh. They must have some affinity to the soil of the land. They must be patriotic Bangladeshis. Even after tremendous atrocity they do not want to come out of Bangladesh because their forefathers were in that land. I think we should also not encourage them to come into India. Prime Minister is working overtime to give security and to create a condition of security in Bangladesh itself,"" Sarma said.""Bangladesh Hindu people are acting very maturely and they are not coming. At least we have not detected any Bangladeshi Hindu in Assam in the last five months,"" he added.""We have put the security forces on high alert at the International Border following the unrest in Bangladesh to check infiltration. The police have detected a good number of illegal immigrants on a daily basis along the International Border. However, no Hindu infiltrator from Bangladesh was arrested in the last five months,"" the Assam chief minister said calling the situation ""very worrying.""Reacting sharply to the Assam chief minister's remarks, Congress leader Rashid Alvi accused the BJP and RSS of exploiting the Hindus.""The statement of Assam CM proves that the BJP and RSS only exploit the Hindu community and they have nothing to do with their problems. The BJP and its government at the Centre are anti-Hindu. They are not bothered about what is happening with the Hindus in Bangladesh. Their only objective is to talk about Hindus during elections and provke their sentiments for political gains,"" Alvi said.""There are a lot of Hindus in Bangladesh. Indian government raises this issue only within India for political gains,"" he added.The Assam chief minister also blamed the textile factory owners, especially in Tamil Nadu, for encouraging the infiltration of workers from Bangladesh.""After the unrest in Bangladesh, the textile industry collapsed there. So workers working in the textile industry in Bangladesh are coming to India. They are trying to enter the country to go to the textile industries in Tamil Nadu, and ""owners of these industries are incentivising them to come to get cheap labour. I have also discussed this issue with Union home minister Amit Shah in my last meeting. So this is a very worrying issue for us because we have never detected so many infiltrators before,"" Himanta Biswa Sarma said.The Hindus in Bangladesh have been faced increased atrocities amidst the ongoing political turmoil after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina 's ouster in August last year. Attacks targeting minorities, primarily Hindus, have increased in Bangladesh since then.The Centre for Democracy, Pluralism and Human Rights (CDPHR) last month presented a report on the state of minorities in Bangladesh. The report titled 'Bangladesh Minorities Under Siege: A Wake-Up Call for the International Community' details the incidents of violence and unrest affecting the Hindu communities in the country in the wake of the political changes.According to the report, there were 190 reported cases of looting, 32 homes were set on fire, 16 temples were desecrated and two incidents of sexual violence were recorded between August 5 and 9 after Hasina's resignation.By August 20, the number of reported incidents had increased significantly, with 2,010 total cases of violence against the Hindus, including the desecration of 69 temples and attacks on 157 families, the report states.The report claims that the situation for religious minorities continued to deteriorate despite the formation of an interim government under Muhammad Yunus on August 8.",Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said Hindus staying in Bangladesh should not be encouraged to come to India.

"Shamsud Din Jabbar’s tragic decline: $120k job, debt, failed marriages and radicalization behind New Orleans attack",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shamsud-din-jabbar-a-120k-salary-financial-struggles-failed-marriages-and-radicalization-behind-new-orleans-attack/articleshow/116868022.cms,"Despite his relatively high-paying position, Jabbar’s life was marked by financial turmoil that escalated during his second divorce in 2022.

A high-earning professional struggling with debt

A fall from stability to squalor

From military service to terror

A deadly attack on New Year’s eve

Shamsud Din Jabbar , the 42-year-old behind the deadly New Year’s Eve attack in New Orleans, had a stable job as an employee at the prominent accounting firm Deloitte, reportedly earning an annual salary of $120,000. However, despite his relatively high-paying position, Jabbar’s life was marked by financial turmoil that escalated during his second divorce in 2022.New York Post reports reveal that Jabbar, who had a background in IT and military service, was deeply in debt. In emails to his ex-wife’s lawyer, Jabbar admitted to owing over $27,000 in overdue home payments and stated he was at risk of foreclosure. Furthermore, he confessed to racking up more than $16,000 in credit card debt while paying court fees and expenses for a second home. His real estate business, which he had hoped would provide a financial lifeline, had suffered a staggering loss of more than $28,000 the previous year.Jabbar’s personal life took a dramatic turn after his second divorce. He had been married twice and had faced ongoing financial struggles , including child support disputes with his first wife, who sued him in 2012. Despite his job at Deloitte and his military service, Jabbar's financial issues pushed him to a breaking point.In the years following his military service, Jabbar's situation deteriorated, and he found himself living in a dilapidated trailer park in Houston, Texas. The once-promising professional now lived in squalor, surrounded by sheep and goats in his yard. His neighbors, many of whom were Muslim immigrants, knew little about him, with one describing Jabbar as a “simple person” who kept to himself, reported the Post.Jabbar’s journey from a decorated military veteran to a terrorist suspect is as complex as it is tragic. He served in the US Army for over a decade, deploying to Afghanistan, where he worked as an IT specialist. He left the Army in 2015 as a staff sergeant after serving both active duty and as a reservist. Despite the stability of his military career, Jabbar struggled with personal and financial issues that seemed to worsen over time.In a 2020 YouTube video promoting his real estate business, Jabbar portrayed himself as a dependable and trustworthy Texan. However, in the months leading up to the New Orleans attack, he reportedly became more isolated and radicalized. The FBI revealed that Jabbar had made references to the Quran and was reportedly influenced by ISIS ideology , a connection underscored by an ISIS flag found on the truck he used during the attack.On New Year’s Day, Jabbar carried out a premeditated terror attack , driving a rented Ford F-150 truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 15 people. Following the attack, he exchanged gunfire with police officers and was killed during the confrontation. Authorities confirmed that Jabbar had an ISIS flag on his vehicle, and law enforcement is continuing to investigate potential accomplices.Jabbar’s financial struggles, marital issues, and apparent radicalization have painted a picture of a man who spiraled from a successful career and military service to a life of financial ruin and violent extremism.","Shamsud Din Jabbar served in the US Army for over a decade, deploying to Afghanistan.
