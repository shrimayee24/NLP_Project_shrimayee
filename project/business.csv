NEW DELHI: India continues to fall short of basic global healthcare capacity standards, the Union Health Ministry told Parliament, acknowledging that the country remains well below the WHO benchmark for hospital beds even as patient load keeps rising nationwide.Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Health Prataprao Jadhav said that while IPHS 2022 mandates at least 1 bed per 1,000 people, several states still cannot meet even this minimum requirement — and remain far from the WHO norm of 3.5 beds per 1,000 population. State-wise data published in the government’s annual Rural Health Statistics and the latest Health Dynamics of India report shows large disparities, with populous states carrying some of the deepest deficits.On staffing, Jadhav said India has 13.86 lakh registered allopathic doctors and 7.51 lakh AYUSH practitioners; assuming 80% availability, the doctor–population ratio stands at 1:811. The nursing workforce has reached 42.94 lakh, with 5,253 institutions producing nearly 3.87 lakh nurses annually, yet significant vacancies remain across government hospitals.Despite a decade of expansion — medical colleges rising from 387 to 818, MBBS seats from 51,348 to 1,28,875, and postgraduate seats from 31,185 to 82,059 — many states continue to struggle with shortages of doctors, nurses and paramedics on the ground.The government has set up State Cancer Institutes, Tertiary Cancer Centres and oncology services in all new AIIMS campuses, but Jadhav admitted that India’s public-health capacity remains uneven, with rural districts and smaller states still far from meeting IPHS norms.He said filling vacancies, strengthening district and CHC infrastructure, and ensuring states comply with national standards will be critical as India works to close one of the world’s largest healthcare infrastructure gaps.","India continues to fall short of basic global healthcare capacity standards, the Union Health Ministry told Parliament.

Huge backlog: cancellations even in November, before the current crisis

IndiGo, one of the country's leading airlines, is currently grappling with significant operational disruptions, leading to widespread flight cancellations and delays across major cities such as Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, and Hyderabad.The airline has attributed these disruptions to a combination of factors, including technology glitches, schedule changes, and a shortage of crew due to updated regulatory requirements on crew rostering.The situation has resulted in mounting frustration among passengers, many of whom have been left stranded at airports with little prior notice of changes to their travel plans.In response, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has launched a probe into the airline's operations, seeking explanations and a concrete mitigation plan to address the ongoing issues.Here are the 10 things to know about the massive flight disruptions at several airports:Multiple major Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Hyderabad, were hit by a fresh wave of IndiGo flight cancellations as disruptions continued.On Wednesday, in Hyderabad alone, more than 40 arrivals and departures were cancelled, while in Kolkata, the airline scrapped both legs of at least 10 flights.Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru also saw over 42 IndiGo arrivals and departures cancelled, leaving several passengers stranded and adding to widespread frustration among flyers.Passengers from major cities hit by the disruption have been venting their anger over a wave of delays and cancellations, with many saying they received little or no prior intimation about changes to their flights.Several flyers have described being stuck at airports for hours with families, missing important meetings and onward connections as departure times were repeatedly pushed back or flights abruptly scrapped.IndiGo spokesperson issued a formal statement acknowledging the severe disruption caused to operations at major airports. The airline said its network had experienced significant operational irregularities over the past two days arising from multiple contributing factors.""We acknowledge that IndiGo’s operations have been significantly disrupted across the network for the past two days, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience caused,"" said the statement released on Wednesday.The airline assured passengers that it has put measures in place to restore normal operations at the earliest. However, it also cautioned that disruptions are likely to persist for up to the next 48 hours.""To contain the disruption and restore stability, we have initiated calibrated adjustments to our schedules. These measures will remain in place for the next 48 hours and will allow us to normalize our operations and progressively recover our punctuality across the network,"" they said, ""Our teams are working around the clock to ease customer discomfort and ensure operations stabilize as quickly as possible.""Aviation watchdog DGCA has launched a probe into IndiGo’s ongoing flight disruptions and asked the airline to explain the causes of the current chaos as well as detail its plans to curb cancellations and delays. The regulator has also sought a concrete mitigation plan from the airline after days of disorder at multiple airports.""IndiGo has been asked to report to DGCA, Headquarters, to present the facts leading to the current situation, along with plans to mitigate the ongoing delays & cancellations,"" it said in a statement.As per the data released by ministry of civil aviation, IndiGo provided the summary of its recent operational performance.Crew shortage was also cited by the airlines as the reason behind their grappling with the disruptions. ""Implementation of updated crew rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitations) had a negative compounding impact on our operations in a way that was not feasible to be anticipated,"" said IndiGo spokesperson in a statement.The airline also issued an explanation regarding FDTL, which is majorly affecting the crew operations. They pointed out that stricter rest and duty-hour requirements have significantly reduced crew availability at short notice, forcing the airline to cancel or reschedule flights whenever reserve pilots or cabin crew cannot be rostered within the new limits.Along with crew-related challenges, IndiGo also pointed to a range of other operational factors that together snowballed into the current disruption.""Minor technology glitches, schedule changes linked to the winter season, adverse weather conditions, increased congestion in the aviation system, and the implementation of updated crew rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitations) had a negative compounding impact on our operations in a way that was not feasible to be anticipated,"" IndiGo spokesperson said in a statement.IndiGo reported that it cancelled 1,232 flights during the period, attributing a significant portion of these disruptions to crew and Flight Duty Time Limit (FDTL) compliance issues, as well as airport, airspace and air traffic control constraints that are often outside an airline’s direct control.The carrier’s on-time performance also took a hit, slipping to 67.70 per cent in November compared with 84.1 per cent in October.The performance report by the airlines highlights that in November alone, IndiGo cancelled 1,232 flights, many due to crew/FDTL constraints. The airline, which operates more than 2,200 flights a day, recorded a punctuality rate of just 35 percent on December 2, according to data from the Ministry of Civil Aviation.DGCA has summoned IndiGo to its headquarters to explain the factors behind the ongoing disruption and to outline concrete measures to address the continuing wave of delays and cancellations.","Over 70 IndiGo Flights Cancelled Across India as Crew Shortage Triggers Massive Disruption.

CHANDIGARH: “The very essence of a welfare state is compromised when the instrumentalities of the state become a source of protracted litigation,” Punjab and Haryana HC observed recently, while reprimanding Punjab govt for its apathy in not absorbing a former worker of Anandpur Sahib Hydel Project for over three decades.Justice Harpreet Singh Brar ordered the state govt to pay within three months Rs 5 lakh compensation to the petitioner, nearly 80 now, noting that: “The state shoulders the profound responsibility of fostering justice and equity; it should be a catalyst for the resolution of disputes, not the cause of their proliferation.”Pulling up the state for ignoring binding directions issued in 1989 in an SC judgment in the ‘Mehanga Ram and others versus State of Punjab’ case and reaffirmed through Punjab advocate general’s 1995 undertaking before apex court, HC said forcing similarly situated employees to repeatedly litigate for identical relief was “the very definition of arbitrariness” barred under Constitution. “The principle that the state must act as a ‘model employer’ is not a mere platitude but a constitutional mandate that informs its dealings with its employees,” HC observed.","Punjab and Haryana HC reprimanded Punjab govt for its apathy in not absorbing a former worker of Anandpur Sahib Hydel Project.

Driving the news

Rupee Slides To Record Low Of 90 Per Dollar As Trade Uncertainty, Dollar Demand And Oil Costs Spike

Why it matters

Your next iPhone, fridge, or car? Costlier.

Zoom in: Why did the rupee drop?

Three main reasons:

Trade tensions with the US:

Investor exodus:

Policy shift at the RBI:

The big picture: What makes this different from earlier rupee crises?

Dollar vs Rupee History

What they’re saying

Between the lines: Life is already getting more expensive

Oil & energy:

Electronics & appliances:

Everyday inflation:

Zoom in: Families, students, and borrowers are hurting

For students abroad:

Education loans hurt more:

Borrowers and consumers:

What's next: The pressure is widespread

Is this good for exporters?

The textbook answer: Yes. The reality: It's complicated.

Winners: IT and business service firms paid in rupees but billing in dollars see better margins-though many hedge currency exposure, which limits gains.

Mixed bag: Pharma exporters benefit from the exchange rate but are squeezed by global price pressures and rising import costs of raw materials.

Losers: Textile and light manufacturing should win-but US tariffs blunt their advantage.

Silver lining: Remittance recipients are smiling

What Indian families should do now

Match currency of income and loans: If you earn in rupees, avoid dollar loans.

Hedge wisely: For tuition and foreign payments, consider forward contracts or staggered payments to limit exchange rate shocks.

Plan with a cushion: Assume the rupee could drop further. Many consultants now suggest budgeting with Rs 93–95/$ in mind for 2026 plans.

Leverage remittances smartly: Fixed deposits and short-term debt funds offer high real returns right now-worth exploring.

Diversify investments: Global mutual funds or India-focused funds heavy in export sectors (like IT or pharma) may offer better protection.

The bottom line:

(With inputs from agencies)

On Wednesday, the Indian rupee broke a historic barrier, falling below Rs 90 to the US dollar for the first time. Though the drop from Tuesday’s 89.94 may seem minor, the implications aren’t.This milestone isn’t just psychological-it signals a shift in how India’s economy is perceived, managed, and felt by its citizens.The ripple effects stretch far beyond Dalal Street or forex traders. The rupee’s weakness is now hitting the average Indian household - from their fuel bills to EMIs, tuition fees, and travel costs.Micro meets macro: Imports = inflation: India imports 90% of its oil, and also depends on overseas suppliers for electronics, fertilizers, and edible oil. A weak rupee inflates these bills.Foreign education: Students studying abroad could be shelling out Rs 5–10 lakh more annually compared to 2023, especially those paying USD tuition and living costs.Recent trade negotiations failed, and US tariffs on Indian exports-some rising by 50%-hit business confidence hard.Despite steady inflation and GDP growth, foreign investors pulled out $17 billion from Indian equities in 2025, adding pressure on the rupee.The International Monetary Fund reclassified India's exchange rate regime from ""stabilized"" to ""crawl-like."" This suggests the RBI is now guiding, not guarding, the rupee.The dollar isn’t the main villain: In 2022, a strong dollar weakened currencies across the globe. This time, the rupee is down even as the dollar remains steady.India’s war chest is full: The RBI has $690 billion in reserves-unlike the 2013 taper tantrum or the 2018 oil price shock. This creates strategic patience.Philosophy shift at RBI: Instead of fire-fighting, the central bank now aims for long-term resilience. Its goal is no longer to defend Rs 90 at all costs, but to allow natural depreciation based on fundamentals-like inflation differentials and trade shifts.“For now, the central bank may be letting the rupee weaken a little more to make exports more competitive in light of US tariffs,” said David Forrester of Crédit Agricole.Bloomberg dubbed the rupee “Asia’s worst-performing currency this year.”“If they allow the rupee to close above 90, we could see further speculative bets and the possibility of the rupee heading to 91,”Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst at Kotak Securities, told Bloomberg. The recent slide is “hard to justify on a fundamental basis,” he added.""The weak macro picture in India makes weak currency performance inevitable, there has been a slide in so many data points recently – rising trade deficits, weakening nominal GDP growth, weak FDI and foreigner selling down domestic equities, etc,"" Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors in Singapore, told Reuters.The RBI’s stance? Let it float-for now. With over $690 billion in reserves, India can act if needed, but the central bank prefers gradual adjustment to aggressive defense.The depreciation isn't academic-it’s household.India imports 90% of its crude and over 60% of its edible oils. A weaker rupee makes them costlier.Imported items-laptops, fridges, smartphones-will now come with steeper price tags.Cooking oil, LPG, and petrol will squeeze budgets further, especially for lower- and middle-income households.Tuition at $50,000/year was Rs 40 lakh at ₹80/$, but now it’s Rs 45 lakh. That’s a ₹5 lakh hike-several months’ salary for many middle-class families.A student repaying a dollar loan taken at Rs 80 now owes 12–13% more in rupee terms.A family earning Rs1.5 lakh/month may now have to dip into savings or cut essentials to meet new EMI demands of student loans.Vacations abroad? That $2,000 family trip just went from Rs 1.6 lakh to Rs 1.8 lakh.Small businesses: Those reliant on imported components or foreign travel now face higher costs and tighter margins.“If your goods hit a tariff wall of 25% or 50%, it’s less helpful,” said one trade economist.India received $137–138 billion in remittances in 2024-more than double any other country.A $500 monthly remittance now brings in Rs 45,000 instead of Rs 40,000.For rural and low-income families, this extra Rs 5,000/month is real uplift-sometimes funding education, healthcare, or property investments.The rupee's fall past 90 is more than a number-it’s a marker of a new phase in India’s economic story.In letting the rupee float, policymakers are betting on long-term gains over short-term defense. But for millions of Indian families, that bet is already affecting daily life, monthly budgets, and multi-year plans.","Rupee Slides To Record Low Of 90 Per Dollar As Trade Uncertainty, Dollar Demand And Oil Costs Spike.

Putin Plans Big India Reset With More Indian Goods, Deep Strategic Defence Ties In Talks With Modi

NEW DELHI: India and Russia are expected to discuss the joint development of advanced variants of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to New Delhi beginning Thursday.BrahMos emerged as a pivotal weapon for the Indian armed forces during the recent four-day Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. Building on this success, India has identified the need for lighter and more versatile versions, including the BrahMos-NG, which can be fitted across the Indian Air Force’s fighter fleet and strike targets over 400 kilometres away, reported ANI, citing souces.The two sides are also likely to explore work on extended-range BrahMos systems capable of hitting targets at more than three times the missile’s current range. “These discussions are likely to take place between the two sides during the Russian President’s visit,” the sources said.BrahMos remains one of the most successful examples of Indo-Russian defence collaboration, symbolising the long-standing strategic partnership between the two nations. Ahead of the summit, the countries have also been in talks on co-developing next-generation hypersonic and long-range air-to-air missile systems.India is further expected to finalise the procurement of 280 S-400 Sudarshan Chakra air defence missiles, which were successfully deployed against multiple Pakistani targets earlier this year.The Indian armed forces have equipped the Navy and other services extensively with BrahMos missiles. The missile has also been successfully exported to the Philippines, and further sales in the Asian region are expected.With its supersonic speed and precision strike capability, the missile is extremely hard to intercept and has repeatedly demonstrated high accuracy in operational use, including during the May conflict with Pakistan.",BrahMos emerged as a pivotal weapon for the Indian armed forces during the recent four-day Operation Sindoor against Pakistan.

""Derogatory"" BJP Hits Out at Revanth Reddy Over Remarks On Hindu Deities

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Rajkumar Chahar on Wednesday said that the city's iconic Taj Mahal had become a ""curse"". The BJP MP told parliament that development in Agra was slowing due to strict regulations under the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) and NGT norms.Speaking in the Lok Sabha during the winter session, he said the Taj Mahal is a global landmark but tight regulations in the area around the monument have become a “curse” for the city. According to him, these rules make it hard for industries to grow and for new jobs to come up.“The beauty of the Taj Mahal has become a curse for the people of Agra. To protect its beauty, rules under the Taj Trapezium Zone, TTZ, and the NGT do not allow industries to be set up in Agra, and because of this, the youth of Agra are left unemployed,” he said.Chahar pointed out Agra’s strong connectivity through major expressways and said the city has the potential to expand if given the right support. He pushed for an IT hub in Agra, saying the city needs development that protects the Taj’s beauty while creating work opportunities for people.Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) is a defined area around the Taj Mahal to protect the monument from pollution. The Supreme Court of India delivered a ruling on December 30, 1996 regarding industries covered under the TTZ, in response to a PIL seeking to protect the Taj Mahal from environmental pollution.","Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) is a defined area around the Taj Mahal to protect the monument from pollution.

Bangladesh Seeks Hasina’s Extradition After Death Verdict As India Weighs Options | Watch

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on “humanitarian grounds,” months after the pair had been pushed into Bangladesh.The top court was hearing the Centre’s challenge to the Calcutta High Court’s September 26 order, which struck down the government’s move to deport Sunali Khatun, Sweety Bibi and their families to Bangladesh after labelling them “illegal immigrants.”A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi directed the West Bengal government to look after the minor and instructed the Birbhum district chief medical officer to ensure full medical support for Khatun, including a free delivery.The bench noted solicitor general Tushar Mehta’s statement that the competent authority had agreed to allow the woman and her child into India purely on humanitarian grounds, without affecting any rights or claims, and that they would be kept under “surveillance.”This followed the Supreme Court’s December 1 direction asking the Centre to consider permitting their entry, also on the condition that they remain under “surveillance.”The Supreme Court had earlier asked Mehta to seek instructions on permitting Khatun, who is in an advanced stage of pregnancy, to enter India through the India–Bangladesh border at Malda in West Bengal.The woman’s father said the family had lived as daily-wage workers in Delhi’s Rohini Sector 26 for more than two decades when police detained them on June 18 on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals.Sunali, her husband, Danish Sekh and their son were later taken into custody and, on June 27, were deported to Bangladesh.Also read: ‘Night at thana’: Was very scared, couldn’t sleep one bit, says Sunali During the hearing, the bench noted that the woman and her eight-year-old child, allowed to re-enter India, would ultimately be brought back to Delhi, from where they were picked up and pushed across the border in June, as cited by PTI.However, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Sanjay Hegde, appearing for Khatun’s father, urged the court to direct that she be taken instead to her home district of Birbhum in West Bengal, where her family resides. They also informed the bench that others, including Khatun’s husband, remained in Bangladesh and sought directions for their return as well, subject to instructions from the Centre.Mehta maintained that he would challenge their claim of Indian citizenship, insisting the family were Bangladeshi nationals and that the government’s decision to admit the woman and her child was purely on humanitarian grounds.Justice Joymalya Bagchi observed that if Khatun could establish that she is the daughter of Bhodu Sheikh, it would be sufficient to prove her Indian citizenship.The court has listed the matter for further hearing on December 10.As per a May 2, 2025, memo issued by the union home ministry, Bangladesh and Myanmar nationals found residing illegally in any state or Union territory will first be subject to an inquiry by the respective state or UT government, after which the deportation process will be initiated.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on ""humanitarian grounds"" The top court was hearing the Centre's challenge to the Calcutta High Court's September 26 order, which struck down the government's move to deport them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125738725,imgsize-1379982,width-400,resizemode-4/ani-file-photo.jpg"

NEW DLEHI: IndiGo - which flies almost two out of three domestic passengers - is witnessing massive flight delays and some cancellations due to a crippling crew shortage. Govt data shows only 35% IndiGo flights (the airline operates over 2,200 daily) operated on time Tuesday (Dec 2). And on Wednesday, multiple airports including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru reported almost 200 flight cancellations till the afternoon itself.The airline is facing severe pilot shortage ever since the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) norms became applicable last month which lays out more humane rostering for crew.

BJP bags 83% of Rs 915cr routed via Tata Group-controlled trust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-bags-83-of-rs-915cr-routed-via-tata-group-controlled-trust/articleshow/125728589.cms,"NEW DELHI: Almost 83% of the total Rs 915 crore political donations routed through the Tata group-controlled Progressive Electoral Trust (PET) in 2024-25 went to BJP, while Congress’ share was a mere 8.4%.A perusal of the contribution reports of various electoral trusts (ET) for 2024-25, now available on the Election Commission website, indicates that the scrapping of electoral bonds by the Supreme Court in Feb 2024 may not have totally dried up the coffers of BJP. The party in office received Rs 757.6 crore from PET, Rs 150 crore from New Democratic ET, over Rs 30.1 crore from Harmony ET, Rs 21 crore from Triumph ET, Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET and Rs 7.75 lakh from Einzigartig ET. This adds up to nearly Rs 959 crore.PET, which receives political donations from various Tata group companies and disburses them in Lok Sabha election year, had passed on a total Rs 454 crore to three parties in 2018-19, of which 75% or Rs 356 crore went to BJP, Rs 55.6 crore to the Congress and Rs 43 crore to Trinamool Congress.Since the 2024-25 contribution report of Prudent Electoral Trust, through which the lion’s share of political donations is routed with BJP being the biggest beneficiary, is not uploaded on EC website, its disbursals to the governing party cannot be assessed.BJP received Rs 856.4 crore via trusts, of which Rs 724 crore came from Prudent, and Rs 1,685 cr from bonds in 23-24.Congress received Rs 77.3 crore from PET in 2024-25, Rs 5 crore from New Democratic ET and Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET. Prudent contributed Rs 216.33 crore to Congress and A B General ET, Rs 15 crore, as per contribution report filed by Congress for 2024-25. Thus, the grand old party received over Rs 313 crore of its total 517 crore contributions in 2024-25 through the trust route.PET also disbursed donations worth Rs 10 crore each to Trinamool, YSR Congress Party, Shiv Sena, Biju Janata Dal, Bharat Rashtra Samithi, JDU, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and LJP-Ram Vilas.Interestingly, Congress contributions in 2024-25 fall way short of the Rs 828 crore it had received via bonds in 2023-24, but are higher than its Rs 171-crore bond income in 2022-23, a non-general election year. Similarly, TMC’s Rs 184.5 crore receipts in 2024-25, of which Rs 153.5 crore were through trusts, are no match for its Rs 612 crore receipts via bonds in 2023-24. BJD, which received Rs 245.5 crore in bonds in 2023-24, received Rs 60 crore in donations, including Rs 35 crore via trusts, in 2024-25. BRS not only saw its Rs 495 crore contributions in bonds (2023-24) eroded, but its receipts from trusts also dipped to Rs 15 crore from Rs 85 crore in 2023-24.The Tata Group companies that donated to PET include Tata Sons Pvt Ltd (Rs 308 crore); TCS (Rs 217.6 crore); Tata Steel (Rs 173 crore); Tata Motors (Rs 49.4 crore); Tata Power (Rs 39.5 crore); Tata Communications (Rs 14.8 crore); and Tata Consumer Products, Tata Elxsi Ltd and Tata Autocomp Systems (Rs 19.7 crore each).Among other trusts, the Mahindra Group-backed New Democratic ET gave Rs 150 crore of its total Rs 160 crore kitty to the BJP, with Congress and Shiv Sena-UBT receiving Rs 5 crore each.Triumph, to which CG Power contributed Rs 20 crore, disbursed Rs 21 crore to BJP and Rs 4 crore to Telugu Desam Party. Harmony ET contributed Rs 30.1 crore to BJP, Rs 3 crore to Shiv Sena-UBT and Rs 2 crore to NCP-Sharad Pawar. Jan Pragati ET disbursed Rs 1 crore to Shiv Sena.","Almost 83% of the total Rs 915 crore political donations routed through the Tata group-controlled Progressive Electoral Trust (PET) in 2024-25 went to BJP, while Congress’ share was a mere 8.4%.

NEW DELHI: An agreement has been reached between parliamentarians to run the House ""smoothly"" after the government gave in to the opposition's demand to hold a discussion on the ongoing pan-India special intensive revision of electoral rolls.After two days of chaos and disruptions, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla held a Business Advisory Committee meeting with floor leaders, where it was decided that a 10-hour-long discussion on electoral reforms will be held in the Lower House of Parliament on December 9 and 10.Birla also decided that the discussion on the 150th anniversary of Vande Mataram will take place from 12 noon on Monday, and the discussion on election reforms from 12 noon on Tuesday.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju informed about the decisions taken at the all-party meeting.""During the All Party Meeting chaired by Hon'ble Speaker Lok Sabha today, it has been decided to hold discussion in Lok Sabha on the 150th Anniversary of National Song 'Vande Mataram' from 12 noon on Monday, 8th Dec, and discussion on Election Reforms from 12 noon on Tuesday, 9th Dec,"" Rijiju said in a post on X.Further, Rijiju explained that SIR is an administrative matter of the Election Commission, which is why the Parliament had to widen the scope of the discussion.""Election Commission reform is a larger issue which is conducted by the Govt and discussed in the Parliament.

Sunali

NEW DELHI: More than five months after her deportation to Bangladesh, the Union govt on Wednesday told Supreme Court that it would “purely on humanitarian grounds” bring back Sunali Khatun, who is pregnant, and her eight-year-old son, even as it stuck to its stand that she is an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh.“Law has to bend before humanity,” said a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi as it asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to seek instructions from govt about the return of the other four who were detained in Delhi by police before being deported to Bangladesh in June.On Oct 3, a Bangladeshi court had declared Sunali and her family to be Indian citizens. Mehta said the Union govt had taken a humanitarian view only because of the woman’s advanced pregnancy and that she and her minor son would be brought back to Delhi and adequate healthcare provided to her.Appearing for Sunali’s father Bhodu Sekh, senior advocate Sanjay Hegde told the bench that she would be better off with her father at her native village in Birbhum district of West Bengal.The Mamata Banerjee govt, through senior advocate Kapil Sibal, supported the plea and requested SC to seek a response from the Centre on the return of the other four, including Sunali’s husband Danish.The bench agreed and said Sunali would be better attended to during her pregnancy if she stayed with her father and asked Centre to send her to Bengal after getting her repatriated to India along with her son. It also directed Birbhum medical officer to provide her with pregnancy-related healthcare free of cost.SC also raised an important issue before the Centre: as govt has not proceeded against Bhodu Sekh on the ground that he is a Bangladeshi national, which would lead to an inference that he is an Indian citizen, Sunali’s proving that she is the biological daughter of Bhodu Sekh would automatically lead to her being considered an Indian citizen, along with her son. However, it was quick to clarify that it would be altogether different if she is not biologically related to Bhodu Shekh.The bench said govt can have a summary inquiry about her citizenship while followings principles of natural justice, i.e. giving her an opportunity to present her case and respond to queries of the authorities concerned. Mehta said Sunali and five others were detained by police in Delhi, not in Birbhum, and a preliminary enquiry found they had no documentary proof about Indian citizenship. The bench posted the matter for hearing on Dec 12.","Sunali Khatun, who is pregnant, and her eight-year-old son were deported on suspicions of being Bangladeshis.

NEW DELHI: India’s green economy could attract $4.1 trillion (Rs 360 lakh crore) in cumulative investments and create 48 million (4.8 crore) ‘full-time equivalent’ (FTE) jobs by 2047, an independent study released by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) said.The analysis also projects that India could unlock a $1.1 trillion (Rs 97.7 lakh crore) annual green market by 2047.“This first-of-its-kind national assessment identifies 36 green value chains across energy transition, circular economy, bio-economy and nature-based solutions that together represent a defining green economic opportunity for India’s journey towards ‘Viksit Bharat’,” said the study released last week.CEEW also launched Green Economy Council (GEC), a group chai-red by former G20 sherpa and former Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant to help India recognise and realise emerging green economic opportunities. Other members of GEC include Prof Ashok Jhunjhunwala of IIT Madras; Srivardhini K Jha of NSRCEL, IIM Bangalore; and Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of CEEW.“Pursuing a green economy will not just create jobs and economic prosperity for India.It will also help us secure the fuels and resources of the future, making us ‘Atmanirbhar’,” said Abhishek Jain, director, green economy & impact innovations, CEEW.The analysis of the study showed that energy transition alone could generate 16.6 million FTE jobs and attract $3.8 trillion in investments across renewables, storage, distributed energy and clean mobility manufacturing.It underlined that electric mobility would be the single-largest employer within the green economy, driving over 57% of all energy-transition jobs whereas bio-economy and nature-based solutions, anchored in India’s rural and peri-urban landscapes, could create 23 million jobs and $415 billion in market value. “Top job-generating value chains within this segment include chemical-free agri and bio-inputs, agroforestry and sustainable forest and wetland management,” it added.In addition, the circular economy could generate $132 billion in annual economic output and create 8.4 million FTE jobs across waste collection, recycling, repair, refurbishment & material recovery.“Together, these opportunities represent one of India’s largest untapped economic opportunities, with deep linkages to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), cooperatives and community enterprises,” said the study.","The analysis also projects that India could unlock a $1.1 trillion (Rs 97.7 lakh crore) annual green market by 2047. “Pursuing a green economy will not just create jobs and economic prosperity for India.

Three crore? Why so many? One god for the unmarried — Hanuman. Another for those who marry twice.

These are not isolated incidents and functionaries of Congress and its allies have repeatedly insulted Sanatan Dharma, he added.Reddy had earlier said that Congress means Muslims, and Muslims mean Congress, Trivedi said. “Rahul used pictures of gods but didn’t take oath in the name of god. He has on several occasions insulted Sanatan Dharma. Congress ally DMK had organised an event for the eradication of Sanatan Dharma,” he said.He highlighted PM Modi’s critcism of Congress as “Muslim League-Maoist” to assert that Congress is behaving true to the description with unruly conducts by its MPs, including Rahul, in Parliament, their insult of institutions & its agenda of “spreading hate against Hinduism”.",Telangana CM Revanth Reddy met PM Narendra Modi Wednesday seeking support for Telangana’s $3 trillion vision.

NEW DELHI: Noting that inherent patriarchal discrimination is still the order of the day, Supreme Court has said gifts given by parents not only to their daughter but to the bridegroom at the time of marriage have to be returned to her if it ends in divorce.Applying a provision of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh quashed a Calcutta high court order that had allowed a man to retain the gifts given by his father-in-law.“The Constitution of India prescribes an aspiration for all, ie equality which is, obviously, yet to be achieved. Courts, in doing their bit to this end, must ground their reasoning in social justice adjudication. To put it in context, the scope and object of the 1986 Act is concerned with securing the dignity and financial protection of Muslim women post her divorce which aligns with the rights of women under Article 21 of the Constitution,” the bench said.Also read: SC allows deported pregnant woman, her child to return from Bangladesh; citizenship still in question “The construction of this Act, therefore, must keep at the forefront equality, dignity and autonomy and must be done in the light of lived experiences of women where, particularly in smaller towns and rural areas, inherent patriarchal discrimination is still the order of the day,” the court said.It said Section 3 of the Act granted a woman right over all properties given to her before or at the time of marriage or after her marriage by her relatives or friends or husband or any relatives of the husband or his friends.“The section quoted above deals with mehr/dower and/or other properties given to a woman at the time of her marriage clearing the way for the woman to set up a claim against her husband in the above situations, or claim back from her husband properties given, as the case may be,” the bench said.","Supreme Court quashes a Calcutta high court order that had allowed a man to retain the gifts given by his father-in-law.

Strong reaction to app took govt by surprise: Officials

Scindia’s clarification meaningless: Congress

NEW DELHI: Faced with a barrage of criticism over mandating pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi app on new smartphones, govt on Wednesday withdrew the directive, seeking to put the controversy on the backburner. The department of telecom (DoT) withdrew the order even while justifying the utility of Sanchar Saathi in making citizens cyber secure.“The govt, with an intent to provide access to cyber security to all citizens, had mandated pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi app on all smartphones... Given Sanchar Saathi’s increasing acceptance, govt has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,” said a statement amidst criticism. DoT’s Nov 21 directive had taken the industry by surprise, with major global players indicating unhappiness at the move.Even as it withdrew its directive on pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi on new smartphones, govt insisted that the app was quite popular with over 1.4 crore downloads. “The number of users has been increasing rapidly and the mandate to install the app was meant to accelerate this process and make the app available to less aware citizens easily.Just in last one day, 6 lakh citizens have registered for downloading the app which is a 10x increase in its uptake,” it said in a statement.A few hours before the reversal of the decision was announced, communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia defended the app in Parliament. Sanchar Saathi app “se na snooping sambhav hai, no snooping hoga”, he said in response to Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda’s supplementary question in Lok Sabha.Officials, however, admitted that govt was taken by surprise at the strong reaction to its move, not just by opposition parties but even by global smartphone makers. Companies such as Apple and Samsung had sounded off the bureaucracy over their displeasure with the “diktat”, and had indicated they would resist the move.Industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) welcomed the withdrawal, and spoke about the need to have consultations with the industry beforehand. “This reflects a balanced and pragmatic policy approach that protects consumers while ensuring smooth and effective implementation by the industry…This decision also reaffirms the importance of comprehensive stakeholder consultations to ensure that future digital security policies are inclusive, technically robust and aligned with on-ground realities. ”Congress Wednesday said govt’s Sanchar Saathi app is to the common man what Pegasus was to VIPs, as it accused PM Narendra Modi of trying to establish a surveillance state that would keep track of everything, from payments to purchases to photographs to bedrooms, of citizens.Party spokesman Pawan Khera said the clarification of communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in the wake of the controversy is meaningless since Section 7(b) of the directions to mobile manufacturers clearly state the pre-installed app cannot be removed nor can any of its “functionalities be disabled or restricted”. “This was not a clarification, it was a blatant lie,” he said.","DoT withdrew the order even while justifying the utility of Sanchar Saathi in making citizens cyber secure.

Rajya Sabha sees heated exchanges over new ‘Lok Bhavans’

15.6L vehicles recalled over safety defects: Govt

To track side effects of drugs, govt

mandates QR codes at pharmacies

The Centre has ruled out any proposal to create an Indian Education Service (IES) for appointments to key leadership positions in higher education institutions, including chancellors, vice-chancellors, pro-chancellors and registrars.Responding to a written question in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, MoS for education Sukanta Majumdar said there is “no such proposal under consideration” to set up a dedicated service for these appointments. He underlined that higher education institutions (HEIs) function as statutory autonomous bodies established under their respective central Acts of Parliament and are governed by existing legal provisions.Majumdar said the govt has taken several technology- driven steps to strengthen transparency in the recruitment process. Among these is the CU-Chayan portal “which connects employers with potential job candidates, simplifying the recruitment process and making it more efficient”. He also said a separate online portal for recruitment of vice-chancellors to central universities has been launched to further improve transparency and efficiency in top-level academic appointments.RS on Wednesday witnessed heated exchanges after TMC MP Dola Sena, while slamming the renaming of Raj Bhavans as Lok Bhavans “without keeping state govts or assemblies in the loop”, sought to ridicule the govt for talking about people while depriving them of their rights.Objecting to Sen bringing in reference to “MGNREGS and other issues”, House leader JP Nadda requested the Chair to expunge remarks not related to the subject. The Chairman concurred.This was contested by LoP Kharge who said Sen had not said anything unparliamentary. He accused Nadda of “bulldozing” by asking for the remarks to be deleted. Nadda replied: “I never bulldozed.”Vehicle manufacturers have recalled around 15.6 lakh vehicles due to safety defects since 2022, heavy industries ministry informed Lok Sabha Tuesday. As per the reply, while around 11.9 lakh two-wheelers have been recalled till Nov 26, the number of cars recalled stood at nearly 3.7 lakh. The ministry quoted data maintained by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) under the voluntary recall provision.In another reply, the ministry told Lok Sabha that so far, Rs 1,635 crore subsidy has been disbursed under the PM E-DRIVE scheme. An allocation of Rs 500 crore has also been made under the scheme towards e-ambulances, it said.The next time you step into a chemist shop, you may find a new addition near the counter — a black-and-white QR code that could quietly transform India’s drug safety system. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has directed every retail and wholesale pharmacy in the country to display the official Pharmacovigilance Programme of India (PvPI) QR code along with its toll-free number, 1800-180-3024, enabling people to report medicine side effects instantly.The order, issued after the 16th Working Group Meeting of PvPI held on June 18, instructs drug regulators to ensure the QR code is placed prominently in pharmacy premises. By simply scanning it, customers and healthcare professionals can report any adverse drug reaction — from rashes and dizziness to swelling, nausea or more serious complications — straight into ADRMS (Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring System). Officials say the move could mark a major shift in how India tracks harmful drug events, which often go unreported.","Rajya Sabha sees heated exchanges over new ‘Lok Bhavans’ 15.6L vehicles recalled over safety defects: Govt.

SEMICON India 2025: Ashwini Vaishnaw Praises India’s Policies For Growth And Stability

NEW DELHI: Warning that fake news poses a direct threat to India’s democracy, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw Wednesday told Lok Sabha the govt is moving to strengthen the legal framework to curb misinformation and AI-driven deepfakes across digital platforms.Vaishnaw said the manner in which social media is being used has led to the creation of “certain ecosystems that do not wish to follow Constitution or laws passed by Parliament”. He stressed the need for firm action against platforms that enable the spread of false and misleading content. He said new rules have already been introduced, including a provision mandating takedown of unlawful or misleading content within 36 hours.Addressing concerns over freedom of expression, Vaishnaw said govt was maintaining a balance between free speech and protection of democratic institutions. He said under PM Modi’s leadership, Digital India has democratised access to technology, which must also be seen for its positive impact in empowering citizens.","I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw warns that fake news poses a direct threat to India’s democracy.

NEW DELHI: The rebound in exports in Nov will help erase the dip seen in Oct, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said Wednesday. Although there was no mention of the exact figure, he said, “If I aggregate Oct and Nov, both months show growth in merchandise (exports) despite all the global turmoil. This only goes to show that the economy is on a strong footing.”In response to a question on the record low of the Rupee, the minister said Indian economy was on a strong footing and would continue to power up. “Growth we just saw is at 8.2% even in the second quarter, beating all estimates. We have seen the lowest ever inflation in the last few months. Foreign exchange reserves continue to be strong, and all the levers of the economy have demonstrated a great deal of positivity.”At a CII event, the minister called for strengthening supply chains and preparing for global volatility with a “twin approach,” building on areas where it holds a comparative advantage while simultaneously achieving strategic autonomy in sectors where supply-chain dependence can threaten long-term resilience.He also said the future of manufacturing lies in being nimble, with companies that innovate, invest in R&D, and build secure, efficient supply chains surviving, while “those who remain in their cocoon of low competition protected economies will gradually start fading.”"," commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said the rebound in exports in Nov will help erase the dip seen in Oct.

NEW DELHI: On most days, 13-year-old Muhammad Yazeen from Kerala's Alappuzha sits at his keyboard, eyes closed, fingers flying, trusting only his instinct.But on Tuesday morning, inside a hall full of applause in Delhi, he opened his eyes to something far bigger, with his name echoing as one of the country's finest young achievers. ""Now, nothing is a challenge in life,"" he said. ""I love cricket… I once played with Sanju Samson. He's my favourite.""Yazeen, who has 80% locomotor disability and holds a world record in operating a keyboard blindfolded, was one among dozens who turned Tuesday's National Awards for Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, 2025 into an extraordinary celebration of resilience and imagination. Each of the 32 awardees has had a journey strong enough to reshape the perception of what ability truly looks like.The awards were presented by President Droupadi Murmu, who reminded the audience that ensuring equality for divyangjan (specially abled) is not our charity but duty.""I especially appreciate the daughters who have been awarded today because they have overcome the twin challenges of gender and disability while achieving extraordinary things,"" she said, adding that govt was strengthening the ecosystem for their inclusion and empowerment by building numerous national-level institutes and launching unique ID cards for the specially abled.Bengaluru's Sheeba Koilpichai, who has over 3,000 Warli paintings to her credit despite battling multiple disabilities, barely spoke, but her art said everything for her. Her works are displayed at Rashtrapati Bhavan, Lok Bhavan in Karnataka and global collections. She teaches at the same institution where she trained.Nagpur's Aboli Vijay Jarit rolled in with her trademark confidence as the country's first wheelchair model, a motivational speaker and a participant in global documentaries. Her family was by her side, and she said the support of her kin was her biggest strength.Delhi-based policy advocate Nipun Malhotra has advanced accessibility through initiatives like ""Wheels for Life"", while Bengaluru's young photographer Gayatri Gupta has championed neurodiversity through her exhibitions and corporate workshops.Lt Col Dwarakesh Chandrasekaran's path is defined by grit and forged in adversity. The first officer in Indian armed forces in active duty despite being totally blind, he broke national swimming records, introduced blind shooting in India and trekked to Siachen Glacier (16,000 feet). ""Doors must be opened to the blind in India. This purpose gives me the strength to keep going,"" he said.Equally compelling was the voice of Bengaluru's Megha Patangi, a senior accessibility specialist redefining how millions experience technology. Her progressive vision loss never dimmed her determination to build inclusive digital spaces. ""Whatever I am today is because of my mother,"" she said, recalling how her mother told her that God took a bit of her eyesight to give it to someone who needed it more. That belief became Megha's compass.Among other awardees was Basant Vikas Sahu from Dhamtari, Chhattisgarh. He spent nearly three decades proving that art can be an engine of dignity. Living with 95% locomotor disability, he paints with a brush tied to his arm, creating vivid portraits of tribal life while training the specially abled and tribal youth through his Jeevan Rang Foundation.Rajesh Sharad Ketkar from Vadodara reshaped the concept of accessibility by championing Indian Sign Language (ISL). He introduced pioneering ISL-based learning systems and built a news platform run by the deaf that reaches millions, turning communication into empowerment.Together, the awardees narrated a singular truth: Disability is not a limitation but a route to brilliance, one defined not by what is absent but by what is unstoppable.","President awards 32 special talents at National Awards for Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, 2025.

Over 70 IndiGo Flights Cancelled Across India as Crew Shortage Triggers Massive Disruption

IndiGo flight cuts send air fares soaring

NEW DELHI: Lakhs of passengers have been hit by massive flight delays and cancellations at India's largest airline, IndiGo, since Tuesday, primarily due to a pilot shortage.On Wednesday, over 200 flights were cancelled, after nearly over 100 cancellations daily for the past 4-5 days. Some of Wednesday's delays were up to 10 hours.Also read: IndiGo chaos leaves passengers stranded, social media erupts with frustration; 200+ flights cancelled DGCA has asked the airline ""to explain the unprecedented disruptions"". Govt data showed on Tuesday (Dec 2) its on-time performance, at 35%, was the lowest among all scheduled airlines in India.Flying a million passengers every three days, the impact in terms of number of flyers hit is in lakhs.The volume of public inconvenience and outcry on social media led the aviation authorities to act. Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has called the airline's senior management Thursday ""to explain the unprecedented disruptions"" and also present a plan on how they hope to get back on track in the ongoing peak travel season when India has been witnessing over five lakh daily domestic passengers. ""DGCA is investigating the situation and evaluating measures along with the airline to reduce cancellations and delays in order to minimise inconvenience being caused to passengers,"" an official said.IndiGo announced Wednesday evening it had ""initiated calibrated adjustments"", or flight cuts. ""These measures will remain in place for the next 48 hours and will allow us to normalise our operations and progressively recover our punctuality across the network,"" the airline said, acknowledging its ""operations have been significantly disrupted across the network for the past two days"".Almost 62% of the 1,232 flights IndiGo cancelled in Nov were due to ""crew constraints"". DGCA had brought into effect more humane crew flight duty norms from Nov 1 following serious complaints of fatigue by cockpit crew of Indian carriers. While this increased pilot requirement, the 62% cancellation data (for Nov) shows IndiGo is now struggling on that front. IndiGo's OTP crashed from 84.1% in Oct, 2025 to 67.7% last month. ""The date for revised FDTL norms' implementation was known. The preparation for the same was definitely not in place,"" said industry sources.IndiGo's flight cuts, and uncertainty over OTP has sent fares soaring. An economy class one-way (nonstop) Delhi-Bengaluru ticket for Friday and Saturday (Dec 5 & 6) was in the range of Rs 11,000 to Rs 43,145. Similarly, Mumbai-Kolkata was in the range of Rs 8,000 to Rs 19,000.About the delays, IndiGo blamed ""a multitude of unforeseen operational challenges, including minor technology glitches, schedule changes linked to the winter season, adverse weather conditions, increased congestion in the aviation system, and the implementation of updated crew rostering rules (flight duty time limitations)"", which, it said, had a negative compounding impact on operations in a way that was not feasible to be anticipated"".IndiGo's OTP has taken a hit for the past few weeks but things now seem to have hit the roof. Only 35% IndiGo flights (the airline operates over 2,200 daily) operated on time Tuesday (Dec 2). And Wednesday multiple airports, including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru, reported almost 200 flight cancellations by the afternoon.Harried officials across airports said Wednesday IndiGo delays and cancellations were causing major issues.","Lakhs of passengers have been hit by massive flight delays and cancellations at India's largest airline, IndiGo, since Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: The results of Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) by-elections were declared Wednesday, with BJP winning seven of the 12 seats, AAP securing 3, Congress 1, and the All India Forward Bloc opening its account with a victory in Chandni Mahal.With the latest outcome, BJP now has 123 seats in the 250-member House-three short of the majority mark of 126. AAP holds 101 seats, Congress 9, and Forward Bloc 1. Indraprastha Vikas Party (IVP), which did not contest the bypolls, continues to have 15 councillors, along with one independent.A major setback for AAP came from Chandni Mahal, a seat it won with the highest margin in the 2022 MCD polls but where it fell to second place this time. Forward Bloc's Mohammad Imran, backed by former MLA and ex-AAP leader Shoaib Iqbal, won by 4,692 votes, marking the party's entry into the MCD.The seat fell vacant after AAP's Aaley Mohammad Iqbal won the Matia Mahal Assembly seat in Feb. AAP fielded Muddasir Usman Qureshi, while BJP nominated Sunil Sharma. Shoaib Iqbal, who quit AAP on November 9 after being denied a ticket for his preferred candidate, campaigned extensively for Imran.It was a mixed bag for BJP, which previously held 9 of these 12 seats, but managed to retain only 7. It lost Sangam Vihar-A and Mundka, both linked to what party members described as public discontent with local BJP MLAs. But at the same time, its vote share rose by nearly 6%, AAP's fell sharply - from 42% in the 2022 civic election to 34% this time. Congress, which won one ward, saw a modest rise from 11.6% to 13.4%.In Sangam Vihar-A-vacated by BJP's Chandan Choudha-ry after her Assem-bly win-Congress candidate Suresh Choudhary won by 3,628 votes.However, BJP secured the largest victory margin of the bypolls in Shalimar Bagh-B, where Anita Jain won by 10,101 votes. The seat was held by CM Rekha Gupta, who resigned after becoming MLA.In Greater Kailash, BJP's Anjum Mandal defeated AAP candidate Eeesha Gupta by a margin of 4,065 votes. The seat was vacated after former deputy mayor Shikha Rai entered the assembly. AAP fielded its student-wing president Eeshna Gupta as part of an organisational push led by Saurabh Bharadwaj.BJP also reclaimed the Chandni Chowk seat from AAP. BJP's Suman Kumar Gupta secured 7,825 votes, defeating AAP's Harsh Sharma (6,643) by 1,182 votes. One of the closest contests came from Naraina, where AAP's Rajan Arora won by just 148 votes. BJP's Chandrakanta Shivani led until the second-last round of counting before Arora pulled ahead, finishing with 10,423 votes to Shivani's 10,275.Across the 12 wards, 269,992 votes were polled, including 2,604 Nota votes (0.96%). Polling was conducted at 580 stations across 143 locations, staffed by 2,320 personnel, supported by a reserve force of 464, taking total deployment to 2,784.State Election Commission said counting across 10 centres was conducted smoothly with all required arrangements in place. State Election Commissioner Vijay Dev noted that electoral rolls were provided in alphabetical order this time, easing the process for polling staff. ""We introduced several reforms in these elections and plan to implement more to encourage greater voter participation,"" he said. The bypolls were held on Nov 30 with 51 candidates in the fray. The seats fell vacant after councillors were elected as MLAs or MPs.In the 2022 civic elections, AAP emerged as the single largest party with 134 seats. However, the political landscape shifted ahead of the April 2025 mayoral polls, when 16 AAP councillors defected to form the Indraprastha Vikas Party, giving the BJP a crucial numerical advantage-enabling it to form its mayor.","The results of Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) by-elections were declared Wednesday.

India’s Workforce Power Will Keep Growing, Jaishankar Says, As He Takes Down Anti H-1B Narratives





Researcher Simon Hankinson who worked as a visa officer in India opened up about his experience of interviewing for H-1B visa program 25 years ago and said he did not fail to see even at the beginning what was wrong with the program. In an opinion piece for Fox News, Hankinson wrote that something was badly wrong with the program which intended to bring 'specialty' workers to the US. But in reality, even 25 years ago, it was average college graduates that he interviewed for the visa program, he said.Hankinson said it's unfair to compare between a Chinese of an Indian student with an American student as a Chinese or Indian student goes to free or inexpensive schools in their countries, gets a BA, MA or even a PhD with little debt. But in America, students are borrowing thousands of dollars to get to the same level.

Was any effort made to retrain or re-assign Americans? Many other large US companies follow the same pattern: hire abroad, fire at home.""Hankinson also said that US companies do not need a lot of specialty workers. ""The truth is, the number of real ""specialty"" workers that even big American companies really need should fit in a bus, not a stadium.

Medical certificate not required to avail leave

BENGALURU: Weeks after the state govt introduced one day of paid menstrual leave every month for employees aged 18 to 52 in the private sector, it extended the benefit to employees in the govt sector as well on Tuesday.On Oct 9, the state cabinet had approved the Menstrual Leave Policy (MLP) 2025, allowing employees in the private sector a day’s paid leave every month. The govt order to that effect was issued on Nov 12. Now, with the latest order, more than 1.5 lakh employees in the govt sector stand to benefit from this new leave policy.Tuesday’s order follows a petition filed by Bangalore Hotels Association in Karnataka high court, challenging the govt’s initial menstrual leave notification.The association argued in the petition that the rule was discriminatory because it excluded women in govt services, even though the state is one of the largest employers of women.An official order has been issued to provide menstrual leave benefits to women govt employees in the state. This leave will also apply to contractual workers. It is expected to help protect the health of women employees and improve their mental strength,” labour minister Santosh Lad said.According to the new directive, women employees are not required to submit any medical certificate to avail the leave. However, menstrual leave cannot be merged with any other leave category. Offices must maintain a separate record of menstrual leave in the attendance register.","Karnataka govt has extended one day of paid menstrual leave to employees aged 18 to 52 in the private sector.

MUMBAI: Mumbai is seeing a surge in cyber financial fraud, with nearly 20,000 cases reported since 2020 and losses crossing Rs 2,000 crore, yet recoveries remain minimal.Victims, from businesswomen to retirees, are finding themselves trapped not only by sophisticated scammers who clone cards and steal data, but also by banks that routinely refuse reimbursement despite RBI's zero-liability rules.Experts say the financial system's own vulnerabilities are to blame. Instead of protecting customers, banks often shift the burden onto them, leaving countless citizens fighting legal notices, recovery calls and bureaucratic indifference long after the fraud occurs.Of the cases, 4,132 FIRs were for credit or debit card fraud, ATM fraud, SIM swap, cloning, activation and OTP sharing, with victims losing Rs 161.5 crore and the police recovering just Rs 4.8 croreThe cases spanned various methods of fraud. In one example, Sakinaka resident Romaljit Kaur Makkar, a businesswoman, lost Rs 2.5 lakh after her credit card was cloned. On April 3, while attending a meeting in a Mumbai office with her card in her possession, fraudulent transactions were carried out on a merchant machine in Lucknow.Makkar alleged that her PIN could have been captured by CCTV during a shopping trip earlier that day. In another instance, retired engineer Navneet Batra (64) of Borivli East has faced daily calls from recovery agents and legal notices since March 2023 over four fraudulent fund transfers totalling Rs 1.9 lakh.He alleged that scamsters stole his card details to buy herbal products from Bihar. Despite filing a complaint with Dahisar police and blocking his card, the bank has not reversed the transactions.RBI rules on card fraud stipulate that customers have zero liability if they report a fraud within three days. If reported within four to seven days, liability is limited to Rs 10,000-25,000 depending on card limit.In cases of customer negligence, such as sharing PINs or OTPs, the customer bears full loss until the unauthorised transaction is reported; the bank covers subsequent losses. Banks must reverse charges within ten working days and resolve outstanding complaints within 90 days.Maharashtra Cyber Cell's Yashasvi Yadav said fraudsters steal card data through leaks and ATM skimmers. Expert Ritesh Bhatia argued that blaming victims for sharing OTPs is misplaced, as such fraud usually stems from systemic failures like data leaks and weak verification, making banks - customers - responsible for securing the ecosystem.Former police chief D Sivanandhan said banks are liable unless victims deliberately share sensitive details. Cyber lawyer Dr Prashant Mali said banks routinely ignore RBI's zero-liability rules and called for stricter KYC, faster card blocking, better coordination and penalties for banks that fail security norms.","Mumbai is seeing a surge in cyber financial fraud, with nearly 20,000 cases reported since 2020.

Chandigarh Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.

AMBALA: Haryana transport minister Anil Vij has ordered a detailed investigation into the assets and income of a man who placed the highest bid of nearly ₹1.12 crore for the VIP registration number HR88B-8888 but later backed out, forfeiting his security deposit.The minister said the unusual bid raises serious questions about the bidder's financial capacity and intentions.Speaking to the media, Vij explained that the state allots fancy and VVIP vehicle numbers through an online auction system, which not only enhances a buyer's prestige but also contributes significantly to govt revenue. In the recent auction, a Hisar-based bidder offered over ₹1.1 crore for HR88B-8888 — a record in the country — and made headlines but failed to deposit the money by deadline.Terming the incident a matter of concern, Vij said the trend of placing excessively high bids without the actual intent or capacity to pay must be curbed. ""Placing a bid in the auction is not a pastime — it is a responsibility. I have directed transport officials to thoroughly verify the individual's income and assets. We must determine whether he truly had the financial capacity to place such a high bid,"" he said.Vij said the transport department will write to income tax department, seeking a comprehensive financial inquiry into the bidder to ensure that people do not misuse the auction system.The minister emphasised that such actions disrupt the integrity of the auction process and could potentially affect govt revenue, hence strict measures are necessary to prevent recurrence.

They argue this ""warp-speed approach"" prioritizes AI investments over climate commitments and human workforce well-being, potentially harming democracy, jobs, and the environment.

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

Here's the complete open letter from Amazon 1000-plus employees:

Dear Andy Jassy and S-team,

In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond.

We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis. We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth.

We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm:

Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming.

Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019. The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants.

Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas.

Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement.

Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional.

Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally,

Jeff Bezos

owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance.

All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need.

We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following:

No AI with dirty energy.

No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments.

No AI without employee voices.

We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact.

No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.

Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine.

The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are.

This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of.

Signed,

1,039 Amazon employees (and counting!)





Thousands of Amazon employees have signed an open letter issuing to CEO Andy Jassy . The letter warns the company about its 'rapid' move toward AI. Signed by more than 1,000 Amazon workers (and counting), the open letter calls out Amazon for pushing its AI investments at the expense of climate and human workforce. The letter’s supporters come from a wide array of roles at the company, including many software engineers, and even employees focused on building AI systems. ""We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth,” the letter’s authors wrote. It adds, “We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene.”The open letter is reported to have been signed by Amazon workers anonymously, and comes almost a month after the ecommerce giant announced mass layoff plans as it increases adoption of AI in its operations. Among the signatories are employees in a range of positions, including engineers, product managers and warehouse associates. The letter argues that their employer is throwing out its climate promises in the scramble to win the AI race.Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, pointing to efficiencies from electric delivery vehicles and reduced plastic packaging in its climate commitment.","Over 1,000 Amazon employees have penned an open letter to CEO Andy Jassy, expressing grave concerns about the company's rapid AI development.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

How Elon Musk sees AI and robotics reshaping global industries





Elon Musk: A Different Conversation w/ Nikhil Kamath | Full Episode | People by WTF Ep. 16

Elon Musk’s prediction of AI-driven instant manufacturing





Elon Musk’s view of AI evolving beyond human well-being goals





Elon Musk’s vision of a future where ‘money becomes irrelevant’









Elon Musk has once again shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour. During a conversation on Nikhil Kamath’s People by WTF podcast, the Tesla and SpaceX chief suggested that the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and robotics is pushing society towards a future where humans no longer need to work to survive. Musk’s view is rooted in the belief that machines will eventually handle all essential tasks, allowing people to approach work as a creative or recreational activity rather than an economic necessity.He expressed strong confidence that the world could reach this turning point within the next two decades. For Musk, this future is not a distant fantasy but a likely outcome of the accelerating technological breakthroughs unfolding today.Musk argued that the extraordinary pace of development in AI models, autonomous systems, and humanoid robots is already rapidly reshaping industries worldwide. According to him, the next phase of technological growth will create intelligent machines that can replicate or even surpass human capability in almost every domain, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare, education, and creative services.He believes that this massive transition may occur much sooner than most people expect, possibly within ten to fifteen years. Musk compared future labour to home gardening. Just as people may choose to grow vegetables for enjoyment rather than necessity, he thinks future generations will increasingly engage in work for personal fulfilment, creativity, or social contribution rather than mere survival. The essential work that maintains society will be managed entirely by advanced automated systems that require minimal or no human oversight.A core part of Musk’s argument is that AI systems will eventually be able to create anything a person can imagine. His own AI company, xAI, along with its chatbot Grok, reflects his belief that increasingly capable generative systems will expand into physical production through robotics, automation, and smart manufacturing techniques. As these technologies combine, they could enable a world where scarcity becomes obsolete and resource distribution becomes more equitable. Musk visualises a future in which goods and services can be produced instantly and efficiently.He emphasised that the ability to turn ideas into tangible products without traditional labour inputs would fundamentally reshape economies, social structures, and the global workforce. Once technology reaches this stage, he thinks most constraints on human consumption and lifestyle will disappear, creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation, creativity, and human progress.Musk also explored a lesser-discussed aspect of hyper-advanced AI. He suggested that there may come a time when AI and robotics complete every possible task aimed at improving human well-being. After satisfying all imaginable human desires and demands, these systems could reach a saturation point where they no longer have meaningful human-centred tasks to perform.At that stage, Musk believes AI may begin working on activities that serve its own optimisation because the catalogue of tasks that benefit humanity is finite. This idea raises profound questions about the long-term relationship between humans and intelligent machines once human needs are no longer the defining force behind technological activity. Musk’s predictions extend far beyond the automation of work. At the US Saudi Investment Forum earlier this month, he stated that humanoid robots and AI systems have the potential to eliminate poverty. His argument relies on the assumption that when machines can produce goods for virtually no cost and at limitless volume, wealth becomes universal because essential resources are accessible to everyone.If machines can meet all human needs, the traditional economic struggle for income, resources, and opportunity would disappear. Musk envisions a world where every person benefits equally from the capabilities of intelligent robots that can generate abundance without relying on human labour.In his discussion with Kamath, Musk introduced an even more radical idea. He predicted that money might eventually lose its relevance. In his view, money exists primarily as a tool for allocating labour and determining the value of goods that require human effort to produce. If production becomes entirely automated and unlimited, the need for money as a mechanism for distribution fades.Musk suggested that in such a world, the primary form of value might shift towards power generation. Energy would become the foundational currency because machines require it to operate, create and sustain the systems that support human life. The economy would therefore revolve around energy capacity rather than labour or manufactured goods.","Elon Musk has shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour.

Strict emissions standards: Factories were forced to upgrade or close, while loopholes in enforcement were removed.

Transport reforms: A city-wide lottery limited fossil-fuel vehicle registrations, while electric cars and public transport were promoted. Truck traffic was rerouted to beltways, and bike-sharing schemes were reintroduced.

Regional coordination: Authorities recognised that smog originated beyond city limits, implementing pollution controls across the greater Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region.

Clean energy push: Coal use was restricted, and renewables were prioritised in power generation and heating systems.

What Delhi Could Learn from Beijing

Regional coordination is critical: Pollution control cannot be limited to city boundaries; neighbouring states and agricultural belts must be engaged.

Binding targets and enforcement: Clear, time-bound objectives with penalties and proper funding drive real change.

Structural reforms: Energy, transport, and industry need systemic shifts, not just temporary measures.

Transparency and public awareness: Accessible air-quality data increases accountability and civic participation.

Long-term environmental planning: Urban greening, green belts, and sustainable city planning can help absorb pollutants and improve liveability.

Air Quality Across India

NEW DELHI: Delhi is engulfed in a thick, choking smog fuelled by crop-residue burning in neighbouring states, vehicle emissions, industrial pollution, and road dust.For years, hazardous air quality has become almost routine, putting residents’ health at risk.Meanwhile, Beijing — once notorious as the “smog capital of the world” — has transformed its air in just over a decade. Coordinated policies, strict enforcement, and bold reforms have turned the grey city skies blue, offering a stark contrast to Delhi’s perennial haze.Back in 2005, when Beijing was preparing to host the 2008 Olympics, satellite data and reports highlighted it as one of the most polluted cities globally. Pollution levels were blamed for hundreds of thousands of premature deaths annually, and nitrogen dioxide concentrations were among the world’s highest, according to the European Space Agency.Even athletes threatened to pull out of the Games due to health concerns.The turning point came in 2013, when the Chinese government announced a five-year action plan targeting severe air pollution in Beijing and surrounding regions.The plan included:The results were dramatic. Between 2013 and 2021, air pollution in Beijing fell by over 42%, according to the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC).Satellite and ground-level monitoring showed that coordinated regional measures were key to the city’s cleaner air.Zongbo Shi, an atmospheric science professor at the University of Birmingham, told The New York Times in 2022 that Beijing’s success depended on unified action: “When the central government prioritizes an initiative, local authorities fall in line. That happened in the case of Beijing’s pollution, as the capital worked in tandem with regional officials and neighboring cities.”Similarly, Dr. Kaspar Rudolf Dällenbach of Switzerland’s Paul Scherrer Institut noted in The Guardian that Beijing’s air pollution often begins outside the city: “Before smog in Beijing forms, pollutants are transported over hundreds of kilometres, making this a regional issue. Coordinated and stringent large-scale measures are needed across one of the most populated regions on the planet.”In Delhi, the situation remains dire. Winter pollution spikes are largely due to crop-stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana , combined with urban and industrial emissions and road dust. Unlike Beijing, Delhi lacks a unified regional mechanism to manage these sources effectively.India’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in 2019, aims for a 20–30% reduction in particulate pollution by 2024 (revised to 40% by 2026). While there has been some progress — a 19.3% drop in particulate pollution in 2022 compared with 2021, according to EPIC — Delhi continues to struggle with enforcement, coordination, and fund utilisation. Between 2019–20 and 2023–24, only 29.5% of NCAP funds were effectively used, according to the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).Experts note that Delhi faces unique challenges: fragmented governance across multiple states, complex sources of pollution, reliance on coal and fossil fuels, and economic pressures that make bold interventions politically sensitive.China’s clean-air strategy focused on reducing emissions from multiple pollutants while strengthening environmental economic policies. It aimed to optimise industrial infrastructure and drive major industrial restructuring, alongside accelerating technological transformation and innovation.The plan also involved adjusting the country’s energy infrastructure to expand clean energy supply, reinforcing environmental thresholds, and optimising industrial layouts. China promoted the use of market mechanisms, improved legal and regulatory systems, and established strong regional coordination frameworks with integrated environmental management.To better cope with pollution episodes, the government set up enhanced monitoring and early-warning systems. Finally, the strategy clarified the responsibilities of government, enterprises, and the public, ensuring wider participation in achieving cleaner air.Despite these challenges, Beijing’s experience offers valuable lessons:“I think the message is clear. We need clear air pollution control targets and a plan to meet them. The process has to be verifiable similar to how China has done it. The level of stringency needs to be very high, and it should be monitored at every milestone and verify whether it’s on track. The notified version of CAP doesn’t have targets. How do you calibrate the plan if there are no verifiable targets?” asked Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment, in 2018.The divergence between Beijing and Delhi underscores a fundamental truth: tackling air pollution requires more than plans on paper. It demands political will, regional coordination, investment, and long-term commitment. While Delhi’s journey may be more complex than Beijing’s due to political and social realities, the blueprint for action is clear.If Delhi is to breathe freely again, it must move from debate to decisive action, transforming policy into practice — and in doing so, chart its own path to cleaner skies.No major Indian city has “good” air quality. A 10-year assessment of air pollution across major urban centres found that none of the country’s top cities met safe Air Quality Index (AQI) levels at any point between 2015 and November 2025. The report, by environmental research firm Climate Trends, analysed long-term pollution patterns across 11 major cities.Delhi remained India’s most polluted city throughout, with average AQI levels peaking above 250 in 2016 and hovering around 180 this year.Despite marginal dips after 2019, the capital never approached healthy air-quality thresholds. Vehicular emissions, industrial pollution, and crop burning are major contributors, compounded by the region’s geographical constraints.Cities such as Lucknow, Varanasi, and Ahmedabad — which recorded persistently high AQI values, often above 200 — showed some improvement in the second half of the decade.Southern and western cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, and Bengaluru recorded relatively moderate AQI levels but none met safe thresholds.Bengaluru posted the lowest AQI readings in the country — between 65 and 90 — still too high for the “good” category.","Beijing was once known as the ‘smog capital of the world’ The city has transformed its air in just over a decade.

H-1B visa row: Trump admin orders enhanced vetting for applicants — what are the new requirements?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/h-1b-visa-row-trump-admin-orders-enhanced-vetting-for-applicants-what-are-the-new-requirements/articleshow/125756220.cms,"India’s Workforce Power Will Keep Growing, Jaishankar Says, As He Takes Down Anti H-1B Narratives

How will this impact Indian techies?



Newsweek

The Trump administration announced on Wednesday that it had increased vetting of H-1B visa applicants for highly skilled workers, instructing that anyone involved in ""censorship"" of free speech should be considered for rejection, according to an internal State Department memo.H-1B visas allow US employers to hire foreign workers in specialty fields and are crucial for US tech companies, which recruit heavily from countries including India and China. Many of those companies’ leaders threw their support behind Trump in the last presidential election.The cable, sent to all US missions on December 2, ordered US consular officers to review resumes or LinkedIn profiles of H-1B applicants and family members travelling with them to see if they had worked in areas including misinformation, disinformation, content moderation, fact-checking, compliance and online safety.In a press release, the US department said that all the applicants need to change their profile setting from private to public.""As of December 15, the Department will expand the requirement that an online presence review be conducted for all H-1B applicants and their dependents, in addition to the students and exchange visitors already subject to this review. To facilitate this vetting, all applicants for H-1B and their dependents (H-4), F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas are instructed to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to “public,"" the statement read.""If you uncover evidence an applicant was responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States, you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible,"" under a specific article of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the cable said.Details on the enhanced vetting for H-1B visas, including the focus on censorship and free speech, had not been previously reported. The State Dept did not respond to a request for comment on the contents of the cable.The cable said all visa applicants were subject to this policy but sought a heightened review for H-1B applicants given they frequently worked in the technology sector ""including in social media or financial services companies involved in the suppression of protected expression.""""You must thoroughly explore their employment histories to ensure no participation in such activities,"" the cable said.The new vetting requirements applied to both new and repeat applicants.The Trump administration made free speech, particularly what it saw as the stifling of conservative voices online, a focus of its foreign policy. Officials repeatedly weighed in on European politics to denounce what they said was suppression of right-wing politicians, including in Romania, Germany and France, accusing European authorities of censoring views like criticism of immigration in the name of countering disinformation.In May, Rubio threatened visa bans for people who censored speech by Americans, including on social media, and suggested the policy could target foreign officials regulating US tech companies.The Trump administration had already significantly tightened its vetting of applicants for student visas, ordering US consular officers to screen for any social media posts that might be hostile towards the United States.As part of his wide-ranging crackdown on immigration, Trump in September imposed new fees on H-1B visas.Trump and his Republican allies had repeatedly accused the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden of encouraging suppression of free speech on online platforms, claims that had centred on efforts to stem false claims about vaccines and elections.The H-1B visa is relied on heavily by Indian tech professionals, meaning stricter US vetting rules will disproportionately affect Indian applicants. Under the Trump administration’s new policy, certain categories of Indian workers are now more vulnerable to delays, intensive questioning and potential denials — and, for the first time, even spouses and children will face expanded background checks. The change adds a new layer of uncertainty for thousands of Indian families in the US immigration pipeline.According to an analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) reported by, only three Indian firms ranked among the top 25 employers with approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in fiscal year 2025.The top seven Indian companies together secured just 4,573 H-1B approvals for initial employment in FY25 — a 70% drop from FY15 and a 37% decline compared to FY24. By contrast, US tech giants such as Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google dominated new approvals, highlighting the increasingly central role of American companies in sponsoring high-skilled foreign workers, the report said.","Trump administration has increased vetting of H-1B visa applicants for highly skilled workers.

""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Google co-founder Sergey Brin’s ex-wife Nicole Shanahan claims Silicon Valley ‘tech wives’ were used to fund hidden agendas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/google-co-founder-sergey-brins-ex-wife-nicole-shanahan-claims-silicon-valley-tech-wives-were-used-to-fund-hidden-agendas/articleshow/125719824.cms,"Nicole Shanahan says Silicon Valley donor circles were conscripted into elite agendas

crime in the communities increased

mental health outcomes worsened

dependency on grants deepened rather than lifting people out of hardship

Social justice and climate change influenced donor decisions

The Great Reset and why her comments are stirring debate





Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin and a major philanthropist who once wrote nine-figure checks, has accused Silicon Valley’s elite donor circles of unknowingly supporting what she describes as hidden agendas pushed by global networks of NGOs, Hollywood figures and Davos-linked institutions like the World Economic Forum . In a recently shared conversation, Shanahan said many wealthy tech wives, including herself, believed they were funding social good but were instead being steered toward broader ideological projects.Shanahan, who briefly served as RFK Jr.’s running mate in 2024, said these women were used to set the groundwork for what she associates with Klaus Schwab’s Great Reset, a post-pandemic economic and social vision promoted by the World Economic Forum. Klaus Schwab, the economist who founded the WEF in 1971, has long advocated for stronger public and private cooperation to reshape global systems. She claims the women’s philanthropic dollars and social influence were directed through advisory networks without them realising how their contributions were being utilised.According to Shanahan, tech-world philanthropists were plugged into a system of NGO advisors, Hollywood connections and Davos culture that guided donor decisions. She described Silicon Valley’s wealth ecosystem as a very small group of people who socialise together, serve on the same boards and make decisions that have outsized influence.Shanahan argues that these donors were not fully aware of how their philanthropic movements were being leveraged.She claims the women were used to fund groundwork that supported global policy frameworks rather than grassroots needs.Shanahan paints a picture of Silicon Valley spouses overwhelmed by the demands of extreme wealth. Many manage multiple homes, large staffs, strained relationships and high levels of stress. She says some are medicated for anxiety or depression and are too busy to question how their philanthropic guidance is shaped.She believes this emotional and logistical overload made these women more susceptible to being steered. As she describes it, they find meaning through philanthropic work. That was her identity as well, and she says she truly believed she was helping.Reflecting on her own giving, Shanahan says she once believed her donations were uplifting Black and Indigenous communities. But she now claims the opposite happened and argues that conditions deteriorated instead of improving.According to her:Her argument is that the philanthropic model itself is flawed because the structure reinforces problems instead of solving them.One of her strongest assertions is that two themes were repeatedly used to persuade Silicon Valley women to fund certain projects:Shanahan says these issues were emotionally compelling and therefore effective at steering donors toward programs that aligned with the interests of advisers and global institutions.She claims that any pushback was quickly dismissed with climate-related justifications, saying that whenever questioned, the answer was always some version of ""but climate change.""The Great Reset is a real initiative promoted by the World Economic Forum in 2020 as a framework for rethinking global systems after the pandemic. Supporters see it as a roadmap toward sustainability and economic reform. Critics argue that it centralises too much influence in the hands of global institutions.Shanahan positions Silicon Valley philanthropy as unintentionally feeding into this agenda, not through conspiracy but through unexamined donor pipelines and emotional messaging.Her comments are circulating widely because they come from someone who belonged to Silicon Valley’s highest social and financial circles, personally managed massive philanthropic budgets and now argues that the system is broken and has harmed the communities it claimed to help.","Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, has accused Silicon Valley’s elite donor circles of unknowingly supporting hidden agendas.
