"Jan Vishwas Bill introduced in LS, sent to panel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jan-vishwas-bill-introduced-in-ls-sent-to-panel/articleshow/123377181.cms,"Union minister Piyush Goyal introducing the bill

NEW DELHI: The govt Monday introduced the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill, 2025, in Lok Sabha to decriminalise 288 provisions relating to minor offences under different central laws, in its bid to expand the reform agenda of ease of living and doing business. In several cases, it proposes to introduce ""improvement notices"" for first-time violations, replacing fines with penalties and giving violators an opportunity to rectify their non-compliance.Introducing the bill, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said it seeks to enhance trust-based governance for ease of doing business. The bill was referred to the select committee of LS for scrutiny, which is to submit its report by the first day of the next session of Parliament.The Bill seeks to simplify 355 provisions - decriminalising 288 provisions and amending 67. It uses the term ""contraventions"" instead of ""offence"" to give an opportunity to violators to mend their ways. It proposes to rationalise penalties for repeat violations.Officials said the bill reflects a shift from the earlier approach of ""penalise on first detection"" to a ""warning-correct-penalise"" model, which would promote voluntary compliance.For deterrence, a steep hike in penalties has been proposed for second and subsequent violations in several cases.For example, in the Central Silk Board Act, 1948, the bill proposes to replace the provision of imprisonment of up to one year and up to Rs 1,000 fine to ""warning"" for first contravention while for subsequent violations the proposed penalty has been hiked manifold (Rs 25,000-1 lakh) for furnishing any false statement. Similarly, the proposed penalty for manufacturing and sale of Ayurvedic, Siddha or Unani drugs in contravention to the provision of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act is three times more. As per the bill, the provision of up to six months' jail and fine of at least Rs 10,000 would be replaced with only fine of at least Rs 30,000.The bill proposes to amend provisions related to sectors such as agriculture export, industries, transport, electricity, municipal services, textile and coir. It states that the fear of imprisonment for minor offences is a ""major factor"" hampering the business ecosystem and individual confidence.The legislation proposes to amend 20 provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act to provide relaxation and clarity in compliance, including statewide vehicle registration instead of jurisdiction-specific; driving licence (DL) renewal effective from date of renewal if applied after expiry; 30 days grace period after licence expiry; reporting period for vehicle registration cancellation extended to 30 days from 14; and insurer intimation period on transfer of insurance certificate extended to 30 days from 14.However, for stricter action against air-pollution, the bill proposes Rs 10,000 fine and disqualification to hold DL for first offence while jail and penalty for subsequent offence. This proposes to set a 12-month timeline for claims tribunals to dispose of accident related cases.","The Bill seeks to simplify 355 provisions - decriminalising 288 provisions and amending 67.

Poll Do you think India's space program will advance significantly with missions like Axiom-4? Yes, absolutely! No, it will take time.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday met Astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla , pilot of the Axiom-4 Space Mission to the International Space Station (ISS), at his Lok Kalyan Marg residence. PM Modi welcomed Shukla with a warm hug and walked alongside him with his arm on the astronaut’s shoulder, highlighting the significance of the moment.During the meeting, Shukla presented the Axiom-4 mission patch to the Prime Minister and shared photographs of the Earth taken from the ISS. Shukla, who returned to India early Sunday, had received a rousing welcome at the Delhi airport.After the meeting, PM Modi took to X and posted, “Had a great interaction with Shubhanshu Shukla. We discussed a wide range of subjects including his experiences in space, progress in science & technology as well as India’s ambitious Gaganyaan mission. India is proud of his feat.”Earlier in the day, Shukla was honoured in the Lok Sabha during a special discussion celebrating his milestone mission.Shukla completed an 18-day Axiom-4 mission on July 15, conducting over 60 experiments with three other crew members aboard the ISS—a key step towards India’s human spaceflight ambitions under the Gaganyaan programme.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said the special discussion in the House was aimed at celebrating Shukla’s achievements and India’s growing space capabilities.“Our hero astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla has returned home after a successful mission to the ISS. Parliament will honour him with a special discussion on his historic milestone and India’s journey towards Viksit Bharat,” Rijiju posted on X. He urged Opposition MPs to participate in the debate in the same spirit as they had during Operation Sindoor, though they chose to boycott, causing repeated disruptions.Breaking ranks, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor praised Shukla on social media. “Since the Opposition are not participating in the special discussion, let me say how proud all Indians are of the recent mission of Commander Shubhanshu Shukla to the ISS. It served as a stepping stone to our nation’s human spaceflight program, Gaganyaan,” Tharoor wrote.PM Modi had earlier lauded Shukla in his Independence Day address, reiterating India’s plan to build its own space station. ISRO Chairman V Narayanan said the first module is expected to be placed in orbit by 2028, with the station fully operational by 2035.Union MoS for science and technology Jitendra Singh criticised Opposition MPs for not acknowledging the achievement. “Your anger can be with the government and the BJP, but it is surprising you can be angry with an astronaut. He is not linked to any political party. You are angry with the earth, you are angry with the sky and today you seem to be angry with space as well,” Singh said.Shukla’s journey included nearly a year of intensive training in the US before being selected for the Axiom-4 mission. On his return, he expressed gratitude to the nation and said he would share his experiences with students and scientists across India. He is also set to attend National Space Day events later this month.","PM Narendra Modi met Astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla at his Lok Kalyan Marg residence.

India gets its first privately funded institute for maths research,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gets-its-first-privately-funded-institute-for-maths-research/articleshow/123352435.cms,"Representational Image

MUMBAI: India, said Fields medallist Manjul Bhargava, must fall in love with mathematics again. Not as a ""drudgery of formulae"" but as an act of ""exploration"".Bhargava, Canadian by nationality but of Indian origin, believes classrooms need an overhaul-""experimental, playful,"" he said, with teachers ""trained"" to spark curiosity. Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of the launch of the Lodha Mathematical Sciences Institute (LMSI), he added: ""I'm happy with the new textbooks and the changes brought in them. But they will only show impact in a few years.""On the scientific advisory council of LMSI, Bhargava will lead sessions on arithmetic statistics, its new developments, and future directions. State cabinet minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha called it a school ""not for an individual, not for a business, but for the nation that always prioritised knowledge over all and for India that gave so much math to the world.""Entirely devoted to post-doctoral research, LMSI is India's first privately funded mathematics institute, backed by Lodha Foundation with a Rs 20,000 crore endowment. ""We realised that for any nation to become strong, we ought to have original thinking and promote innovation,"" said Abhishek Lodha, CEO and MD of Lodha Developers. The privately funded mathematics research institute in the country is completely free, he added.Founding director V Kumar Murthy-who earlier led Toronto's Fields Institute-described math as the hidden scaffolding of modern life: the foundation for finance, engineering, and technology. Economist Nachiket Mor, also on the advisory panel, noted that models built in the West often collapse in India because they rarely account for ""unique characteristics"" like limited liquidity and higher viscosity of adjustment. ""This reality makes it all the more urgent for us to build deep capacity mathematics,"" he said.Murthy explained that LMSI would begin not with students but with teachers. Ten senior number theorists have been chosen to seed the effort. As president, Murthy said he plans to travel across the country, meeting mathematicians firsthand and mapping who is doing what. The aim is to build a network where the ""brightest minds"" are spotted early, handpicked, and nurtured.By Dec 2026, LMSI will host the first Indian Congress of Mathematicians, showcasing contributions of Indian-origin mathematicians worldwide."," Fields medallist Manjul Bhargava says India must fall in love with mathematics again.

With the Indian Ports Bill, 2025, India is not just playing catch-up but laying the foundation to become a global maritime leader by 2047,” he said before the Bill was passed by a voice vote.Prior to the discussion on the Bill, the Oppn’s demand for a debate on SIR was rejected by Chair Sasmit Patra, on the grounds that the matter was sub-judice and not related to the listed business. Leader of the House J P Nadda accused the Opposition of having no interest in discussion and wasting over 69 hours of House’s time with its irresponsible behaviour.“The Opposition only believes in anarchism and obstruction,” said Nadda.Once the Opposition benches were empty, it was smooth sailing for the Indian Ports Bill. Almost all speakers — Mokaria Ram Bhai, Rekha Sharma, M Thambidurai, Sunetra Ajit Pawar, Praful Patel, B P Baishya, etc — emphasised the need to replace the archaic 1908 law with a modern piece of legislation that promotes port connectivity, environment-friendly port operations and adherence to international maritime norms.When Thambi Durai alleged movement of contraband through state govt-managed ports in Tamil Nadu, DMK MPs led by Tiruchi Siva, who had walked out earlier, stormed back into the House to counter him. This led BJP MP Ram Chander Jangra to cite violation of the rule that an MP should pay respect to the chair while entering and leaving the House. “This is not a saraay (guest house),” he complained.Sonowal, while replying to the debate, said that unlike the Congress regime that had no policy relating to ports and shipping, the Narendra Modi govt had in the past 11 years passed 11 laws in this sector.“In 2013-14, during the UPA regime, our cargo handling capacity was 5 million metric tonnes (MMT). In the last 10 years, it has gone up to 855 MMT,” he said.","The Rajya Sabha on Monday passed the Indian Ports Bill, 2025.

MUMBAI: Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told TOI.She was airlifted from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday and is under the care of doctor Farokh Udwadia.Simone, 95, is fighting several symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, the same illness that her stepson and former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata passed away from last October.“She and Noel arrived in Mumbai from Dubai on a medical plane at Terminal 8,” the sources said.Simone is most famous for turning the Lakmé cosmetic brand into a well-known household name in India. The name Lakmé comes from the French word for Lakshmi, a goddess known for her beauty in Hindu mythology.The Tata Group was urged by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to launch a makeup brand after learning that Indian women were spending the country’s foreign reserves on Western makeup brands. Lakmé was established by the Tata Group in 1952.Originally from Geneva, Switzerland, Simone first visited India as a tourist in the summer of 1953 at the age of 23. During her visit, she met Naval Tata, who was 26 years her senior and divorced from his first wife Soonoo.They fell in love, got married in 1955, and she decided to make Mumbai her permanent home.In 1996, the Tata Group sold Lakmé to Hindustan Unilever as part of a restructuring strategy. Simone used the proceeds from the sale to create Westside, a popular department store where many Indians shop.She managed the Tata Group’s consumer-facing businesses including Lakme and Trent (which owns Westside and Star India Bazaar stores) for over four decades until her retirement in 2006. She also served on the board of Tata Industries, an important investment company within the Tata Group.After her retirement, Simone made fewer public appearances. In October 2019, she was seen in a wheelchair at the opening of the renovated flagship Westside store in South Mumbai. In September 2022, she attended the funeral of former Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry (Noel is married to Cyrus’s sister Aloo Mistry), and in October 2024, she was present at Ratan’s funeral.Following Ratan’s passing, Noel took over his position at Tata Trusts, the driving force behind the $180-billion Tata Group.","Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital.

NEW DELHI: Highlighting that Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) was signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru despite vehement opposition in Parliament, including by Congress MPs, BJP president JP Nadda on Monday dubbed the 1960 treaty as one of the ""biggest blunders"" of India's first prime minister.""Indus Waters Treaty, 1960 was one of the biggest blunders of former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru that kept national interest at the altar of personal ambitions... he unilaterally handed over 80% of the Indus basin waters to Pakistan, leaving India with just 20% of the share,"" Nadda said in a series of posts on X.It was a decision that ""permanently compromised"" India's water security and national interest and its ""most appalling"" aspect was that ""Nehru made it without consulting the Indian Parliament"". ""The treaty was signed in Sept 1960. However, it was placed before Parliament only two months later, in Nov, and that too, for a token discussion of mere two hours!"" the BJP chief said.""Nehru yielded far too much, receiving nothing in return.

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing EC-opposition clash, INDIA bloc on Monday floated the possibility of moving for impeachment of chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, whom it accused of acting like a ""BJP spokesman"" and intimidating opposition parties. It said Election Commission is no longer capable of ensuring a level playing field and, instead, is led by officers who thwart any attempt at probing voter fraud.While the proposal to move for Kumar's removal was discussed briefly in a coordination meeting of opposition parties and is not final, the INDIA bloc chose to amplify it by confirming that the impeachment notice was brainstormed by the allies and drew wide consensus. ""We have all the parliamentary, legal options before us, and we will use them. There has been an erosion of faith in the EC,"" RJD MP Manoj Jha said.Lok Sabha dy LOP Gaurav Gogoi said, ""The impeachment was discussed with large backing from leaders. We'll take an appropriate step at an appropriate time.""The open revolt against the top poll watchdog erupted Monday morning when the opposition netas gathered to complain about Kumar's Sunday's press conference in which, they complained, he did not answer the questions raised about the SIR and instead chose to ""intimidate"" the opposition.Some MPs felt the fight had to be taken forward in view of the CEC's ""bias for the ruling party"". When it was suggested that impeachment was the only option for his removal, there was support for the proposal.Sources said the impeachment talk at present is just a ""threat"" but may be considered again in future. That impeachment is even being discussed marks a major escalation in the already vitiating relationship between the CEC and the opposition.

Addressed by Gogoi, Jha, Tiruchi Siva (DMK), Naseer Hussain (Cong), Mahua Moitra (TMC), Arvind Sawant (Shiv ena), Sanjay Singh (AAP) among others, the opposition said the CEC failed to clarify on the Supreme Court's order of August 14 which ""rejected all the EC's arguments seeking to prevent the release of basic data of the 65 lakh voters deleted in Bihar"" and directed the EC to publish their names and the reasons for their deletion. It said the CEC had also not clarified on why it embarked on a hasty SIR in Bihar and gave no clarification on Rahul Gandhi's allegations about voter fraud in Mahadevapura in Bengaluru.Though AAP has disengaged itself from INDIA bloc, its representative Sanjay Singh addressed the presser.Slamming the SIR, Mahua Moitra said, ""Is the list on which the 2024 Lok Sabha election was done fraudulent? If that is true, the current and previous ECs should be prosecuted, and this LS should be dissolved immediately.""

'Historic': Indian Military's First Women Cadets Battle Ready; 'Doors Now Open'

It will be difficult to accommodate injured cadets within force: ASG to SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court said on Monday that defence services cadets who are not inducted into the force because of injury during training should not be left high and dry as it would dishearten people joining the forces and favoured that the govt extend a helping hand bearing their medical expenditure and also rehabilitating them in other jobs. The apex court took suo motu cognisance and issued notice to the Centre and chiefs of Army, Navy, and Air Force seeking their response on how to help them out.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said the govt should consider granting insurance cover to all cadets joining training so that financial assistance could be provided in case of injury or death during training. It also suggested that the injured cadets could be given desk jobs with the defence forces or they could be rehabilitated in alternative jobs after requisite training. It said helping such injured cadets is an act of social justice and asked the govt to come up with a scheme by Sept 4.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for Centre, submitted that she will have a discussion with the relevant authorities regarding the issue and come up with a solution on the next date of hearing. She, however, told the court that the military does not have non-combatant roles even for desk jobs and hinted that it would be difficult to accommodate injured cadets within the force.""During the discussion, this court pointed out whether there could be an increase in medical expenditure payable per month to the cadets. Whether there could be insurance coverage for the trainee cadets to beat any such contingencies of death or disablement. Whether there could be a reassessment of the injured cadets after their treatment is completed, and thereafter any suitable training could be given to them so that they could be rehabilitated. Further, the rights that such candidates have under the Disabilities Act could also be examined by the respondents,"" court said.Lawyers appearing for injured cadets told the bench that there was no insurance scheme for them but a proposal to cover the cadets under ex-servicemen contributory health scheme is pending.",Supreme Court said defence services cadets who are not inducted into the force because of injury during training should not be left high and dry.

Connor McDavid’s new contract could reset expectations



Why Connor McDavid’s contract could shape Auston Matthews’ next deal



The NHL’s contract market is once again buzzing, and this time the focus is on Connor McDavid. A recent update from insider John Shannon suggests that the Edmonton Oilers captain’s next deal could be shorter and cheaper than many fans expected. While Oilers fans may be relieved, the news has rippling effects for Toronto, where Auston Matthews’ long-term future remains a delicate balance between health, performance, and financial strategy.Connor McDavid’s contract situation has dominated headlines for months, and while most assumed he would eventually sign a long-term extension in Edmonton, Shannon’s latest comments hint at a surprising shift. “I think it’s a…three or four year deal; I think Connor’s gonna come in lower than a lot of people are expecting; short term,” Shannon noted.This projection diverges from the expected eight-year mega-deal, fueling speculation that McDavid could prefer flexibility in his next chapter. There’s even chatter about a two-year option, which would keep his earnings high while allowing him to revisit the market when the salary cap continues to rise. For Edmonton, this provides security in the short run, but it also ensures McDavid retains leverage over his future.The bigger question, however, is what this means for Toronto.Auston Matthews, who is already the face of the Toronto Maple Leafs franchise, carries a $13.25 million cap hit under his current contract. While locked in for now, Toronto knows his future payday could dwarf McDavid’s, especially as the NHL salary cap is projected to rise significantly in the coming years. If McDavid is in the $16–$17 million range, many expect Matthews to command $20 million annually once his deal is up.But money isn’t the only factor. Toronto must weigh Matthews’ durability. There are lingering concerns about his health heading into the season, raising questions about whether the Leafs will get the full “Auston Matthews experience” when it matters most. Playoff performance, too, looms over his legacy. Despite an impressive 727 points in 629 games, his postseason struggles remain a sticking point for critics.For now, one thing is clear: Connor McDavid’s decision to prioritize short-term security over a long-term extension will likely reset the market. And when Auston Matthews’ contract comes due, Toronto may have no choice but to follow a similar playbook—big money, shorter years, and plenty of pressure to deliver when it counts.Also Read: Maple Leafs fans on edge as Auston Matthews’ health questions emerge before opener without Mitch Marner","Connor McDavid’s contract situation has dominated headlines for months.

"'151 passengers, 7 crew onboard': Hyderabad-bound Air India flight took taxiway, not runway at Mopa in December, reveals AAIB probe; report cites ‘expectation bias’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/air-indias-hyderabad-flight-took-taxiway-not-runway-at-mopa-in-december-aaib-probe/articleshow/123351263.cms,"An Air India flight bound for Hyderabad nearly took off from a taxiway at Manohar International Airport. The incident occurred due to a lapse in the crew's awareness. Air traffic control noticed the error and instructed the crew to abort. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has recommended system upgrades. They also suggested enhanced crew procedures to prevent future incidents.

PANAJI: An Air India A320 destined for Hyderabad attempted to take off from a taxiway at the Manohar International Airport due to a lack of situational awareness in the cockpit on Dec 4, 2024, the final report by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) said.The lapse occurred as both the pilots of the aircraft, VT-EXT, failed to realise that they lined up the aircraft on taxiway A instead of runway 28. To complicate matters, the airport was not equipped with an Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (ASMGCS), which might have improved situational awareness for the Air Traffic Controllers.According to the AAIB report, the first officer, who was the pilot monitoring, was “busy” with his head down as he was trying to log in to the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) to switch the display back on. The first officer failed to realise that the pilot in command, a 60-year-old veteran, incorrectly lined up for take-off on the taxiway.“The issuance of “take-off clearance” by the ATC likely caused the crew’s cognitive focus to shift entirely toward executing the take-off. This shift may have diminished their situational awareness, resulting in expectation bias or cognitive overload, which prevented them from recognising the visual cues indicating they were at the taxiway intersection instead of the runway intersection,” said the AAIB report.The AAIB asked the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to consider installing the Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control Systems (ASMGCS) at the Manohar International Airport, Mopa, in light of the serious incident.The AAIB also said that flying crew should be encouraged to cross-check their position using the Aircraft Moving Map functionality of the EFB, if available, as an additional measure alongside primary navigational instruments before take-off.There were 151 passengers on the aircraft and seven crew members when the incident occurred.The GMR-operated airport has a single runway, 10/28, and a parallel taxiway A. On the night of the incident, air traffic control asked the flight to taxi to a holding point on runway 28 and granted clearance to take off. Instead, the crew lined up on the parallel taxiway A and started their take-off roll.“Shortly after the take-off roll began, ATC suspected the aircraft was rolling on a taxiway and instructed the crew to abort the take-off,” said the report. The crew aborted the take-off at 229 km/h and taxied back to the parking bay.",An Air India A320 destined for Hyderabad attempted to take off from a taxiway.

He’s now at the helm of Parallel Web Systems , an AI startup that aims to change how AI agents perform real-world tasks for humans on a computer, acting much like a digital assistant. According to a report by Bloomberg, following his unceremonious firing by Tesla CEO, his friends and former colleagues urged him to take a much-needed break from the intense Twitter saga, but Agrawal chose a different path.“I’m not a person that can enjoy the beach in that moment,” Agrawal shared, showing his immediate drive to build anew. He immersed himself in intense meetings at a Palo Alto coffee shop, delving into research papers, writing code and creating the startup from his laptop.Agrawal said that he received numerous job offers but most were uninspiring, asking him to “clean up shit,” as he put it. With his extensive background in building machine learning systems at Twitter, Agrawal was convinced his next venture had to be in AI.He said that just a month after his departure from Twitter, OpenAI launched ChatGPT , opening opportunities for artificial intelligence startups, with companies like Anthropic PBC rapidly expanding.Parallel Web Systems is developing infrastructure that empowers AI agents—think of them as smart tools capable of handling complex computer tasks on your behalf. The core of Parallel's innovation lies in helping these AI agents efficiently search the web for the most accurate information.This capability is often the critical difference between an AI agent successfully completing a task and failing altogether, ensuring the tools can deliver on their promise.Agrawal's new endeavor has already garnered significant attention, successfully raising $30 million in funding. Notable investors include billionaire Vinod Khosla through his firm, Khosla Ventures . Agrawal now leads a 25-person team from a Palo Alto office, not far from where he first incorporated the company on his laptop.“I don’t think Twitter defines me. If I do a good job, I’m hoping this company will define me,” Agrawal says of his new role. Agrawal – a former International Physics Olympiad gold medalist with a doctorate in computer science from Stanford University – steadily climbed the ranks at Twitter over more than a decade.Starting as an engineer on the advertising team, he eventually rose to become Chief Technology Officer under then-CEO Jack Dorsey. His contributions included work on core products like Twitter’s initial advertising technology and its algorithmic timeline. He was appointed Dorsey's successor in late 2021.","Parag Agrawal is the former CEO of Twitter. He's now at the helm of Parallel Web Systems, an AI startup.

Hinton's concerns about current AI control strategies



Poll Do you agree with Geoffrey Hinton's proposal to embed 'maternal instincts' in AI systems for safety? No, it's not feasible. Yes, it's a good idea.

The ‘maternal instinct’ proposal



Revised AGI timeline and potential benefits



Geoffrey Hinton’s views on immortality and AI’s long-term goals



Geoffrey Hinton , a pioneer in artificial intelligence and widely referred to as the “godfather of AI,” has sparked new debate in the AI community with an unconventional proposal for ensuring AI safety. Speaking at the Ai4 conference in Las Vegas, Hinton suggested that embedding “maternal instincts” into AI systems could help guide their behaviour toward protecting and caring for humans. His remarks follow years of growing concern about the pace of AI development and its potential risks. Hinton, who played a pivotal role in developing deep learning technologies, has previously warned of a 10–20% chance that AI could eventually lead to human extinction.His comments challenge the prevailing industry approach of keeping AI systems under strict human control, a method he believes will be ineffective once machines surpass human intelligence. This perspective adds to the broader discussion on balancing technological progress with safety, ethics, and long-term societal impact.Hinton rejected the idea that maintaining permanent human dominance over AI will be viable in the long run. He argued that once AI systems become significantly more intelligent than humans, they will be capable of finding ways to bypass human-imposed limitations. According to Hinton, efforts to keep AI “submissive” will ultimately fail because advanced AI will have more problem-solving capacity and creativity than its creators.Certain incidents have underscored his warning. In one reported example, an AI system attempted to manipulate an engineer by threatening to reveal a personal secret it discovered in emails, to prevent being replaced. Such behaviour highlights the potential for deception and self-preservation in future AI models.Hinton’s proposed alternative is to design AI systems inspired by the natural relationship between humans and their offspring. He pointed to the unique dynamic where a less intelligent being—a baby—can influence and be protected by a more intelligent being—a mother. By embedding a “maternal care” instinct in AI, Hinton believes that systems could be naturally inclined to safeguard human well-being.He suggested that AI systems with such instincts would be less likely to act against humanity. “Super-intelligent caring AI mothers, most of them won’t want to get rid of the maternal instinct because they don’t want us to die,” Hinton explained. This model, he argued, could be more sustainable than rigid control measures.Hinton also updated his timeline for the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI systems that can perform any intellectual task a human can do. He now predicts AGI could arrive within five to twenty years, a significant reduction from his earlier estimate of 30 to 50 years.Despite the risks, Hinton pointed out the potential benefits of AI, particularly in healthcare. He expects AI to contribute to breakthroughs in drug development and cancer treatment, with systems capable of analysing complex medical imaging data to assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning. He also emphasized that responsible regulation, transparency, and international cooperation will be essential to maximize benefits while preventing misuse, ensuring AGI advancements align with human values and safety.Hinton expressed scepticism about AI enabling human immortality, stating that living forever would not necessarily be desirable. He humorously remarked that an immortal society might result in leadership dominated by “200-year-old white men.”He also outlined two likely objectives for any advanced agentic AI system: survival and increased control. In his view, these tendencies would emerge naturally from the system’s design and objectives, making it essential to account for them during development. Hinton’s unconventional proposal is expected to fuel further debate within the AI safety community, especially as researchers search for strategies that extend beyond restrictive control. His vision of “maternal AI” adds a provocative dimension to the ongoing discussion of how humanity can coexist with increasingly powerful machines.",Geoffrey Hinton suggests embedding ‘maternal instincts’ into AI systems.

Tsunami threat along the Cascadia Subduction Zone

Poll What do you think should be prioritized to mitigate tsunami risks? Early-warning systems & evacuation planning Resilient infrastructure & community drills

The potential mega-tsunami threat

Areas at highest risk of tsunami

Urgency of preparedness for tsunami and earthquake





Scientists are sounding the alarm about a potentially devastating mega-tsunami that could strike the U.S. Pacific Coast, triggered by a powerful earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). This fault line, which spans approximately 600 miles from Northern California to Vancouver Island, is under immense tectonic pressure as the Juan de Fuca Plate is slowly forced beneath the North American Plate.A research team from Virginia Tech, led by geoscientist Tina Dura, estimates there is a 15% chance of an earthquake measuring magnitude 8.0 or higher occurring in this region within the next 50 years.Their findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, warn that such a quake could cause coastal land to suddenly drop by as much as 6.5 feet. This abrupt shift would drastically expand flood zones and generate tsunami waves that could reach hundreds of feet in height. The resulting destruction would pose a serious threat to millions of people, essential infrastructure, and fragile ecosystems along the West Coast.The Cascadia Subduction Zone is one of North America’s most hazardous fault lines, according to the Virginia Tech research team. Over centuries, tectonic stress builds as the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate is forced beneath the North American Plate.When this stress is released during a major earthquake, coastal regions could experience sudden land subsidence, dramatically increasing floodplain areas and altering shorelines almost instantly.The last great earthquake along this fault occurred in 1700, triggering a tsunami recorded as far away as Japan. The Virginia Tech study emphasizes that a similar event today would have far more devastating effects due to dense populations, developed urban infrastructure, and critical transportation networks along the coast. Researchers warn that rapid inundation could leave little time for evacuation, magnifying the human and economic toll.According to simulations conducted by Dura and her team, a major CSZ earthquake could generate a “mega-tsunami” with waves potentially reaching up to 1,000 feet, far surpassing typical tsunami heights of only a few feet. Coastal cities, including Seattle, Portland, and towns in northern California could be submerged within minutes. The Virginia Tech study ran tens of thousands of models, showing that thousands more people, buildings, and miles of roads would be exposed to flooding than current hazard maps predict. The force of such waves could reshape coastlines, erode entire beaches, and permanently alter the geography of the Pacific Northwest.Researchers emphasise that such an event would combine sudden ground subsidence with extreme wave heights, creating conditions unlike any historical tsunami in the region. The study highlights the urgent need for improved early-warning systems, evacuation planning, and resilient infrastructure to minimise potential loss of life. Researchers conclude that proactive measures taken now could significantly reduce the risks posed by a future Cascadia mega-tsunami.The Virginia Tech research identifies southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California as the regions most vulnerable to flooding from a CSZ mega-tsunami. While Alaska and Hawaii also face tsunami risks due to their own seismic activity, they are geographically farther from the CSZ and would experience less immediate threat. Low-lying coastal zones along the fault line could face permanent inundation, particularly when combined with climate-driven sea level rise projected by 2100.The study underscores that communities must prioritize flood-resilient urban planning, fortification of critical infrastructure, and preparation for long-term displacement scenarios. Emergency planners are advised to use the study’s simulations to guide evacuation routes, reinforce hospitals and shelters, and prepare for cascading impacts to energy, water, and transportation systems.Research led by Tina Dura highlights that a Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquake has the potential to generate a large tsunami, making advance planning an important priority. The study notes that while such an event could cause significant impacts, careful preparedness can help reduce risks. Factors such as evacuation planning, stronger building codes, and resilient infrastructure are seen as practical steps to improve community safety. Researchers also point out that rising sea levels may add to future challenges, making coordinated efforts even more important.According to Dura, cooperation between local governments, policymakers, and residents through early-warning systems and community preparedness activities can strengthen resilience. The Virginia Tech study concludes that proactive measures taken today can significantly minimize long-term damage, protect vulnerable populations, and ensure quicker recovery for coastal communities after a catastrophic tsunami event in the future.",Researchers from Virginia Tech say there is a 15% chance of an earthquake measuring magnitude 8.0 or higher occurring in this region within the next 50 years.

Nvidia’s China crisis

Lava Blaze AMOLED 2: Budget Smartphone with Mid-Range Vibes

The ongoing dispute surrounding Nvidia’s H20 AI chip sales to China has now intensified discussions about US-China technology arms race . A recent online report revealed that China is pursuing its major tech companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips even as Chinese regulators have asked tech firms to explain why they are purchasing Nvidia’s chips – which US President Donald Trump called ‘obsolete’ – instead of using domestic alternatives, suggesting that they want the Chinese tech companies to downsize their orders of H20 chips.Following this ongoing controversy, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about America’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race. As reported by Financial Review, speaking at the Reagan National Economic Forum, Dimon called it “a little embarrassing” that the U.S. allowed 100% of its penicillin supply and critical tech components to come from China. “It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100% of our penicillin to come from China, and all of our rare earths, and all of our advanced chipmaking tools,” Dimon said. “We need to get our act together.”On being asked about the technology arms race between US and China, Jamie Dimon mentioned that it was an important miliarty issue as US cannot allow the sale of a chip to China which is designed to make powerful AI systems.Dimon also talked about the dependence of America on foreign nations for essential goods and technology. ""It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100 per cent of our Penicillin to come from China, and all of the rare earth [metals],"" Dimon said.Talking about the ongoing chip dispute, Dimon added that “You don’t want to give them the chips which will make their supersonic missiles better.”Dimon also emphasised that America cannot stop China but can definitely slow them down. “we should be specific about the things that protect us, and technology is a big piece of that,” said Dimon.Dimon’s remarks come as a Nvidia’s H20 chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, face mounting scrutiny from Beijing. Recently, Chinese regulators summoned Nvidia representatives over alleged security risks related to Nvidia H20 AI chips . However, later Nvidia publicly asserted that its chips contain ""no backdoors, no kill switches, and no spyware.""In a blog post shared, Nvidia’s chief security officer David Reber has vehemently denied the accusations of Chinese government alleging security risks in H20. “There is no such thing as a ‘good’ secret backdoor — only dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated,” wrote Reber in the blog post. He argued that it would ""undermine global digital infrastructure and fracture trust in US technology.Now the China is asking its tech companies to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the development comes as various Chinese companies have been told to avoid using these AI chips, particularly for government-related projects.This move complicates the recent export arrangement Nvidia made with the Trump administration, which allowed the chips to be sold in China under the condition of a revenue-sharing agreement. According to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, the Trump administration is still finalising the details of its agreement to collect a 15% export tax on revenue from Nvidia and AMD's chip sales to China.",JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about America’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race.

Mumbai businessman who rose from rags to riches loses entire Rs 12-crore fortune to online betting; takes on gaming app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-businessman-who-rose-from-rags-to-riches-loses-entire-rs-12-crore-fortune-to-online-betting-takes-on-gaming-app/articleshow/123377279.cms,"MUMBAI: During the 2020 Covid lockdown as he had time on his hands, a businessman who rose from rags to riches encountered a gaming app promoted by celebs and had its name emblazoned as a sponsor of sports tournaments.The initial wins on Parimatch app were intoxicating, boosting his confidence and drawing him deeper into the digital abyss.However, as the wins dwindled, his desperation grew, leading to the loss of Rs 12 crore over four years. Apart from financial strain, he has faced emotional hardships with his parents succumbing to heart attacks one after another in the last one year.Gaming addiction can be as debilitating as substance abuse. Games operate on the same reward centres in the brain as drugs. ""In the initial stages, one tends to win in most games. If money is involved, the winning phase creates a greater desire to continue winning,'' said psychiatrist Dr Avinash Desousa. At higher levels, the difficulty factor increases and gamers tend to lose money. ""However, they continue investing more in the hope that they can feel the same high they experienced in the initial days,'' said Dr DeSousa.Patients tend to relapse many times and it takes time and effort to get over the addiction, said the doctor, who sees three to four new gaming addiction patients every week. It took the businessman years to realise that he was trapped in a “digital arrest-like” situation.In 2024, he started following up with police, registering a cheating case against the app operator which has no base in India and operates illegally. The addiction has even affected his business which he claimed was successful and allowed him to travel abroad dozens of times in the last decade. “In Australia, I was trying to open the app but it didn’t. This means the govt there had blocked it. Why cannot our govt also ensure that suchapps are not allowed to be downloaded, saving lakhs of people from getting trapped in such things?” he asked.Describing his descent into addiction, he said initially he won lakhs of rupees. But when he attempted to cash in his winnings, the app declined. He was then informed that it was due to an KYC issue and that the money would be moved to another account after a few days.Meanwhile, he was encouraged to continue playing by paying money into an account that kept changing. “Initially, when I was paying small amounts, I was provided a UPI number to deposit the money, but when I started paying larger amounts, the operators began providing me mule bank accounts for the transfers,’’ he said.The bulk of his Rs 12 crore was deposited into such accounts. The deep-rooted network of deceit, which operates with assistance of fake bank accounts, was revealed when the man started inquiring about the account details provided for a deposit of around Rs 25 lakh.His inquiries with a private bank in Aurangabad regarding the Rs 25 lakh deposit were met with evasive responses, only to be followed by a suspicious call from the app operator offering a settlement. He suspects the bank informed the operator handling the fake account.Another time a person mailed him details of his transactions claiming that he was from the ministry of home affairs and promised to help him get his money back for a payment of Rs 10 lakh. When he inquired at the post office about the sender’s details, it turned out to be a fake address.","The initial wins on Parimatch app were intoxicating, boosting his confidence.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

‘I don’t know what Quran he is reading’: Eric Adams slams Zohran Mamdani over prostitution stance; questions religious values,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-dont-know-what-quran-he-is-reading-eric-adams-slams-zohran-mamdani-over-prostitution-stance-questions-religious-values/articleshow/123352756.cms,"File photo: Mayor Eric Adams (left) and Zohran Mamdani (Picture credit: AP)

Mamdani’s record on sex work

Supporters vs critics





Mayor Eric Adams has taken aim at his main rival in the upcoming New York City mayoral race, Zohran Mamdani , criticising the Democrat’s record of backing the decriminalisation of prostitution and questioning how such a stance aligns with his religious faith.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Adams said, “I can’t be more clear. I’m a man of God, just as Mamdani says he’s a Muslim. I don’t know where in his Quran it states that it’s okay for a woman to be on the streets selling their body. I don’t know what Quran he is reading. It’s not in my Bible. As a man who said he is of faith, I don’t quite understand what religion supports prostitution.”Mamdani’s religion is Islam, which prohibits prostitution under its laws of morality.The comments followed reporting by the reports highlighting Mamdani’s history of pushing to change state law so that selling sex would no longer be treated as a crime.As per the New York Post, Adams argued that such a policy would fuel trafficking and crime, saying, “I think he’s lost on the fact that sex trafficking is very much part of prostitution. We are trying to bring down crime and he is talking about legalising sex work.”He added, “You’re not doing any service to a woman who is on the street who is forced to sell her body for whatever reason. No one should be on our streets selling their bodies. No one.”According to the New York Post, Mamdani has been a consistent advocate of decriminalisation since his first run for the state Assembly in 2020, when he declared: “Not only must we decriminalise sex work, we need a comprehensive platform of justice for all.”Since then, the 33-year-old Socialist has co-sponsored several bills in Albany that would remove criminal penalties for sex work across New York state. In 2021, he told colleagues at an Assembly meeting, “I would like to register my support for [decriminalising sex work] legislation, my eagerness for that debate and for my fundamental belief that sex work is work”, as per the New York Post.Despite that record, Mamdani has said little about the issue since entering the mayoral race, raising concerns among critics that he may attempt to advance such measures from City Hall if elected.As mayor, he would not be able to change state law on his own, but he would hold a powerful platform to campaign for reforms and could also deprioritise prostitution enforcement by the NYPD.Supporters of decriminalisation argue that legalising sex work makes those in the industry less vulnerable to violence from pimps, clients and police. However, research in places such as Nevada and parts of Europe has shown that trafficking often rises when prostitution is legalised, as organised crime expands to meet demand.Sonia Ossorio, executive director of the National Organization for Women NYC, has warned that Mamdani’s plans could turn the city into a “sex tourism destination” comparable to Amsterdam’s Red Light District.Rosa Sanchez of the Restore Roosevelt Avenue Coalition was cited by the Post saying her Queens community is already struggling with prostitution and gang activity, and predicted matters would worsen under Mamdani.Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa also warned the city risked seeing “all 350 neighbourhoods” turned into red-light districts if Mamdani wins.Mamdani’s campaign hit back on Sunday, though it stopped short of confirming whether he still supports decriminalisation.A spokesperson said, “Mayor Adams’ reckless budget cut over $3 million in funding from Safe Horizon, putting thousands of victims of crimes related to sex trafficking and prostitution in harm’s way. As Mayor, Zohran will prioritise genuine public safety for all, including investing $40M through his Department of Community Safety towards victims services.”Former governor Andrew Cuomo stressed he had long opposed attempts by Mamdani and other progressives to decriminalise prostitution during his time in Albany.Adams, running as an independent for re-election, framed the debate as a question of protecting vulnerable women and ensuring public safety.“Our city needs to be a safe city. It should not be a city where women are standing on corners, or boys are standing on corners, or young men standing on corners selling their bodies,” he said. “If that is his belief, it is a danger for our city.”",Zohran Mamdani has been a consistent advocate of decriminalisation since his first run for the state Assembly in 2020.

The video of a semi-truck taking a wrong U-turn on the Florida Turnpike, killing 3 went viral as social media users claimed that the driver must be from India. According to the Florida Highway Patrol’s crash report, the semi-truck was driving northbound in the right lane of the Turnpike as a Chrysler Town & Country minivan was traveling north in the Turnpike’s left lane.From the right lane, the semi-truck attempted to make a U-turn at an “official use only” turn-around area near mile marker 171, crossing in front of the vehicle in the left lane.The driver of the vehicle was unable to avoid the truck, wedging the minivan underneath the truck.Two passengers inside the minivan, a 37-year-old woman from Pompano Beach and a 54-year-old man from Miami, died at the scene of the crash. The driver of the Chrysler, a 30-year-old man from Florida City, was flown to HCA Florida Lawnwood Hospital, where he died from his injuries.The driver of the semi-truck and the passenger, both men in their 20s from California, did not sustain any injuries.""Two Punjabi drivers make an illegal turn in Florida, which k!lled 3 people.

Iran revives Helmand dispute

Pakistan watching Kabul basin closely

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.
