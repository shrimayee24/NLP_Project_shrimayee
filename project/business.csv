Did producer-director Sujoy Ghosh violate copyright? Supreme Court to decide on ‘Sabak’ vs ‘Kahaani 2’ row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/did-producer-director-sujoy-ghosh-violate-copyright-supreme-court-to-decide-on-sabak-vs-kahaani-2-row/articleshow/122216710.cms,"Supreme Court of India (Picture credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: Is there a ‘Sabak’ (lesson) in the film 'Kahani-2' for producer-director Sanjay Ghosh? The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to adjudicate Ghosh’s petition against criminal proceedings initiated against him in a Hazaribagh court by one Umesh Prasad Mehta, who accused Ghosh of lifting from his literary work “Sabak’.The entire case is a classic example of snail paced three-tiered justice delivery system in India – a simple question whether Ghosh has lifted from Umesh’s work ‘Sabak’ and used it in the script of his film “Kahani-2” has already consumed six years since the Hazaribagh magistrate found a prima facie case and issued summons to Ghosh in 2018. And there is no finality yet to the entire controversy.Ghosh challenged the magistrate’s order before the Jharkhand HC in 2018, and his plea was rejected by the HC only on Apr 22 this year, after nearly seven years. Arguing his appeal against the HC order, senior advocate Siddharth Dave told a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and R Mahadevan that the magistrate, without watching Kahani-2 film, has formed an erroneous prima facie opinion and issued summons to Ghosh.The bench said that it could be proved only in a trial whether the content of ‘Sabak’ has been plagiarised in the script of ‘Kahani-2’. However, it refused to stay the trial proceedings before the Hazaribagh court while exempting Ghosh’s personal appearance before the magistrate.Umesh had alleged that he had given the script of ‘Sabak’ to Ghosh for assistance in obtaining copyright over it. Ghosh later produced ‘Kahani-2” and after watching it at Hazaribagh, Umesh filed a complaint before the trial court alleging that “Ghosh has violated his copyright by committing theft of the script to produce ‘Kahani-2’ film”.The Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hazaribagh, found a prima facie case for the offence punishable under Section 63 of Copyright Act, 1957 and issued summons to Ghosh.",The entire case is a classic example of snail paced three-tiered justice delivery system in India. A simple question whether Ghosh has lifted from Umesh’s work ‘Sabak’ and used it in the script of his film ‘Kahani-2’ has already consumed six years.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122216772,imgsize-1182053,width-400,resizemode-4/122216772.jpg"

Isro is deeply appreciative of the partnership and camaraderie shown by our counterparts around the world.”Reiterating that the mission was conceptualised during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to the US in 2023, Isro said the PM’s leadership continues to shape India’s future in space as one that is collaborative, confident, and committed to peaceful exploration.Ax-4 is expected to provide useful operational inputs for Isro’s Gaganyaan programme , particularly in areas such as astronaut health telemetry, crew-ground coordination, multi-agency integration, and experiment execution in space conditions.“These insights will directly influence mission planning, safety validation, and astronaut readiness for India’s first indigenous human spaceflight mission,” Isro said.Onboard the ISS, a set of Indian scientific experiments is being conducted as part of the Ax-04 mission. These cover life sciences, fluid dynamics, health monitoring, and Earth observation.“Redwire Space, US, is coordinating the payload integration activities. Redwire facilitated key steps, including technical validation and compliance with ISS payload requirements. Each experiment is packaged into flight-ready payload containers. Redwire is also supporting the development of hardware handling protocols, ensuring that the Indian experiments could be safely deployed and operated onboard ISS, thereby enabling meaningful scientific outcomes for India’s research community,” Isro said.Pointing out how the launch was rescheduled multiple times due to issues such as a harness problem in Dragon, weather in the ascent corridor, leakage in the Falcon-9 booster stage, and leakage in the Zvezda Module of the ISS, the space agency said: “The Isro delegation played a constructive role in resolving all the issues. It made its stand clear that all problems should be resolved before clearing the launch for lift-off, considering the mission risks and safety of the crew. ”The Indian astronauts —Shukla and his backup Group Captain Prashanth B Nair — have trained in spacecraft systems, microgravity operations, emergency protocols, space medicine, and experiment handling. As part of the programme, he also participated in Nasa’s National Outdoor Leadership Programme (NOLPS) in the Mexican wilderness, designed to build team resilience and psychological readiness.","Axiom-4 follows in the legacy of international cooperation that sent Rakesh Sharma to space in 1984 aboard the Soviet Soyuz.

NEW DELHI: ED on Wednesday told a special court that former Congress presidents Sonia and Rahul Gandhi wanted to take over a Rs 2,000 crore company - Associated Journals Limited (AJL) - that once published party organ National Herald.The agency, through additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju, submitted before the court of Special Judge Vishal Gogne that a conspiracy was hatched to create Young Indian Pvt Ltd, a not-for-profit company, in which Sonia and Rahul held 76% shares (38% each), to siphon off assets of AJL in lieu of repaying a Rs 90 crore loan (taken by AJL) to Congress. This debt was converted into equity in favour of Young Indian (YI), ED argued.The agency argued that the whole scheme was conceived for the benefit of the Gandhis, who controlled YI as well as AJL, the latter, while being in loss, had enough assets to repay the loan.""Losses were to the tune of Rs 70 lakh. They (YI) didn't even have the wherewithal to pay Rs 50 lakh. During this time, Rahul and Sonia were directors of the company along with Sam Pitroda and others,"" said Raju, adding that AJL was not making profit but it had assets worth Rs 2,000 crore.""How come they (AJL and its functionaries) didn't have Rs 90 crore to repay the loan (given by Congress)? Any prudent person would've sold their assets to repay loans. This is absurd and can never be explained,"" the ASG argued.The hearing saw Raju refuting the suggestion that since AJL was started by the first PM, Jawahar Lal Nehru, it was alright for Congress to acquire it.Referring to Sonia and Rahul, ED said till 2015, only these two individuals were the actual beneficiaries with full control over AJL's assets and functioning.The court will continue to hear arguments on Thursday too. ""AJL was not making a profit but it had large assets of Rs 2,000 crore. They were finding it difficult to manage their daily affairs. Thus, a Rs 90 crore loan was taken from Congress,"" ASG submitted.He said several senior Congress functionaries engaged in fake transactions that existed only on paper to divert funds to AJL, adding that fabricated rent receipts and fraudulent advance rent payments were made over several years."," ED told a special court that former Congress presidents Sonia and Rahul Gandhi wanted to take over a Rs 2,000 crore company.

NEW DELHI: As foreign minister S Jaishankar held a bilateral meeting with US defence secretary Pete Hegseth, the latter expressed hope that the US can complete several major pending defence sales to India and expand shared defence industrial cooperation.Noting mutual concern about the danger of aggression in the Asia-Pacific region, according to a US readout, the two reviewed pending defence sales, the signing of the next '10 Year Defence Framework' and progress on advanced tech policy reviews.The two countries had announced plans to pursue new procurements and co-production arrangements for Javelin anti-tank guided missiles and Stryker armoured vehicles. Talks are also on for procurement of six additional P-8I maritime patrol aircraft from US.The US is looking at more defence procurement by India also to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance.Jaishankar told Hegseth the India-United States defence partnership is today truly one of the most consequential pillars of the relationship.""It is not built merely on shared interests, but we believe really in deepening convergence of capabilities, of responsibilities, and what we do in the Indo-Pacific, we believe is absolutely crucial to its strategic stability,"" he said.Jaishankar also met his counterpart Marco Rubio who, according to an American readout, affirmed the strength of the US-India relationship, highlighting implementation of the US-India COMPACT which will enhance collaboration on trade, defence, energy, countering illegal immigration and counternarcotics.

It also urged all UN States to cooperate with “all relevant authorities” in this regard, without naming Pakistan or India.In his opening remarks at the meeting in Washington, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had said India expected Quad – a strategic grouping of leading maritime nations committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific – to understand and appreciate India’s right to defend its citizens from cross-border terrorism. This was the first Quad ministerial since the April 22 Pahalgam attack and the subsequent India-Pakistan conflict that ended with India’s bombing of Pakistan air bases.“We condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025, which claimed the lives of 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen, while injuring several others,” said the Quad statement, expressing deepest condolences to the families of the victims.The UN Security Council (UNSC) statement condemning the attack in April seemed to have acted as a template for the Quad, the former having urged UN States to cooperate with all relevant authorities – without specifically mentioning India - in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant UNSC resolutions. Like with the UNSC condemnation, there was also no mention of the perpetrator group – The Resistance Front (TRF) – in the Quad statement. As a non-permanent Council member, Pakistan had worked to water down the UNSC statement with support from Beijing.“We call for the perpetrators, organizers, and financiers of this reprehensible act to be brought to justice without any delay and urge all UN Member States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant UNSCRs, to cooperate actively with all relevant authorities in this regard,” added the Quad statement.Like in the past, the Quad ministerial unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism, renewing commitment to counterterrorism cooperation.Apart from India, Quad comprises the US, Australia and Japan, all of which had separately condemned the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India, however, was keen that Quad do so in a joint statement for a more impactful response to Pakistan’s role in the attack and its support for cross-border terrorism.It was a fair expectation, given Quad’s strong condemnation of cross-border terrorism in the past too, like after the foreign ministers’ meeting in Tokyo last year in July. On that occasion, Quad had strongly condemned 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot attacks, calling for bringing the perpetrators of these attacks to justice without delay, and naming UN-proscribed groups including Pakistan-based JeM and LeT for concerted action against them by the international community. There was no mention this time of any Pakistan terror group or the Mumbai and Pathankot attacks in the Quad statement.","The Quad foreign ministers strongly condemned the Pahalgam terrorist attack in a joint statement.

The draw of lots extended to Patna College and Patna Science College, two of Bihar's oldest and most prestigious institutes, which will be now headed, respectively, by Anil Kumar, a chemistry teacher from a UP college, and Alaka Yadav of Hajipur's Mahila College.Suheli Mehta, a home science teacher at Magadh Mahila College, was 'picked' to head Vanijya Mahavidyalay while Yogendra Kr Varma of Patna Law College became the institution's principal.All the five incumbents were earlier selected as principals on the recommendations of Bihar State University Service Commission (BSUSC), based on their interviews and academic qualifications. It's after a gap of 15 years that the PU colleges will get principals recommended by the university service commission.Usually, the appointment of a college principal is done by vice-chancellor of the university concerned.However, following allegations of foul play in appointment of principals in some universities, governor-cum-chancellor Arif Mohammed Khan ordered that the posting of BSUSC-recommended candidates would be done through a lottery system under the supervision of a three-member committee, headed by the VC of the university concerned.In the case of five PU colleges, the names were picked through a draw supervised by a committee consisting of VC Ajay Kumar Singh, registrar Shalini and the chancellor's representative, Rahmat Jahan.

Complainant drove rashly, broke rules before car toppled

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday said insurance companies are not bound to pay compensation to the kin of drivers who die due to their own mistake during daredevil stunts or on account of rash and negligent driving, in an extreme message to speed addicts and those who seek to hog eyeballs by performing stunts, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.Justices P S Narasimha and R Mahadevan refused to give relief to the wife, son and parents of a man who died while driving a car at high speed in a rash and negligent act which ended with the vehicle toppling over.Dismissing the claim petition of his kin, who demanded Rs 80 lakh as compensation from United India Insurance Company, the bench said that family members cannot demand an insurance payout when death is caused due to a mistake on part of the deceased without involvement of any extraneous factors. The SC upheld the decision of Karnataka HC on Nov 23 last year rejecting their claim for compensation.On June 18, 2014, one N S Ravisha was driving a Fiat Linea from Mallasandra village to Arasikere town, with his father, sister and her children as co-passengers. He drove rashly and at a high speed and broke traffic rules before losing control of the vehicle near Mylanahalli gate, Arasikere. The car toppled over and rolled on the road.Ravisha succumbed to injuries sustained in the accident.

NEW DELHI: Consumption of protein rich food in India has inched up in over a decade but fat intake has risen at a faster pace. Latest data released Wednesday showed cereals continue to be the most important source of protein among the five major food groups.The data released by the statistics office showed an increasing trend in daily intake of protein by individuals in urban as well as rural India since 2009-10 and trend was evident in most major states. Rajasthan, Haryana, Maharashtra and UP, however, showed a marginal decline in average protein intake. In urban areas, daily per capita intake of protein rose from 58.8 gms 2009-10 to 63.4 gms per day in 2023-24, an increase of 8%, while in rural areas, it rose at a slower pace, from 59.3 gms a day in 2009-10 to 61.8 gms in 2023-24.Pulses consumption in rural areas rose marginally, while it dipped in urban centres. In both areas, egg, meat and fish consumption saw the steepest rise. In the case of fat intake, there is an unmistakable rising trend, with every major state showing an increase, according to the Nutritional Intake report released by the statistics ministry based on the Household Consumption Expenditure survey of 2022-23 and 2023-24.At the all-India level, the rise has been from 43.1 gms per person per day in 2009-10 for the rural population to 60.4 gms in 2023-24 and from 53.0 gms to 69.8 gms for the urban - a rise of more than 15 gms in both segments. All the major states show a rise in per capita per day intake of fat across rural and urban segments, the data showed.The data showed that cereals accounted for 46-47% of the share of protein in rural areas among the five major food groups, which include pulses, milk and milk products, eggs, meat and fish and other food category. In urban areas, it was about 39% for 2022-23 and 2023-24. The report showed that the contribution of cereals to protein intake has fallen by about 14% in rural India and nearly 12% in urban India from 2009-10. The fall in the share of cereals has been balanced by rise in the share of egg, fish and meat, other food and milk and milk products, the data showed.","Cereals continue to be the most important source of protein among the five major food groups.

EC yet to hear from oppn after Cong plea for 'urgent' meet

NEW DELHI: Netas of the INDIA bloc met the Election Commission on Wednesday to question the timing of the special intensive revision (SIR) of the Bihar electoral roll, saying it comes too close to the ensuing assembly poll. They also complained that EC's guidelines, including only those who are 'ordinarily resident' in a constituency, may affect migrants who form a significant part of the Bihar electorate.The opposition told EC that SIR could be ""disastrous"" as it could lead to the deletion of ""tens of lakhs"" of genuine voters, especially those on the margins. Eleven opposition parties that met EC comprised Congress, RJD, TMC, DMK, SP, JMM, NCP-SP, Shiv Sena (UBT), CPI(M), CPI and CPI(ML) Liberation.Congress had approached the Election Commission on June 30 seeking an ""urgent"" meeting ""any time after 4 pm on July 2"" between the poll panel and a delegation comprising 10 opposition parties to discuss the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of rolls in Bihar. However, EC, despite promptly writing back to each of the 10 parties to indicate availability of their representatives at 5 pm on July 2, is yet to hear from them.EC sources said the ""July 2"" meeting with the multi-party opposition delegation thus stood deferred as no confirmations were received.Sources told TOI that while the mail received from a legal counsel of the All India Congress Committee for the multi-party delegation's appointment with EC was unilateral - with no similar email received from the remaining nine parties or the AICC mail marked to them - the panel in its response sent the same day to each party - Congress, RJD, TMC, DMK, SP, NCP, JMM, CPI, CPM and CPI(ML) Liberation - welcoming their request and seeking their confirmations for a meeting at 5 pm on July 2. However, not one of the parties, Congress included, had responded to EC's mail till late Tuesday, said EC sources.Even so, a TMC delegation met EC on Tuesday as part of its consultation with parties on all poll-related issues.","EC yet to hear from oppn after Cong plea for 'urgent' meet on July 2.

"Insurance scam: Officials from 50 firms, finance ministry meet in Sambhal to plug gaps leading to frauds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/insuring-dying-dead-50-firms-finmin-meet-with-senior-cops/articleshow/122193252.cms,"Insurance scam: Officials from 50 firms, finance ministry meet in Sambhal to plug gaps leading to frauds

MEERUT: Six months after a multi-crore insurance scam surfaced in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal district, senior officials from the Union finance ministry, insurance regulatory bodies, over 50 insurance companies, and investigative agencies met in Sambhal to plug critical policy gaps and improve coordination. At the conclave hosted by the UP Police, officials proposed systemic reforms to combat insurance fraud, including changes to Section 45, enhanced data sharing, and stricter scrutiny of investigation processes.The scam, first reported by TOI, involved policies being taken out in the names of terminally ill or deceased individuals across more than 12 states. ""The findings uncovered during the probe prompted the need for a national-level dialogue on fraud prevention. The idea came from the case details we encountered over the past six months,” said Anukriti Sharma, additional SP of Sambhal and lead investigator.The investigation revealed that the network did not stop at forgery. In some cases, operatives allegedly resorted to murder to access insurance payouts. Four such deaths, initially reported as accidents, were later linked directly to the scam. In one case, a paralysed man was killed in Sambhal for a policy worth Rs 95 lakh.In another, a man was murdered in Amroha to claim Rs 2.7 crore. These killings highlighted the organised nature of the racket and its readiness to escalate from document fraud to homicide.Sambhal SP Krishna Bishnoi said the conclave concluded with a range of key suggestions. “We discussed better coordination among insurers, the need to relook Section 45, investor protection, standardisation of investigation procedures, and stronger communication between police and insurance firms,” he told TOI. He added that participants also suggested introducing new legislation tailored to insurance fraud, setting standards for investigation companies, and building structured channels for information-sharing between stakeholders.The scale of the fraud brought Section 45 of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015, into sharp focus. The clause bars insurers from questioning a policy on any ground—including misstatement or fraud—after three years from the date of issuance, revival or commencement, whichever is earlier. Officials said this clause has often been misused to push fraudulent claims.At the conclave, Meena Kumari, Executive Director of IRDAI, pointed out that insurers need to maintain up-to-date policies and procedures at both the underwriting stage and the claims stage, with an appropriate feedback loop. Many companies appear to be missing early signs of fraud because the systems don’t talk to each other,” she said. “Preventing fraud is essential, but equal attention must be paid to ensuring no genuine claim is denied. ” She called for smarter use of data and faster detection tools that don’t delay payouts to honest claimants.Mandakini Balodhi, director (insurance), the finance ministry, said the bigger challenge was the restoration of public trust. “Insurance is a tool of financial inclusion, and social security schemes allow us to serve the most vulnerable. Fraud and abuse in the insurance ecosystem hit these highly vulnerable segments and need to be arrested by concerted efforts of all present in the ecosystem, insurance and outside. ” She added that repeated frauds risk damaging faith in welfare programmes designed for the most vulnerable.Venkat Changavalli, who leads the Insurance Information Bureau, said fraudsters were exploiting the gaps between companies. “We see the same scam patterns being missed because insurers aren’t sharing data fast enough,” he said. “We’re working on systems to flag suspicious claims in real time, but that only works if insurers respond quickly and consistently.”TOI’s investigation revealed that the scam, estimated to be worth over Rs 500 crore, extended into government-backed schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Mukhyamantri Sadak Durghatna Bima Yojana. Operatives used fake death certificates, tampered Aadhaar data, and backdated policies to make fraudulent claims. The investigation exposed links between insurance agents, hospital staff, bank officials, ASHA workers, civic employees, and elected representatives.In Jan, UP Police intercepted an SUV in Sambhal carrying cash, forged PAN cards, Aadhaar details, and fake documents. That bust triggered a wider investigation and culminated in a May case by the Enforcement Directorate under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Police later filed an 800-page chargesheet naming operatives from UP, Bihar, and Jharkhand. Police have so far registered 17 FIRs in Sambhal, Moradabad, Badaun and Amroha, arrested 52 people, and recorded three surrenders.","Officials from 50 firms, finance ministry meet in Sambhal to plug gaps leading to frauds.

Real estate and other business holdings: It’s least $1.3 billion

Prior to his involvement in cryptocurrency, a substantial portion of Trump's wealth originated from his real estate portfolio, encompassing hotels, residential developments, golf facilities and office buildings. Although this sector has experienced fluctuations, it continues to be a significant component of his financial portfolio.

Ascertaining the precise worth of his property holdings presents challenges, as his financial declarations provide only estimated values. His latest disclosure lists 19 real estate assets, each valued above $50 million, without specifying upper limits. The total declared value of his properties and business interests amounts to a minimum of $1.3 billion, excluding Trump Media and World Liberty.

Legal proceedings initiated by the New York attorney general alleged that Trump overstated his property values to obtain advantageous bank loans, culminating in a civil trial that imposed a judgment of nearly half a billion dollars against him.

These properties generate income, though without disclosure of operational costs and property investments, determining profitability remains impossible. In 2024, his Florida properties led in revenue generation: Trump National Doral golf club near Miami ($110 million) and Mar-a-Lago private club and estate ($50 million).

What is US President Donald Trump ’s net worth? Trump has often called himself a billionaire - but the actual net worth is not easy to assess. The exact value of Trump's assets remains unclear, primarily because his family enterprise operates as a private company with limited financial transparency.Recent data indicates Donald Trump's net worth has seen significant growth during the initial period of his second term, primarily due to his cryptocurrency investments, potentially reaching $10 billion or more. However, the majority of this wealth exists in non-liquid forms, requiring the sale of investments and business interests to convert into readily available funds, says a New York Times report.Donald Trump’s wealth portfolio includes real estate holdings, which present valuation challenges. Additionally, the shared ownership of various assets with family members and business associates complicates the assessment of his personal share.Also Read | From ‘dead’ to ‘hottest in world’: Donald Trump calls ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ the path to US making a ‘fortune’; says America growing out of ‘Biden mess’ Certain aspects of his financial portfolio, particularly his investments in stocks and cryptocurrency, are publicly accessible. The mandatory annual financial disclosure he submits as president provides insight into the less transparent aspects of his business operations.This document also reveals his outstanding financial obligations, including recent legal settlements.The complete picture of the president's net worth comprises both verifiable and unverifiable elements, making a definitive assessment challenging. Here’s a deep dive, based on the NYT report:It’s a minimum of $2.2 billion distributed across stocks, bonds and cash instruments. The social media venture, Truth Social, operated through, represents President Trump's second most valuable asset, following his cryptocurrency holdings. His ownership of 115 million company shares amounts to approximately $2 billion at current market valuations.However, this valuation remains unrealised until share liquidation happens. The company's share price has experienced a significant decline since his assumption of office. Previously, his shareholding reached a peak value of approximately $6 billion.The president maintains a substantial financial investment portfolio valued at a minimum of $236 million, as per his latest financial disclosure for 2024. The actual magnitude of his portfolio remains uncertain due to the broad value ranges used in financial disclosure reports.A notable disclosure entry showed that he maintained over $50 million in a money-market fund without specifying an upper limit, making it unfeasible to calculate the complete value of his holdings.NYT conducted an analysis of his previous year's financial disclosure to establish the distribution of his investments across bonds, cash and stocks.Also Read | ‘End of New York City as we know it…’: Why Zohran Mamdani’s possible win in mayoral race has Wall Street fretting; sense of doom prevails Based on the minimum values reported for each asset, bonds constituted approximately 60 per cent of the portfolio, whilst cash and similar investments comprised roughly 30 per cent, and stocks represented under 10 per cent. Within the bond category, municipal bonds formed nearly 80 per cent of the holdings, according to the minimum reported values.The president's investment portfolio, consisting of stocks, bonds and cash, generated a minimum of $13 million in dividends and interest during the previous year.Digital currencies represent a recent venture for the Trump family. However, within a brief period, Trump has built an extensive portfolio of cryptocurrency investments spanning across various sectors of the industry, the report says,A substantial portion of Mr. Trump's assets emerged recently through ""$TRUMP"", a digital currency he launched shortly before taking office in January. (A memecoin refers to a digital currency associated with internet culture or mascots, primarily used for speculative purposes.) The majority of the created $TRUMP coins remain under the ownership of Mr. Trump and his associates.Based on the current value of approximately $8.67, as of noon E.T. on July 1, these holdings were valued at roughly $6.9 billion. However, this valuation lacks liquidity: Trump's coins face trading restrictions, and substantial sales would significantly decrease the price. The precise distribution of ownership between Trump and his partners remains unclear.Additionally, Trump receives transaction fees whenever the memecoin changes hands. According to Chainalysis, a crypto analytics firm, these fees have generated at least $320 million, which is distributed between the Trump family and their business associates.The president's venture into cryptocurrency has proven highly profitable, extending beyond his memecoin success.

The Trump family likely received over $300 million, although the president's exact earnings await disclosure in his next annual financial statement.The president maintains possession of more than 15 billion World Liberty tokens, as per his latest disclosure. These non-tradeable tokens presently serve solely for voting rights on certain World Liberty Financial business matters, making their value assessment challenging.According to crypto analytics firm Nansen's data, initial token sales occurred at 1.5 pence each, aligning with World Liberty's investor communications from last year. This valuation suggests the president's holdings approximate $236 million.World Liberty may eventually permit token trading, potentially increasing their value significantly. The company has indicated progress towards making tokens ""transferable"", though specific details remain unclear.

Jean Carroll. In one case, a Manhattan jury directed Trump to pay Ms. Carroll $83.3 million for defamatory statements following her sexual assault allegation.Previously, a different jury awarded Ms. Carroll $5 million after determining that Mr. Trump had sexually abused her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s and made defamatory remarks on Truth Social.Following these legal setbacks, Trump secured appellate bonds worth hundreds of millions, allowing him to delay payments whilst appealing. This arrangement required him to pledge substantial assets to bond-issuing companies.

358 international students get SEVIS restored in a significant settlement with DHS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/358-international-students-get-sevis-resorted-in-a-significant-settlement-with-dhs/articleshow/122206337.cms,"AI photo





In a significant court-aided settlement reached with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) all 358 international students, many of whom are Indian, succeeded in having their SEVIS registration restored retroactively. TOI in its edition of May 3, 2025, had reported on the mass action lawsuit that had been filed by these students pseudonymously.The list of stipulations (requests) set down by these students were accepted by DHS and approved by the district court judge (Northern district of Georgia). The stipulation sought reinstatement of their SEVIS records to ‘active’ status, retroactive to the date of initial termination, effectively ensuring no gap in their immigration status. This retroactivity means ‘as though the termination did not happen’. F-2 dependents (such as spouse or dependent children) of the F-1 visa holder (aka, the international student) will also receive the same terms and conditions of the settlement.A key concern for the international students was the impact of the termination on their Optional Practical Training (OPT), the two-year extended OPT which is available to international students in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) field or the Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorizations.The settlement sought that any end dates for these training programs be reset to their original end dates contained in their SEVIS records prior to termination. Crucially, the settlement ensured that unemployed days accumulated by some plaintiffs due to the SEVIS termination would be removed from their records. This was a vital point – to illustrate: there is a limit of 90 days of unemployment during the one year OPT post completion of studies. If this period is exceeded the students F-1 visa status is in peril.Furthermore, the plaintiffs sought assurance that ICE would not re-terminate their SEVIS records based solely on the National Crime and Information Center (NCIC) record that led to the initial termination. As has been reported by TOI earlier, SEVIS records of several students were terminated based on innocuous charges such as traffic or parking violations.The settlement also addressed potential negative impacts on future immigration applications – the settlement ensured that the termination and revocation of SEVIS records will not, by itself, have any negative impact.A group of law firms: Bless Litigation, Joseph and Hall, Kuck Baxter and Siskind Susser under the umbrella IMMPACT Litigation were representing the students. Charles Kuck, immigration attorney told TOI, “This settlement gives us more than we believe we could have obtained from a federal court judge’s order and are grateful to restore our 358 plaintiffs to their proper F-1 status, without interruption. We look forward to moving against Department of State in a separate legation to restore the unlawfully revoked visas to the international students. ”"," 358 international students, many of whom are Indian, succeeded in having their SEVIS registration restored retroactively.

‘Tesla gave me a future’: Ex-employee on how the company transformed his life

Ex-Tesla employee quits due to Musk’s politics

An emotional exit after 7 years



Respect for the company, not the leadership

After seven years of working at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, former engineering technician Trae Cervantes has made the difficult decision to step away from the company, citing moral discomfort with CEO Elon Musk ’s recent actions. Cervantes, who began his career as a production associate in 2018, steadily advanced to an engineering technician role before formally resigning in March 2025. His departure was not spurred by workplace conditions or job dissatisfaction, but rather by a growing unease over Musk’s political involvement and public conduct.In an interview with Business Insider, Cervantes reflected on both the opportunities and challenges he experienced at Tesla. He joined the company during the high-demand ramp-up of the Model 3 production line and described his early days as physically taxing but professionally rewarding.“I started out on their production line for the Model 3 and I moved up from there,” Cervantes said. “When I started out, it was gruelling work. It was pushing heavy things up and down aisles. I was on my feet for 12 hours a day, but they also give you three to four days off a week to recover.”Tesla supported Cervantes' growth over the years, offering him access to professional development programs, including certifications in advanced manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma through local college partnerships.Cervantes credits Tesla with helping him build a career despite having no formal education or technical training before joining the company.“I was getting paid the most I'd ever gotten in my adult life,” he said. “No education, no real skills to speak of, and Tesla offered me opportunities to take charge of my life and grow my career.”He highlighted how the work culture at Tesla—particularly among peers and supervisors—was largely positive and focused on efficiency, learning, and advancement.“I stayed because they kept treating me well. I didn’t have a reason to leave for a long time,” Cervantes noted.However, Cervantes' sentiment toward the company began to shift as Musk became more active politically and made several high-profile public moves, including acquiring Twitter and engaging in voter-related controversies.“What I took issue with the most was the giveaway for prospective voters,” he said, referring to a public campaign Musk promoted. “It seemed so morally wrong. I didn't want to be associated with that.”The turning point for Cervantes came when Musk's public image, behaviour, and political commentary became more prominent in association with Tesla’s identity.“Last year, I started to be ashamed to tell people where I work,” he admitted.While Cervantes did not go into detail about every incident that caused concern, he made it clear that the cumulative effect of Musk’s public actions led him to feel ethically conflicted about remaining with the company.Cervantes decided to leave Tesla without securing another job. He described his final conversation with his supervisor as emotional and honest.“I have to leave. I can't do this anymore. It's getting to a point where I feel like I'm compromising myself morally by walking through those doors every day,” he recalled telling his manager.The decision was not taken lightly. “I’m not going to lie, I cried a little. Seven years is a long time, and Tesla wasn’t always a bad thing for me,” Cervantes shared.While Cervantes walked away from his position at Tesla, he was careful to clarify that his issue was not with the company’s workforce or its mission, but with its leadership.“There are plenty of good people at Tesla. I didn’t leave the place because of the company. I left because of the face of the company,” he stated, referring directly to Elon Musk.","Trae Cervantes worked as an engineering technician at Tesla's Gigafactory in Nevada for seven years.

What is the Einstein visa? How Melania Trump qualified for a visa reserved for Nobel-level talent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-einstein-visa-how-melania-trump-qualified-for-a-visa-reserved-for-nobel-level-talent/articleshow/122204926.cms,"

What is the EB-1 or 'Einstein' visa?

How did Melania Trump qualify for the Einstein visa?

The larger debate: Loopholes, privilege, and policy





When Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the “Einstein visa,” in 2001, it raised eyebrows and continues to stir debate. Reserved for individuals with “extraordinary ability” in fields such as science, arts, education, business, or athletics, the EB-1 green card is typically associated with Nobel laureates, Olympic medalists, or globally recognized experts. Melania, a Slovenian model at the time, was not widely known for groundbreaking accomplishments, prompting questions about how she met the high bar required. So, what exactly is the Einstein visa, and how did the former First Lady qualify for a program meant for the world’s best and brightest?The EB-1 visa is a US employment-based green card designed for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in specific fields, or who are recognized as outstanding professors, researchers, or multinational executives. Applicants must prove “sustained national or international acclaim” and either win a major international award (like a Nobel Prize) or meet at least three of ten criteria set by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). These include published work, media recognition, contributions to a field of major significance, or commanding a high salary compared to others in the same field.While the standards are rigorous, the process is subjective.Immigration officers ultimately decide if the evidence supports a claim of extraordinary ability. This subjectivity has sparked debate over how consistently the criteria are applied and who benefits most from its loopholes.Melania Trump, then known as Melania Knauss, was living in New York as a model when she applied for the EB-1 visa in 2000. It was approved the following year. Though she was featured in magazines and had some runway experience, she had not received prestigious modeling awards or reached the supermodel status typically associated with international acclaim. Critics argue her qualifications were modest compared to the visa's intent.Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett recently reignited the controversy, questioning whether Melania’s case truly exemplifies merit-based immigration. Her approval has drawn comparisons to other questionable EB-1 recipients, including Playboy models and niche artists who managed to craft narratives aligning with the visa’s requirements.Experts note that while the visa is often seen as exclusive, it can be awarded to applicants whose accomplishments, though not widely known, are well-documented and strategically framed within a narrow field. In Melania’s case, her successful petition may have emphasized uniqueness in her modeling niche, media presence, or professional trajectory.The EB-1 program, limited to around 40,000 visas annually, has been praised for attracting top global talent. But its subjective evaluation process has also made it vulnerable to exploitation. Legal experts and immigration attorneys admit that certain applicants with the right legal guidance can tailor their portfolios to meet the criteria, even without widely celebrated achievements.Adding to the irony, Melania later used her citizenship to sponsor her parents for green cards through “chain migration,” a policy her husband, Donald Trump, has publicly opposed. This contradiction has further politicized her immigration journey and raised broader questions about fairness, privilege, and transparency in the US immigration system.","Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the ‘Einstein visa,’ in 2001.

Poll Do you believe that financial support should be guaranteed in a marriage? Yes, it's essential. No, it depends on circumstances. Only if children are involved. I have no opinion.

NEW DELHI: Mohammed Shami ’s estranged wife Hasin Jahan has once again levelled serious allegations against the Indian cricketer, claiming he has refused to provide basic financial support for her and their daughter, and has tried to ruin her life. Jahan, who married Shami in 2014, shared her personal ordeal, stating she was forced to give up her career after marriage and is now left without any source of income.“I used to model and act before I got married. Shami forced me to quit my profession. He wanted me to live only a housewife's life. I loved Shami so much that I happily accepted it,” Jahan said.The couple’s bitter legal battle has been ongoing for years and frequently played out in public. According to Jahan, her current financial dependence on Shami compelled her to seek legal recourse.Also See: Ind vs Eng “Now I have no earnings of my own. Shami has to bear all the responsibility for our maintenance. That is why we had to approach the court when he denied this. Thank God there is a law in our country which orders people to bear their responsibilities,” she said.She further questioned Shami’s character, accusing him of endangering the future of their daughter.“If you are entering a relationship with someone, it is not written on their face that they have a poor character, are a criminal, or will play with your and your daughter's future. I too became a victim like this,” she added.“God has forgiven the biggest criminals. He cannot see the protection, future, and happiness of his daughter. He should also give up his stubbornness of wanting to ruin Hasin Jahan's life. He cannot destroy me because I am on the path of justice while he is on the path of injustice.”On Tuesday, the Calcutta High Court directed Shami to pay Rs 4 lakh per month—Rs 1.5 lakh to Jahan and Rs 2.5 lakh to their daughter—as interim maintenance. The court observed this sum was “just, fair and reasonable” to ensure their financial stability during the ongoing legal proceedings.Jahan had earlier moved the High Court against a 2023 sessions court order that had directed Shami to pay Rs 50,000 to her and Rs 80,000 to their daughter. The High Court revised the amount, noting that Shami’s income and financial disclosures indicate he is capable of paying more.“In view of materials placed before me... the quantum of interim monetary relief as fixed by the Court below requires revision,” the court order by Justice Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee stated.“The petitioner’s wife, who has remained unmarried and is living independently with the child, is entitled to a levelled maintenance that she enjoyed during her continuance of marriage and which reasonably secures her future as well as the future of the child,” it further said.Jahan had earlier filed an FIR in 2018 against Shami and his family under multiple charges, including domestic violence, dowry harassment, and allegations of match-fixing, which she later reiterated in court filings. She had initially sought Rs 7 lakh per month for herself and Rs 3 lakh for their daughter as interim monetary relief.",Hasin Jahan accuses Mohammed Shami of trying to ruin her life.

Meeting 'not cordial'

'Concerns fully raised'

NEW DELHI: A delegation of 11 opposition parties met the Election Commission on Wednesday and objected the ongoing intensive revision of the electoral rolls in Bihar just months ahead of the upcoming assembly elections.The delegation dubbed the exercise as ""Votebandi"" and claimed that this will put democracy in the state ""under threat""Briefing the media after the meeting with the poll body, senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the timing of the revision raised serious concerns.“This exercise involves verifying over 7.75 crore voters in Bihar. With barely 2–3 months left for the assembly polls, such a massive exercise is neither practical nor fair,” he said, calling it a violation of the level playing field essential for free and fair elections.Singhvi, accompanied by RJD MP Manoj Jha, CPM’s Dipankar Bhattacharya, Bihar Congress chief Rajesh Kumar, and others, said the delegation also expressed strong disapproval of the EC's new rule restricting the number of party representatives in such meetings. He said senior leaders like Jairam Ramesh and Pawan Khera were denied entry and made to wait outside.“This kind of limitation on who can meet the Commission — capping it at two people including the party president — is unprecedented and arbitrary,” Singhvi said.Calling the exercise as 'Votebandi,' Bhattacharya claimed that the Commission admitted that 20% of Bihar's voters reside outside the state, which effectively means they could lose their right to vote.This is nothing less than 'votebandi' for Bihar,"" he said, comparing the exercise to the demonetisation, or 'notebandi', carried out in 2016.""There seems to be a failure on our part to convince the Election Commission that one month is not enough for lakhs of voters to submit identification documents. Democracy in Bihar is under threat. A major people's movement is now necessary,"" he added.RJD leader Jha said that the meeting with the poll body was ""not cordial.""""We expressed our concern about the poor, backward classes in Bihar. We saw a lack of concern from the Election Commission,"" he said.""Is this an effort to disenfranchise people? The 20 per cent Biharis who migrate outside the state are the target. If the purpose of an exercise becomes exclusion instead of inclusion, what should we do? Are you trying to find doubtful voters in Bihar?"" he added.Sources, however told PTI that some of the participants were given an appointment and others were allowed to join in without any prior appointment, as the Commission decided to meet two representatives from every party.They also said each concern raised by the parties was ""fully addressed"" by the Commission.The poll body has taken up the mantle of weeding out foreign illegal migrants from the voting list of six states - starting from Bihar.According to the poll body, it is part of its crackdown on illegal immigrants from countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar.The poll panel reminded the constitutional provision that says only Indian citizens can vote. ""The Constitution of India is supreme. All citizens, political parties, and the Election Commission of India follow the Constitution,"" EC said in a statement.The EC said the special revision has already started successfully in Bihar for verifying the eligibility of each elector with ""full participation"" of all political parties.The poll panel already has nearly 78,000 booth-level officers (BLOs) and is appointing over 20,000 more for new polling stations, it said.More than one lakh volunteers will be assisting genuine electors, particularly the old, sick, persons with disabilities, poor, and other vulnerable groups during the special intensive revision.Out of the existing 7,89,69,844 electors, 4.96 crore electors, whose names are already in the last intensive revision of the Electoral Roll on January 1, 2003, have to ""simply verify so, fill the Enumeration Form and submit it"".","11 opposition parties met the Election Commission on Wednesday and objected the ongoing intensive revision of the electoral rolls in Bihar.

Bengaluru: The caste census drive by BBMP has left residents fuming, as QR-coded stickers marking Scheduled Caste (SC) households have been slapped indiscriminately on everything from bikes to tea stalls — often without any actual enumeration.Launched on June 23, 2025, the survey aims to collect data on 101 SC communities across all eight BBMP zones. However, instead of meticulous data collection, the civic body's sticker campaign has drawn ridicule and criticism, especially on social media, for its shoddy implementation.According to the authorities, BBMP surveyors are supposed to visit homes, verify details, collect self-declaration forms, and place stickers at the entrance to signal participation. In practice though, many residents claim they weren't even consulted. Many woke up to stickers on their doors — and in some cases, on their parked vehicles — with no explanation or prior interaction.BBMP's special commissioner (welfare), Suralkar Vikas Kishore, admitted to the gaps in execution.""Enumerators have sometimes done a poor job. We will take stringent action. A sticker doesn't mean the survey is done,"" he told TOI.He also noted that areas unlikely to have SC households are being skipped altogether.""Pls let me know the caste of HONDA ACTIVA!"" a user posted on X, highlighting the absurdity of stickers appearing on scooters.Nagarbhavi resident Prabudh Shetty said he confronted officials who claimed the survey had been completed a month earlier. ""That's false — we were always home, especially my elderly parents,"" he said.In Kasturinagar, Nirvigna KS said a sticker was slapped on her door with industrial glue, leaving stains. ""Nobody asked us anything or explained what was going on. It's damaging my property.""Despite the criticism, BBMP maintains the drive is progressing well. Officials claim they've identified more than 6.7 lakh SC individuals after covering more than 1.8 lakh SC households and 32 lakh general households. Citizens who missed the door-to-door round can scan the QR codes on the stickers to complete the survey online, or visit ward offices and Bengaluru One Centres.However, confusion persists.Smitha Ranganath, another Bengalurean, wrote that a sticker suddenly surfaced on her back gate, without any household member being surveyed.BBMP says it is now covering 1.8 lakh households a day and will intensify verification efforts in the coming weeks. However, for many citizens, the sticker campaign has already left a bitter aftertaste.What to do if a sticker appears on your door?■ No interaction? Call the helpline at **9481359000** (also printed on the sticker) to request a proper survey■ SC households left out? Scan the QR code on the sticker to fill out the self-declaration form online■ For direct access: Visit portal: https://schedulecastesurvey.karnataka.gov.in/selfdeclaration"," BBMP's caste census drive has left residents fuming. QR-coded stickers marking Scheduled Caste (SC) households have been slapped indiscriminately. BBMP surveyors are supposed to visit homes, verify details, collect self-declaration forms, and place stickers at the entrance to signal participation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122211701,imgsize-62732,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/122211701.jpg"

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.More countries are adopting digital verification systems, and e-passports are expected to further streamline international travel. Travelers will benefit from smoother immigration checks and faster processing through automated e-gates at major airports. With the government's phased rollout underway, carrying a smarter and more secure passport is set to become the new norm for Indian citizens.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S.

OpenAI: “Someone has broken into our home”

Nothing Headphone (1) Unboxing and First Look

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly offering massive pay packages— up to $300 million over four years—to top AI talent for the company’s new ‘Superintelligence’ lab. Quoting unnamed sources, Wired reports that Meta has made at least 10 high-value offers to staffers at OpenAI. The offers include compensation along with company stock - a big part of it is given right away in the first year—bringing the total pay to over $100 million. Beyond these benefits, Zuckerberg is reportedly telling potential hires they won’t have to worry about access to computing resources—especially high-demand GPUs, which can make or break research success.According to the report, many OpenAI employees said they are weighing the huge payouts against how much impact they could make at Meta compared to their current roles. “That’s about how much it would take for me to go work at Meta,” said one OpenAI employee who spoke to WIRED anonymously.Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told the publication “Some people have chosen to greatly exaggerate what’s happening for their own purposes.”“These statements are untrue — the size and structure of these compensation packages have been misrepresented all over the place.”Still, the numbers speak volumes. A senior engineer currently working at Meta told WIRED they earn about $850,000 per year—already high by industry standards, but nowhere close to what Meta is reportedly offering to a select few. Engineers in the tier above (E7s) reportedly make around $1.54 million annually, based on public data from Levels.FYI.Meta’s Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth acknowledged during a Q&A with employees that some roles do command premium pay—but pushed back on the $100 million figure.“Look, you guys, the market's hot. It's not that hot. Okay? So it's just a lie,” Bosworth said.“We have a small number of leadership roles that we're hiring for, and those people do command a premium,” he added.“It’s not a sign-on bonus, but all these different things,” he added, referring to how the offers are structured.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg officially introduced Meta’s new Superintelligence Labs on Monday in a note to staff. Former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang is now Meta’s Chief AI Officer, joined by Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO. The two will co-lead the team.Notably, neither Wang nor Friedman are researchers in the traditional academic sense. Meta has not named a chief scientist or research head yet. According to sources, none of the OpenAI hires so far have received the full $300 million package.The hiring spree has rattled leadership at OpenAI. Mark Chen, the company’s Chief Research Officer, reportedly told staff: “It feels as if someone has broken into our home and stolen something.”Chen acknowledged that OpenAI is adjusting compensation to remain competitive but emphasized that it would not sacrifice fairness.",Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly offering massive pay packages to top AI talent for the company’s new ‘Superintelligence’ lab.

(AI image)

Gold and silver price prediction today:

Both gold and silver prices are showing strength, with gold heading towards Rs 99,000, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group. Silver is also exhibiting a bullish trend. What should gold and silver investors do and what’s the outlook for gold and silver rates in the near future? Abhilash Koikkara shares his views:

STOPLOSS: Rs 1,05,500

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

MCX Gold prices have shown strong momentum, rallying from the support zone of ₹96,000 and now inching closer to the ₹99,000 mark. This uptrend is supported by positive global cues and a bullish sentiment surrounding safe-haven assets. Geopolitical tensions, inflation concerns, and central bank policies have continued to push investors towards gold, boosting demandTechnically, gold has broken above short-term resistance levels and is now forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart — indicating sustained bullish momentum. The strength in the dollar index and fluctuations in U.S. treasury yields remain key global drivers, but domestic developments like tariff structures and festive demand could amplify the upside move.Traders are advised to maintain a buy-on-dips approach as long as gold sustains above ₹96,500 on a closing basis. Immediate resistance is seen near ₹99,000, and a breakout above that could open the gates for ₹1,00,500 in the near term. Overall, the outlook remains positive with a bullish bias for the week, backed by both technical and fundamental factors.MCX Silver continues to trade in a bullish structure, forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart — a clear sign of sustained upward momentum.The metal is expected to move towards ₹1,10,000 in the near term, as long as the key support at ₹1,05,500 remains intact. Technically, any pullback towards ₹1,06,000–₹1,05,500 could offer fresh buying opportunities with a favorable risk-reward setup.From a fundamental perspective, silver is gaining strength from both industrial demand and safe-haven appeal. With the global push towards green energy and electric vehicles, demand for silver — a key component in solar panels and battery technologies — is rising steadily. Additionally, the recent dovish stance by major central banks and expectations of potential rate cuts in the coming quarters have weakened the dollar and supported precious metals across the board.Overall, the outlook for MCX Silver remains positive. As long as the ₹1,05,500 support zone holds, the path of least resistance remains upward, with ₹1,10,000 being the next key target in the short term.","Both gold and silver prices are showing strength, with gold heading towards Rs 99,000, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

BARCELONA: Barcelona adopted plans on Wednesday to tighten safety rules to protect sanitation workers from heatwaves after a woman died in the searing temperatures that have hit Spain and much of Europe.The woman, who was employed by a company providing cleaning services to the Mediterranean coastal city, died Saturday after working her shift in mid-heatwave.The city's four sanitation providers will now be required to activate heat protection protocols when temperatures reach the ""yellow alert"" level, 34° Celsius (93.2° Fahrenheit), instead of the previous requirement, which kicked in at ""orange alert"", or 37°C.""Every year, we're seeing a new face of climate change and the effects of increasing temperatures on our city. That means we need to update our protocols every year,"" said first deputy mayor Laia Bonet after meeting with sanitation companies.The measures provide for five-minute water breaks every hour on the hottest routes, an insulated water bottle for every worker, and routes optimized to keep workers in the shade as much as possible during the sunniest periods.Under ""red alerts"", from 40C, employees will only work with vehicles during the hottest hours.The cause of the worker's death is still being investigated.Spain has been hit by a major early-summer heatwave since the weekend, with temperatures of more than 40C in many places.It was the country's hottest June on record, according to the national weather service.","Barcelona to tighten safety rules to protect sanitation workers from heatwaves.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.
