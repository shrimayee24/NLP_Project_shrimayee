NEW DELHI: An Air India aircraft en route from Chicago to Delhi had to return to Chicago after flying for more than ten hours on Thursday due to technical issues.However, according to PTI sources, the flight had to return because numerous toilets were non-functional.According to flightradar24.com, the Boeing 777-337 ER aircraft returned to Chicago's ORD airport after being airborne for over ten hours.The Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft, which accommodates more than 340 passengers across first, business and economy classes, is equipped with 10 toilets, including two designated for first-class travellers, according to PTI sources.The source further revealed that only one toilet remained operational.""Upon landing at Chicago, all passengers and crew disembarked normally and have been provided with accommodation to minimise inconvenience.

A FasTag for scholarships? Jhunjhunu pilot shows way in easing student pain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-fastag-for-scholarships-jhunjhunu-pilot-shows-way-in-easing-student-pain/articleshow/118827398.cms,"GRANT A WISH: (From left) Piramal Foundation’s Shraddha Mishra with MNREGA worker Suman, her daughter Ronak and batchmate Kajal (in school uniform)

How it works

That cold morning on December 6, there was a quiet buzz at Hameeri Kalan Senior Secondary School in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan. For the students, teachers, and parents gathered there, it wasn’t an ordinary day. It felt like a festival — a scholarship festival.Class 9 student Kajal, clutching her notebook, ran toward her mother, who had taken the morning off from her job as a daily wage worker. “Maa, mobile de na,” she asked, eager and out of breath. “Kai karegi?” her mother said, handing over the phone. Kajal tapped the screen, and suddenly, her face lit up. “Ho gaya! Paisa aa gaya!” she yelled. Other students looked up and quickly ran to their parents, grabbing phones, dialing numbers, and checking messages. “Mujhe bhi SMS aaya!” (Even I got a money transfer SMS), one of them shouted. Yet another student said Rs 3,600 had been credited to their account. For the teachers, and staff of nonprofit Piramal Foundation who stood watching, it was a proud moment. “It felt like a lottery. Very often, students don’t receive their scholarships even after passing out from school,” says Hameeri Kalan school vice-principal Rajkamal Kataria.In a scholarship system riddled with delays and mistrust, Digi Vritti , a small digital pilot in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan is using real-time technology to help students get their scholarships within days, not months. Just as a FASTag gets rid of toll queues and Digi Yatra speeds up airport boarding.For Piramal Group chairman Ajay Piramal, the Digi Vritti pilot is not just about fixing delays and inefficiencies. It’s about reimagining how India delivers opportunities to its most deserving students. “The existing scholarship system faces numerous challenges. From manual verification and delays in disbursement to trust deficits among beneficiaries, deserving students are often left without timely support,” he says. Digi Vritti aims to reduce benefit delivery times from 40 weeks to under a week, using digital wallets and verifiable credentials to simplify processes and ensure transparency.Sher Singh Rajput and Shraddha Mishra of the Piramal Foundation say two schools were chosen for the pilot, Hameeri Kalan and Bajawa Suron Ka, as both had high numbers of SC/ST and marginalised students, with less than 20% of those eligible receiving scholarships over the years. The platform — powered by the Open Network for Employment and Skilling Transformation (ONEST), part of the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) framework — connects students needing scholarships with bhamashahs (donors). “It’s like Flipkart,” Rajput explains. “Buyers are matched with sellers — it’s as simple as that.” This system could scale up to include govt scholarships in the future.Every year, India sets aside over Rs 50,000 crore for scholarships and benefits to support marginalised communities — nearly a quarter of the population. Yet, much of this money goes unspent. A study by the Piramal Foundation highlights how endless paperwork and fragmented systems discourage students from even applying.Most students in India must navigate multiple portals, often without reliable internet access to apply for scholarships. Aadhaar cards or caste certificates are frequently mismatched, forcing families to make repeated trips to govt offices. Besides, for every application, one must dish out between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. “It’s disheartening to get them to fill the forms as we never know when and whether at all the kids will receive the scholarship amount. Most of them have stopped applying altogether,” says Kisturi, a teacher at the school who manages the process.For MNREGA labourer Suman, every minute lost chasing paperwork for daughter Ronak’s scholarship means lost wages. “I’ve been waiting for her scholarship since she was in Class 6. She’s in Class 9 now. Last time, I spent almost Rs 1,000 on photocopies, bank visits, running from one office to another. That’s what I earn in 10 days of hard work,” Suman says.Digi Vritti eliminates these pain points by making the process easy (see box). It also makes scholarships easier to understand, ensuring even small grants like exam fees or skilling courses reach the right students quickly. Verification of all documents happens directly at the school, cutting through the usual layers of bureaucracy. District block education officer Manish Kumar Chahar says the best part is that students won’t have to apply repeatedly. “They’ll simply get notifications about scholarships that match their eligibility and profiles,” he says. Piramal sees this project as a model for broader reforms. “Philanthropy and technology are increasingly converging to address deep systemic challenges,” he explains. “Digi Vritti exemplifies this synergy.”","Digi Vritti aims to reduce benefit delivery times from 40 weeks to under a week.

NMC is in a shambles, such a casual approach is shocking: Activist

Despite the National Medical Commission (NMC) deciding in September last year that not only doctors, but patients too can appeal to the Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) against decisions of state medical councils , on February 21 the EMRB rejected the appeal of a patient from Punjab.Incidentally, the EMRB is totally vacant since the tenure of all members came to an end last year, raising the question of who rejected the appeal.From Sept 2020, when the NMC was constituted, hundreds of patient appeals were rejected saying that NMC Act allowed only doctors to appeal. This is despite the patients’ right to appeal being upheld by a Supreme Court order in 2002.However, the minutes of the 16th meeting of NMC held on Sept 29 last year, obtained through RTI in Jan stated: “NMC had agreed that all appeals received by EMRB will be entertained.” The minutes were approved by Dec.Further, as regards action not being taken by state medical councils on complaints filed by non-medicos even after issuance of reminders by the boards. It was decided to send a communication by EMRB to state medical councils to complete the process in a time bound manner. In case of failure by the concerned SMC to act upon, EMRB may take over the complaint matter from SMC and dispose the same. This is noted by EMRB, and board will proceed further accordingly.”Gokul Chand Aneja from Punjab’s Amritsar filed an appeal dated Jan 30 against the decision of Punjab Medical Council, in a case of alleged medical negligence which led to his wife’s death. He received a letter from NMC dated Feb 21 rejecting his appeal stating that EMRB had decided in Oct 2021, that in keeping with NMC Act 2019 , “only medical practitioners or professionals should be allowed as (sic) appeals before EMRB”.In March 2022, NMC had rejected the appeal of a patient from Haryana’s Faridabad. The letter from EMRB rejecting the appeal of Aneja appears to be a copy-paste of the letter issued in March 2022 with just a change in dates, name of recipient etc.“NMC appears to be in shambles. Who took the decision to reject an appeal when EMRB is vacant? It looks like Aneja’s appeal was rejected by some functionary in the EMRB division who just copied an earlier letter. Such a casual approach is shocking,” said Dr KV Babu, ophthalmologist and RTI activist who has been fighting since 2022 to get the right of patients to appeal restored.","National Medical Commission (NMC) decided in September last year that not only doctors, but patients too can appeal to the Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) On February 21 the EMRB rejected the appeal of a patient from Punjab.Incidentally, the E MRB is totally vacant since the tenure of all members came to an end last year.

Going off-patent

10.1cr Indians live with diabetes, most end up paying out of pocket

NEW DELHI: Several domestic drug companies are set to transform diabetes therapy by launching the blockbuster drug Empagliflozin at a fraction of the innovator’s price.Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin on March 11, industry sources told TOI.The launch of generic Empagliflozin , used to treat diabetes, related comorbidities, including heart failure, promises to slash therapy costs, making it more accessible to millions of diabetics and easing the financial strain of this debilitating disease. Those looking to launch the drug include Mankind Pharma , Torrent, Alkem, Dr Reddy’s and Lupin.Mankind Pharma, India’s fourth-largest firm by market share, plans to offer Empagliflozin at one-tenth the innovator’s Rs 60 per tablet, sources said.Most generic versions will cost Rs 9-14 per tablet, disrupting the high-growth diabetes therapy market valued at nearly Rs 20,000 crore, up 43% from Rs 14,000 crore in 2021.The market was further bolstered by Torrent Pharmaceuticals’ acquisition of three Empagliflozin brands from Boehringer Ingelheim last year. With India facing a staggering public health burden—10.1 crore people live with diabetes, according to International Diabetes Federation— this shift is critical.“This aligns with our philosophy of breaking cost barriers with a high-quality product (raw materials certified by regulators like the USFDA) at an affordable price. Using our own active pharmaceutical ingredient in bulk lowers costs, and we will deploy separate teams to promote two distinct brands, boosting distribution and market share,” said a Mankind Pharma executive.The market size of Empagliflozin and its combinations is estimated at Rs 640 crore. Experts highlight its ability to significantly reduce heart failure hospitalisations, slow chronic kidney disease progression and improve survival in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, though high pricing has long limited access.Metformin remains the first-line treatment for type-2 diabetes, but as the disease progresses, additional medications—such as Sulfonylureas (glimepiride, glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide), DPP-4 Inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin), and SGLT2 Inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin)—are added. Now, newer therapies like semaglutide and tirzepatide enhance management, offering improved glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits.The economic burden of diabetes weighs heavily in India, where most patients pay out-of-pocket due to limited medical reimbursement. Treatment costs escalate with complications, magnifying the challenge.","Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin.

FM to table Manipur budget today, Shah to seek Prez rule nod

NEW DELHI: The budget session of Parliament resumes on Monday in the shadow of a spate of controversies along the ‘ opposition vs government ’ battleline, ranging from Trump’s comments on tariffs, duplicate voter identity card numbers, three-language policy and delimitation, amid indications that the non-budget issues may set off fireworks.Adding to the clutch of issues being debated in public are the renewed violence in Manipur and the Waqf amendment bill . The government is scheduled to bring a resolution to seek Parliament’s approval for proclamation of President’s rule in Manipur , and the opposition will use the discussion to raise the two years of continuing ethnic strife in the northeastern state. The state’s budget too will come up for discussion.The Centre last month placed Manipur under President’s rule after the resignation of beleaguered CM N Biren Singh. Also, the Centre is expected to bring the controversial Waqf bill for passage, which is being opposed by the entire opposition. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju has indicated that govt was in favour of early passage of the Waqf bill on which NDA allies have pledged support.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is to table the budget for Manipur on Monday, which has been under President’s rule since Feb 13. Home minister Amit Shah is expected to move a resolution seeking Parliament’s approval for proclamation of President’s rule in the state. The three-language policy and delimitation have become contentious in the south, with states banding together to question the Centre.Trump’s disparaging statements about India’s tariffs, and his recent announcement that India has agreed to lower tariffs, have elicited strong statements from Congress about the interests of India’s farmers and manufacturers. The party has demanded that the prime minister take Parliament into confidence on the discussions with the US about the proposed trade deal.At the same time, the opposition will corner government over the issue of duplicate EPIC numbers, which has become controversial after the claims by Trinamool Congress in West Bengal.",Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is to table the budget for Manipur on Monday.

Officials confirmed on Saturday that the agency is working closely with the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to dismantle these operations, PTI reported.The move comes after the recent arrest of Kannada actress Ranya Rao, who was caught carrying 14.2 kg of gold worth Rs 12.56 crore at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport . Two CBI teams have been dispatched to Mumbai and Bengaluru airports to collect further information.Ranya Rao, known for her roles in Kannada films like Maanikya and Pataki, was detained by the DRI upon her arrival from Dubai on March 3. Authorities allege that she was attempting to smuggle 17 gold bars, weighing 14.8 kg, into the country. She was produced before a special court for financial offences on March 4 and has been remanded in judicial custody until March 18. The court has permitted her to meet her lawyer for half an hour each day and has instructed officials to ensure she is provided with basic necessities.Following her arrest, an image of Ranya with swollen eyes and bruises circulated on social media, sparking speculation of possible assault during custody, as per news agency PTI. Karnataka State Commission for Women Chairperson Nagalakshmi Chaudhary addressed the concerns but stated that the commission could not investigate unless a formal complaint was filed. She condemned any potential mistreatment, adding that no one has the right to take the law into their own hands.The case has also brought renewed scrutiny to the misuse of airport protocol services. Reports suggest that certain privileges meant for high-ranking officials were exploited to facilitate gold smuggling. In response, the Karnataka government has decided to revise standard operating procedures, restricting protocol services strictly to officials themselves, rather than their family members or associates. Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Umashankar SR confirmed the decision, stating that security measures would no longer extend to relatives of senior bureaucrats.Meanwhile, sources indicate that a protocol staffer at Kempegowda International Airport was briefly detained by the DRI after Ranya’s arrest. However, he was later released after stating that he had been instructed to receive a senior officer’s daughter and was unaware of the smuggling attempt.In a voluntary statement to the DRI, Ranya admitted to possession of the gold, acknowledging that 17 gold bars were recovered from her. She described herself as an artist, wildlife photographer, and real estate freelancer in Dubai. Her case remains under investigation as authorities expand their probe into the smuggling network.","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case against gangs involved in smuggling gold into India through various airports.

How UP government reacted to the report?



NEW DELHI: The Central Pollution Control Board in its new report has said that water quality in the recently concluded Maha Kumbh was ""fit for bathing"". This comes after the board had termed water in Prayagraj at several locations during Kumbh unfit for bathing due to high faecal bacteria levels.In the new report dated February 28, the pollution control board said that a statistical analysis was required due to inconsistencies in the data, as water samples taken from the same locations on different dates—and from different spots on the same day—varied significantly. As a result, the findings did not accurately represent the overall water quality across the entire river stretch.""There is a significant variability in the values on various parameters, viz pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and fecal coliform count (FC) for the samples taken from the same location on different dates. The values of the afore-mentioned parameters also vary at different locations for the samples collected on the same day,"" the report said.The report clarified that an expert committee analyzed the issue of data variability and concluded that the findings represent only a snapshot of water quality at a specific location and time.It highlighted that water quality can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, including human activities upstream, flow rate, sampling depth, time of collection, river currents, mixing of currents, and the exact sampling location, among other influences.""As a result, these values reflect water quality parameters at the exact time and place from where these water samples were collected, and may not fully represent the overall characteristics of the river, therefore, not necessarily reflecting the overall river water quality throughout the river stretch,"" it said.The previous report, submitted on February 17, said that water quality at several locations in Prayagraj during Kumbh did not meet primary bathing standards due to high faecal coliform levels.""A large number of people bathe in the river at Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh Mela, including on auspicious bathing days, which eventually leads to an increase in faecal concentration,"" the report had said, adding ""The river water quality was not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to faecal coliform at all the monitored locations on various occasions.""The UP CM Yogi Adityanath had rejected the faecal bacteria in Sangam waters claim and had said that the Kumbh was fit for bathing. He had also called it an attempt to defame the religious gathering.""Questions are being raised about the quality of the water (at Triveni). All the pipes and the drains in and around Sangam have been taped and the water is being released only after purification. The UP Pollution Control Board is continuously monitoring the water to maintain its quality,"" he had said.""The reasons for increased faecal coliform can be several, such as sewage leakage and animal waste, but the amount of faecal coliform in Prayagraj is, as per the standards, less than 2,500 MPN per 100 ml. This means that the false campaign is only to defame the Maha Kumbh.

India hints at tariff liberalisation

Ongoing talks

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump have agreed to advance negotiations on the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), ANI reported on Saturday citing sources. The development comes on the same day when foreign secretary Vikram Misri hinted that New Delhi might be considering liberalising tariffs.This mutually beneficial agreement, finalised in February 2025, aims to boost market access, reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and enhance supply chain integration.To achieve the goals of the agreement, both leaders have decided to appoint senior representatives to accelerate negotiations, enhance trade relations and foster economic cooperation, the sources revealed.The BTA is expected to impact various sectors, including goods and services. By increasing market access and reducing barriers, the agreement will facilitate smoother trade flows and create new opportunities for businesses on both sides.A day after Trump claimed that India had agreed to bring down tariffs, foreign secretary Vikram Misri refused to comment on the US president's remark. He, however, added that India in recent years had signed several trade pacts with partners based on tariff liberalisation.""There’s a lot of interest in statements coming out of the United States. I will not get into that at this point of time because these are ongoing discussions… But I would only point you towards the fact that we have in recent times entered into bilateral trade agreements which are based on tariff liberalisation with several partners,"" he said.""There are ongoing discussions with several other partners on these issues now. I think the ongoing discussions should be seen in that context. That is our general approach and it applies to any such engagement we have,” he added.Sources indicate that India is optimistic about resolving the tariff issue with the US in the coming weeks, ideally before the April 2 deadline.This was reflected in the MEA's response on the same, which said, ""Our objective through the BTA is to strengthen and deepen India-US two-way trade across the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries.""India has already lowered its average applied tariffs for major developed nations, including Australia, UAE, Switzerland, and Norway, under recently concluded trade agreements.A delegation, led by commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal , had visited Washington from March 3 to 6, for discussions with the US counterpart on the trade agreement.

'Economic terrorism': Baba Ramdev on Donald Trump's tariff threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/economic-terrorism-baba-ramdev-on-donald-trumps-tariff-threat/articleshow/118818227.cms,"NEW DELHI: Yoga guru and Patanjali co-founder Baba Ramdev on Sunday lashed out US President Donald Trump over his decision to impose reciprocal tariffs, calling it an act of "" tariff terrorism "" and ""economic terrorism."" The yoga guru accused Trump of threatening poorer nations and attempting to dominate global trade through unfair policies.""There is a new era of intellectual colonisation. Ever since Donald Trump rose to power, he created a new world record of 'tariff terrorism'. He has ripped off democracy by threatening poor and developing nations,"" Ramdev said.""This is 'economic terrorism'... He is taking the world to a different era. In such a case, India needs to develop... All Indians should unite to build a strong nation and answer all these destructive powers.""His remarks come as India and the US engage in negotiations over a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), aimed at reducing trade barriers and strengthening economic ties. Trump had claimed that India had agreed to significantly cut tariffs on American products, saying, ""India charges us massive tariffs, you can't even sell anything in India, it's almost restrictive... By the way, they have agreed to cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done.""Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri refrained from commenting on Trump's statements, saying, ""I will not get into that at this point of time because these are ongoing discussions, so it would not be right to get into it.""Commerce minister Piyush Goyal recently visited the US for trade talks, meeting with his American counterparts to discuss the agreement. India has been gradually reducing tariffs for several nations, including Australia, the UAE, Switzerland, and Norway, under recent trade pacts. Similar negotiations are ongoing with the European Union and the UK.Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs from April 2 has raised concerns about a potential global trade war, with other countries already considering countermeasures. India, while maintaining a cautious approach, has expressed its willingness to deepen trade ties with the US. External affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""Our objective through the BTA is to strengthen and deepen India-US two-way trade across the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries.""India's recent decision to lower tariffs on certain products, including bourbon whiskey, wines, and electric vehicles, was viewed as a gesture to ease trade tensions. Meanwhile, Tesla is reportedly eyeing the Indian market, with senior Trump advisor, Elon Musk criticising the country’s high import duties, which reach up to 110%.Despite tensions, trade between India and the US remains strong, with overall bilateral trade reaching $190 billion in 2023. The US also remains a key foreign investor in India, contributing nearly $5 billion in direct investments last year.","Yoga guru and Patanjali co-founder Baba Ramdev lashed out US President Donald Trump over his decision to impose reciprocal tariffs.

NEW DELHI: Amid US president Donald Trump’s tariff war against Beijing, the call for duty protection against Chinese dumping is getting louder from domestic producers of polysilicon , ingot and wafers — making up the solar industry ’s upstream segment that provides the building blocks for solar cells and panels.At a meeting with renewable energy ministry officials on March 1, industry representatives pressed for safeguard duty (SGD) on Chinese supplies of these basic inputs, pointing out how such a levy and other incentives had helped India become self-sufficient in module and panel manufacturing.A presentation made by the Indian Solar Manufaturers Association underlined the urgency of steps to boost upstream manufacturing as Chinese dumping could undercut investments being made to expand capacity in line with the government’s solar ambitions. China customs data pegs wafer exports alone to India at $318 million in 2023, marking a surge of 91% over the previous year.Cells and modules from China, Taiwan and Malaysia currently attract 20% SGD, which was first imposed at 25% in July 2018. In July 2019, it was reduced to 20% and further to 15% from January 2020 to July 2020, only to be reinstated at 20% in July 2024.The upstream players also sought protection similar to ALMMS (approved list of models and manufacturers) scheme for cell and module manufacturers mandating locally produced panels in public projects but left polysilicon, ingot and wafer makers at the mercy of Chinese imports.The presentation called for reorientation of government focus towards the capital and energy intensive upstream manufacturing with Import duty exemption on capital goods and raw material for producing polysilicon, ingot and wafers.The wishlist for fiscal incentives included a fresh capital subsidy programme, priority lending and interest subvention and creation of dedicated funds. In addition, other accelerated depreciation on plant and machinery was also suggested.","The call for duty protection against Chinese dumping is getting louder from domestic producers of polysilicon, ingot and wafers.

VIZIANAGARAM : A TDP Lok Sabha member from Andhra Pradesh has pledged to dole out Rs 50,000 for every third child who turns out to be a baby girl in his constituency.Vizianagaram MP K Appala Naidu said he will deposit the money in favour of the newborn girl child in the form of a fixed deposit, which could compound up to Rs 10 lakh by the time she is of marriagable age. “If the third child is a boy, we will give a cow and a calf. Will make a fixed deposit of Rs 50,000 if the third child is a baby girl. The Indian population has to rise,” Appala Naidu said on Sunday.The parliamentarian said he was inspired by the calls given by CM N Chandrababu Naidu to raise the country’s population. During his visit to Delhi in March, Naidu had voiced concerns over the declining population in south India, saying its ageing population poses challenges, whereas states like UP and Bihar have a younger demography. Naidu announced on Saturday that maternity leave will be granted for all women employees irrespective of the number of children they have.Promising to extend this offer to every woman in his constituency, Appala Naidu recalled he was encouraged by several women in politics and life, including his mother, wife, sisters and daughter. Further, he said encouraging women is also the need of the hour as they go through discrimination. According to the MP, he announced this offer during Women's Day celebrations in his constituency.","Vizianagaram MP K Appala Naidu said he will deposit the money in favour of the newborn girl child in the form of a fixed deposit.

KOLLAM: CPM’s state conference on Sunday unanimously re-elected M V Govindan as the party’s secretary of the Kerala unit. Unlike a decade ago, there was no factional dissent in the conference, with all members in the official panels getting elected unopposed.Only those in the good books of CM Pinarayi Vijayan , the de-facto leader of both the govt and the party in Kerala, figured in the panels.Addressing a meeting at the end of the four-day state conference, Vijayan rejected as “far-fetched and unfounded” the criticism against the new pathways suggested by him towards a new Kerala. He said CPM decided to accept string-free private capital long ago. However, the party could pursue the same only now due to lack of a supporting mechanism to attract such large-scale investment in the past.Justifying the proposals he made in the document, Navakeralathinte Puthuvazhikal (New Pathways to a Renewed Kerala), which the state conference adopted without much resistance, Vijayan said the nearly nine years of continuous LDF governance significantly improved the facilities and environment, pivoting on which Kerala can achieve new heights in the coming days. The measures suggested in the document include public-private participation for revival of loss-making PSUs , cess, and differential fees for govt services.“BJP govt at Centre wants to block development activities in Kerala.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin Sunday decided to send senior DMK functionaries to meet chief ministers and senior politicians from seven states, including BJP-governed Odisha, to rally support for his campaign against Centre’s proposed delimitation exercise.At a meeting with DMK MPs, Stalin assigned responsibility for each of the seven states. Tamal Nadu IT minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan will engage with Kerala politicians, while DMK MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi will head a delegation to West Bengal. State PWD minister E V Velu has been tasked with meeting politicians of Andhra Pradesh while industries minister TRB Rajaa will head for Odisha.Similar delegations will be sent to AAP-governed Punjab and Congress-run Telangana and Karnataka.Stalin had last week written to the CMs and other key politicians of these seven states, explaining TN govt’s position against population-based delimitation. Calling it “an unfair exercise”, Stalin had said the Centre’s plan was a “blatant assault on federalism , punishing states that ensured population control and good governance by stripping away our rightful voice in Parliament”.With the Parliament session set to begin on Monday, Stalin has also instructed DMK MPs to raise in the two Houses key issues, including opposition to Hindi imposition, objections to the National Education Policy, and the demand for pending funds for Tamil Nadu.Three resolutions were passed at the DMK meeting at Anna Arivalayam: to safeguard Tamil Nadu’s parliamentary representation by raising the delimitation issue in Parliament, unite all the states that successfully implemented population control measures which were likely to be affected by the delimitation exercise and work with other MPs from the INDIA bloc and other democratic forces to uphold states’ rights in the delimitation process.","Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin has decided to send senior DMK functionaries to meet chief ministers and senior politicians from seven states.

Maha budget will seek to strike balance between fiscal prudence & welfare plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maha-budget-will-seek-to-strike-balance-between-fiscal-prudence-welfare-plans/articleshow/118825409.cms,"CM Devendra Fadnavis

MUMBAI: As the Mahayuti government faces its first budget after the assembly polls, it will have to walk the tightrope between controlling its massive debt and fiscal deficit while continuing its welfare schemes, with polls to local bodies including municipal corporations and gram panchayats due this year.Government could focus on keeping its welfare schemes going while scrutinising and trimming beneficiaries as it has done with its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana . It is already apparent that chances of hiking the Ladki Bahin stipend from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,100 per month as promised in the Mahayuti poll manifesto will be unlikely in this budget.With CM Devendra Fadnavis announcing a rise in outlay under Namo Shetkari Samman Nidhi for farmers from Rs 6,000 to Rs 9,000 per year, the budget may account for this. The state’s debt projection for 2024-25 was already Rs 7.8 lakh crore. Before the polls, it had introduced welfare schemes worth a steep Rs 96,000 crore, including the Ladki Bahin Yojana which helped drive its electoral victory.Since then, the state has introduced supplementary budgetary demands for additional expenses outside the budget worth Rs 1.37 lakh crore, the highest ever in Maharashtra.At Rs 1.1 lakh crore by July, the state’s fiscal deficit had spiralled upwards. By Oct 2024, the finance department had warned that the fiscal deficit was estimated at Rs 2 lakh crore and will be impossible to fill.Officials say the state will try and bring the fiscal deficit down to 3% of the GSDP, which is required by budgetary management norms. Fadnavis told TOI in the past that the state will not cut welfare or infrastructure spending but will focus on increasing revenue.However, the global slowdown will be a challenge to revenue generation. Fadnavis had said the state would focus on raising finances, including through borrowings, monetisation schemes and annuity schemes or build-operate-transfer schemes for infrastructure projects.","Government could focus on keeping its welfare schemes going while scrutinising and trimming beneficiaries.

LUCKNOW: Three revenue officials were among 12 people detained in UP’s Sitapur on Sunday for interrogation about the daylight murder of 36-year-old journalist and RTI activist Raghvendra Bajpai, whose reports on alleged irregularities in paddy procurement and stamp duty are suspected to be among the possible reasons he was targeted.Sitapur SP Chakresh Mishra told TOI that six teams were probing the case, based on an FIR registered on Saturday against the unidentified motorcycle-borne assailants who shot dead Bajpai in the city, around 90km north of Lucknow.The revenue officials — called “lekhpals” in parts of India — and the other nine people in detention were purportedly in contact with the victim over the past month.“The motive remains unclear, which is why investigators are looking at the case from multiple angles, including Bajpai’s reportage in the Hindi newspaper for which he worked,” the SP said. “We aren’t ruling out personal enmity being the trigger for the murder.” Investigators are banking on data forensically gleaned from the victim’s mobile phone to provide clues crucial to cracking the case.The FIR received by Maholi police station quotes Rashmi Bajpai, the slain journalist’s wife, as saying that he left home around 2.30pm on Saturday to “meet somebody”. An hour later, Rashmi was informed that her husband had been shot by unidentified assailants near the Hempur overbridge on Sitapur Road. He was declared dead on arrival at Sitapur District Hospital.Rashmi told police that she suspected her husband’s reportage “angered certain individuals” and that he was “ambushed and killed”.She wrote to CM Yogi Adityanath, demanding the strictest possible punishment to those involved in the crime.

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam on Friday claimed that the state unit of Congress is going through a severe monetary crunch leading to nonpayment of rent and electricity bill of the party office. Former state president of the grand-old-party, who joined Eknath Shinde months before the assembly elections said that the incompetence of the state and the national leadership of the party led to this situation.""The Mumbai Congress is just one step away from being shut down. The current ineffective and incompetent leaders of the Mumbai Congress are to blame for this situation. The office, which operates in the premises of the Maharashtra government's PWD department, has not paid rent for several years, resulting in an outstanding bill of 18 lakh rupees. The electricity bill has reached nearly 5 lakh rupees, and the electricity supply company eventually removed the meter and disconnected the power,"" Nirupam said.""This situation reflects the lack of leadership and capability among the leaders. For about 9 to 10 months, Mumbai Congress employees have not received their salaries. The party is in a silent mode with no events being organized, mainly because the leadership has completely failed,"" he added.Further, taking a jibe at Rahul Gandhi, Nirupam said that leaders seldom meet party workers in the state and make a video for YouTube and leave. He blamed the Congress' alliance with Thackeray’s party, Shiv Sena (UBT), for its decline.""Rahul Gandhi yesterday came to Mumbai not as a Congress leader but as a YouTuber to make a video in Dharavi. While the Mumbai Congress' condition is getting worse, their leaders are more busy making videos,"" Nirupam said""This is the result of effective leadership. In 2019, when the alliance between Shiv Sena and Congress was forming, I advised against it, warning that the Congress party would gradually weaken. Five to six years later, this prediction is coming true, with only three MLAs remaining, who rely heavily on Muslim votes. Currently, in Mumbai, Uddhav Thackeray's party is the first choice because they appear strong. The Mumbai Congress and the Congress party have become subordinate to Uddhav Thackeray's party, and the incompetence of Delhi's leaders is evident. They have accepted that they cannot stand on their own and rely on allies, leading to the party's downfall. In the coming days, the Congress party in Maharashtra will face a similar fate as it did in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar,"" he added.This comes days after Harshwardhan Sapkal became the new chief of the party's Maharashtra unit. Sapkal takes over from Nana Patole, who had resigned following the party's poor performance in the Maharashtra Assembly elections.In the 2024 assembly elections, the Mahayuti coalition of BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP won 235 of the 288 seats, with BJP securing 132 alone.

"Nitish Kumar loses cool, again: Why Bihar CM's frequent outbursts may upend state politics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nitish-kumar-loses-cool-again-why-bihar-cms-frequent-outbursts-may-upend-state-politics/articleshow/118790264.cms,"Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Women's Day wishes, messages and quotes !



NEW DELHI: Is Nitish Kumar losing his cool way too often these days? On Friday, the Bihar chief minister lost his temper inside the state legislative council and surprised many with his choice of words to refer to former chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi .""Jab iske husband doob gaye to apni wife ko bana diya (When her husband began to sink, he installed his wife (in the CM's post))"", Nitish said referring to Lalu Prasad's move to make Rabri Devi the chief minister after he was forced to resign from the post following an arrest warrant in a fodder scam case.It all started after RJD MLC Urmila Thakur, citing the example of her Begusarai district said ""in many villages, girls are deprived of education as reaching the nearest school requires them to walk four to five kilometers"".This irked Nitish Kumar, who lashed out at the opposition and said: ""Do you people even know what we have done for girls' education? Village girls hardly went to schools in Bihar until we came to power.""When Urmila Thakur objected, Nitish stepped up his attack.""The education system had collapsed during the RJD government. It was I who revived it,” the CM said. ""What did the RJD government do for women? Where did women study earlier? They barely had access to primary education,” he added.Then the Bihar chief minister went on to launch a frontal attack on Rabri Devi and mocked at the way she was made the chief minister by her husband Lalu Prasad.Also read: 'Mahila has no problems': Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's remark sparks spat with opposition women lawmakers - watch Leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav strongly objected to the language used by Nitish Kumar for his parents and once again raised questions over Bihar chief minister's health. ""I pity the condition of chief minister and I don't want to comment any more on this aspect. His falling health has proved that he is not fit to run Bihar anymore,"" Tejashwi said.""There should be some decency in language when you are holding the post of chief minister. Rabri Devi became the chief minister before him and that too of undivided Bihar and he is referring to her as ""re"" and ""tu"","" he added.""Nitish Kumar should know that Rabri Deviji was the first woman chief minister of the state. She is elder to Nitish both in age and also in relationship,"" the RJD leader said.And while targeting Nitish over his health suits Tejashwi's politics, senior political analyst N K Choudhary has a different take on the changed behaviour of Bihar chief minister.""Nitish Kumar is perhaps reacting to the challenges he faces to his undisputed leadership for the first time. Nitish enjoyed unbridled power for over 15 years but realises that political dynamics in the state has changed,"" says Choudhary, who is also a former professor of Patna University.Also read: 'I made your father': Bihar CM Nitish to Tejashwi Yadav amid big showdown in assembly ""No one could question Nitish Kumar and there was no challenge to his authority all these years. This perhaps led to some arrogance. Also, the social system that gave him power increased his ego over the years. So, now when questions are raised over his governance or his development claims are criticised, Nitish reacts very strongly,"" says N K Choudhary.""Even Lalu Prasad, during his prime enjoyed a lot of power and would often say ""I am the king,"" he adds.Whatever be the reason, those who have followed Nitish Kumar and seen his politics over the years, do feel that there is a perceptible change in his behaviour. In fact, one of the biggest factors that differentiated Nitish from his arch rival Lalu Prasad, who is also a mass leader, was the grace with which the JD(U) chief handled his critics and the opposition.With elections scheduled later this year in Bihar, Tejashwi has stepped up his attack on Nitish. However, the strong reactions from Bihar chief minister seem to suggest that he is not ready to take such political attacks lying low. May be Nitish feels offence is the best defence. More so, as his dominance in Bihar politics is perhaps on the decline. However, what Nitish needs to realise that his frequent outbursts will give the opposition an opportunity to raise more questions on his health - a narrative that not just suits RJD's Tejashwi, but also the BJP. The saffron party, which is now the senior partner in the Bihar alliance, would be keen to lead the alliance once the Nitish era comes to an end.(With inputs from agencies)","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar lost his temper inside the state legislative council.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin is on a warpath with the BJP-led NDA government. The two major issues at the center of the now almost everyday war of words are delimitation and the Hindi ""imposition"" row concerning the National Education Policy (NEP).On Friday, Stalin wrote to his counterparts of seven states, including Bengal's Mamata Banerjee, Punjab's Bhagwant Mann, and also BJP-ruled Odisha's Mohan Chandra Majhi to fight the delimitation exercise. Stalin also wrote to the chief of political parties if these states proposing the inaugural joint action committee meeting in Chennai on March 22, urging the leaders to join forces to chart a ""collective course forward.""Stalin has claimed that the representation of the South in the Lok Sabha would be reduced due to delimitation exercise.Despite Amit Shah's assurance that the southern states will not lose a single Lok Sabha seat, the chief ministers of two Congress-ruled states — Karnataka's Siddaramaiah and Telangana's Revanth Reddy — have united with Stalin to attack the BJP-led Centre on delimitation.At a recent all-party meeting, Stalin also secured the support of the main opposition AIADMK, Congress, and Left parties, as well as actor-politician Vijay's TVK and Kamal Haasan's Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM). The meeting was boycotted by the BJP, Tamil nationalist Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK), and former union minister GK Vasan's Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar).During the meeting, Stalin also asserted that the 1971 population data should be the basis for delimitation of Lok Sabha seats for 30 years from 2026, and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make an assurance in Parliament.In what maybe seen as a win for Stalin, BJP’s ally, PMK, also voiced concerns on Thursday that Tamil Nadu's representation in Parliament could decline due to delimitation.With assembly elections due next year, Stalin has intensified his attacks on the NDA government on another front with three-language policy . The Tamil Nadu government has strongly opposed implementing the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020, raising concerns over the ""three-language formula"" and alleging that the Centre is attempting to ""impose"" Hindi.However, while Congress leaders in the South have supported Stalin's stance, the party's central leadership has so far maintained a neutral stance on the issue.With Bihar assembly elections just months away, followed by Uttar Pradesh, Congress seems to have adopted a carefully balanced approach. This is likely because Congress still holds influence in the South. Among the three Congress-ruled states, two — Telangana and Karnataka — are in the South. The party's 99-seat Lok Sabha win was largely powered by southern states, where it won a total of 42 seats:To keep the party's stance in balance, Manickam Tagore, Congress MP from Tamil Nadu’s Virudhunagar and party whip in Lok Sabha, recently stated: ""Our party respects all languages, and we are against all kinds of language imposition. Hindi can be learned by choice but not by imposition.""Other key INDIA bloc allies, including Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Jammu and Kashmir's National Conference leader Omar Abdullah, have remained silent on both issues.On NEP, all state governments except Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and West Bengal have adopted and implemented the policy. However, Bengal CM and INDIA bloc ally Mamata Banerjee has also refrained from making any public statements in support of Stalin.Instead, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief has shifted focus and is now trying to corner the NDA government and the Election Commission, alleging voter list manipulation.The Parliament session after Lok Sabha elections saw the INDIA bloc divided with their individual agendas (Congress on the Adani issue, Samajwadi Party on Sambhal violence) as they tried to corner the NDA government. With TMC already announcing that it will raise the issue of voter ID number duplication during the upcoming session starting from March 10, it will be interesting to see if the INDIA bloc finds a common ground to carry out coordinated attack this time.","Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin is on a warpath with the BJP-led NDA government.

In the annals of political faux pas, Mitt Romney’s infamous ‘47%’ comment or Hillary Clinton branding Trump supporters as ‘deplorables’ stand out as classic cases of plain speaking gone horribly wrong—instances where opponents easily cast them as out-of-touch elitists. But perhaps no self-goal in Indian politics has been as monumental as Mani Shankar Aiyar ’s 2014 ‘chaiwala’ jibe at then-Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi. Modi may well have ascended to the Prime Ministership without that gaffe, but Aiyar ’s ill-timed comment ensured that the crumbling edifice of UPA-2 was buried six feet under. Narendra Modi, who had always sought to play on the theme of the entitled versus the commoner, lapped up the ‘chaiwala’ moniker like a fish to water.If that was not enough, Aiyar repeated history just a few years later, once again helping PM Modi secure his home turf. In 2017, as the BJP grappled with anti-incumbency, the Patel agitation, and Dalit uprisings in Gujarat, Aiyar’s ‘neech aadmi’ remark gifted Modi the perfect opportunity to reframe the election as a question of Gujarati(pride). The result? A last-minute consolidation of core voters, allowing the BJP to scrape through in a tough contest. A red-faced Congress suspended Aiyar, but the damage was already done.While that may have been the formal break between Aiyar and the Congress, the former Union minister has continued to embarrass the party. The latest episode? A backhanded compliment to Rajiv Gandhi, where Aiyar, in his characteristic bluntness, detailed how the former Prime Minister had flunked at Cambridge and later at Imperial College, London. It provided fresh ammunition to the BJP, all too keen to puncture the image of the technocratic PM, who has been widely hailed for bringing the first wave of the IT revolution to the country.Furious Congress leaders wasted no time in denouncing Aiyar—Maharashtra’s Nana Patole labelled him “mentally unstable,” Harish Khare called him “frustrated,” and former Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot dismissed him as(crazy).Whether Aiyar is crazy or simply unfiltered remains up for debate. What is clear, however, is his unwavering desire for validation from the Gandhis. Despite the controversy, he expressed hope that Rahul Gandhi would take notice of him. Ironically, it was Rahul himself who, during an AICC session in 2014, praised Aiyar’s role in solidifying the Panchayati Raj system. In 2004, Rahul had apparently told Aiyar's wife that he would always listen to the ex-bureaucrat because his father trusted Mani. Yet, Aiyar himself admits that in all these years, he has had only one meaningful conversation with Rahul and just two with Priyanka. He claims he has long been ready to mentor Rahul, but that the Congress leader seems averse to taking his advice, likely due to his age. He even goes on to say that Rahul Gandhi probably despises him, even though Aiyar maintains that his relationship with the Gandhis remains intact!Aiyar’s connection with the Gandhis, however, is indisputable. He was one of Rajiv Gandhi’s closest aides, serving as his joint secretary, and has extensively chronicled his legacy. Even last year, he published a book arguing that Rajiv Gandhi remains one of India’s most misunderstood Prime Ministers. Aiyar’s loyalty to Rajiv appears unquestionable, making it unlikely that he intended to damage his legacy. Instead, his real problem is that he is a relic of a bygone political era—one in which intellectual acerbity was tolerated, if not encouraged.In today’s-obsessed generation with decreasing attention spans, where media organisations are fishing for viral outrage, Aiyar's verbose, long-winded explanations of his ideals leave too many loose ends. Even though thehas shifted with the BJP being in power for over a decade, Aiyar has held onto his pacifist ideals and commitment to secularism. Thus, the man who embarked on aduring the Ayodhya movement and accused then-PM Narasimha Rao of parroting the BJP's line on Hinduism faced brutal public pushback when he said Modi must be removed to improve Indo-Pak relations. Similarly, his attempt to explain the reason behind theattack also led to controversy. Perhaps a simple condemnation without qualifiers would have been easier, but then, it wouldn’t have been Mani Aiyar.In today’s world, political correctness reigns supreme. Aiyar’s brand of public discourse—witty yet sharp, opinionated yet unfiltered—has long since expired. His comments, mocking Hansraj College with his elitepedigree, his dyed-in-the-wool liberal stance regarding what he believed were ‘alleged’ Chinese incursions, his opposition to nuclear weapons, and his resistance to liberalisation, are now seen as political liabilities rather than intellectual contributions.Even as sports minister, he went against the tide, opposing India’s hosting of the Commonwealth Games, describing them as a colossal waste of money.It is a testament to his political gumption that he managed to win three elections from Mayiladuthurai (1991, 1999, and 2004). It is no mean feat for a person born in Lahore, schooled at Doon and Welham’s, later attending St. Stephen’s and Cambridge, to also find acceptance with the electorate despite his anglicised persona. In 2010, he made it to the Rajya Sabha, but his relationship with the Congress leadership gradually soured, leaving him out in the cold.In another political system—perhaps in the US—Aiyar, a self-proclaimed 'secular fundamentalist,' might have found space as India’s equivalent of Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a left-liberal figure leading an ideological movement. But in India, where political pragmatism trumps ideological rigidity, he stuck out like a sore thumb. A more strategic Congress leadership could have harnessed Aiyar’s intellect and commitment to rural empowerment to craft an alternative policy vision, challenging the ruling government’s policies. As an IFS officer, he served in Pakistan and was the first consul general of India in Karachi. His insights could have been leveraged to shape opposition's foreign policy towards India's neighbourhood. Instead, he has been relegated to a running meme—a political grenade who periodically explodes, causing maximum collateral damage to his own party.In many ways, his trajectory mirrors that of Sam Pitroda , another Congress veteran known for his verbal misadventures. But unlike Pitroda, who still enjoys official roles in the Congress, Aiyar remains an outsider, waiting for his next moment of unfiltered candour.Perhaps the world is simply not ready for another Mani Shankar Aiyar. Or perhaps, just maybe, Aiyar has outlived his political relevance—a man out of sync with his time, clinging to an era that no longer exists. In some ways, the Congress, despite all its grandstanding about being a melting pot of ideas, failed to accommodate Aiyar. Another man who does not shy away from speaking his own mind—a diplomat-turned-politician who runs his own successful campaign—Shashi Tharoor, may end up sharing Aiyar’s fate if he does not play by the rules.","Mani Shankar Aiyar’s 2014 ‘chaiwala’ jibe at then-Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi helped the BJP secure his home turf.

The Los Angeles Lakers aren’t just a basketball team—they’re a dynasty. For decades, they’ve produced some of the sport’s biggest icons, players who didn’t just dominate on the court but built incredible wealth beyond it. From Magic Johnson ’s billion-dollar empire to LeBron James ’ game-changing investments, Lakers legends have proven that success isn’t just about championships—it’s about legacy.Some, like Shaquille O’Neal, turned their larger-than-life personalities into media stardom. Others, like Luol Deng, quietly built financial empires through smart investments. And then there’s Magic, whose business acumen transformed him into one of the richest athletes in history. Let’s take a closer look at these legends, their journeys, and how they turned Lakers fame into financial powerhouses. Pau Gasol isn’t just a Lakers legend—he’s an international basketball icon. With a net worth of $120 million as of 2025, according to Celebrity Net Worth, the Spanish big man made his mark both on and off the court. A six-time All-Star, Gasol played for multiple teams, but his most memorable years came in Lakers gold and purple. Traded to LA in 2008, he became the perfect frontcourt partner for Kobe Bryant , helping the team secure back-to-back championships in 2009 and 2010.Over his 18-year NBA career, Gasol earned $225 million in salary, peaking at $19 million per season. Off the court, he secured endorsement deals with Nike, Adidas, and Banco Popular, and made strategic real estate investments. Beyond the NBA, he led Spain to multiple Olympic medals and a FIBA World Cup title, cementing his place in basketball history. Anthony Davis ’ dominance on the court has translated into serious financial success. With a net worth of $160 million as of 2025, per Celebrity Net Worth, Davis has built his fortune through massive contracts, endorsements, and smart investments. Drafted first overall by the New Orleans Pelicans in 2012, he quickly established himself as one of the league’s best big men before joining LeBron James on the Lakers in 2019. Their partnership led to a championship in 2020.His dominance earned him a $190 million contract in 2020, followed by a $186 million extension in 2023, bringing his salary to a staggering $62 million per year. In February 2025, Davis was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster deal for Luka Doncic .Off the court, Davis has endorsement deals with Nike, Ruffles, and First Entertainment Credit Union, and owns a $31 million Los Angeles mansion. His ability to dominate both in business and basketball makes him a force to be reckoned with. Luol Deng may not have been the flashiest player, but his financial acumen has made him one of the wealthiest former Lakers. With a net worth of $200 million, per Celebrity Net Worth, Deng built his fortune through lucrative NBA contracts, endorsements, and an impressive real estate portfolio.Drafted seventh overall in 2004, Deng was a two-time All-Star with the Chicago Bulls before playing for the Cavaliers, Heat, Lakers, and Timberwolves. His most lucrative contract came in 2016 when the Lakers signed him to a four-year, $72 million deal. Over his 15-year career, Deng earned $166 million in salary.Off the court, he invested heavily in real estate, amassing a $125 million portfolio that includes hotels, resorts, and apartment complexes. His financial success proves that smart decisions can be just as valuable as a killer jump shot. Russell Westbrook has never been the type to go halfway—on the court or with his money. With a net worth of $375 million as of 2025 per Celebrity Net Worth, he’s built his fortune through massive contracts, big-name endorsements, and some smart real estate moves.Drafted fourth overall in 2008, Westbrook became the face of the Oklahoma City Thunder, racking up triple-doubles and winning MVP in 2017. He later played for the Rockets, Wizards, Lakers, and Clippers before signing with the Denver Nuggets in 2024.His biggest contract was a five-year, $205 million extension in 2017—once the largest deal in NBA history. With over $350 million in career earnings and endorsements from Jordan Brand (worth up to $200 million), Pepsi, and more, Westbrook has turned his explosive playing style into a financial empire. His real estate portfolio includes luxury properties in Los Angeles and Oklahoma, proving his investments are as smart as his game. Shaquille O’Neal isn’t just one of the greatest centers in NBA history—he’s a business mogul. With a net worth of $500 million, per Celebrity Net Worth, Shaq turned his on-court dominance into a multi-faceted empire.After being drafted first overall in 1992, he became a household name with the Lakers, leading them to three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002 alongside Kobe Bryant. But basketball was just the beginning.Shaq has earned over $800 million from endorsements, investments, and media ventures. From Reebok to Papa John’s, Google to real estate, his portfolio is diverse and ever-growing. Even in retirement, he earns an estimated $60 million annually, proving that true legends never stop winning. LeBron James made history by becoming the first active NBA player to reach billionaire status. With a net worth of $1.2 billion (as of 2025), according to Forbes, his wealth stems from his playing career, endorsements, and strategic investments.Since being drafted first overall in 2003, LeBron has dominated the NBA, winning titles with the Heat, Cavaliers, and Lakers. His Lakers contracts alone have surpassed $200 million, with an annual salary over $45 million.Off the court, he’s earned over $900 million through endorsements including a lifetime Nike deal, business ventures like his stake in Fenway Sports Group, and investments in Blaze Pizza and SpringHill Entertainment. Unlike most athletes, LeBron takes equity in brands he promotes, ensuring long-term wealth. Magic Johnson isn’t just a basketball legend—he’s a business icon. With a net worth of $1.6 billion as of 2025, per Forbes, Magic transformed his earnings into a financial empire.Though he made roughly $40 million during his Lakers career, his real success came after retirement. Instead of relying solely on endorsements, Magic built his fortune through high-value investments. His biggest asset is a 60% stake in EquiTrust, a life insurance firm managing $26 billion in assets.He also owns stakes in the Dodgers (MLB), Commanders (NFL), LAFC (MLS), and Sparks (WNBA). Through Magic Johnson Enterprises, he invested in Starbucks franchises, real estate, and urban development, cementing his legacy beyond the court.The Lakers have always been about more than just basketball. These legends didn’t just leave their mark on the game—they built legacies that extend far beyond it. Whether it’s Gasol giving back to his home country, LeBron creating opportunities for future generations, or Magic revolutionizing business, these players prove that true greatness isn’t just about money—it’s about impact.Also Read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could sign $35 million Chicago Bulls guard to support Luka Doncic and LeBron James in their Championship Run And as the next generation of Lakers stars rise, one thing is certain: greatness doesn’t stop at the final buzzer.

Taylor Swift was reportedly ""gripped by fear"" over Travis Kelce's decision of returning for the 2025 NFL season

Following the loss of the Kansas City Chiefs during Super Bowl 59 to the Eagles, there was uncertainty around Travis Kelce 's future in the NFL. He confessed during the New Heights podcast that he took time considering whether to continue playing or hang up his boots. He, however, finally decided to remain in the league. Radar Online, however, indicated that Taylor Swift was exceedingly worried about this decision, citing its importance not only for his career but for their relationship.After the Kansas City Chiefs' gut-wrenching defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 59, rumors circulated regarding Travis Kelce's NFL future. Fans and pundits alike wondered if the superstar tight end would come back for another year or retire after the crushing loss.Kelce himself cleared the air about the uncertainty on the New Heights podcast, saying that he himself did not know what he would do next in the moments after the game. He revealed that he had taken time to consider his options before making a conclusive decision regarding his football future.Finally, Kelce decided to keep playing, deciding to play on rather than retire from the sport. His long-time girlfriend, global singing sensation Taylor Swift, though, was highly invested in the consequences of his choice, and by a Radar Online report, worried about the heaviness of it all. According to the report, Swift feared what route Kelce would end up going down, stressing the importance the decision held for him professionally as well as personally, for himself and for the couple's future.A source close to Swift told the outlet, ""Taylor is really gripped by fear over which way he's going to jump because it has big ramifications for their relationship, but also, it is totally his call. Travis is totally adamant that Taylor would never pressure him into anything, insisting she’ll support whatever he decides – but let’s be real, it’s no secret she’s itching to settle down.”The report also indicated that both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift were keen on spending more quality time with each other, something that has not been easy given their hectic schedules. Since they started dating, their hectic schedules—Kelce's NFL commitments and Swift's global music career—have restricted their time together, making it hard to give their relationship the priority it deserves.Also Read: “Their fantasy bubble has been popped”: Taylor Swift is clearly happy for her beau Travis Kelce's retirement decision, but she had some reservations Furthermore, Radar Online asserted that Swift was worried about the possible public outcry if Kelce had decided to retire.

Taylor Swift is taking the uncertainty of her future with Travis Kelce hard

Travis Kelce stands at a career fork in the road, caught between remaining in the NFL or transitioning into entertainment. His increasing presence in the media has created speculation that he will leave football behind. Taylor Swift is said to be worried about how his choice will affect their relationship, considering they already have busy schedules. With both his professional career and personal life on the line, Kelce's decision might determine not only his future in football but also his future with Swift.Travis Kelce stands at a critical juncture in his professional life, and everyone—from his superstar partner, Taylor Swift—is watching which direction he will ultimately head. In the aftermath of the Kansas City Chiefs' gut-wrenching defeat at Super Bowl 59 , the tight end is torn between staying in his storied NFL career or pursuing the glitz and glamour of show business.Kelce has already gained fame outside of football, having tried his hand at television, commercials, and media appearances, fueling rumors that he might go full-time showbiz. As he takes his time weighing his options, Swift is said to be taking the uncertainty hard. With their very public relationship and already busy schedules, Kelce's decision could have major repercussions for the future of the couple.The pop star is reportedly eagerly waiting for his choice, aware that it would help them spend more time together or make their situation even more complicated with regards to balancing their separate careers. With too much hanging in the balance—both professionally and personally—Kelce's next step is one that would change not only his life but that of his romance with Swift as well.Swift is uncertain about two potential outcomes in the near future: more time together with Kelce, which they both desire, or too much togetherness, which can potentially unravel even the strongest relationships, according to insiders. “If Travis does retire, it could drastically change his and Taylor’s lives together. He would be around far more – and who knows, she may start to get sick of him!” an insider warned.“Taylor is really gripped by fear over which way he’s going to jump because it has big ramifications for their relationship, but also, it is totally his call. Travis is totally adamant that Taylor would never pressure him into anything, insisting she’ll support whatever he decides – but let’s be real, it’s no secret she’s itching to settle down.”They added, “Imagine if he retires; they could finally have more time together! They both really miss each other when he’s off training or jet-setting around the country for games. But on the flip-side there is the danger they would then be spending too much time together and they both know this can spell the death of a relationship.”Also Read: “Their fantasy bubble has been popped”: Taylor Swift is clearly happy for her beau Travis Kelce's retirement decision, but she had some reservations","Travis Kelce stands at a career fork in the road, caught between remaining in the NFL or transitioning into entertainment.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
