Indian NGO Highlights Dalits, Minorities Rights In India At UNHRC Side Event

NEW DELHI: Unveiling details of his brain child ‘Unified Judicial Policy’ (UJP), CJI Surya Kant on Saturday said courts will give top priority to cases relating to personal liberty, ensure predictability in decisions relating to commercial and economic matters to foster investor confidence, and deal empathetically with disputes relating to family, consumers and social justice.Speaking at the Regional Judicial Conference at Jaisalmer, the CJI said citizens approach courts not only to seek remedies but with the hope that the law will be applied consistently, liberties will be guarded, rights will be clarified and govts will be held accountable.He said predictability of the justice delivery system, pruned of legal jargon, is important to further public understanding and maintain faith in the system. Predictability is rooted in consistency, reason, precedent and timely disposal, he said, adding, “investors look for it, accused persons rely on it, families hope for it and society depends on it.”“A justice system that operates unpredictably or without clear guiding principles inevitably weakens public confidence because litigants cannot anticipate how similar cases will be treated or when their matters will be resolved,” CJI Kant said.“When judicial outcomes reflect principled reasoning, consistent application of law and transparent evolution of doctrine, confidence in the courts is strengthened, as people come to understand justice is not dependent on chance but guided by established norms. ”Technology has evolved into a constitutional instrument that strengthens equality before the law, expands access to justice and enhances institutional efficiency. It allows the judiciary to transcend physical barriers and bureaucratic rigidities to deliver outcomes that are timely, transparent and principled.Justice systems, one headed by HCs in the states and the other operated nationally by SC, are not operating in parallel, he said while underscoring the need for UJP, under which technology will be the engine to ensure convergence of the two systems by harmonising procedural norms, prioritising cases, removing delays and formatting coherently judgments across jurisdictions. “But technology alone cannot sustain the Rule of Law; it must operate alongside the deeper constitutional traditions that anchor judicial behaviour and preserve institutional coherence,” he said.CJI Kant said uniformity in judgment and reasoning is a must in cases of similar nature. “A Unified Judicial Policy is not merely an administrative doctrine; it is the architecture of constitutional confidence. It strengthens the idea that our courts are not isolated entities but parts of one Republic, driven by common values, delivering coherent justice,” he said.“Ultimately, the measure of innovation is not the complexity of the software we deploy, but the simplicity with which a citizen understands the outcome of their case and believes that justice has been served,” he stressed.",Chief Justice of India Surya Kant unveils details of his brain child ‘Unified Judicial Policy’ (UJP) He said courts will give top priority to cases relating to personal liberty.

Heart disease leading cause of sudden deaths under 45: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heart-disease-leading-cause-of-sudden-deaths-under-45-study/articleshow/125954017.cms,"Keep your heart young post-30s with these 4 simple ways

.

NEW DELHI: Sudden deaths are no longer confined to old age. An AIIMS study has found that more than half of all sudden deaths examined over a year occurred in people under 45 — many of them apparently healthy, who collapsed without warning at home or while travelling.Published this month in Indian Journal of Medical Research as part of an ongoing Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) project, the cross-sectional study was conducted between May 2023 and April 2024 at the departments of pathology and forensic medicine at AIIMS New Delhi. Of the 2,214 autopsies analysed, 180 cases — 8.1% — met the criteria for sudden death. Young adults aged 18–45 accounted for 103 of these cases, or 57.2%, with an average age of 33.6 years and a strong male predominance.Heart disease emerged as the leading cause. Dr Sudhir Gupta, from AIIMS’s department of forensic medicine and an author of the study, said cardiovascular conditions accounted for 42.6% of sudden deaths in the young. Most had advanced coronary artery disease with severe blockages, often without any prior diagnosis, indicating that fatal heart disease had progressed silently. Respiratory causes — such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and asphyxia — accounted for a little over one in five deaths.More than one-fifth of deaths in young adults remained unexplained despite detailed imaging, full autopsy and microscopic examination. These “negative autopsy” cases point to hidden electrical or genetic heart disorders that routine investigations may miss.Most deaths occurred at home or during travel, frequently at night or early morning. Sudden loss of consciousness was the most common symptom reported by families, followed by chest pain and breathlessness. Only a small number of young adults had known conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.Lifestyle risks were common across the cases examined. Over half of those who died young were smokers or consumed alcohol — rates similar to those for older adults. The study found no significant link between sudden deaths and Covid infection or vaccination — vaccination coverage was high across age groups.Among adults aged 46–65, coronary artery disease was even more predominant, accounting for over 70% of sudden deaths.Commenting on the findings, Dr K K Talwar, chairman, PSRI Heart Institute, said the study highlights a disturbing rise in premature coronary artery disease. He noted that many unexplained deaths occur likely due to inherited electrical disorders of the heart, which routine autopsies cannot detect, underscoring the need for genetic testing and family screening. He stressed early preventive check-ups, strict avoidance of tobacco and alcohol, and routine heart evaluations in younger people, while reiterating there is no evidence linking Covid vaccination to sudden cardiac deaths.Researchers warn that sudden death in the young often stems from underlying disease, making early detection critical. With fatal events striking earlier in life, the study flags an urgent public health challenge: identifying silent heart disease before it turns deadly.","More than half of all sudden deaths examined over a year occurred in people under 45.

Why India’s New Right To Disconnect Bill Could Transform Work Culture, Protect Millions From Burnout

Key provisions of the bill

Global pioneers in disconnection rights

France leads with early legislation

Portugal enforces strict boundaries

Italy adapts to flexible work

Australia joins the movement

US lacks legal protections amid rising proposals

India's parliament has seen the introduction of a new bill that grants employees the power to ignore work communications outside official hours. The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life. Employees gain the legal right to switch off from calls, emails, and messages without fear of repercussions from employers.Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule introduced this private member's bill in the Lok Sabha. As a non-ministerial proposal, it focuses on creating an Employees' Welfare Authority to oversee implementation and address violations.The legislation mandates that companies establish clear policies on after-hours contact. Workers can decline responses to non-emergency communications, promoting healthier work-life balance. The proposed authority would investigate complaints, impose fines on non-compliant firms, and educate both sides on rights and responsibilities. Supriya Sule's bill applies to private sector employees, ensuring they disconnect without disciplinary action.Several nations adopted similar measures years before India's proposal.These laws emerged amid rising concerns over burnout and digital overload in modern workplaces. Governments recognised the need to protect workers from incessant demands.France became a trailblazer in 2017 by enacting the Right to Disconnect as part of the El Khomri Labour Law, requiring companies—especially larger ones—to negotiate with unions to ensure employees are not pressured to be online after hours, helping combat digital burnout and protect work-life balance. The law requires firms with over 50 employees to negotiate agreements on out-of-hours communications. Workers disconnect from devices, and employers respect rest periods. This stemmed from labour code reforms addressing 35-hour workweeks and overtime boundaries.Portugal introduced robust protections in 2021 (Law no. 83/2021). Employers face bans on contacting staff outside shifts, with fines up to €9,690 for violations. The law covers remote workers, mandating compensation for home office expenses. It prohibits monitoring tools that invade privacy during off-hours.Italy embedded the right in 2017 smart working laws (Law 81/2017). Companies must outline disconnection periods in contracts for remote employees. Unions negotiate terms, ensuring no penalties for unavailability. This applies to public and private sectors, focusing on work-life harmony.Australia implemented its version in 2024. Employees ignore unreasonable after-hours contacts, with tribunals resolving disputes. Small businesses get exemptions initially, but larger firms comply fully. The law builds on fair work acts, shielding staff from overreach.The United States trails far behind, with no federal, state, or local right to disconnect laws enacted as of December 2025. California led the charge in February 2024 with Assembly Bill 2751, mandating policies for ignoring employer communications during non-working hours, defined by job descriptions or agreements. The measure stalled in committee amid pushback from businesses citing global operations and flexibility needs, though it could resurface. New Jersey followed with a similar 2024 bill for firms with 10-plus staff, but it too faltered. Earlier attempts in New York City and Washington met defeat, leaving workers reliant on voluntary policies.This void amplifies US work culture's intensity. Over 80% of employees report job-related stress, with more than half saying it spills into home life, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Salaried roles often exceed 40 hours without overtime pay, fostering a ""hustle"" mentality where unplugging invites guilt. Tech firms like Google offer perks such as flexible schedules and mental health days, but these vary widely, and many sectors demand round-the-clock responsiveness.","The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life.

NEW DELHI: With air quality worsening sharply across the Delhi-NCR, authorities on Saturday invoked the strictest restrictions under Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan, triggering emergency curbs across the region. This comes hours after implementation of GRAP stage III measured in the national capital region.The Commission for Air Quality Management said its GRAP sub-committee had decided to enforce all measures under Stage IV or ‘Severe+’ air quality with immediate effect after pollution levels crossed critical thresholds. In an official statement, the panel said, “Keeping in view the prevailing trend of air quality and in an effort to prevent further deterioration of air quality in the region, the CAQM Sub-Committee on GRAP decides to invoke all actions as envisaged under Stage-IV of the extant GRAP ‘Severe+’ Air Quality (DELHI AQI > 450), with immediate effect, in the entire NCR. ” It added that these steps would be in addition to restrictions already in force under Stages I, II and III.In an official order, the government directed that all administrative secretaries and heads of departments shall attend office regularly, with no more than 50 per cent staff strength physically present.""The remaining 50 per cent staff shall work from home, provided that the Administrative Secretaries and Heads of Departments can call officers/officials to the office, as required to ensure uninterrupted delivery of essential and emergency public services,"" the order read.Likewise, the order stipulated that all private offices operating within Delhi shall function with no more than 50 per cent staff physically attending the workplace.""The remaining staff shall mandatorily work from home,"" it added. The order also urged all private entities to implement staggered working hours where feasible. Furthermore, private offices have been instructed to ensure strict compliance with work-from-home norms and minimise vehicular movement related to office commutes.""Hospitals and other public/private health establishments, Fire Services, Prisons, Public Transport, Electricity, Water, Sanitation and related municipal services, disaster management and related services, forest and environment departments/agencies engaged in air pollution control, monitoring, and enforcement activities (like teams deployed to curb biomass burning, dust control, GRAP measures, etc. ), and other essential/emergency services shall be exempted from these directions,"" the order said.The decision came hours after Delhi slipped back into the ‘severe’ category, prompting the reimposition of Stage III curbs earlier in the day. According to official data, the city’s Air Quality Index, which stood at 349 on Friday evening, surged overnight and was recorded at 401 by Saturday morning due to slow wind speeds, a stable atmosphere and unfavourable meteorological conditions that hampered the dispersion of pollutants.According to news agency ANI, As of 7.00 PM, AQI readings were 488 in Anand Vihar, 434 in Ashok Vihar, 496 in Bawana, 457 in Burari, 479 in Chandini Chowk, 394 in IGI Airport, and 445 in Okhla Phase-2.Also read: Delhi AQI turns 'severe': GRAP Stage III reimposed across NCR; what's allowed & what's not A dense layer of smog enveloped the capital on Saturday morning, reducing visibility and intensifying health concerns.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Saturday criticised the Central government after the Union cabinet approved a bill to rename the Mahatma Gandhi national rural employment guarantee act ( MGNREGA ), questioning why Mahatma Gandhi’s name needed to be dropped and accusing the Centre of focusing on rebranding rather than reform.Reacting to the Cabinet decision, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said the government was a “dhurandhar” at renaming schemes and laws. “They renamed the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, and the rural LPG distribution programme to Ujjwala. They are experts in re-packaging and branding,” he told PTI.Ramesh questioned the rationale behind the move, saying, “They hate Pandit Nehru but it seems they also hate Mahatma Gandhi. What’s wrong with the name Mahatma Gandhi, why rename the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act to Pujya Bapu Employment Guarantee Scheme?”PTI citing Sources said the Cabinet on Friday cleared a Bill to rename the scheme as ‘Pujya Bapu Grameen Rozgar Yojna’ and increase the guaranteed number of workdays from the current 100 to 125 days.Congress general secretary in-charge organisation K C Venugopal said Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who had earlier described MGNREGA as a “monument of failure”, was now renaming the scheme to claim credit for it.“It’s yet another way of erasing Mahatma Gandhi from our national psyche, especially from the villages, where, he said, India’s soul resides,” he alleged in a post on X.Venugopal also accused the government of neglecting the scheme, saying the renaming was a “cosmetic change”.“MGNREGA workers have been demanding higher wages, but the Centre has been reducing allocated funds for the scheme year after year,” he said, alleging that mounting arrears reflected a “carefully planned strategy to engineer a slow death for the scheme”.“But Mr Modi, rename it all you want, the people know it was Dr Manmohan Singh ji and Smt Sonia Gandhi ji who brought this transformative scheme to every village of India,” Venugopal added.Enacted in 2005, MGNREGA is a flagship rural employment programme that guarantees at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to rural households whose adult members undertake unskilled manual work.",Cabinet on Friday cleared a Bill to rename the scheme as ‘Pujya Bapu Grameen Rozgar Yojna’ and increase the guaranteed number of workdays from the current 100 to 125 days.

Rahul Gandhi Demands Unified National Response As Parliament Debates India’s Air Pollution Crisis

NEW DELHI: The air quality in Delhi sharply deteriorated to the ‘severe’ category on Saturday as a toxic greyish haze blanketed the city. The 24-hour average overall AQI released at 4pm was 431, as opposed to 349 a day earlier. However, the AQI subsequently slipped into the ‘severe plus’ category for the first time this year, reaching 452 at 8pm.This prompted CAQM to impose stringent measures under GRAP, first under stage 3 and then stage 4 as the air worsened, on the same day. No respite from hazardous air quality is expected on Sunday. Experts said the AQI spiked due to high emission loads and unfavourable meteorological conditions. The farm fire season is over, while an increase in moisture due to the formation of fog, calm winds, and inversion trapped the pollutants.Among the measures invoked are a ban on construction and demolition, no entry of non-essential trucks, hybrid mode for schools, and a ban on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles.The Delhi govt has directed that all govt and private offices operate at 50% strength, with the rest working from home. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed that the AQI rose rapidly on Saturday. It was 397 at 9am, in the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category, but reached the severe range at 10am at 401.According to the India Meteorological Department, the lowest visibility at Safdarjung, the city’s base station, was observed at 400 metres at 8am. It improved to 500 metres at 9.30am.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said, “As the atmospheric conditions are turning unfavourable with low wind speed and poor dispersion of pollutants, high emissions from local sources are getting trapped, spiking the peak levels.”CAQM said a feeble western disturbance is approaching north-west India, and the prevailing meteorological condition has marked a reduction in wind speed, at times becoming calm, a shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly, and an increase in moisture content in the lower atmosphere. “Such conditions during the winter season are conducive to the formation of smog,” it said.","The 24-hour average overall AQI released at 4pm was 431, as opposed to 349 a day earlier.

J&K LG hands over govt job letters to 39 terror victim families,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-lg-hands-over-govt-job-letters-to-39-terror-victim-families/articleshow/125951178.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakeeza Riyaz was still a minor when her father Riyaz Ahmad was abducted by terrorists in Anantnag and tortured to death in 1999. Her mother, unable to cope with the emotional and financial stress caused by loss of the family's sole breadwinner, remarried. Pakeeza was taken in by her grandparents who raised her despite their advancing age. On Saturday, Pakeeza's fortunes finally turned, thanks to J&K administration's decision to rehabilitate her with a govt job.Fozy Jan suffered similarly at the hands of terrorists when they forcibly entered her home in Qazigund, Anantnag in the year 2000 and took away her father and grandfather, only to kill them mercilessly shortly after. The loss of the two primary earning members pushed the family into a financial crisis. Twenty-five years later, she got closure with a govt job offer.Pakeeza and Fozy are two among the 39 next of kin of terror victims from Kashmir division of J&K, to be handed over appointment letters by J&K LG Manoj Sinha, ending their families' wait of more than two decades to be recognised and rehabilitated.Sinha said the move is part of the J&K administration's resolve to deliver justice, jobs and dignity to families torn apart as terrorists tortured and killed their loved ones.The families had to undergo years of hardship and emotional trauma, given that they were left to fend for themselves even as overground workers who aided terrorists were given govt jobs by the previous regimes.""For these families, the long wait for justice has ended today. With concrete steps for rehabilitation, we have restored their dignity and faith in the system,” LG Sinha said after distributing the appointment letters to the next-of-kin of terror victims.Both Shaista of Hyderpora, Srinagar, whose father Abdul Rashid Ganai was murdered in 2000, and Ishtiyaq Ahmad, the son of BSF braveheart Altaf Hussain who was martyred in a terrorist encounter 19 years ago, were handed appointment letters, ending their long battle for justice and bringing them economic stability.Justice was granted thirty years later to the family of Abdul Aziz Dar, a resident of Srinagar who was murdered by terrorists. The family of Late Abdul Rehman Lone, a special police officer (SPO) who was killed in 1999 inside his house, also had balm applied to their 26-year wound. Abdul's brother Md Ashraf Lone, who was forced to abandon studies and work as a labourer to sustain the family, will now lead a life of dignity as a govt employee.Irshad Ahmad Sofi, also an SPO, was killed by terrorists in 1999 at his residence in Bijbehara. He was ""punished"" by them for doing his duty by joining counter-terrorism operations. On Saturday, his sibling Irshad, who had to do odd jobs to make ends meet, was handed over an appointment letter.LG Sinha said that after the Abrogation of Article 370, the terror victim families have found new courage and self-confidence, and now they are speaking out against the terror ecosystem without fear.“For generations, the system had failed these victims by not giving their cases the priority they deserved. We are empowering victim's voices and ensuring they get their dues and rights they deserve. We are also committed for swift and fair justice to perpetrators,” he said.Sinha said that the Narendra Modi govt follows a zero-tolerance policy against terrorism in all its forms. ""Every available resource and means will be used to make J&K terrorism-free and those who are giving sanctuary, safe-haven or any other support to terrorists will have to pay a very heavy price,” he underlined.Appointment letters were handed over on Saturday to 39 other beneficiaries under the compassionate appointment rules and rehabilitation assistance scheme (RAS).As many as 156 family members of terror victims have been provided self-employment opportunities under various schemes, including Mission Yuva, Holistic Agriculture Development Program (HADP) and Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP). Furthermore, 17 encroachments were removed from the properties belonging to terror victim families.Also, 36 terror victim families have been identified for house reconstruction. More families will be identified and included as the process continues. The reconstruction work for the houses of the families whose homes were destroyed due to Pakistani shelling in Uri and Karnah will commence in April.","Pakeeza Riyaz was still a minor when her father Riyaz Ahmad was abducted by terrorists in Anantnag and tortured to death in 1999.

Mass visa chaos: H-1B families stranded in India for months after US consulates cancel interviews,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mass-visa-chaos-h-1b-families-stranded-in-india-for-months-after-us-consulates-cancel-interviews/articleshow/125910898.cms,"Trump’s Massive Visa Crackdown: 85,000 Cancellations and Social-Media Scrutiny Hit Indians

Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children, are stranded in India. In some cases, families have been separated, with some members in the US and those in India facing an endless delay to fly back.The uproar is loud; the anguish is palpable across social-media posts and WhatsApp groups. Jobs may no longer exist, schools stand disrupted, children have been torn from their parents…As TOI reported in its edition of December 10, US consulates have cancelled interview slots scheduled for mid- to late-Dec 2025. Many appointments have been pushed to March next year, and some even as far back as June 2026. This sweeping disruption followed a new US Department of State (DoS) policy requiring mandatory social-media screening for all H-1B and H-4 applicants from Dec 15. The additional vetting has sharply reduced the number of interviews that can be conducted each day, triggering mass cancellations.The US Embassy in India posted on X: “If you have received an email advising that your visa appointment has been rescheduled, Mission India looks forward to assisting you on your new appointment date. Arriving on your previously scheduled appointment date will result in your being denied.”The responses reflect the crisis families are facing. One user pleaded: “Please consider those who travelled to India before the appointment changes. We are stuck here, facing serious challenges related to employment and our US-citizen kids' education. We humbly request earlier consular appointments.”Another wrote: ""Booked my H-1B visa slot in Sept after weeks of trying. My Dec 18 appointment was suddenly moved to Mar 30, 2026. We must return to the US in early Jan and my US-citizen kids need to go back to school. Requesting urgent help.""Rajiv S. Khanna, lmanaging attorney at Immigration.com, describes the situation as “brutal chaos”. He notes that while applicants may reschedule online if they cannot attend the new date, they get only one such opportunity — and fee receipts older than a year are treated as expired.Immigration attorney Ellen Freeman warns that many H-1B workers will now lose their jobs. “We have to plead with employers to let them work from India or take prolonged leave of absence for as many as five months. In this economic environment and with deliverables pressure, many employers will not be able to wait.”She points out to the real-world fallout: “People left their apartment leases, utility bills, car payments in the US. These prolonged delays will have a devastating effect on our communities and economy. There are human stories behind each visa cancellation…”Rahul Reddy, founding partner at Reddy, Neumann, Brown, cautions against holiday travel for anyone who needs visa stamping. In his blog, he warns that travellers risk being stranded abroad for four to six months. “Employers cannot keep an H-1B role vacant for half a year. Many cannot legally allow remote work from outside the US due to export-control, payroll and tax restrictions. This means one thing: if an H-1B worker travels now, they may return not to their job but to unemployment. H-4 spouses and children will face the same delays, leading to extended separations and tremendous stress.”Calling the policy shift “poorly planned” and “poorly implemented”, he adds: “You cannot claim to support legal immigration while blindsiding H-1B families with six-month delays. Labelling this as ‘operational necessity’ does not change the truth: this process reflects a lack of preparation, transparency, and foresight. Enhanced vetting is fine but rolling it out in a way that effectively shuts down consular processing is reckless. Routine visa renewals should not turn into half-year exiles.”","Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children, are stranded in India.

'Warm And Engaging': PM Modi Holds Phone Call With Trump Amid Trade Talks, US-India Ties Discussed

PM-Trump call signals greater India-US willingness to engage

NEW DELHI: Amidst ongoing efforts by India and the US to finalise a bilateral trade deal, PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation while also discussing regional and global issues.The conversation came within a week of Modi's summit with Russian President Putin and in the middle of renewed efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war on the back of Trump's peace plan.The two sides are looking to arrive at a common understanding on issues amid indications that US is still seeking access for its farm products like corn and soybean, among other issues. The two sides have been in talks for a bilateral trade pact since March.""Had very warm and engaging conversation with President Trump. We reviewed progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments. India and the US will continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity,"" Modi posted on X.PM Modi is learnt to have reiterated India's position that it will support all international efforts for peace.""Modi and Trump reviewed the steady progress in India-US bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments,"" said an Indian readout. This was the first conversation between the two since they had a call days after Diwali.Thursday's telephonic conversation signals a greater willingness on both sides to engage as there has been progress in most areas, barring trade, for which Trump has imposed 50% import duty on Indian products, comprising 25% reciprocal tariff and another 25% secondary tariffs for purchasing Russian oil and defence equipment.The move has hit several Indian exports, including textiles, leather, gems and jewellery and shrimps. While negotiators from the two sides have been engaging in a dialogue to resolve the issue, the Trump administration is yet to ease the tariffs, despite an acknowledgment by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that the offer on the table is the best received so far.The conversation follows recent efforts by both sides to revive bilateral engagements after the trade-related impasse. US also joined India and other Quad nations in condemning the Red Fort terror incident in a Quad counter-terrorism dialogue. Both sides also separately held their own terrorism dialogue.India and US held foreign office consultations this week with a focus on key bilateral issues, including trade and investment, defence, the TRUST initiative for cooperation in critical technologies, energy, including civil nuclear collaboration, and critical minerals.According to US, the meeting was an opportunity to translate President Trump and PM Modi's vision from their Feb meeting this year into ""concrete progress that enhances US security, jobs and competitiveness, while supporting India's long-term goals"".""The Under Secretary emphasised US' aim to deepen cooperation in defense, energy, technology, space, and trusted supply chains and the value of US-India cooperation that fuels US innovation while supporting India's rise as a global technology leader,"" a US embassy spokesperson said.While the US statement did not mention the Indo-Pacific, an Indian readout said that the discussions also covered regional and global developments of mutual interest, with both sides underscoring their shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.","PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation.

NEW DELHI: A court on Thursday granted 15 days' interim bail to northeast Delhi riots conspiracy accused Umar Khalid, allowing him to attend his sister's wedding later this month.Additional sessions judge Sameer Bajpai noted that Khalid had already spent five years and three months in custody since his arrest in Sept 2020 and that the plea was specifically tied to a personal and significant family occasion. ""Considering the fact that the marriage is of the real sister of the applicant, the application is allowed and the applicant is granted interim bail,"" the court said.It added that the interim relief would remain effective from Dec 16 to 29. The former JNU student will be released on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 20,000 along with two sureties of the same amount. The court also emphasised that the interim bail was being granted within a limited and clearly defined timeframe.The court observed that the temporary release would also allow Khalid to briefly reunite with his parents, besides with his elder sister and her children, who stayed abroad and were expected to attend the wedding.The order, however, imposed several conditions. Khalid has been specifically barred from contacting any witness connected with the case, from using social media in any form and from travelling to any place other than visits to his parents and immediate close relatives.Opposing the plea, the prosecution argued that ""considering the act of the applicant, they do not deserve any relief"". It also pointed out that the actual ceremonies were scheduled only between Dec 25 and 27, lasting ""three days"", and questioned the necessity of granting a 15-day relief. The court, however, proceeded to allow the full period sought by Khalid.This is not the first instance in which the former JNU scholar has received limited-duration bail for family functions. Last Dec, he was granted interim bail for seven days to attend a wedding in his family. In 2022, he was similarly granted a week-long release for his sister's marriage.Khalid's main bail plea, along with those filed by co-accused Sharjeel Imam, Gulfisha Fatima and others in the larger conspiracy case, is pending before Supreme Court.

What is Paige Shiver’s Net Worth?

Her name is linked to former coach Sherrone Moore's firing and police detainment due to alleged inappropriate relationship rumors. Shiver's recent significant salary increase and social media silence have fueled speculation amid the ongoing investigation.

Paige Shiver’s rising salary, estimated net worth, and why the timing has fueled public curiosity

The University of Michigan football program is facing its most turbulent moment in years, and at the center of the storm is executive assistant Paige Shiver, an employee who until recently maintained a low public profile. Interest around Shiver has surged after her name became entangled in online speculation connected to the firing and police detainment of former head coach Sherrone Moore.While no university official has identified the staff member involved in the alleged inappropriate relationship, searches such as “Sherrone Moore assistant” and “who did Sherrone Moore have a relationship with” have driven Shiver into the national spotlight. Paige's sudden social media silence and a significant salary increase have added new layers to a story that continues to unfold.Public payroll filings show that Paige Shiver’s salary held steady at $58,025 for two years before climbing to $90,000 for the 2024–25 fiscal cycle, a 55.11% jump that many observers viewed as unusually steep for an executive assistant role. Based on Paige's salary history, limited public records, and the absence of additional disclosed income streams, Shiver’s estimated net worth likely falls in the $150,000 to $200,000 range.As online rumors intensified, Shiver reportedly “switched her Instagram account to private,” a move that social media users interpreted as a sign of the pressure surrounding her. Yet there is no confirmed link between the pay hike and the university’s investigation, and officials have not named her in any formal capacity. Still, the scrutiny grew louder as Sherrone Moore’s professional downfall accelerated.Sherrone Moore, who became a rising coaching star after stepping in during Jim Harbaugh’s suspension and later leading Michigan to major wins, was abruptly dismissed after allegations surfaced of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.“Ex-Michigan coach Sherrone Moore was detained by police in Saline, Mich. this evening and turned over to police in Pittsfield Township for investigation into potential charges,” according to ESPN’s Pete Thamel via Dan Wetzel..With Biff Poggi appointed interim head coach and speculation swirling around the future of the Wolverines’ program, Paige Shiver’s name remains tied to one of the most chaotic weeks in Michigan football history, even as the facts remain unsettled and the investigation ongoing.Also Read: Why Sherrone Moore ended up in police custody amid Michigan firing him for alleged ‘inappropriate relationship’ scandal",Paige Shiver is an executive assistant at the University of Michigan.

How Triple H and Stephanie McMahon accumulated long-term financial strength through wrestling, leadership and corporate expansion

Why their legacy still guides WWE’s future identity

As members of the WWE corporate leadership team and creative team members, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon are important to both the WWE corporate and creative ecosystems. The estimated net worth of Triple H is approximately $250 million, while the estimated net worth of Stephanie McMahon is approximately $250 million.Therefore, the combined estimated value of both Triple H and Stephanie McMahon in 2025 will be approximately $500 million based on the long-term growth of their respective equity interests, as well as the decades they have each spent with WWE.Triple H’s career rarely moved in a straight line, because his shift from performer to executive created a layered income structure through royalties, contract earnings and high-ranking corporate roles. His long involvement in creative planning continues to generate value as global media rights expand and the talent pipelines he built remain central to WWE’s structure.Stephanie McMahon followed a different path, leading branding initiatives, community programmes and global partnerships while earning multi-million-dollar compensation packages across several executive cycles. WWE's merger with Endeavor has provided additional value for its shareholdings as a result of increased activity in the marketplace and the evolution of entertainment entities to include more entertainment-based revenue streams.Due to this growth, WWE and Endeavor's financial momentum have developed over time as a result of the company being able to create global brands and have a consistent presence in the evolution of WWE from within its Entertainment Model.Through WWE Television and Digital showcases, Triple H's fingerprints remain very evident. Many of the strategies that he created while heading up NXT are still being utilized in the creation of talent presentation, match structure, and long-term development of characters for the roster of talent on the main roster.The vision of talent recruitment created by Stephanie McMahon will shape the future stories of multiple main event talents, providing WWE with a solid foundation for character development and storytelling. The previous work of Stephanie McMahon will continue to strengthen WWE's public image and brand as a result of the partnerships, digital initiatives and outreach programs she helped create before transitioning out of day-to-day responsibilities.The combination of Triple H and Stephanie McMahon is now being viewed as a creative foundation and business guideline for the future growth of WWE under TKO and the ongoing economic security that both Stephanie McMahon and Triple H represent.Also Read: WWE in big trouble?

LUCKNOW: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday launched a major crackdown across three states—Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Gujarat—hours after registering an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) against 67 accused in the state’s largest codeine-based cough syrup diversion and trafficking racket.Acting on the ECIR filed by its Lucknow zonal office, ED teams, accompanied by central paramilitary forces, carried out coordinated searches at 25 locations. The raids spanned factories, warehouses, and residences linked to arrested accused and their associates.In Uttar Pradesh, premises in Lucknow, Saharanpur, Varanasi, and Ghaziabad were searched, while parallel operations were executed in Ranchi (Jharkhand) and Ahmedabad (Gujarat)—regions identified as hubs for the illegal manufacturing, bottling, and diversion of codeine-based syrups.Officials said the money-laundering probe marks the beginning of a full-fledged financial investigation into the racket, which allegedly generated crores through illegal sale, forged stock entries, fake billing, and benami distribution chains. The ECIR, ED’s internal equivalent of an FIR, empowers the agency to summon suspects, freeze bank accounts, seize digital evidence, and attach properties acquired through illicit proceeds.Sources said the ECIR is based on 24 FIRs registered over the past year by UP Police, STF, and FSDA across districts including Lucknow, Chandauli, Varanasi, Ghaziabad, Sonbhadra, Sultanpur, Kanpur Nagar, Jaunpur, Bahraich, Bhadohi, and Ghazipur. These cases involve large-scale seizures of illegal or mislabelled codeine syrups, fake GST invoices, manipulated stock registers, unregistered transporters, and suspected covert manufacturing units.“Diversion of pharmaceutical consignments to unlicensed markets and cash-based interstate networks indicated layered laundering,” an official said. Investigators have also flagged the use of shell firms, informal cash channels, and benami entities.ED has sought complete case files, bank statements, GST records, ITRs, and property documents of all accused from UP Police, and has begun mapping the financial and logistical chain—transporters, warehouses, pharma distributors, and cash handlers.The alleged kingpin, Shubham Jaiswal, was issued a notice to appear before ED in Lucknow on December 8, 2025. But he did not now. More summonses are expected as the financial probe widens.“This case involves diversion of pharmaceutical stock, illegal manufacturing, smuggling routes, and laundering of profits. The financial network is as critical as the criminal one,” an officer said.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday launched a major crackdown across three states.

Months-long hunt ends: Leopard roaming Pune airport finally captured,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/months-long-hunt-ends-leopard-roaming-pune-airport-finally-captured/articleshow/125927981.cms,"PUNE: After months of remaining elusive, the fully grown male leopard, which was sighted multiple times at the Pune airport since April this year, was finally caught in the wee hours of Friday by a joint team of forest department and RESQCT members.Forest officials said that the carefully planned operation was assisted by the personnel of the Indian Air Force (IAF). The leopard had been moving on the airside of the airport which is managed and maintained by the IAF.The presence of the leopard was first confirmed on April 28. Over the following months, the animal utilised an extensive network of underground tunnels, dense vegetation and low-footfall zones within the airport premises to move in and out of the area. Given the vast and sensitive nature of the airport landscape, capture efforts posed significant operational and safety challenges. Continuous monitoring was undertaken using camera traps, live cameras and trap cages, though the leopard consistently avoided entering cages.On December 4, monitoring confirmed that the leopard had entered the underground tunnel network. In response, tunnel exits were systematically closed and reinforced, additional live surveillance cameras were installed, and camera traps were repositioned to closely track the animal’s movement patterns within the confined space, officials said.Based on this data, a focused operation was planned on 11 December 2025 involving a 30-member team comprising personnel from the Forest Department, RESQ Charitable Trust and the Indian Air Force. The team executed a coordinated drive to guide the leopard into an approximately 80-foot tunnel, where a controlled chemical immobilisation could be attempted.Despite the highly constrained conditions underground, the leopard was successfully tranquilised by wildlife veterinarian Dr Gourav Mangla. The animal was then safely retrieved from the tunnel and transferred for veterinary observation.The leopard has since recovered well and is currently housed at the Transit Treatment Centre at Bavdhan, Pune, for further observation and assessment.Mahadev Mohite, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Pune Division, said, “This operation reflects strong inter-agency coordination and preparedness. The Forest Department, RESQ Charitable Trust, the Indian Air Force and airport authorities worked seamlessly over several months. Pune has demonstrated that it is equipped to respond to complex wildlife situations within highly sensitive urban and infrastructure settings. ”Neha Panchamiya, Founder and President, RESQ Charitable Trust, added, “Every wildlife capture situation is unique, and responses must be guided by strategy, timing and context rather than urgency alone. This operation shows that wise, measured decision-making, supported by data, technology and teamwork, leads to outcomes that prioritise both human safety and wildlife welfare.”","The presence of the leopard was first confirmed on April 28.

Jamie Dimon the CEO of America’s biggest banks JPMorgan and Chase has now warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation. This in turn is creating risks not only for the continent but also for the United States. As reported by Bloomberg, speaking at the Reagan National Defence Forum, Dimon said, “Europe has a real problem. They do some wonderful things on their safety nets. But they’ve driven business out, they’ve driven investment out, they’ve driven innovation out. It’s kind of coming back.”Along with this, Dimon has also cautioned that a fragmented Europe is one of the biggest challenges faced by the world. Earlier this year, in his annual shareholders letter, Dimon noted that Europe has “serious issues to fix.” While praising the creation of the euro and Europe’s pursuit of peace, Dimon warned that reduced military efforts and difficulties in reaching consensus within the European Union threaten the continent’s stability.“If they fragment, then you can say that America first will not be around anymore. It will hurt us more than anybody else because they are a major ally in every single way, including common values, which are really important,” he said, urging Washington to adopt a long-term strategy to strengthen Europe.“A weak Europe is bad for us.”The comments made by Dimon clings with recent announcement made by JPMorgan to funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next decade — $500 billion more than previously planned.The initiative will mainly focus on supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence and resilience and also frontier and strategic technologies.Along with this, JPMorgan will also invest up to $10 billion of its own capital to enable combines expand and innovate in strategic manufacturing.Separately, Dimon commended President Trump’s efforts to cut government bureaucracy. “There is no question that this administration is trying to bring an axe to some of the bureaucracy that held back America. That is a good thing and we can do it and still keep the world safe, for safe food and safe banks and all the stuff like that,” he said.","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation.

TCS HR chief Sudeep Kunnumal on layoffs in future





Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar has now informed that the state legislative council that around 376 employees of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were laid off at the company’s Pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year. The disclosure was made via a hand written reply during the Vidhan Parishad session, after concerns were raised by members over reports of widespread layoffs in the IT sector.Fundkar further clarified that the layoffs were not linked to artificial intelligence or automation, addressing speculation that job losses were part of a broader restructuring driven by new technologies. In the Vidhan Parishad, Fundkar revealed that the company fired 376 employees from its Pune campus and the round of layoffs mainly impacted middle and senior-level managers.As reported by new agency PTI, during the Question Hour, the legislators including Uma Khare and Prasad Lad raised questions about increasing job losses in the technology sector and the impact of AI adoption on employment. The reply by the minister is sought to provide transparency by citing official data received directly from TCS.The Maharashtra government also stressed in the fact that while the layoffs have occurred, they are not on the scale suggested by media reports of mass layoffs across multiple cities.The minister further assured the council that the government is monitoring developments in the IT sector closely, given its importance to employment and state’s economy.Recently, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant. Speaking during the company’s Q2 earnings call earlier this month, Kunnumal said that TCS is not “chasing a target” when it comes to job cuts. Instead, the IT firm said it will evaluate “everyone”.During the earnings call, analyst Surendra Goyal from Citi asked: “The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal replied to the question saying: “So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition. So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”",Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) laid off 376 employees from its Pune campus.

"20 states file lawsuit against US government on $100,000 H-1B visa fee; say: No presidential administration can rewrite …",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/20-states-file-lawsuit-against-us-government-on-100000-h-1b-visa-fee-say-no-presidential-administration-can-rewrite-/articleshow/125954103.cms,"“unprecedented”

“No presidential administration can rewrite immigration law. No president can ignore the coequal branch of government of Congress, ignore the Constitution, or ignore the law.”

What White House said about the H1B lawsuit

“a necessary, initial, incremental step towards necessary reforms to the H-1B program. President Trump promised to put American workers first, and his commonsense action on H-1B visas does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas.”





The US government is facing a new ‘problem’ over the H-1B visa fee, that was implemented a few months ago. California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he, along with 19 other US states, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's policy of hiking the fee on new H-1B visa petitions to an$100,000. Bonta argued that the increased costs for the skilled-worker visa are illegal because they surpass what Congress approved and run counter to the intent of the program.Bonta said in a press conference in San Francisco (as reported by Politico).=Major technology companies are among the biggest users of the H-1B visas to import high-skilled overseas employees. Critics have slammed the firms for using the program to hire cheaper labour rather than American workers. However, Bonta said the fees will exacerbate labor shortages across key sectors of the state economy by making it more difficult to fill positions for doctors, researchers, teachers, nurses, and public service workers.He also expressed concern that the $100,000 payout, issued by US President Donald Trump through a presidential proclamation in September, would be used selectively at the discretion of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.High-skilled immigration and H-1B visas have been a contentious topic among different groups, as many argue that these can help bring in more global talent into the tech fields.The president's stance on the policy has changed since its release, particularly after he began building closer relationships with top tech industry executives whose companies rely on the H-1B program.In an interaction last month with Fox News host Laura Ingraham on H-1B visas, he said the country has abundant talent. He added that the nation still needs to bring in labourers for some specialised areas.In a statement, responding to Politico about the lawsuit, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers defended the government’s actions. He said that the visa fee hike was not only lawful butEarlier this year, the US Chamber of Commerce, joined by research universities, filed a lawsuit against the new H-1B fee, arguing that the administration overrode the provisions of the law governing the program.Another was filed on behalf of various groups including labour unions. This latest suit will be filed in Massachusetts federal court and will be spearheaded by California Attorney General Bonta and Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell.","California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he, along with 19 other US states, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's policy of hiking the fee on new H-1B visa petitions to an$100,000.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals.

UAE poised to make lunar history with Rashid Rover 2 mission to Moon’s far side,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-poised-to-make-lunar-history-with-rashid-rover-2-mission-to-moons-far-side/articleshow/125926325.cms,"The UAE’s Rashid Rover 2, launching in 2026, will explore the Moon’s far side/Image: X

Rover ready for launch

Far side exploration



Learning from the first attempt



Arab space milestones



Looking ahead







The UAE is moving forward for its historic moment of space exploration. Rashid Rover 2, the country’s second lunar rover, has passed an important round of tests in the US. These checks mean it’s now one step closer to heading to the Moon’s far side in 2026, riding aboard Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 2 lander.Before leaving the UAE, Rashid Rover 2 went through thorough environmental and functional checks. In the US, engineers worked with Firefly Aerospace to see how it interacts with the lander. They tested the rover’s electrical systems, software, and mechanical parts. Wireless communication between the rover and lander was also checked. Finally, they ran deployment and drive off simulations to make sure the rover can safely move around once it reaches the Moon.Salem Al Marri, head of the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre, said all tests were successful and confirmed the rover is ready. Dr Hamad AlMarzooqi, project manager for the mission, highlighted that the work with Firefly is focused on precision and reliability, reflecting the UAE’s larger goals in space exploration.Rashid Rover 2 will explore the Moon’s far side, the part that never faces Earth. The terrain there is rough and the crust is thicker than on the near side.The rover is equipped with cameras and scientific tools to study the Moon’s surface temperature, soil, plasma environment, and photoelectron sheath.This data will help plan future lunar missions and could guide the use of lunar resources.The mission is also international. The rover will carry instruments from Australia, NASA, and the European Space Agency. Farah Zuberi from Firefly Aerospace said the successful testing brings the mission closer to deployment and will provide new insights into this mysterious region of the Moon.Rashid Rover 2 is the UAE’s second attempt at a lunar landing. The first, Rashid Rover 1, launched in December 2022, was lost in April 2023 when the Japanese lander it was riding, Hakuto R Mission 1, crashed. This second attempt builds on those lessons and aims to succeed where the first one failed.The UAE’s lunar mission is happening alongside another milestone. The first joint Arab satellite, 813, launched from China this week. The 260 kilogram satellite is for Earth observation and was developed by engineers from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Sudan, Kuwait, Oman, and Lebanon.The satellite’s name refers to 813 AD, when Baghdad’s House of Wisdom became a public academy. Salem Al Qubaisi, director general of the UAE Space Agency, said the project helps build research capabilities, train Arab talent in space science, and provide climate data for countries in the region.Rashid Rover 2 is scheduled to launch in early 2026 for a 10 day mission on the Moon’s far side. If all goes well, the UAE will become only the second nation to land there successfully. The rover’s work will provide valuable data for future missions and underline the UAE’s growing role in global space research.","Rashid Rover 2 is the UAE’s second attempt at a lunar landing.

Trump FREEZES Green Card, Citizenship Applications From THESE High-Risk Countries After DC Shooting

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled what he called the ""Trump Gold Card,"" announcing that people will be able to apply for Gold Card citizenship starting Wednesday afternoon.In a post on Truth Social, Trump promoted the new immigration pathway, saying, ""THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT’S TRUMP GOLD CARD IS HERE TODAY! A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!""Speaking further about the initiative, Trump said, ""Very excitingly for me and for the country, we've just launched the Trump Gold Card. The site goes up in about 30 minutes, and all funds go to the United States government... It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card. Companies will be able to go to any school, buy a card, and keep that person in the United States... It's a gift to get somebody great coming into our country, because we think there will be some tremendous people who otherwise wouldn't have been allowed to stay.They graduate from college, they have to go back to India or China or France... The companies will be very happy. I know Apple is going to be happy. Nobody talked to me more about it than Tim Cook. He said it's a real problem. And it's not going to be a problem anymore... The other thing is it'll take in, we think, probably billions of dollars that will go to the Treasury of the United States... Many billions of dollars, even.""Trump has previously spoken about a Gold Card–style visa program designed to attract wealthy or highly skilled foreign nationals. The broader objective has been to bring top talent and significant foreign investment into the United States by offering a faster pathway to residency.While full details of the newly announced Gold Card are still unclear, earlier proposals included substantial financial thresholds: individual applicants were expected to donate $1 million to the US Treasury, and corporate-sponsored applicants needed to contribute $2 million, in addition to a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee.A third tier, the Platinum Card, had also been proposed, allowing an individual to spend up to 270 days a year in the US without becoming subject to US tax on foreign income, in exchange for $5 million. It remains unclear whether this tier is part of the current rollout.The website clarifies that simply having the money does not guarantee entry into the US, a point that had been less explicit in earlier announcements. Applicants must still qualify for permanent residency, be legally admissible, and have an available visa slot.Under US immigration rules, Gold Card holders will effectively fall under the EB-1 or EB-2 categories. These visas are typically meant for individuals with “extraordinary ability,” including top researchers, distinguished professors, accomplished artists and leading business figures, and they provide a route to permanent residency and eventual citizenship.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled what he called the ""Trump Gold Card"" Trump has previously spoken about a Gold Card–style visa program designed to attract wealthy or highly skilled foreign nationals.

Dem states sue over $100k H-1B fee as MAGA fumes over jobs flight to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dem-states-sue-over-100k-h-1b-fee-as-maga-fumes-over-jobs-flight-to-india/articleshow/125951509.cms,".

The TOI correspondent from Washington:





A coalition of 20 US states led by Democratic attorneys general filed a federal lawsuit Friday challenging the Trump administration’s controversial $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications, claiming the policy exceeds presidential authority and threatens US labor markets and critical services.The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts and spearheaded by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, argues that the fee far surpasses what federal law allows and was implemented without proper legal procedures. Traditionally, employers pay between roughly $960 and $7,600 in combined regulatory and statutory fees for H-1B petitions; the new six-figure surcharge represents an unprecedented jump.Democratic officials contend that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lacked authority to impose such a steep fee without congressional approval and bypassed required notice-and-comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act. They assert that the fee will dampen employers’ ability to hire skilled foreign professionals US industries rely on — particularly in tech, healthcare, research and education.State attorneys general emphasized the practical impacts of the rule, warning that schools, universities, hospitals and research institutions could struggle to fill specialized positions. Maryland’s AG noted teacher and researcher shortages, while Oregon and Vermont officials highlighted risks to local economies and public services that depend on H-1B workers, some 70 percent of whom are from India. Proponents of the fee say it is intended to curb perceived abuses of the H-1B system and protect US jobs. But Democratic critics counter that the policy will worsen labor shortages in critical sectors and undercut US competitiveness in science and technology.The states’ lawsuit adds to a broader legal and political battle over the H-1B system. In October, the US Chamber of Commerce and several industry groups also filed separate lawsuits alleging the fee is unlawful and threatens business investment and innovation.With hearings expected in coming weeks, the case is shaping up as a key test of executive authority over immigration policy — and of broader tensions between efforts to protect domestic labor and needs of a globalized economy reliant on high-skilled talent.","20 US states led by Democratic attorneys general filed a federal lawsuit Friday challenging the Trump administration’s controversial $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications.

Pakistan’s Asim Munir Threatens India With 'Severe Response' In First Speech After Becoming CDF





In a first since partition, a course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan, The Tribune reported. The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) has introduced the course, with Hindu mythologies like Mahabharat and Gita on the cards too.“People ask me why I’m learning Sanskrit. I tell them, why should we not learn it? It is the binding language of the entire region. Sanskrit grammarian Panini’s village was in this region. Much writing was done here during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Sanskrit is like a mountain--a cultural monument. We need to own it. It is ours too; it’s not tied to any one particular religion,” The Tribune quoted associate professor, Shahid Rasheed, who is at the heart of the initiative saying.“A significant collection of Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts were catalogued in the 1930s by scholar JCR Woolner, but no Pakistani academic has engaged with this collection since 1947. Only foreign researchers use it. Training scholars locally will change that,” the news outlet quoted the director of the Gurmani Centre, Ali Usman Qasmi, saying.“In 10-15 years, we could see Pakistan-based scholars of the Gita and the Mahabharata,” Qasmi added.The Sanskrit course began as a three-month weekend workshop only to eventually become a four-credit university course after it received an overwhelming response.“After we saw the response, we decided to introduce it as a proper university course. Even though the number of students is still small, we hope it will grow over the next few years. Ideally, by spring 2027, we should be able to teach the language as a year-long course,” the director said.","A course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan.
