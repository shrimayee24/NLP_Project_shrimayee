Candy or ayurvedic item? GST poser on Hajmola,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/candy-or-ayurvedic-item-gst-poser-on-hajmola/articleshow/120222514.cms,"NEW DELHI: The humble Hajmola is now facing GST scrutiny. Authorities approached Dabur , the company that manufactures it, raising questions over whether the product should be classified as a candy, which attracts 18% tax, or as an ayurvedic item, which faces a 12% levy.While the company could not be reached for comment, Dabur is learnt to have responded to the query from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence, arguing that it should be classified as an ayurvedic preparation and that it should not be treated as sugar-boiled candy.Sources said the issue had been dealt with in the past as well and there were court rulings that allowed Hajmola, a household name, to be treated as an ayurvedic product.The queries, which have the makings of a possible tax dispute, once again highlight the challenges faced by companies due to four-rate Goods and Services Tax structure.","Authorities approached Dabur over whether the product should be classified as a candy, which attracts 18% tax, or as an ayurvedic item, which faces a 12% levy.

Delhi weather today: IMD forecast more relief as city cools down after powerful thunderstorm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-weather-today-imd-forecast-more-relief-as-city-cools-down-after-powerful-thunderstorm/articleshow/120222002.cms,"Credit: Rajesh Mehta/TNN

NEW DELHI: IMD expects the relief from heat to continue on Saturday as well, after a powerful thunderstorm with winds touching 84 kmph hit Delhi on Friday evening, disrupting flights, traffic, and power supply while offering a sharp drop in temperature.The storm caused widespread disruption—grounding flights, toppling trees, cutting power lines, and jamming traffic across several parts of the capital. At the airport, 35 incoming flights were diverted and more than 100 others delayed as air traffic control halted operations for nearly 30 minutes.Roads were no better. Uprooted trees choked busy stretches like Mathura Road, Lodhi Road, Janakpuri, Okhla, Najafgarh and Dwarka, with vehicles damaged in some areas, including one incident in Janakpuri where a van was crushed by a fallen tree. NDMC and MCD received numerous complaints about trees being brought down across areas such as Jor Bagh, Hanuman Road, Mohan Singh Place, and Shahdara.Wind speeds varied across the city—touching 84 kmph in southwest Delhi, 74 kmph near IGI Airport, and 70 kmph at Pragati Maidan. Weather stations recorded light showers: 5mm in Narela and 2.5mm in Pitampura.The storm brought down the maximum temperature at Safdarjung from 39.6°C on Thursday to 35.8°C on Friday, while Lodhi Road saw a sharp dip from 31°C to 24°C in just 30 minutes post 6.15pm.According to IMD scientists, the thunderstorm was triggered by a western disturbance that caused dry mid-level winds to collide with moist lower-level winds from the Arabian Sea—a perfect recipe for thunderstorm formation.Power supply was hit in several areas after tree branches damaged power lines. BSES and Tata Power-DDL said their teams were deployed promptly to restore electricity, with some delays in areas like Narela, Bawana, Badli, and Mangolpuri due to safety concerns.In Gurgaon, a gantry on the Dwarka Expressway collapsed during the storm, landing on a moving car. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries or damage. The structure was quickly removed, and traffic has since resumed.","Thunderstorm with winds touching 84 kmph hit Delhi on Friday evening.

NEW DELHI: At a time when India is in talks with US for a trade deal, govt said it will not compromise on the country's interests because of deadline pressure to clinch FTAs.""We do not negotiate at gunpoint... until we are able to protect the interests of the country and people, it is never good to be hasty,"" commerce minister Piyush Goyal said. The comments came amid confirmation that US Vice-President J D Vance and wife Usha, and NSA Mike Waltz would visit Delhi, likely April 21.Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said that there was a lot of interest among trading partners to step up bilateral trade ties. The comments came amid confirmation that key members of Trump team - Vice-President J D Vance and national security adviser Mike Waltz - would visit Delhi.Although the visit of Vance and his Indian-origin wife Usha was planned a few weeks ago, his arrival, likely on April 21, has taken on a different dimension, given Trump's tariff offensive. India would expect Vance, though he is himself a tariff warrior, to smoothen the wrinkles which may be holding up progress in talks.While PM Modi is expected to host Vance and his family for a meal, his visit is said to be mainly private in nature. He's expected to visit Agra and Jaipur. Waltz, who will travel to India around the same time to participate in India-US Forum organised by Ananta Centre, is expected to hold talks with NSA Ajit Doval and foreign minister S Jaishankar. He's also likely to call on PM Modi.Secretary of state Marco Rubio and secretary of defence Pete Hegseth are also expected to travel to India in the next few months before the big visit by US President Donald Trump for Quad summit that India will host. Dates for the summit will be finalised after elections in Australia next month.Goyal said there have been 8 high-level delegation visits to India over the last two years.

"La Nina over, India unlikely to see drought or extreme rain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/la-nina-over-india-unlikely-to-see-drought-or-extreme-rain/articleshow/120221899.cms,"NEW DELHI: La Nina conditions in the Pacific Ocean that generally favour good monsoon rains in India have ended, the US govt agencies declared late Thursday, with the world’s largest ocean likely to stay in ‘neutral’ phase till winter. This could be good news for India’s monsoon, as it reduces the probability of drought or excess rainfall in the season, but it’s also likely to make monsoon forecasts trickier, experts said.Adding to the difficulty of forecasters, conditions in the Indian Ocean too are likely to be ‘neutral’ till at least Aug, as per the latest Australian weather bureau update. Along with the Pacific, surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean play a major role in India’s monsoon, with the ocean’s ‘positive’ phase — when waters in western Indian Ocean are warmer than those in the east — generally boosting rains.For the Pacific, the US’s Climate Prediction Center said in a release that there was more than a 50% chance that neutral conditions will stay till Sept. Its probability of persisting till the year-end was also higher than those of La Nina or El Nino, it said.If this forecast holds true, this would be the first time in 12 years that the monsoon peri od, or the months immediately preceding or following it, won’t have presence of either El Nino or La Nina. These two opposite Pacific Ocean conditions are seen as most important among large scale weather features that determine how much rain India gets during the June-Sept period.“When Pacific Ocean conditions are neutral, all scenarios are open for the Indian monsoon. However, the chances of a drought or a flood year are small. Generally, under neutral Pacific conditions, we don’t expect unwanted monsoon outcomes,” said M Rajee van, veteran meteorologist and former secretary of the Union earth sciences ministry.During neutral conditions in the Pacific, also known as ENSO neutral phase , surface water temperatures in the ocean’s eastern and central equatorial regions are neither abnormally warm (El Nino conditions, which weaken Indian monsoon) nor too cool (La Nina). While this is said to be the ocean’s natural state, neutral years aren’t that common.“Monsoon is more difficult to predict under such conditions. Forecasters have to be more careful and look closely into factors such as the state of the Atlantic Ocean. Internal dynamics can also play a role,” said Rajeevan, who is also IMD’s former monsoon forecaster.As per the first monsoon forecast this year, made by private agency Skymet, total monsoon rainfall in India is likely to be 103% of the long period average, at the higher end of the normal range.","La Nina conditions in the Pacific Ocean that generally favour good monsoon rains in India have ended.

Achieve a fair trade balance Protecting national interest

NEW DELHI: Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said that India would ""never negotiate at gunpoint"" after US President Donald Trump hit a 90-day pause period on tariff imposition on countries including India.""Trade talks proceed when both sides are sensitive to each other's concerns and requirements. All our trade talks are progressing well, in the spirit of India First, and to ensure our pathway to Viksit Bharat @ 2047 in the Amrit Kaal,"" Goyal said speaking on the sidelines of the Italy-India business, science and technology forum.""We never negotiate at gunpoint. Favourable time constraints motivate us for quicker talks, but till the time we are not able to secure the interest of our country and our people, we do not hurry,"" he added.Donald Trump had, on Wednesday, announced a 90-day pause period on tariff imposition including 26% on India, except China.""Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers , Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" Trump had declared.""Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the USA., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,"" he said, exempting China from the pause period.Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar remarked that India's trade negotiations were quite complex, noting that the United States had high expectations and the global environment has changed significantly compared to a year ago.""This time around, we are certainly geared up for a very high degree of urgency. I mean, we see a window. We want to see stuff. So our trade deals are really challenging. And we are really, when I look at the trade deals, I mean it's not my direct credit, but we have a lot to do with each other. I mean, these are people very much on top of their game, very ambitious about what they want to achieve,"" he said.""We talked for four years during the first Trump administration. They have their view of us, and frankly, we have our view of them. The bottom line is that they didn't get that. So if you look at the EU, often people say we've been negotiating for 30 years, which is not entirely true because we had big blocks of time and nobody was even talking to each other. But they have tended to be very protracted processes,"" he added.India is taking a measured approach to the matter, with the government actively pursuing the US-India trade agreement that was announced during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States earlier this year. While the 26% tariff imposed on India is higher than what many experts expected, it remains lower than the rates imposed on other countries. For instance, China initially faced a combined tariff of 54% (20% plus a 34% discount), which has now been raised to 125% following its retaliatory actions."," commerce minister Piyush Goyal said that India would ""never negotiate at gunpoint"" Donald Trump had, on Wednesday, announced a 90-day pause period on tariff imposition including 26% on India, except China.

"Will trial be over in a year, asked Rana. Lawyers’ reply changed his demeanour",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-trial-be-over-in-a-year-asked-rana-lawyers-reply-changed-his-demeanour/articleshow/120222143.cms,"NEW DELHI: Worry seemed to flit across Tahawwur Rana’s face when he asked his legal counsels on Thursday night whether his trial would be over in a year or so and received “No” as a reply, sources said. They told him that just filing a chargesheet could consume a year, and that the entire trial, even a fast one, could take between five to 10 years.As he got a quick primer on the pace of the Indian legal system, Rana asked if he could plead the “Fifth”, to which his counsels said Indian laws also provide protection from “self-incrimination”, sources said. “Pleading the Fifth”, or invoking the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution, means refusing to answer questions or providing information that could incriminate oneself.Walking slowly in a brown jumpsuit with Crocs as footwear, wearing specta cles and a four-to-six-inch white beard, a fringe of white hair framing a balding scalp, Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security. His legal aid counsels (LACs) — advocates Piyush Sachdeva and Lakshya Dheer — were provided to him by Delhi State Legal Services Authority.Looking frail, tired, and jet-lagged, Rana displayed no other signs of anxiety during the court proceedings. However, the effects of age-related ailments were visible on the former Pakistan Army officer accused of a key role in the 26/ 11 Mumbai terror attacks. Rana suffers from various ailments, including abdominal, intestinal, and sinus cysts.According to sources, he came across as a “smart individual” who can strike up “casual conversations”. Rana was offered fruits by NIA personnel while waiting for court proceedings to begin, which he refused, but interacted “comfortably” with agency members. Sources said that Rana is being “taken good care of”. Govt and the agency want to make this case a “model one” so no one is going to take any chances, said sources.Rana’s major concern, apart from his claim that he is innocent and that extradition was not needed as he had already spent over a decade in jail and had been “acquitted” in the matter, was his medical care. On this, NIA assured the special judge that he would be provided all the medical care he needs. The question of “manhandling” also came up in the hearing, which was addressed by the court directing that Rana be medically examined every 48 hours.A US district court trial by jury had acquitted him on June 9, 2011 of conspiracy to provide material support to the Nov 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The LACs appearing for Rana urged the court to provide him with a “writing instrument” so that he can prepare his defence.The hearing for his re mand was over within 10-15 minutes at around 11pm on Thursday. However, the order was pronounced at around 2am Friday.The prosecution, led by senior advocate Dayan Krishnan and advocate Narender Mann, submitted before the court that Rana is the first accused to be arrested and has links with named terrorists and other accused persons in this case. The counsels appearing for NIA told the court that a detailed investigation is required, Rana has to be confronted with a lot of evidence, and his statements would lead to additional discoveries.The court granted NIA 18 days’ custody of Rana. The agency requested 20 days, expressing concern that Rana might orchestrate terror plots like 26/11 targeting additional Indian cities. The court stipulated several conditions, including permission to consult with his legal representative on alternate days. The court also specified that Rana could only use a soft-tip pen and must conduct meetings with his lawyer under NIA supervision and within hearing range.",Tahawwur Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security.

NEW DELHI: Is BJP planning Nitish Kumar 's 'honourable exit' from Bihar politics ? Is BJP looking to reposition him in a different role? As the NDA in Bihar gears up for year end elections speculations are rife that the BJP may stake claim to the top post in the state post elections and find another important role for Nitish Kumar. In such a scenario, Nitish Kumar's son, who has dropped hints for a political debut, may be accommodated at the sate level.It is in this light that senior BJP leader and former Union minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey floated a possible ""plan"" in place for a smooth transition of power.""It is my personal wish that he be made the deputy Prime Minister . If the wish is granted, Bihar will see the second son of its soil, after Babu Jagjivan Ram, rising to the office,"" Choubey, who was also once a minister in Nitish's cabinet, said.""Nitish Kumar's contribution to the NDA is tremendous. He has been strengthening the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi by playing the role of an anchor in the coalition,"" he added.Political analyst Kumar Vijay while speaking to TOI.com said that BJP is likely to remove Nitish from the chief ministerial post in Bihar and relocate him in the central cabinet or any other constitutional post.""Now, BJP wants to dominate the politics of Bihar and become a senior partner in the alliance. It is very likely that BJP will give Nitish Kumar an 'honourable exit' from Bihar by placing him in the central cabinet,"" Vijay said.He further said that the ""BJP would attempt to maintain its alliance with the JD(U) by offering Nitish Kumar's son, Nishant, the position of deputy chief minister.""Ashwini Choubey's proposition was, however, quickly snubbed by the JD(U) which cited Union minister Amit Shah 's earlier remark and reiterated that ""all NDA partners acknowledge the chief minister as the coalition's leader for the upcoming assembly polls"".""We have nothing to do with who says what.

Annamalai's comment on Jayalalithaa and BJP-AIADMK breakup

NEW DELHI: One has a past with AIADMK, and the other made a contentious remark on Jayalalithaa. For Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to take on its biggest critique - Tamil Nadu's ruling government DMK - it needed a working regional alliance with AIADMK. And thus, Nainar Nagendran seems to be a fair choice.BJP on Friday announced its reunion with AIADMK for the upcoming 2026 assembly elections and Union home minister Amit Shah said that the NDA would contest under the leadership of Edappadi Palaniswami. This comes after EPS had declared that the DMK was his party’s ""sole enemy"" and expressed willingness to form alliances with any like-minded parties.The event was followed by Nainar Nagendran, who was formerly with AIADMK, submitting his nomination for Tamil Nadu BJP state president, a post previously held by K Annamalai.Annamalai made it clear that he was not in the race for the party's top post.""The nomination for the post of Tamil Nadu BJP State President has been received only from Mr @NainarBJP. As the Tamil Nadu BJP President, Mr @annamalai_k has made commendable achievements. Whether it is taking the policies of Prime Minister Mr @narendramodi to the people, or taking the party's projects village by village, Mr. Annamalai's contribution is immense. The BJP will utilize Mr Annamalai's organizational skills in the party's national structure,"" Amit Shah informed.Nainar Nagendran is a BJP legislator who represents Tirunelveli constituency in Tamil Nadu. He had already given a hint of the alliance earlier this year when he had said that ""there was no need to intimidate the AIADMK to get the party agree to an alliance with the BJP and a dialogue with EPS was enough for stitching an alliance with the AIADMK.''Annamalai, who was then the BJP president, had distanced himself from the statement and said that Nagendran's remarks were misinterpreted. He had later clarified his stance on the possibility of an alliance saying that he was ready to serve as a ""BJP cadre."" ""I have already said that I am even ready to work as a BJP cadre. I have not entered politics for power. I wanted to work for a better TN,'' he said.He served as a cabinet minister under AIADMK from 2001 to 2006, hence, he is well suited to be a bridge between the newly formed alliance.The freshly formed alliance, which would remain ""permanent and wouldn't change"" as assured by Amit Shah, has had its share of tumultuous past after the saffron party's outgoing chief Annamalai made a remark on late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa, that did not go down well with AIADMK.""It took time because this alliance is now permanent,"" Shah said on the question of delay in forming an alliance.The BJP and AIADMK were allies in the 2021 state elections, where the BJP secured four seats. However, tensions between the two parties arose after Annamalai made a contentious remark about the late AIADMK leader and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s conviction in a corruption case.Senior AIADMK leaders had criticized Annamalai for undermining the alliance’s spirit and not acknowledging the AIADMK’s leadership role within the state coalition.Amit Shah, however, this time, categorically said that the BJP wouldn't interfere in the internal matters of AIADMK. ""AIADMK has no conditions and demands... We will have no interference in the internal matters of the AIADMK. This alliance is going to be beneficial to both NDA and AIADMK,"" he said.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, both parties contested independently with separate alliances, which ultimately weakened their position, as the DMK-led coalition won all the seats in Tamil Nadu.","BJP on Friday announced its reunion with AIADMK for the upcoming 2026 assembly elections.

Amid the continuing grounding of 330 ‘Dhruv’ advanced light helicopters (ALHs) after a crash three months ago, which has hit operations in the armed forces, Hindustan Aeronautics on Friday publicly lashed out at some serving military officers, former pilots, “so-called defence analysts” and “armchair critics” for spreading “malicious” and “speculative” narratives on the indigenous 5.5-tonne chopper.“These stories are written without offering HAL’s perspective, and arguments are one-sided and biased. HAL would like to reiterate it’s working with all its customers including IAF and is confident of handling the critical issues that are innate to the defence aeronautics and com plex flying platforms,” the defence PSU said.Critics were quick to respond and demand complete transparency on flight safety issues. “The interests of your (HAL) stakeholders are best served if you welcome criticism, work with greater transparency, stop shooting messengers and hallucinating about malafide intent. Your worst critic is not your enemy; just as a sycophant is not your best friend.

Kerala HC ordered Friday a CBI investigation against CM Pinarayi Vijayan ’s chief principal secretary K M Abraham for allegedly amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income.Justice K Babu’s order came on a petition by activist Jomon Puthenpurackal, challenging the dismissal of his complaint against Abraham by the inquiry commissioner and special judge of Thiruvananthapuram.The court directed the SP of CBI’s Kochi unit to register an FIR against Abraham and the Vigilance and AntiCorruption Bureau (VACB) to hand over the case files to the central agency.Puthenpurackal’s petition alleged that between 2000 and 2015, Abraham acquired three properties –– an apartment in Mumbai valued at Rs 3 crore, another at Thycaud in Thiruvananthapuram worth Rs 1 crore, and a three-storey shopping complex at Kadappakkada in Kollam, estimated atRs 8 crore.Abraham, who is also CEO of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, was previously the state’s chiefsecretary.VACB’s preliminary report said it didn’t find sub stantive evidence to support the allegations. The special court accepted the bureau’s contention and dismissed the complaint against Abraham.HC found “prima facie evidence” suggesting Abraham had acquired assets disproportionate to his known sources of income. It noted that during the preliminary inquiry, the investigation officer deliberately excluded from consideration “a substantial immovable asset” acquired by Abraham by curtailing the check period.Given the fact that Abraham currently holds a cabinet-rank post as chief principal secretary to CM, to whom the directorate of vigilance reports, the court said a VACB investigation would not inspire confidence.To ensure a fair, independent and credible investigation — the court held the pribe must be conducted by CBI.","Kerala HC ordered Friday a CBI investigation against CM Pinarayi Vijayan ’s chief principal secretary K M Abraham.

NEW DELHI: The NIA team, led by the agency’s deputy inspector general Jaya Roy who is also the chief investigating officer in the Tahawwur Rana case , aims to extract information about his contacts and activities during his India visits, particularly between Nov 8 and Nov 21, 2008, and is likely to follow through any lead closely with various state Anti-Terrorism Squads (ATS) to take action based on Rana’s testimony.“Rana will remain in NIA custody for 18 days, during which time the agency will question him in detail in order to unravel the complete conspiracy behind the deadly 2008 attacks, in which 166 peo ple were killed and over 238 injured,” said a statement issued by the probe agency soon after the court’s order.Rana’s security during his remand as well as future judicial custody is the biggest challenge for the agency. He has been kept on “suicide watch” which requires him to be under 24/7 human and CCTV surveillance.Only a handful of officers, authorised by NIA chief Sadanand Date, are permitted inside his cell. Date, a Maharashtracadre IPS officer, was posted as additional commissioner of police in Mumbai during the 2008 attack and had received serious injuries fighting the terrorists.Special guards are keeping a watch on Rana on rotation basis and no conversation between them is permissible, a source said.

Rana was represented by Piyush Sachdeva, provided to him by Delhi Legal Services Authority. After the hearing, the court sent Rana to 18-day NIA custody.Rana's extradition process was nothing short of a nail-biter with fears of sabotage looming till the flight touched down at Palam airport's technical area. The home ministry and the office of NSA, along with Intelligence Bureau, constantly monitored the flight ferrying Rana, taking precautions to thwart any attempt to stop him from landing in the grasp of Indian agencies.Exercising utmost caution in extraditing Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a dummy code was generated for the chartered aircraft, a Gulfstream G550, ferrying him to India to avoid detection on public flight trackers and alleviate threats of an attack. The aircraft took off from Los Angeles in the early hours of Wednesday and landed in New Delhi around 6 pm, after a pit stop in Romania.Rana, along with his close school friend and fellow jihadi Daood Gilani aka David Coleman Headley, had left Mumbai on Nov 19, 2008, just a week before a gang of jihadi terrorists belonging to and motivated by LeT and trained by serving officers of Pakistan army landed on the Worli shore to carry out an attack in which 166 people were killed and which left the nation traumatised. The massacre marked the execution of a plan that Rana and Headley helped draw by selecting the targets to be struck.As Rana stepped on the tarmac in prison browns with NIA personnel clinging to him, he looked far from the unassuming businessman he had posed as when he checked into a Powai hotel in Mumbai in 2008. He had also visited Agra, Hapur, Kochi and other cities during this trip, supposedly to promote his immigration business, though NIA suspects the trips may have been a cover to scout for potential terror recruits for LeT.Rana, for long a strategic asset for Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistan's military intelligence complex, was placed under arrest at the airport, made to undergo a medical examination and whisked to court through a green corridor amid heavy security comprising a 20-vehicle cavalcade and SWAT commandos.On the plane back to India, Rana was seated in the middle with NSG commandos on all seats surrounding him, followed by senior NIA officials. Just after touchdown, the NIA acknowledged the assistance of US Sky Marshals who are assigned with secure transportation of federal prisoners, including inmate transfers via air.In a statement, the NIA termed Rana a key conspirator and confirmed his extradition. ""Rana was being held in judicial custody in the US pursuant to proceedings initiated under the India-US extradition treaty. The extradition finally came through after Rana exhausted all legal avenues to stay the move. The district court for the Central District of California had ordered his extradition on May 16, 2023. Rana then filed multiple litigations in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, all of which were rejected,"" it said.Extradition proceedings were initiated between the two countries after India eventually secured a surrender warrant for the wanted terrorist from the US govt.The extradition finally came through after Rana's various litigations and appeals, including an emergency application before the US Supreme Court, were rejected with the active assistance of the US department of justice's Office of International Affairs, US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, US Marshals Service, FBI's Legal Attache Office in New Delhi, and US department of state's Office of the Legal Adviser for Law Enforcement, the NIA said.For NIA investigators, the challenge will be to get Rana to reveal more than what he has already told US authorities. His interrogation will be aimed at getting to the bottom of the Mumbai attack conspiracy and exposing the role of Pakistan-based LeT masterminds like Hafiz Saeed, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and others in planning and remote-controlling one of the deadliest terror strikes against India.","Tahawwur Hussain Rana played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives.

CJI Dipak Misra: Singapore Supreme Court Quashes 'Copy-Pasted' Arbitration Award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/singapore-sc-quashes-ex-cji-dipak-misras-copy-pasted-arbitration-award/articleshow/120141717.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major embarrassment, Singapore Supreme Court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) set up to manage dedicated freight corridors in India after finding that the tribunal headed by retired CJI Dipak Misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties but on different issues.Though the tribunal also comprised MP HC ex-Chief Justice K K Lahoti and ex-CJ of J&K HC Gita Mittal, a Singapore SC bench led by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said since the other two were not part of the earlier awards, it couldn't be ascertained whether they were even aware of Misra's ""copy-paste"" job.The Singapore SC was firm that the copying compromised the integrity of the arbitration process and thus it did not adhere to the ""principles of natural justice"".The court said, ""The patently substantial material derived from parallel arbitrations were extraneous considerations that hadn't been raised to the parties' attention. The material formed such a pervasive part of the award that it simply could not be overlooked. It was plain that it was neither contemplated nor agreed to by the parties that the award could be prepared by such a process. We agree with the (Singapore HC) judge there had been a breach of the fair hearing rule.""By its award dated Nov 24, 2023, the Justice Misra-led tribunal had ruled in favour of the three firms which formed a consortium to bag the contract for Western Dedicated Freight Corridor in Aug 2015. A dispute arose because of the Indian govt's decision to raise labour wages, leading to the consortium demanding more money which was contested by the SPV, and the matter was referred to the Justice Misra-led arbitration tribunal.Upholding the Singapore HC's decision to set aside the award, Justices Menon and Steven Chong in a 40-page judgment analysed the award, found it plagued by copying and in breach of the principles of natural justice. The Justice Menon-led bench accepted the SPV's arguments and rejected those of the consortium.The SPV contended that Justice Misra, during the arbitration, had used extensive material derived from parallel arbitrations. ""It is also common ground that the award was not drafted afresh. Rather, the parallel awards were used as templates, with adjustments made to account for what were thought to be the specificities of the arbitration,"" the Singapore SC said.CJ Menon said the SPV had abandoned some of the submissions made in the parallel arbitrations and replaced these with new arguments unique to the arbitration at hand. ""These new arguments arose because of the slightly different factual matrix presented by the arbitration: for instance, the difference in the length of delay between the issuance of the notification and the consortium's claim allowed the SPV to make additional arguments on estoppel,"" he said.""Despite this, the parallel awards were used as templates in drafting the award to a very substantial degree. It is undisputed that at least 212 paragraphs from the parallel awards were retained in the 451-paragraph award. This has several implications,"" the Singapore SC said.""We also consider that the expectation of equality between the arbitrators was compromised. While, as we have noted, there is no evidence as to what transpired between the members of the tribunal, it is known that the two co-arbitrators in this case were not privy to the parallel arbitrations. They would thus have had no direct access to any material or knowledge derived from those proceedings, but which appeared to have significantly influenced the outcome of the present arbitration. The integrity of the arbitration was, therefore, further compromised as a result,"" it said.",Singapore Supreme Court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( SPV) The tribunal headed by retired CJI Dipak Misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties but on different issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120142141,imgsize-543479,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Meta confirms: ‘Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC…’

Jeff Bezos, former Google CEO and other tech moguls who have brought houses in Washington

Jeff Bezos purchased a $23 million Kalorama mansion in 2016.

Peter Thiel bought a $13 million beaux-arts residence in 2021.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

PayPal co-founder David Sacks, now a White House advisor, purchased a $10.3 million Northwest DC penthouse.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

In a sweeping crackdown on illegal gambling operations in US, a New Jersey councilman of Indian origin Anand Shah has been named among 39 individuals charged following a two-year investigation. The operation, authorities say, was tied to the Lucchese organized crime family and generated more than $3 million in unlawful proceeds.New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin announced the charges on Friday, identifying Shah—a councilmember in Prospect Park—and George Zappola, a senior member of the notorious Lucchese crime family , as central figures in the probe.""Organized crime in 2025 may look different than it did 50 years ago,"" Platkin was quoted saying by NYT during a press briefing, ""especially thanks to the online component, and some of the language may have changed, but it's the same old story: criminals motivated by greed and power who think they are above the law.""Shah is said to have played a key managerial role in overseeing illicit poker games and managing an online sportsbook. According to law enforcement officials, his political position was not implicated in the charges, but his alleged involvement in illegal activities has nonetheless cast a shadow over his public office.The investigation uncovered four illegal poker establishments in Totowa, Garfield, Woodland Park, and Paterson. The Paterson location reportedly housed gambling equipment, including poker tables and slot-style machines.Authorities say the operation relied on a network of front businesses to conceal gambling profits and maintain a façade of legitimacy. Supervisors assigned by senior operators collected fees from poker hosts and monitored the games, while also managing club staff.""Romanticized versions of organized crime have been the subject of countless movies and television shows, often set right here in the Garden State,"" Platkin remarked. ""But the reality isn’t romantic or cinematic. It’s about breaking the laws the rest of us follow.""Col. Pat Callahan, Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police , emphasized the scale of the operation, which involved cooperation between state and federal agencies. “Everyone’s got to be held accountable who thinks they are above the law,” he said.","New Jersey councilman of Indian origin Anand Shah has been named among 39 individuals charged following a two-year investigation.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach. It became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118066912,imgsize-31572,width-400,resizemode-4/118066912.jpg"

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

US judge clears path for immigrants' registration rule: DHS issues stern warning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-judge-clears-path-for-immigrants-registration-rule-dhs-issues-stern-warning-even-h-1bs-students-will-need-to-carry-documentation/articleshow/120213051.cms,"On or by April 11, 2025, the following will apply to all non-citizens, regardless of status (legal or undocumented):

Present in the US for 30 days or more as of April 11, 2025, without registration evidence: Register immediately. Entering on or after April 11, 2025, without registration evidence: Register within 30 days of arrival.

Turning 14 in the US: Re-register and submit fingerprints within 30 days of your 14th birthday, even if previously registered.

Parents or guardians of minors under 14: Register minors if they remain in the US for 30 days or longer.

Show me your papers! This ‘demand’ could well be the reality that any immigrant to the US – including those who are there legally on work or study visa could now face, anytime and anywhere.In a strongly worded statement, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has stated: “All non-citizens 18 and older must carry this documentation (aka - registration proof) at all times. This administration has directed DHS to prioritize enforcement, there will be no sanctuary for noncompliance.”A US district court judge has recently allowed the Trump administration to move forward with a contentious new rule requiring millions of immigrants to register with the federal government and carry documentation. The regulation, which comes into effect from April 11 – Friday, could have sweeping consequences for immigrants across the US.The registration requirement primarily impacts foreign nationals without lawful immigration status (illegal or undocumented immigrants). According to DHS, there were 2.20 lakh illegal immigrants from India as of 2022. Owing to differing calculation methods Pew Research Center pegs this number at a much higher figure of 7 lakh, whereas according to the Migration Policy Institute it is 3.75 lakh. This cohort of the Indian population would be impacted by the registration-ruleAccording to immigration attorneys, those who entered the US on a valid visa (be it a work , study, travel visa) or hold a green card, employment authorisation document (EAD), border crossing card or a I-94 admission record are considered already registered and should not be impacted by the new registration process.However, even such ‘already registered’ foreign nationals – such as those on an H-1B visa or even international students (a significant chunk of whom are Indians) will need to carry documentation with them round the clock. Their children will also need to re-register and submit fingerprints within 30 days of their 14th birthday, even if previously registered.Further, any change of address is required to be reported within ten days – if it is not done the individual can be subject to a fine of up to $ 5,000 and/or imprisonment of not more than 30 days. It could also jeopardise the ability to continue to remain in the US or re-enter after travel overseas (say back to India).In a press statement, Kristi Noem, Secretary, DHS, reminded all foreign nationals present in the US for longer than 30 days that the deadline to register under the Alien Registration Act is on April 11. This law requires all aliens in the United States for more than 30 days to register with the federal government. Failure to comply is a crime, punishable by fines, imprisonment, or both, added the press note.“President Trump and I have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now. If you leave now, you may have the opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American dream,” said Noem. “The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws—we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce. We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans,” she added.DHS has outlined the registration requirement. All those who are present in the US for 30 days or more as of April 11 (without registration evidence) are required to register immediately. Those entering the US on or after April 11 (without registration evidence) must register within 30 days of arrival. For those already considered as registered, children on turning 14 have to re-register. Parents have been asked to register minors if they remain in US for more than 30 days.On January 20, President Donald J Trump signed executive order ‘Protecting the American People Against Invasion’ and directed DHS to enforce the ‘long-ignored’ Alien Registration Act. Subsequently, the registration rule was introduced by the DHS and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on March 12 as an interim final rule.The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, the American Immigration Council and others had filed a lawsuit contending that the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act by bypassing public notice and comment procedures. They also warned of confusion and chaos stemming from the rule's implementation.However, the Trump administration cited a World War II-era statute as the legal basis for the rule, arguing that it simply enforces a longstanding requirement for all non-citizens in the US to register with the federal government, failing which they would be subject to fines and prosecution.Judge Trevor N McFadden, a Trump appointee, in his order dated April 10 (a copy of which is with TOI), rejected a request from several immigration advocacy groups to block the rule, concluding that the plaintiffs lacked the legal standing necessary to pursue their case.The fall out for the undocumented masses will be severe as registration would result in their coming on record, which in turn could lead to deportation.Compliance requirements (Source: DHS)","A US district court judge has recently allowed the Trump administration to move forward with a contentious new rule.

White House explains why Donald Trump's tariffs were 'necessary',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-explains-why-donald-trumps-tariffs-were-necessary/articleshow/120222161.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

The White House strongly defended President Donald Trump’s tariffs, saying that they were a long-overdue response to decades of economic policies that devastated American workers and hollowed out the country’s industrial base.In a detailed statement, the administration compared previous trade policies to “insanity,” suggesting it was irrational to continue down a path that had already led to soaring trade deficits and widespread job losses. “The trade policies of the past several decades have failed this nation, its workers, and our communities,” the statement read, recalling a 2005 New York Times editorial that warned of “dangerous deficits” when the monthly US trade deficit hit $58.3 billion.""It’s cliché, yet true — the definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and expecting a different result. The trade policies of the past several decades have failed this nation, its workers, and our communities,"" the statement read.Citing the remarks of former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, the statement said these persistent deficits helped trigger the Great Recession and have continued to erode America’s economic self-sufficiency. Since 1990, manufacturing jobs in New York have dropped by 59%, and by 35% in Ohio. “The loss of these jobs killed innocent Americans and destroyed towns,” the statement claimed, adding that job losses from bad trade deals have been linked to rising drug overdoses.Critics of Trump’s tariffs, particularly among liberal commentators, were called out in the White House statement for dismissing efforts to reshore American industry. CNN’s Nia Malika-Henderson was singled out for asking whether it was “worth it to upend the global economy for HVAC jobs,” to which the White House responded pointedly, “Apparently, Nia Malika-Henderson thinks preserving low-wage jobs in China is more important than creating high-wage jobs in America.”The statement listed a wave of recent investments from both US and international firms in American manufacturing as proof that Trump’s trade approach is yielding results. Companies including Nvidia, Apple, Novartis, TSMC, Hyundai, and Eli Lilly have all committed billions to new or expanded US-based facilities. These investments, the White House s, vaidalidate Trump’s strategy to restore domestic production and reduce dependence on foreign supply chains—a matter described as a “national security emergency.”Yet, Trump’s tariff strategy has not come without disruption. His sudden imposition—and equally abrupt suspension—of new global tariffs in April shocked financial markets and unsettled businesses. Since President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement last week, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF has fallen 5.2%. While Trump insisted the 90-day pause was part of a broader negotiation strategy, many saw it as a reaction to market turmoil and criticism from allies and corporate leaders.The initial tariff plan involved a 10% baseline duty on most imports, followed by higher “reciprocal” tariffs on countries with perceived unfair trade practices. China faced the harshest penalty, with tariffs raised to a staggering 145% after Beijing announced retaliatory measures.Despite the turbulence, the White House maintained that the transition is necessary. “There will be a transition cost and transition problems,” Trump had previously admitted, “but in the end it’s going to be a beautiful thing.”","The administration compared previous trade policies to “insanity,” suggesting it was irrational to continue down a path that had already led to soaring trade deficits and widespread job losses.

Ice stupas

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan.

Optimism laced with caution appears to be the prevailing sentiment across Bangladeshi news media following the landmark meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh , Muhammad Yunus. This comes at a time when there is no-real consensus about what exactly transpired in the meeting. The account provided by Yunus’s press secretary, Shafiqul Alam—particularly regarding Sheikh Hasina—has been contested by Indian sources.Significantly, this was the first summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government. Tensions had escalated in recent months between the neighbours who are bounded by deep historical ties. Most prominent news outlets in Bangladesh described the meeting, held on the sidelines of Bimstec in Bangkok, as a much-needed ice-breaker.went a step further, declaring it a diplomatic victory for Bangladesh. The paper emphasized that for eight months India had avoided high-level interactions with Dhaka and insisted that any talks must exclude discussions on Hasina. Therefore, the fact that a 40-minute meeting occurred in a third country was, in their view, a breakthrough. Another daily,said that getting this meeting done only adds to the aura of Nobel winning economist Muhammad Yunus.The 'sources' in India particularly took exception to remarks made by Yunus' press secretary Alam in a Facebook post, describing the claims made about the Bangkok meeting as 'mischievous' and 'politically motivated'. Alam alleged that Yunus requested Hasina’s extradition and that Modi’s response was 'not negative'. He even claimed Modi said, 'Regardless of what was actually said, the idea that Yunus directly brought up Hasina’s extradition dominated headlines on Saturday and became a recurring theme in Sunday’s editorials. It earned Yunus praise across media outlets of various ideological stripes. However, a caveat was frequently added: Hasina remains a potential stumbling block in the normalization of Indo-Bangla relations.featured a detailed front-page story quoting various foreign policy voices. The article began with the assertion that no real improvement in ties was possible without Hasina’s extradition. Former Dhaka University professor Shahiduzzaman warned of a long-drawn process, predicting that India would not hand over Hasina, while Bangladesh would refuse to honor what he called 'biased treaties' signed by her. He advocated exploring new trade relationships, including with Pakistan.In contrast, former envoy Mashfee Shams struck a more measured tone, expressing hope that relations could move beyond the Hasina factor. M Jashim Uddin, Director of the Centre for Peace Studies at North South University, described the meeting as a diplomatic win, arguing that India was forced to acknowledge Yunus's legitimacy.asserted that India was waiting for the next election to take a definitive stance regarding Bangladesh and that was hampering the normal flow of relationship. Dubbing the meeting as a diplomatic win, it hoped that India treats Bangladesh as an equal and claimed Yunus had clearly conveyed this expectation., the most famous newspaper of the country in its editorial rued the fact that there was no real discussion about pending water agreement and said that constant engagement is the need of the hour and one or two meetings wouldn't break the deadlock. It urged India to prevent ousted PM Hasina , currently living in New Delhi from giving controversial remarks. Fairness, equality and brotherhood need to be the cornerstone of the relationship between two countries, the editorial underlined.On the issue of India’s demand for an 'inclusive election'—a veiled suggestion that Awami League should be part of the process—questioned India’s earlier silence when Hasina allegedly bulldozed the opposition to secure repeated victories. A front-page analysis on Sunday lamented that the visa issue—especially India’s drastic reduction in issuance to Bangladeshis—was overlooked. The article also noted that China had indirectly featured in the talks, with Modi reportedly indicating that he would not welcome a “third wheel” in the relationship.suggested that Yunus’s recent China visit may have paved the way for this summit. During that trip, Yunus reportedly described India’s North East as landlocked and dependent on Bangladesh, calling Bangladesh the “only guardian of the ocean”—remarks that sent shockwaves in India. Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma called the comments 'offensive' and warned against 'longstanding agendas,' emphasizing infrastructure development in the Chicken’s Neck region. In a thinly veiled statement before his Thailand departure, PM Modi described North East India as 'integral to BIMSTEC,' widely interpreted as a message to Yunus.Bangladeshi dailybelieves that India as the bigger partner had the responsibility of creating a working relationship but it was Bangladesh which took the lead. In a laudatory tone, it claims that Mohammad Younus has raised all the contentious issues and has made it clear to India that the days of flexing arm is over. Another newspaper,also harped on the theme of equality and fairness for lasting friendship between two countries.One tangible way to bolster friendship, according to Farid Hossain—former Minister (Press) at the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi—would be for India to resume regular visa services. Speaking to, Hossain said that the Modi-Yunus meeting had generated a positive media buzz and was welcomed by many politicians in Bangladesh. However, he noted that Hasina’s extradition was unlikely in the near term and not something the general public expected soon. Instead, progress on trade normalization and the Teesta water issue would help marginalize hardliners. Farid also played down the possibility of Bangladesh not obeying existing treaties.He concluded by saying that while social media may always lean toward extreme views, calm diplomacy and mutual respect were necessary to restore normalcy in bilateral ties. And in his view, the Modi-Yunus meeting—with its honest exchanges—was just the beginning.","First summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government.
