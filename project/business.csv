Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection. Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group.

Mami Mizutori

tells

Pradeep Thakur

Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people. Excerpts from the interview:

The

estimates 150 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty in 2021 due to Covid-19. How can India minimise the impact?

The US and some other countries reserved enough shots for their citizens. Should India have done the same?

How much success has the UN’s Covax programme achieved?

The second wave of Covid-19 has caused more deaths in India. Where did it go wrong?

Your idea of a ‘global response for future pandemics’ and vaccine distribution?

With Covid disruptions, can countries like India meet the UN’s

target?

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the people and government of India on the tragic loss of life that is taking place across the country. All major disasters which affect low- and middle-income countries result in economic losses on a scale which has a damaging effect on their ability to eradicate poverty and meet other basic needs, including health services and access to education. In the case of Covid-19, we have seen how it has pushed millions into extreme poverty globally, and has contributed to rising levels of hunger in many parts of the world where the informal economy that poor people depend on has been decimated. For all member states, the eradication of poverty cannot be achieved without reducing disaster risk and improved prevention as nothing undermines development like disasters.Much of the world looks to India for vaccine supply but the pharmaceutical supply chain is very complex and specialised to a degree that serving a population the size of India’s was always going to be a gargantuan task. The numbers already vaccinated in India are enormous but manufacturing enough doses to reach over one billion people will take time.The Covax facility portfolio, administered by Gavi, currently consists of agreements related to eight vaccines, including those developed with the Serum Institute of India . Coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO, Covax is making steady progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high risk and vulnerable people, as well as frontline healthcare workers.Covid-19 demonstrates the systemic nature of disaster risk, how a biological hazard can ravage all areas of life starting from public health to all socio-economic aspects of our societies. Unfortunately, many countries, including India, are learning the hard way that prevention requires more patience than previously thought and, in the case of biological hazards, a longer game plan. WHO has warned that when there are mass gatherings, more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low, this can create a perfect storm for the virus to spread in any country. India has done an admirable job in harnessing technology and communication to ensure effective early warning leads to early action in the case of cyclones. The challenge for the government now is to communicate effectively on the continued need for face masks, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings while at the same time rolling out an effective vaccination programme.If the global level of preparedness for this pandemic had matched the warnings, much of the impact could have been reduced. An adequate level of pandemic preparedness would have cost billions instead of the trillions that it is now costing. The loss of life and the economic disruption could have been significantly reduced if we had been adequately prepared from the moment biological hazards were included in the Sendai Framework in 2015. Given the transboundary nature of biological hazards it is obvious that a global response plan is required for future pandemics. A patchwork response is not working for Covid-19, and it will not work against any newly emerging diseases and viruses in the future. It is not acceptable that developing countries should have to wait so long for Covid vaccines. This inequality and lack of solidarity to access affordable vaccines only fuels the spread of the virus, allows the emergence of new variants and prolongs the pandemic. None of us is safe until we are all safe.It is clear that the death toll and economic loss from Covid-19 means that Sendai Framework targets on reducing mortality, numbers of disaster affected people and economic losses has suffered a great setback. However, we are still making significant progress on other targets. Asia and the Pacific are not on track to achieve any of the SDGs.","Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people.

"Weak monsoon sparks tension between Karnataka, Tamil Nadu over water",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/weak-monsoon-sparks-tension-between-karnataka-tamil-nadu-over-water/articleshow/111301243.cms,"Inflow down to a trickle

Saving water for drinking

DEFICIT RAIN IN MOST DISTRICTS

BENGALURU: With the monsoon slowing considerably over Karnataka in the past week, tension between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu appears set to escalate over sharing of Cauvery river water. A hint of this emerged at a Cauvery Water Management Authority ( CWMA ) meeting late on Tuesday, with both the states sticking to their stands on the issue.At the meeting, Karnataka, the upper riparian state, citing low inflow into the four reservoirs in the Cauvery river basin, expressed its inability to release water to its neighbour as per the month-wise schedule prescribed by Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal.Karnataka said its reser-voirs cumulatively received a measly 7.3Tmcft of water from June 1 to June 24 against a 30-year average of about 24.4Tmcft in the same period. Karnataka also said it would consider releasing water depending on how the monsoon behaves and inflows into its reservoirs.Tamil Nadu vehemently objected, while demanding the authority direct Karnataka to release water as per the schedule. But Karnata-ka also suggested Tamil Nadu was wasting water.In a submission before CWMA, Karnataka said: “Despite prevailing 70% distress conditions at four reservoirs of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu has been making large releases into the river from its reservoirs amounting to 3.9Tmcft to date. Karnataka has not released water into its canals [for irrigation] toconserve water for drinking purposes. The authority is requested to watch the evolving situation up to the end of July. By taking stock of the hydrological scenario, a considered decision could be taken (sic).”Since levels were low in its reservoirs, Karnataka released 5.3Tmcft less than the prescribed quantity to Tamil Nadu till June 24. CWMA has also previously directed Karnataka to release 31.2Tmcft for the month of July. At the meeting, Tamil Nadu demanded that Karnataka make up for the deficit in June, besidesmeeting the July quota.Though the authority decided to wait till July 27 to review the hydrological situation before taking a call, it is highly likely that both the states will be at loggerheads if the monsoon does not pick up in the next one week. In some relief, rain fell in catchment areas on Wednesday, bringing some relief.Last year, when Karnataka witnessed one of the worst droughts in more than 100 years, tension prevailed between the two states for almost four months from Nov to Feb.Barring Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Ramanagara, Kolar, Chikkaballapur and Tumakuru districts, all other districts in the state have recorded deficit rainfall over the past seven days.The situation is far grimmer in North Karnataka compared to other regions asaverage deficit over normal rainfall in these districts is as high as 47%. The deficit has touched over 60% in districts like Raichur, Kalaburagi, Bidar, Ballari and Vijayapura. Even Malnad districts of Shivamogga, Hassan, Chikkamagaluru and Kodagu have received below normal rainfall.","Karnataka said its reser-voirs received a measly 7.3Tmcft of water from June 1 to June 24.

""You are a coaching institute. How can you file a petition under Article 32,"" it asked senior advocate R Basant.When Basant said even if the court disregards the coaching centre, there are four other students who have filed a joint petition alleging that OMR answer sheets have discrepancies in evaluation and that there is no mechanism provided by the NTA to address these grievances.NTA counsel Vardhaman Kaushik said a batch of petitions related to alleged irregularities in NEET-UG is engaging the attention of SC and is fixed for hearing on July 8, the first day of the court resuming normal business after summer break.But court, on insistence of Basant, asked NTA to file an affidavit detailing the mechanism to address grievances of students regarding evaluation of OMR sheets. However, it expressed its strong disapproval of the coaching centres jumping into the fray with students regarding the NEET-UG.The bench observed, ""We see the role played by the coaching centres as pied pipers. They have hardly any role to play in this case. Your duties end once coaching is over. If they have discharged the duty of coaching, that is the end of the matter. They have not further undertaken to see that they will have a role to play after the coaching is over.""Repudiating the claim of the coaching centre that OMR sheets are not provided to every candidate who took NEET-UG, NTA counsel told SC that they have been uploaded on the website.The apex court asked NTA to file a detailed affidavit on this issue and tagged the petition with the bunch of matters to be taken up for hearing on July 8.","A vacation bench of Justices Manoj Misra and S V N Bhatti wondered as to which fundamental right of the coaching centre was violated.

"A temple for Mahabharat's arch villain, now a taxpayer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/a-temple-for-mahabharats-arch-villain-now-a-taxpayer/articleshow/111325091.cms,"A village where Duryodhan's a benign

, is called 'grandpa'

Even in a land of temples, and more deities than even the most pious can name, a temple for the arch villain of India's greatest epic is unusual. But what really makes the Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala 's Kollam district a standout is an aspect of modernity - per govt records, the eldest Kaurav prince pays taxes.Local lore has it that the prince was tired and thirsty during his travels.Drinking water was scarce, but a woman of a so-called low caste offered him a drink of toddy. Duryodhan, who also famously elevated the supposedly low-born Karna to kingship, accepted happily, blessed the woman and her village, and gave them land. The temple for him was the village saying thank you. Ritual offerings here include a good measure of intoxicants.At the Peruviruthy Malanada temple, the daily offering of toddy to Duryodhan, who's not represented by an idol in the temple but by a polished mace, the Kaurav prince's weapon of choice. In Mahabharat , he's the man who hoots with delight as he orders Draupadi disrobed, the prince who plotted to steal the kingdom that rightfully belonged to the good guys - Pandavs. But in this village, he's a benign, protective deity. Villagers call him 'appoopa' (grandpa).That sharp departure from Mahabharat's narrative treatment of Duryodhan, the fact that there's no idol and the votive offering of toddy are similar to other non-Vedic practices in many southern temples. Villagers have a more interesting take on the toddy offering - a tipple keeps the deity in a mild and cheerful mood, they say.As for those taxes Duryodhan pays diligently, it will be wise to first point out that the tax is not on the temple's income - all temples are tax free in India. The levy is on the 15 acres of temple land at the Poruvazhy village surrounding the temple.""When the pattayam was issued for the temple, the land was registered in the deity's name. The thandaper (land deed) number and survey details show the land is owned by Duryodhan. Ever since taxes were introduced in Kerala, this land tax has been paid in Duryodhan's name,"" a local administrator said. Of the 15 acres of temple land, eight acres are paddy fields, the rest is forested land, said temple committee secretary Rajaneesh R.When in Puruvazhy, don't diss Duryodhan.","Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala's Kollam district is a standout.

NEW DELHI: Raising expectations of major announcements, President Droupadi Murmu on Thursday said the first Budget of PM Narendra Modi 's third term will have several historic steps, going beyond economic and social decisions. ""This Budget will be an effective document of govt's far-reaching policies and futuristic vision... The pace of reforms will be further accelerated in tune with the aspirations of people of India for rapid development,"" the President said in her address to the joint sitting of Parliament .Expectations of a reform-oriented Budget have been building up since Modi returned to office for a third consecutive term, equalling Nehru's record, with govt expected to address several concerns flagged during the elections, including job creation and inflation through a push for manufacturing, tax concessions to spur demand and provide more money to households.The PM has also spoken about the Budget being a key element of the govt's 2047 development agenda which will include a 100-day programme leading to action points and targets up to 2030.Curiosity about the Budget has been heightened by the estimate in political quarters that govt might come up with measures which may help alleviate the grudges behind BJP's lower-than-expected seats tally. In any case, despite being in a good fiscal spot, govt had held off on coming out with schemes for specific sections in the interim budget. It is expected to make good for the restraint in the coming Budget, besides having reachouts to sections like women.Murmu's address was marked by confidence and an effort to amplify the message that BJP's reduced numbers will not be a deterrent in its pursuit of bold measures.The Prez cited the favourable environment for India and underlined the need for lawmakers to fulfil their responsibilities so that the country can harness its potential. She listed out the achievements of the Modi govt during its first two terms - from an average 8% GDP growth during the last three years to India emerging as the fifth largest economy and record profits by State Bank of India - despite challenges posed by Covid and geopolitical tension in Ukraine and West Asia.""With the reforms that have taken place in the last 10 years and the new confidence that has been infused in the country, we have gained a new momentum to make India a developed nation. We all need to always remember that making India a developed nation is the aspiration and resolve of every citizen of the country. All of us are responsible for ensuring that no obstacles come in the way of achieving this resolution,"" the Prez said at a time when BJP, while leading a coalition govt after 10 years, will need numbers in Parliament to ensure passage of key bills.Govt has lined up several legislations, from amendments to the Constitution for one nation-one election to strengthening the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and decriminalising several laws.Murmu also reflected govt's grouse over what it considers baseless propaganda by the opposition, especially Congress, that the Modi govt has undermined the public sector and that GST, dubbed ""Gabbar Singh Tax"" by the party, was an extortionist device.""Many such reforms have taken place in the last 10 years which are greatly benefiting the nation today. Even when these reforms were being taken up, they were opposed and attempts were made to spread negativity. But all these reforms have stood the test of time,"" she said while listing out the clean-up of banks, revitalising Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd and GST.She also argued for healthy competition between states to attract investment and said the Centre would seek to push ahead with their development.","Expectations of a reform-oriented Budget have been building up since Modi returned to office for a third consecutive term, equalling Nehru's record.

Google Trends: This topic has fetched wide interest globally

NEW DELHI: Christina Applegate 's teenage daughter recently revealed that she was diagnosed with POTS .In an episode of the ""MeSsy"" podcast hosted by Jamie Lynn-Sigler , Sadie Grace Applegate LeNoble , daughter of the ""Dead to Me"" star, said that she has been dealing with POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) for several years. She mentioned on the Tuesday episode that despite experiencing symptoms for a long time, she was only officially diagnosed with POTS in the past few months.“I have no clue what it actually is, but it’s something to do with the autonomic nervous system and it affects my heart,” Sadie explained.“So when I stand up, I get really, really dizzy and my legs get really weak and I feel like I’m going to pass out.”POTS, which started ranking on Google Trends, impacts the autonomic nervous system, crucial for regulating essential bodily functions such as heart rate, digestion, pupil size, and blood flow. It results in an accelerated heart rate when transitioning from sitting or lying down to standing up. POTS is an incurable condition, affects between 1 million to 3 million people in the United StatesOn the podcast, Sadie shared that her experience with POTS includes symptoms like tremors and blurry vision, affecting her school days. She described feeling sick and in pain during classes, noting that some teachers have not taken her concerns seriously and have refused her requests to see the nurse.“Them not doing anything about it definitely hurt me physically and emotionally,” she said. “This is rude and I feel sick and you’re telling me to go to PE and run laps around the football field. I can’t do that.”School staffers aren't the only ones who overlooked Sadie's condition. Applegate, 52, admitted she was unaware of what her daughter was going through. ""I feel so horrible that we didn’t pay attention to it,"" she said. Applegate apologized to her daughter and connected her own battle with MS to Sadie’s experiences.“We get out in the world, and the stresses and the anxiety of the world bring upon our symptoms much worse than they would be if we were in the safety and the coolness of our own homes,” she said.Sadie, who is still working out treatment and medication with her doctor, said her experience with POTS helps her empathize with her mom. Applegate was diagnosed with MS three years ago and has been open about her struggles with the autoimmune disease. Earlier this month, the Emmy-winning star detailed the return of her depression.Applegate, diagnosed with MS three years ago, has openly shared her challenges with the autoimmune condition.

No justification to charge toll if roads are in disrepair: Nitin Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justification-to-charge-toll-if-roads-are-in-disrepair-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/111267453.cms,"NEW DELHI: Echoing the sentiment of many highway commuters, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said there is no justification of highway agencies charging toll, if roads are not in good condition and people continue to face problems. He was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling, which will be rolled out across 5,000 km during this financial year.Known for not mincing his words, Gadkari said, “If you don’t provide good services, you should not charge toll...We are in a hurry to start tolling to collect user fees and protect our interest.When the condition of any road is not good I get numerous complaints and there are social media posts all over...You should collect the user fee where you provide the best quality road. If you collect toll on roads with potholes, mud, then there will be a backlash from people. We (political leaders) face people’s ire.”The minister said the field officers of NH agencies must be more sensitive towards the pain that people face waiting for long at toll plazas and there must be a mechanism for lodging grievances and their quick redressal.Though govt made the use of FASTag for paying toll on highways mandatory in 2021 for seamless travel through toll lanes and currently around 98% transactions are through these smart tags fixed on vehicles, there have been numerous reports of queues at plazas from across the country. In its bid to put an end to this, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on the roll out and expansion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based toll collection. This aims to remove toll gates from the NH network in the next few years.The highway authority proposes to roll this out in a phased manner, starting with only commercial vehicles and dedicating one lane on each side of toll plazas for them to pass without stopping. It’s mandatory for commercial vehicles to install vehicle tracker system (VTS), an on board unit, which is necessary for GNSS-based tolling.Govt plans to bring private vehicles under this tolling system at a subsequent phase.The road transport ministry has finalised a series of amendments in Central Motor Vehicle Rules and NH Fee Rules, which don’t need legislation, for roll out of the system. While vehicle owners will be incentivised to get a discount in toll charge for complying with their vehicles having OBUs for paying toll without stopping, there will be disincentives for those who don't opt for this.Gadkari said the system (GNSS)-based toll collection will add Rs 10,000 crore to govt’s toll revenue. “We need to put in place a transparent, qualitative and a leak proof system of GNSS-based toll collection in India to ensure no inconvenience to toll users,” he added. The GNSS-based toll collection is expected to enhance efficiency, bring down logistics cost and major relief for the highway users as they will have to pay only for the distance travelled.","Gadkari was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling.

Google has reportedly ‘edited’ or ‘removed’ a photo of a ‘top-secret’ vessel, nicknamed “Manta Ray”, after its picture went viral online. A report said that the underwater drone has been clearly visible, docked at Port Hueneme naval base in California.According to a report by The New York Post, a high-resolution satellite photo shows the distinctive, smooth hull of the submarine contrasting with surrounding vessels.After the image popped up online, Manta Ray ‘disappeared’ and was apparently replaced with boats.The report indicates the “Manta Ray” is an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a top-secret US submarine prototype weapon designed for extended, low-power operation at significant depths.‘Manta Ray’ is manufactured by Northrop Grumman as part of a US Navy project to develop long-range underwater weapons. The report said that it is an underwater drone that can hibernate on the seafloor for “very long periods” without need of it being refuelled.It uses “efficient, buoyancy-driven gliding to move through the water. Our successful, full-scale Manta Ray testing validates the vehicle’s readiness to advance toward real-world operations,” said Dr. Kyle Woerner, Manta Ray program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.“The craft is designed with several payload bays of multiple sizes and types to enable a wide variety of naval mission sets,” Woerner added.It has a modular design, which makes it easier to be disassembled and transported in shipping containers. Manta Ray has been tested by the US Navy off Southern California for over three months, the Telegraph reported.Defense analysts believe that the drone technology is aimed at countering Russian and Chinese submarine operations, the report noted.",'Manta Ray' is an underwater drone that can hibernate on the seafloor for “very long periods” without need of it being refuelled.

But the lender’s advocate Vinod Kothari said its proposal was only for change of the developer.The judges said the petitioners are entitled to transit rent and “cannot be made to run from pillar to post to recover their dues.” They added that “neither the developer nor the lender is willing to pay arrears” and the State and SRA “are also sitting tight” over their proposals.The judges said “none of the respondents are serious about solving the petitioners’ most genuine problem.” They noted that Omkar has raised its hands up stating it has no financial means to pay and at the same time is unwilling to let go of the project and pave the way for a new developer. “This unfortunate situation cannot continue any longer,” they added.They said Omkar “cannot declare that it has no means to pay the transit accommodation rent, which it is statutorily duty bound to pay.” Also, till date, it continues to be “duly appointed developer for this redevelopment project.” They directed Omkar to deposit all rent arrears in HC by July 24. If for any reasons Omkar wishes to avoid compliance, its MD shall remain “personally present” in court and shall file an affidavit disclosing all assets of the company.The judges noted that despite time granted SRA and State govt had not taken decisions on proposals by Omkar and the lender and “almost 6 months later” were seeking adjournments. They directed both to take “firm decisions” on the proposals within 2 weeks.", Bombay high court has slammed the State government and Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) for not taking a decision to allow change of the developer.

Frame guidelines to speed up land acquisition proceedings: High court to Maharashtra government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/frame-guidelines-to-speed-up-land-acquisition-proceedings-hc-to-maharashtra-govt/articleshow/111322026.cms,"MUMBAI: Bombay high court has directed the State government to frame guidelines for expeditious disposal of execution proceedings of land acquisition and for payment of compensation to those whose land has been acquired.“For expeditious disposal of the execution proceedings and other proceedings pending in the courts and also for ensuring timely payment of compensation and other related benefits to the land oustees, the State Government shall frame appropriate guidelines within a period of four months,” said Chief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Amit Borkar in the June 19 order.They were hearing a PIL by Bharat Navale, a lawyer, on the plight of individuals whose lands have been subjected to compulsory acquisition and delay in proceedings where a reference is made to the court. The petition said there is delay in execution proceedings pending before civil courts and inordinate delay by State authorities to deposit compensation amounts to those whose land has been acquired.Advocate Tejas Dande, for Navale, drew the judges attention to certain orders of civil courts in execution proceedings saying they manifest indifference on part of the State authorities and, also sometimes, on part of the courts dealing with such matters. He said the High Court in a January 2001 order, on finding that decrees passed by the courts were not executed expeditiously, had expressed dismay and observed that the executing court must act with promptitude for expeditious disposal of land acquisition cases, particularly where hardly any dispute arises in the course of execution.The judges said Navale’s prayers are general in nature and granting them “will not serve the cause of land oustees.” They said the prayer for framing of guidelines will require taking a policy decision which “is the preserve of the State government.” They said any guideline to be framed, by any authority including HC, would involve gathering information and date, which would not be possible for HC. “In such a situation, it will be more appropriate if the State government itself considers the plight of the land owners as highlighted in this PIL petition and takes a policy decision and frames guidelines to expedite land acquisition proceedings and proceedings for payment of compensation within a time-frame,” they added.The judges also directed that it will be open to parties to apply for expeditious disposal of the proceedings and “it shall be considered by the court concerned with utmost seriousness and expedition.” Where the State, its authorities and instrumentalities are parties , “it shall fully cooperate for expeditious disposal of the proceedings.” The judges also directed the HC registrar general to issue an appropriate circular to courts in Maharashtra for ensuring expeditious proceedings. They clarified that it will always be open to an individual to approach HC/any other forum for redressal of his grievances."," Bombay high court has directed the State government to frame guidelines for expeditious disposal of execution proceedings of land acquisition.

"" Dictatorship runs in Congress 's DNA,"" he alleged. ""They wanted autocracy. Three judges were demoted and one judge was promoted to pass their (Congress's) rulings. The elections were cancelled and Indira Gandhi ji won through the misuse of government and the administration"".While sharing his personal experiences, he said that during the Emergency he was arrested and sent to jail and beaten with sticks. ""I was only 17 at that time. I was beaten ruthlessly while in custody, and I still feel the effects of that torture. The physical and emotional scars from that period remain with me to this day,"" he recalled. He also recounted a deeply personal loss, saying, ""one of the most painful memories for me is that when my grandmother died, she couldn't see me because I was imprisoned during the Emergency.""The conclave began with a tribute to Jayaprakash Narayan, followed by inaugural remarks from Professor Jasim Mohammad, chairman of the Centre for Narendra Modi Studies . He emphasized the need of educating the youth about the Emergency and its long-term effects on the nation. Professor Jasim Mohammad informed that the Centre for Narendra Modi Studies will continue to organize conferences, workshops, seminars, and symposiums on the theme ""Dark Emergency"" throughout 2024-2025 in schools, colleges, and universities.Guest of honour Jatinder Kumar from the USA, who played a significant role abroad in conveying the plight of Indians during Emergency too spoke emphatically delivered an impactful address. ""During the Emergency, RSS members worked tirelessly to highlight the trauma and suffering faced by the people of India, informed other country leaders about the atrocities being committed by the Indira Gandhi government,"" he said.Veteran journalist Ram Bahadur Rai, in his presidential address, said: ""Imposing Emergency was murder of democracy and it was completely unnecessary.

He urged people to pursue legal action against the Indira Gandhi family for their actions during that dark period, saying, ""In today's times, people should file cases against the Indira Gandhi family in the Supreme Court for what they did during the Emergency period.""Rai also recalled his personal experience saying that when he was arrested newspapers were restricted in prisons. He recalled:""We informed our families about this, and when a dedicated worker Narendra Modi heard about the restriction of newspapers, he personally ensured that all newspapers were sent to us in prison, which kept us informed about the outside world during that challenging period.""The conclave also featured a presentation of books and mementos to the esteemed guests, acknowledging their valuable contributions to the discourse on Emergency.",The function commemorated 49th anniversary of the Emergency.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Elon Musk's SpaceX gets $843m to help discard ISS around 2030,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-spacex-gets-843m-to-help-discard-iss-around-2030/articleshow/111323006.cms,"WASHINGTON: Nasa awarded SpaceX $843m to build a vehicle capable of pushing the Internation Space Station into Earth's atmosphere for its planned destruction around 2030, it said on Wednesday, a task originally meant for Russia's thrusters.Under its new Nasa contract, SpaceX will build what the space agency called the US Deorbit Vehicle to deorbit the ISS and avoid risks to populated areas, with Nasa taking ownership of the craft and handling the deorbiting operation.The football field-sized research lab, led primarily by the US and Russia, has been continuously staffed with govt astronauts during its some 24 years of operation, but its aging components have led Nasa and its foreign partners to set 2030 as a planned retirement date.The first segment of the ISS was launched in 1998. Weighing 430,000kg, ISS is by far the largest single structure ever built in space. Based on past observations of how other stations such as Mir and Skylab disintegrated on atmospheric re-entry, Nasa engineers expect the orbital outpost to break up in three stages. First, the massive solar arrays and the radiators that keep the orbital lab cool will come off, then individual modules will break off from the truss, or the station's backbone structure. Finally, the truss and the modules themselves will tear apart. Much of the material will be vaporised, but large pieces are expected to survive. For this reason, Nasa is aiming for an area of the Pacific Ocean called Point Nemo, one of the most remote areas of the world and known as the graveyard of satellites and spaceships.The US, Japan, Canada and the countries under the European Space Agency have committed to the space station partnership through 2030, while Russia has agreed to remain a partner through 2028, the date through which the Russian space agency Roscosmos believes its hardware can last. Russian thrusters maintain ISS's orbital altitude and US solar arrays keep its power running.For after 2030, Nasa has been funding early development of privately built space stations in low-Earth orbit to maintain US presence in the cosmic region, with Airbus and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin involved in those efforts.","Nasa awarded SpaceX $843m to build a vehicle capable of pushing the Internation Space Station into Earth's atmosphere for its planned destruction around 2030.

US SC blocks opioid settlement that gave immunity to Purdue co's Sackler family,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-sc-blocks-opioid-settlement-that-gave-immunity-to-purdue-cos-sackler-family/articleshow/111322988.cms,"Washington: The US Supreme Court on Thursday blocked OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma 's bankruptcy settlement that would have shielded its wealthy Sackler family owners from lawsuits over their role in the nation's deadly opioid epidemic. The 5-4 decision reversed a lower court's ruling that had upheld the plan to give Purdue's owners immunity in exchange for paying up to $6 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits accusing the firm of unlawful misleading marketing of OxyContin, a powerful pain medication introduced in 1996.The ruling represented a victory for Prez Biden's administration, which had challenged the settlement as an abuse of bankruptcy protections meant for debtors in financial distress, not people like the Sacklers who have not filed for bankruptcy.Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the ruling, which was joined by fellow conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett, as well as liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. ""The Sacklers haven't filed for bankruptcy and have not placed virtually all their assets on the table for distribution to creditors, yet they seek what essentially amounts to a discharge,"" he wrote.Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined be fellow conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, and liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. ""The decision is wrong on the law and devastating for more than 100,000 opioid victims and their families,"" he said.Purdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019 to address its debts, nearly all of which stemmed from thousands of lawsuits alleging that OxyContin helped kickstart an opioid epidemic that has caused more than half a million US overdose deaths over two decades. At issue in the case was whether US bankruptcy law lets Purdue's restructuring include legal protections for members of the Sackler family, who have not filed for personal bankruptcy. The decision has broader implications for other bankruptcy settlements involving claims of mass injury.","Supreme Court blocks OxyContin maker's bankruptcy settlement that would have shielded its wealthy Sackler family owners from lawsuits.

What issues did Cuevas observe in the Boeing?

What were the previous complaints?

What the company said?

Another whistleblower has come forward on Wednesday with allegations that certain components of Boeing 's 787 Dreamliner aircraft were constructed in an unsafe manner, potentially leading to ""devastating consequences.""Richard Cuevas , a mechanic employed by Strom, a former contractor, has filed complaints with two US agencies, claiming he faced retaliation after raising concerns about potential manufacturing issues on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.According to his attorneys at Katz Banks Kumin, Cuevas was terminated in March 2024 after he brought attention to manufacturing deviations in the forward pressure bulkhead, a crucial component for managing pressure during flights, as per CNN reports.Richard Cuevas is the latest in the list of whistleblowers who have come forward from Boeing's operations, further intensifying the scrutiny faced by the plane manufacturer, in an incident involving a 737 MAX aircraft operated by Alaska Airlines in January, after the plane was forced to make an emergency landing due to an inflight issue.Cuevas was employed by Strom, a contracting company that assigned him to work atSpirit AeroSystems , the manufacturer responsible for building fuselages for the Dreamliner.According to CNN, in October 2023, Cuevas submitted a complaint to Boeing, claiming that Spirit had implemented unapproved modifications to the dimensions of fastener holes located in the forward pressure bulkhead of 787 aircraft.The Boeing initiated an investigation into his concerns in October 2023, notifying Spirit management of the complaints. During this period, Cuevas says a colleague commented, ""we've got a snitch among us,"" and in March, Spirit abruptly terminated his employment.Katz Banks Kumin said, ""Our client witnessed critical issues with the forward pressure bulkhead assembly on multiple planes that deviated from Boeing's specifications.""""He recognized the substandard work and expressed concern about his safety concerns, but Spirit and Boeing failed to stop the faulty manufacturing processes. Mr. Cuevas was fired when his manager found out that an employee complained about these issues, and suspected that employee was Mr. Cuevas,"" he added.Cuevas reported that he observed gaps in the forward pressure bulkheads of two aircraft he helped construct, which could potentially lead to ""catastrophe.""Cuevas witnessed the improper drilling of holes into the forward pressure bulkheads of 787 planes at Spirit's facility in Wichita, Kansas, during 2023,"" which he believes could compromise power and air pressure on the planes, posing a serious safety risk to passengers.He filed a report with Boeing's ethics hotline, informing management that he believed Spirit was concealing the issues from Boeing.Cuevas witnessed these issues with three planes he worked on and believes that these problems may affect at least 10 to 12 planes, either in production or already delivered to Boeing.In response to the allegations, Boeing has said that they had previously investigated Cuevas' claims and determined that they did not present a safety issue.The bulkhead is a critical component of an airplane's structure, essential for maintaining the aircraft's integrity while in flight.A previous whistleblower, Sam Salehpour , a Boeing engineer, reported similar gaps in 787 and 777 aircraft. The FAA and Boeing suspended deliveries of new Dreamliners for nearly two years starting in 2021 to investigate the gaps.The same attorneys are also representing Sam who testified before the Senate in April regarding his concerns about the manufacturing practices of the 787 and the retaliation he faced for speaking out.More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has increased significantly since a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane in January just after takeoff, leaving a large hole in the side of the plane, CNN reported.Last week, a current Boeing employee claimed that the company attempted to conceal broken or out-of-specification 737 Max plane parts from regulators and lost track of them, fearing that they may have been installed on planes carrying passengers.The Boeing said, ""A subcontractor's employee previously reported concerns to us that we thoroughly investigated as we take seriously any safety-related matter. Engineering analysis determined that the issues raised did not present a safety concern and were addressed.""""We are reviewing the documents released today and will thoroughly investigate any new claim,""they added.company spokesperson Joe Buccino said, Spirit ""leadership is aware of the allegations and looking into the matter. We encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected.""Attorneys representing Cuevas submitted complaints to the Federal Aviation Administration and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration in a letter of submission, saying ""based on his direct observations of glaring safety issues, that Boeing's and Spirit's statements to the public and investors about the safety of 787 Dreamliners are fraudulent.""The FAA has initiated multiple investigations into Boeing, and the US Department of Justice has stated that it may file criminal charges against the company due to its ongoing quality and safety failures.""We strongly encourage anyone with safety concerns to report them and we thoroughly investigate every report,"" the FAA said.According to the FAA, it has received a total of 126 such reports in the current year, while only 11 were submitted last year.","Richard Cuevas, a mechanic, has filed complaints with two US agencies.

Gupta was arrested in the Czech Republic in June last year and was extradited to the US on June 14.State department spokesperson Matthew Miller responded to a question at a press briefing and said, “They (Indian officials) have announced that they are conducting an inquiry, and we will look forward to the results of that inquiry.”Miller's remarks came in response to a question about a letter sent by members of the foreign senate foreign relations committee to secretary of state Antony Blinken . The letter called for a strong diplomatic response to the Indian government's alleged involvement in the assassination attempt on a US citizen on American soil.In response to these allegations, India has formed a high-level inquiry committee to investigate the information provided by the US regarding the plot.Miller emphasized, “We will respond to those members privately as we always do. I won't speak to that here. But as pertains to the other issue, when this issue first arose, we made clear that we had raised it with the government of India and told them that we expected there to be a full investigation.”During a virtual media briefing on Wednesday, US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell reiterated that the US has been in consistent contact with India for updates on the investigation into the foiled plot to kill Pannun. He underscored the importance of accountability in the case.“We have had constructive dialogue with India on this topic and I would say that they have been responsive to our concerns,” Campbell said.“We've made clear that we seek accountability from the Government of India and we have consistently asked for updates on the Indian committee of inquiry's investigations,” Campbell added.Campbell further noted, “And I would just simply say that we raised this issue directly with the Indian government...at the most senior levels between our two sides.”He made these comments while responding to a query about whether the 'murder-for-hire' plot targeting Pannun was discussed during his and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's meetings with their Indian counterparts.When asked about the Lok Sabha elections in India, Miller commented on the US’s position regarding India's democratic process.“When it comes to the Indian elections, we have been quite clear on behalf of the United States government that we celebrate what was the largest exercise of democracy in the history of the world,” Miller said.“It was an extraordinary achievement. And then when it comes to the outcome of the election, we obviously take no side. That's a question for the people of India to decide,” Miller concluded.The US maintains that it seeks accountability from India regarding the alleged assassination plot and has consistently pursued updates from Indian authorities on their investigation. Both Campbell and Miller highlighted the ongoing dialogue and cooperation between the two countries on this sensitive issue.","The United States is anticipating the results of an Indian investigation into allegations that an Indian official was involved in a plot to assassinate Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York.

According to reports, the relationship between Melania and Ivanka has seen some changes following Donald Trump's legal troubles.A source close to the family noted that ""Melania and Ivanka are rumored to be getting along better since Donald Trump was convicted in New York."" This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years, a Newsweek report said.Melania Trump's former friend, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff , weighed in on the evolving dynamics within the Trump family. Wolkoff, who has previously published a tell-all book about her time with the former first lady, described some of the recent claims about Melania and Ivanka's relationship as ""ridiculous."" Wolkoff's comments suggest that the public may not have the full picture of the intricate relationships within the Trump family.This development comes as Donald Trump faces various legal challenges, which have undoubtedly impacted the family's interactions. The former president's conviction in New York has led to increased media attention on his personal life, including his relationships with Melania and Ivanka.Historically, there have been reports of tension between Melania and Ivanka. Ivanka, who served as a senior advisor during Donald Trump's presidency, often took on a prominent role, leading to speculation about her influence and relationship with her stepmother. However, the current situation appears to show a thawing of relations between the two women, perhaps brought on by the pressures of their shared circumstances.Melania Trump has largely remained out of the public eye since leaving the White House, making few public statements and maintaining a low profile. Ivanka, on the other hand, has also stepped back from the political spotlight but continues to be a figure of interest due to her high-profile role during her father's administration.As the Trump family navigates these legal and personal challenges, the evolving relationships within the family continue to be a topic of public fascination. The reported improvement in Melania and Ivanka's relationship adds a new layer to the complex narrative of the Trump family's public and private lives.","A source close to the family noted that ""Melania and Ivanka are rumored to be getting along better since Donald Trump was convicted in New York"" This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111292941,imgsize-10050,width-400,resizemode-4/111292941.jpg"
Presidential Election: Trump says inflation is 'killing our country' under Biden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-says-inflation-is-killing-our-country-under-biden/articleshow/111328168.cms,"- Surge in inflation -

- 'Inflationary' policies -

ATLANTA: Donald Trump accused Joe Biden on Thursday of doing a ""poor job"" on the US economy and of presiding over a disastrous rise in inflation -- reflecting how rising prices and the cost of living have become key issues ahead of November's presidential election .""He has not done a good job. He's done a poor job,"" Trump said during CNN's head-to-head debate with Biden in Atlanta, Georgia.""And inflation is killing our country. It is absolutely killing us.""Biden said the US economy had turned a corner under his leadership, but that more needed to be done to help the working class.""We got to take a look at what I was left when I became president,"" he said. ""We had an economy that was in free fall. The pandemic was so badly handled, many people were dying.""Americans have named inflation or the cost of living as ""the most important financial problem facing their family,"" in each of the last three years, according to a recent poll from the DC-based firm Gallup.Perhaps more worryingly for Biden, 46 per cent of US adults said they have ""a great deal"" or ""a fair amount"" of confidence in Trump to do or recommend the right thing for the world's largest economy, while just 38 per cent said the same thing about him, according to another Gallup poll.A post-pandemic supply crunch and the war in Ukraine helped fuel a surge in US consumer inflation, which hit a multi-decade high in 2022.In response, the US Federal Reserve hiked its key lending rate from almost zero to a two-decade high of between 5.25 and 5.50 per cent -- where it has remained for the past year.Higher interest rates cool down the economy by raising borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, indirectly impacting everything from mortgage rates to auto loans.Inflation has fallen sharply since the Fed started hiking rates but remains stuck stubbornly above its long-term target of two per cent -- keeping the US central bank on pause as it waits for more positive data.Because inflation has remained high for several years, consumer prices have now risen by around 20 per cent since January 2021, when Biden took office, according to the Labor Department's consumer price index (CPI) inflation calculator.In contrast, consumer prices rose by less than six per cent during the same timeframe under Trump.Although Congress has given the Fed the mandate to tackle inflation on its own, it is still a difficult topic for Biden, who has looked to talk up his economic record ahead of November's election.The Fed currently expects inflation will continue to ease this year and next, before hitting its long-term target of two percent in 2026.But what happens next will likely depend on who becomes president in November -- and which parties will control the House of Representatives and the Senate.Trump has suggested that, if he wins the election, he will look to extend a series of tax cuts made under his leadership, severely restrict immigration, deport some foreign-born illegal immigrants and slap tariffs on all US imports.These policies would all ""likely be inflationary,"" by putting up prices, placing upward pressure on wages and boosting and adding to the nation's debt, JP Morgan economists wrote in a recent note to clients.As things stand, Republican control of the House, Senate and the White House is not the most likely scenario come November, Oxford Economics lead US economist Bernard Yaros wrote in a recent note to clients.""If Biden is reelected but presides over a divided government, the upside risk potential to the economy from fiscal policy is limited,"" he said.""If Trump returns to the White House with a divided government, he will have a tougher time enacting his fiscal agenda,"" he added.","Donald Trump accuses Joe Biden of doing a ""poor job"" on the US economy.

In response to the incident, Alton Parks and Recreation announced on their Facebook page that Gordon Moore Park would remain closed pending an investigation.New Frontier Materials , a building supply company, informed that the sinkhole was the result of subsidence from the subterranean mine. Michael Haynes, the Director of the Alton Parks and Recreation Department, stated: ""The mines have been here and in this area for decades and decades. It's never been brought up before so I'm told it's an anomaly. We'll wait until the investigation is complete.""Haynes described the experience as surreal, comparing it to a movie scene where the ground unexpectedly disappears beneath one's feet. He expressed hope that a solution could be found, and plans could be made to move forward before the park's busy season resumes. The affected soccer fields were added to the park in 2019, at a cost exceeding $1 million.","The sinkhole, measuring approximately 100 feet in width and 30 to 50 feet in depth, emerged on Wednesday morning at Gordon Moore Park in Alton.

US supreme court rejects opioid settlement that shields Sackler family,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-rejects-opioid-settlement-that-shields-sackler-family/articleshow/111321390.cms,"The US supreme court has overturned a portion of Purdue Pharma 's bankruptcy agreement that would have protected members of the Sackler family from future lawsuits related to their involvement in the opioid epidemic but also would have provided billions of dollars to combat the opioid epidemic.The Sacklers, who owned and ran the company that produced Oxycontin, had agreed to contribute $6bn towards a broader settlement in exchange for extensive protection against civil claims connected to the addictive opioid.However, the supreme court determined that granting such protections to individuals who did not personally file for bankruptcy was not permitted under bankruptcy law. The decision is a win for the US government, which had opposed the deal, contending that releasing the Sacklers was an abuse of the system.Nevertheless, it raises significant questions about the settlement's future, which had garnered considerable, albeit mixed, support from many who sued the company and viewed it as the only feasible way to access the family's wealth for drug treatment and other purposes.Purdue gained notoriety in the US as the manufacturer and marketer of OxyContin, a prescription painkiller it promoted as safe despite knowing it was highly addictive and widely misused. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2019 after being hit with thousands of lawsuits from states, cities, and families. It later admitted to criminal charges, including deceiving health agencies and making illegal payments to doctors.The ruling leaves open the possibility of restarting negotiations. Cheryl Juaire, the mother of two sons who died of opioid overdoses and helped negotiate the deal as a member of the creditors' committee, said, ""There's no win-win here. If the Sacklers go to jail, that would be justice for a lot of people but it wouldn't save lives.""Abbe Gluck, a Yale Law School professor, noted that the justices were under ""a lot of pressure not to stop this money from flowing to victims."" However, she said the case served as a ""test case"" for broader legal issues, as more companies turn to bankruptcy courts to resolve claims of mass wrongs. She believes the decision is a warning against that trend, stating, ""The court is sending a signal of caution I think that should have an impact on other pending cases.""","The US supreme court has overturned a portion of Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy agreement.

Instead, a significant portion of tax revenues is earmarked for debt servicing, a trend expected to escalate in the upcoming fiscal year, as reported by Dawn.""The government would spend PKR 7.21 trillion on domestic debt servicing and an additional PKR 1.04 trillion on foreign debt servicing, taking the total to PKR 8.25 trillion,"" according to the budget document for FY2023-24.

Melting ice due to climate change unmasks Everest's hidden tragedies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/melting-ice-due-to-climate-change-unmasks-everests-hidden-tragedies/articleshow/111302957.cms,"The sacred slopes of Mount Everest are witnessing the effects of climate change as the snow and ice cover thins, exposing the bodies of hundreds of mountaineers who lost their lives pursuing their dream of reaching the world's highest peak. This year, a team of climbers and military personnel embarked on a mission not to summit the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) mountain, but to retrieve some of the corpses, risking their own lives in the process.As part of Nepal's mountain clean-up campaign on Everest, Lhotse, and Nuptse, the team successfully recovered five frozen bodies, including one that was reduced to skeletal remains.The task was arduous, dangerous, and emotionally challenging.Rescuers spent hours chipping away at the ice with axes and sometimes using boiling water to release the bodies from the frozen grip. Major Aditya Karki, who led the team, said, ""Because of the effects of global warming , (the bodies and trash) are becoming more visible as the snow cover thins.""Over 300 people have died on Everest since expeditions began in the 1920s, with eight fatalities in this season alone. Many bodies remain on the mountain, some hidden by snow or lost in deep crevasses, while others have become landmarks along the route to the summit, earning nicknames such as ""Green Boots"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"".The presence of these bodies can have a psychological impact on climbers, as they believe they are entering a sacred space.Retrieving bodies from the ""death zone,"" where thin air and low oxygen levels increase the risk of altitude sickness, is a controversial and challenging task. It requires significant financial resources, with each body requiring up to eight rescuers and weighing over 100 kilograms (220 pounds).However, Major Karki emphasised the necessity of the rescue effort, saying, ""We have to bring them back as much as possible. If we keep leaving them behind, our mountains will turn into a graveyard.""The retrieved bodies, once brought down from the mountain, are transported to Kathmandu. Two of the bodies have been preliminarily identified, and authorities are awaiting detailed tests for final confirmation. Those that remain unidentified will likely be cremated.Despite the recovery efforts, the mountain still holds its secrets. The body of British climber George Mallory, who went missing during a 1924 summit attempt, was only discovered in 1999. His climbing partner, Andrew Irvine, and their camera, which could provide evidence of a successful summit and rewrite mountaineering history, have never been found.In addition to the body retrieval mission, the clean-up campaign, with a budget of over $600,000, employed 171 Nepali guides and porters to remove 11 tonnes of rubbish from the mountain.The well-trodden route to the summit is littered with fluorescent tents, discarded climbing equipment, empty gas canisters, and even human excreta. While current expeditions are under pressure to remove their waste, historic rubbish remains a challenge.As Tshiring Jangbu Sherpa, who led the body retrieval expedition, said, ""The mountains have given us mountaineers so many opportunities. I feel that we have to give back to them, we have to remove the trash and bodies to clean the mountains.""","Mount Everest is witnessing the effects of climate change as the snow and ice cover thins.

As per the record from the home ministry, landslides have claimed 14 lives followed by 13 deaths due to the lightning in the same period of time.Nepal has a high mortality rate due to landslides and flooding during monsoons on an annual basis, because of the terrain and unplanned urbanization as well as settlement in the slopes prone to landslides.The monsoon season in the Himalayan nation usually starts on June 13 and ends on September 23. Last year, it began on June 14, which was one day later than the usual start date.Nepal is expecting the monsoon to formally arrive on June 13 and will remain active for approximately three months. Over time, the government has estimated that up to 1.8 million people could be affected by rain-related incidents during the season.According to a statement by the 28th Session of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum released on April 29, above-normal rainfall is expected during the monsoon season over most parts of South Asia. However, some areas over northern, eastern, and northeastern parts of the region may experience below-normal rainfall.Landslides triggered by heavy rains in Nepal cause extreme damage to life, property, infrastructure, and the environment.In Tarai, tens of thousands of people are affected by floods every year. In the hills, landslides are the main natural disaster occurring very frequently, mostly during monsoon.This year, South Asian meteorologists say, there is a strong agreement among the experts that La Nina conditions are likely to develop over the equatorial Pacific during the second half of the southwest monsoon season.It is also recognised that the La Nina conditions are generally associated with the normal to above-normal southwest monsoon rainfall over most parts of South Asia.(With inputs from agency)","Eight people have been killed by landslides, five due to lightning, and one due to floods.

The agreement marks a key step in the country's economic recovery after defaulting on debt repayment in 2022.Sri Lanka is under an International Monetary Fund bailout program, and the debt treatment deal is expected to reopen the doors to bilateral transactions and the resumption of foreign projects stalled when the island nation defaulted.""This morning in Paris, Sri Lanka reached a final agreement with our official bilateral creditors . Similarly, we signed another agreement with China's exim bank today in Beijing. ... Sri Lanka won,"" Wickremesinghe said.Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 and suspended repayments on some $83 billion in domestic and foreign loans amid a severe foreign exchange crisis that led to a severe shortage of essentials such as food, medicine, fuel and cooking gas, and hours-long power cuts.Sri Lanka's crisis was largely the result of staggering economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which along with 2019 terrorism attacks devastated its important tourism industry. The coronavirus crisis also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad.Additionally, the then-government slashed taxes in 2019, depleting the treasury just as the virus hit. Foreign exchange reserves plummeted, leaving Sri Lanka unable to pay for imports or defend its beleaguered currency, the rupee.Wickremesinghe said with these agreements, Sri Lanka will be able to defer all bilateral loan instalment payments until 2028. Furthermore, Sri Lanka will be able to repay all the loans on concessional terms, with an extended period until 2043.According to a previous president's office statement, the agreements would cover $10 billion, but further details on the mode of restructuring were not immediately announced.By 2022, Sri Lanka had to repay about $6 billion in foreign debt every year, amounting to about 9.2 per cent of gross domestic product. The agreement would enable Sri Lanka to maintain debt payments at less than 4.5 per cent of GDP between 2027 and 2032.As Wickremesinghe addressed the nation, his supporters the watched the speech on a giant screen in the capital Colombo and celebrated the announcement by lighting firecrackers and partaking traditional milk rice.The economic upheaval led to a political crisis that forced then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign in 2022. The Parliament then elected Wickremesinghe as president.Sri Lanka suspended repayment of its debt as it ran short of foreign currency needed to pay for imports of fuel and other essentials. Shortages led to street protests that changed the country's leadership. The IMF approved a four-year bailout program last March.The economic situation has improved under Wickremesinghe, and severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine have largely abated. But public dissatisfaction has grown over the government's effort to increase revenue by raising electricity bills and imposing heavy new income taxes on professionals and businesses, as part of the government's efforts to meet the IMF conditions.After Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy, all projects funded by foreign loans were also halted.On Wednesday, Wickremesinghe said the new agreements would pave the way to resume the foreign funded projects such as highways, light railway and airport development and also initiate new projects too.",Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 and suspended repayments on some $83 billion in domestic and foreign loans.

NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh signed 10 agreements/ MoUs and announced over a dozen other initiatives - spanning across areas like connectivity, health, trade, energy, defence and maritime cooperation - as PM Narendra Modi hosted his counterpart Sheikh Hasina for the first state visit after the formation of the new NDA government. Among the new initiatives was an announcement by Modi after the meeting that India will soon send a technical team to Bangladesh for management and conservation of the Teesta river inside Bangladesh.The announcement is significant as it comes amid efforts by China to convince Dhaka to allow it to develop the Teesta basin. Aware of India’s reservations about China’s role, Bangladesh has maintained it will consider “geopolitical issues” before going ahead with the project, which will apparently cost $ 1 billion.Hasina is expected to soon visit China, a country Dhaka - in a fine balancing act - continues to have strong economic ties with for its development needs. “As part of our development cooperation, we will also undertake conservation and management of Teesta River inside Bangladesh with Indian assistance within a mutually agreed timeframe,” said a joint statement, in which the leaders announced a shared vision for commerce, connectivity and collaboration.Sharing of Teesta waters has remained a long outstanding issue between the countries, after opposition from West Bengal prevented them from signing a water-sharing agreement finalised during the UPA government. India’s technical team is expected to first examine if there’s any need for a reservoir to be built, something which the Chinese have reportedly suggested. For India, it’s important that Bangladesh remains mindful of Indian security concerns while pursuing economic projects with Beijing.The leaders also welcomed formation of a Joint Technical Committee to initiate discussions for the renewal of the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty of 1996. They pledged to intensify cooperation in border management, counterterrorism and against radicalisation, while agreeing to start talks for a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA).“We have prepared a futuristic vision for cooperation in new areas. We have managed to restore in the past 10 years connectivity that was there before 1965. We will now focus on energy and digital connectivity. We will soon launch CEPA negotiations to take our economic cooperation to new heights,” said Modi.There was focus on long-term defence cooperation as well as India and Bangladesh signed an MoU for cooperation concerning military education in the field of strategic and operational studies. For modernization of the Bangladesh Armed Forces, the leaders said they will explore defence industrial cooperation, while ramping up military engagements in the form of exercises, training and capability development.The 2 countries announced signing of agreements for digital and green partnerships, as also a significant initiative by India to provide e- visa for medical patients from Bangladesh. “To facilitate easier cross-border travel and as a supportive gesture to the friendly people of Bangladesh, India will extend e-Medical Visa facility to people from Bangladesh travelling to India for medical treatment,” said the joint statement, adding India will also help Dhaka with supply of essential commodities.Other major announcements included new Assistant High Commission of India in Rangpur in Bangladesh, train service between Rajshahi and Kolkata and bus service between Chittagong and Kolkata. To promote sub-regional connectivity, government said India will extend transit facilities for movement of Bangladesh goods to Nepal and Bhutan through railway network.India is also looking at early operationalization of two Special Economic Zones (SEZs) offered by Bangladesh to India in Mongla and Mirsharai and to opening of new border-haats. The 2 countries also signed an MoU to enhance railway connectivity. The joint statement also said they will pursue collaboration in frontier technologies, including civil nuclear, oceanography and space technology. “To this end, we will partner in joint development of a small satellite for Bangladesh and its launch using Indian launch vehicle,” it said.",India and Bangladesh signed 10 agreements/ MoUs and announced over a dozen other initiatives.
