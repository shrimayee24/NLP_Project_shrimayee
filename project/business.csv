"Jio’s IPO set for 2025, likely to be India’s biggest: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jios-ipo-set-for-2025-likely-to-be-indias-biggest-report/articleshow/114963676.cms,"Reliance intends to proceed with the Jio IPO in 2025, following the company's achievement of becoming India's leading telecom provider.

NEW DELHI/HONG KONG:

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani targets a 2025 Mumbai listing for his telecom business Jio, valued by analysts at over $100 billion, and plans to launch his retail unit’s IPO much later, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.Reliance Industries’ boss Ambani hasn’t updated his IPO timelines after saying in 2019 that Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail would “move towards” a listing within five years. In recent years, Ambani, Asia’s richest man, raised $25 billion collectively for digital, telecom and retail businesses from the likes of KKR, General Atlantic and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, valuing both ventures at above $100 billion.The two sources said Reliance has now firmed up plans to launch the Reliance Jio IPO in 2025 as it internally believes it has achieved a stable business and revenue stream in becoming India’s No. 1 telecom player with 479 million subscribers.But the retail business IPO is not expected until after 2025 as the company first needs to address some internal business and operatio nal challenges, said the first source. Reliance Industries did not respond to a request for comment.Reliance aims for the 2025 Jio IPO to be India’s biggest ever, overtaking Hyundai India’s record $3.3 billion IPO this year, said the first source. Both the sources, who declined to be named as the discussions are private, said the IPO timelines can still change.","Reliance Industries’ boss Ambani hasn’t updated his IPO timelines after saying in 2019 that Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail would “move towards” a listing within five years.

"After Demchok, Army undertakes first full-fledged patrol in Depsang",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-demchok-army-undertakes-first-full-fledged-patrol-in-depsang/articleshow/114955764.cms,"(File photo tweeted by 14 Corps)

NEW DELHI: The Army “successfully” undertook a full-fledged patrol to one of the five patrolling points (PPs) in the Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh on Monday, after conducting similar patrols in Demchok last week.“After the consensus reached between India and China on October 21 for disengagement, both sides had earlier undertaken verification patrols in Demchok and Depsang. Full-fledged patrolling had then resumed in Demchok,” a senior officer told TOI.On Monday, a patrol of 15 soldiers was sent to one of the PPs in Depsang Plains as well, with prior intimation to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) as per the bilateral pact on “patrolling arrangements” announced on October 21.“After the verification patrols, this was the first independent patrol sent in Depsang. It came back to base after several hours on Monday evening and reported there were no hindrances put up by the PLA on the way,” he added.With the “task” assigned to the patrol being “completed”, the Army will now also send patrols to the other four PPs in Depsang. “The ball has been set in motion,” the officer said, after the new pact led to disengagement in the remaining two of the seven major face-off sites that arose after multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020.“This is yet another positive step towards maintaining peace and tranquillity on the Line of Actual Control,” the Leh-based 14 Corps also said in a post on `X’ late on Monday night, with a “file photo” attached to it.Though the Army now has “unrestricted access” to the five PPs in Depsang and two in Demchok, which was earlier blocked by Chinese soldiers, long-duration patrols to certain areas will be a “tough task” due to the approaching winter. “We will patrol some areas throughout the winter, but it will not be possible in a few other places due to weather conditions,” he said.Also read: Did US play any role in India-China LAC agreement? State department responds The PLA, too, is conducting similar patrols with advance information to India to prevent the possibility of any clash. As part of the earlier verification patrols, Indian soldiers had gone up to PP-10, 11, 11A, 12 and 13 in Depsang Plains for the first time in almost five years through the “Bottleneck”, the area around 18-km inside Indian territory where the PLA was blocking them from going any further since April-May 2020.After the Depsang-Demchok pact, India now wants the restoration of patrolling rights in areas where “no patrol buffer zones” were established after previous rounds of disengagement till September 2022.These buffer zones at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3-km to 10-km, largely came up on what India considers to be its own territory.There is, of course, still a long way to go for India’s demand for de-escalation and de-induction of the over 50,000 PLA troops forward deployed in eastern Ladakh, with another 90,000 across Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector, to be accepted by China.","The Army ""successfully"" undertook a full-fledged patrol to one of the five patrolling points (PPs) in the Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh on Monday.

However, while being taken away from the court, Sanjay Roy denied charges, claiming that he was being framed in murder of the trainee doctor.""I have been framed. I told the judge that I am innocent but they did not listen to me,"" says accused Sanjay Roy while being taken out of Sealdah court.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is leading the investigation, had filed a charge sheet against Sanjay Roy about a month ago. The other two arrested in connection with the August 9 rape and murder of the junior doctor – former RG Kar principal Sandip Ghosh and ex-Tala OC Abhijit Mandal – were accused of conspiracy and evidence tampering.Previously, a Sealdah court had ordered that charges be formally filed on November 4, with an in-camera trial set to commence on November 5, running four days per week. Roy faced charges under specific sections relating to rape and murder, which, if proven, could result in the death penalty.In the charge sheet submitted on October 7, the CBI claimed that Roy’s involvement in the crime was “clearly established” through 11 points of evidence, including oral testimonies, documents, forensic findings, and other supporting evidence. CCTV footage confirmed Roy’s presence on the third floor during the night of August 8-9, while his phone records aligned with his presence at that location. Roy’s defense has signaled plans to challenge the charges.The evidence against Roy appears significant. The police, who initially handled the investigation, found Roy’s jeans and shoes with the victim’s bloodstains. DNA analysis confirmed matches between Roy and the victim. Additionally, it was confirmed that Roy sustained injuries between the night of August 8 and midday on August 9, coinciding with the timeframe of the crime. A Bluetooth device at the scene was also linked to Roy’s phone.","West Bengal's Sealdah Court on Monday framed charges against prime accused Sanjay Roy in the RG Kar rape-murder.

""Yes, Mysore Lokayukta has issued a notice regarding MUDA.

Among those involved is CM Siddaramaiah’s wife, Parvathi, who was also summoned by Lokayukta police on October 25.The compensatory land parcels allocated to Parvathi date back to Siddaramaiah’s earlier tenure as chief minister and have raised concerns about potential favoritism and financial impropriety.While Siddaramaiah has denied any wrongdoing, calling the accusations “politically motivated,” he said that the land allotment to his wife took place during the BJP's administration, framing it as a legitimate compensation process.""They (BJP) are the ones who gave the site; now if they call it illegal, how should one respond?"" he questioned in defence.The Muda case also implicates top officials from Muda and the revenue department, further intensifying scrutiny around the scheme.",Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah received a summons from the Lokayukta police to appear before it on November 6.

Kharge had also highlighted that of the 18,940 teaching posts across 46 central universities, 27% remain vacant, with higher vacancy rates for SC (32.1%), ST (40.3%), and OBC (41.8%) categories.Congress has a ""habit of lying"", Pradhan said, citing that during the Congress-led UPA govt in 2014, 37% of central university posts were unfilled, with severe under-representation in the reserved categories - 57% for SC, 63% for ST and 60% for OBC.The Modi govt has made significant strides in reducing these vacancies, Pradhan said and added that although the number of sanctioned posts increased to 18,940 by 2024, the overall vacancy rate has dropped to 26.8%.

Nothing wrong in PM Modi's visit to my residence for Ganpati puja: CJI Chandrachud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nothing-wrong-in-pm-modis-visit-to-my-residence-for-ganpati-puja-cji-chandrachud/articleshow/114962239.cms,"NEW DELHI: Addressing the controversy over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to his residence for Ganpati prayers, Chief Justice of India (CJI) D Y Chandrachud on Monday said there was ""nothing wrong"" in it and underscored the need for a ""sense of maturity in political sphere"" on such issues. Following the PM's visit to the CJI residence, opposition parties led by the Congress and a section of lawyers had raised concerns over propriety and separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive. The BJP, on the other hand, dismissed the criticism as unwarranted and said it was a ""part of our culture"".Speaking at an event organised by the Indian Express, CJI Chandrachud said one has to respect that the dialogue between the judiciary and the executive takes place as a part of the robust inter-institutional mechanism and separation of powers does not mean the two will not meet.""The separation of powers concept does not postulate that judiciary and executive are antagonist in the sense they will not meet or not engage in a reasoned dialogue. In the states, there is a protocol of chief justice and the administrative committee of the high court meeting the chief minister and on the chief minister meeting the chief justice at their residence. In most of these meetings, you are discussing basic issues like budgeting, infrastructure, technology, etc,"" he said.On the prime minister's visit, the CJI shared, ""The PM visited my residence for Ganpati puja. I do feel, there is absolutely nothing wrong as these are continuing meetings between the judiciary and the executive even at the social level. We meet at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Republic Day, etc. We are in conversation with the prime minister and the ministers. This conversation does not involve the cases which we decide but life and society in general.""The CJI, who demits office on November 10, said, ""There has to be a sense of maturity in the political system to understand this and trust our judges because the work we do is evaluated by our written word. Everything we decide is not kept in wraps and is open to scrutiny.""He said a robust dialogue taking place between the executive and the judiciary on the administrative side had nothing to do with the judicial side.""What the separation of powers postulates is that the judiciary should not be performing the role of the executive which is defining policies because the power to frame policy belongs to the government. Likewise the executive does not decide the cases. So long we have this in mind. Dialogue has to take place because you are dealing with the careers and the lives of people in the judiciary,"" he said.The CJI said the dialogue between the judiciary and the executive had nothing to do with how cases were decided. ""That has been my experience.""Even his statement of having prayed to God for a solution to the Ayodhya Ram Mandir dispute had attracted considerable clamour.CJI Chandrachud called himself a ""person of faith"" who respected all religions equally.""It is a problem of social media. You must have the backdrop of where I was speaking. I visited my village which is 1.5 hours from Pune. It is predominantly an agricultural community. The question which I was asked was that in the arena of conflict in the court how do you stay calm.""I said everyone has his own mantra and my mantra (not religious) of life is to spend time on reflection on myself. When I said that I sit before a deity, I am not defensive about the fact I am a man of faith. I have my own faith and equally respect all faiths,"" he said.""My being a person who professes a particular faith has nothing to do with how I will treat people of different faiths who come to me seeking justice. Every case is decided in accordance with law and the constitution. If someone's faith gives a sense of calm and degree of objectivity to look beyond conflict so be it and that people must accept. The fact that you belong to a particular faith has nothing to do with your ability to do justice to people of different faith,"" he said.His statement had come while addressing the residents of his native Kanhersar Village in Khed Taluka during a felicitation ceremony, when he said he had prayed to God for a solution to the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute and asserted God will find a way if one has faith.""Very often we have cases (to adjudicate) but we don't arrive at a solution. Something similar happened during the Ayodhya (Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute) which was in front of me for three months. I sat before the deity and told him he needs to find a solution,"" he had said.""One look at our cause list, would indicate the diversity which comes to our court,"" the CJI added.When asked about his take on presser by four Supreme Court judges in 2018 against ex-CJI Dipak Misra, Chandrachud said there has to be institutional discipline and he believed that there is always a room for a dialogue.Commenting on CJI-designate Justice Sanjiv Khanna , Chandrachud said he is an objective and calm human being and can smile even in serious conflict.""The Court is in safe and secure hands post my retirement,"" he added.When asked if he would like to tweak the frame of the Ganesh Puja picture and include the Leader of Opposition (LoP) and judges of the apex court, Chandrachud, in a lighter vein, said that he would not include the LoP as it was not a selection committee for appointment of Central Vigilance Commissioner or Director of CBI.""On occasion such as marriages, deaths, there are social visits. When my mother died, I had a visit from the chief minister of the state. These are elementary courtesies. We must understand that judiciary has a sense of maturity. The fact is that deals are never cut like these, so trust us. We are not here to cut deals. To cast impute motives on judges is denigrating the society,"" he added.Responding to a question on delay in hearing on the bail plea of former JNU student Umar Khalid in Delhi riots case, CJI Chandrachud said in media a particular case assumes significance and then the court is criticized on that particular case.""After I took over as CJI, I decided to prioritise bail cases as it pertains to personal liberty. It was decided that at least every bench of the top court should hear 10 bail cases. Between November 9, 2022, and November 1, 2024, 21,000 bail cases were filed in the Supreme Court. During this period, 21,358 bail cases have been disposed of.""As many as 967 Prevention of Money Laundering Act cases were filed during this period and 901 cases have been disposed of.

Is private property within Art 39(b) ambit? Supreme Court to give verdict today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-private-property-within-art-39b-ambit-supreme-court-to-give-verdict-today/articleshow/114961211.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court will pronounce its verdict on Tuesday on two important issues - correctness of its 1978 view that the state can distribute public and private resources for the greater common good, and the validity of Allahabad HC's decision ordering closure of madrassas terming them 'non-secular'.Both verdicts will be delivered by benches of different strengths led by CJI D Y Chandrachud. A nine-judge bench will decide on the meaning of Article 39(b), which is part of the Directive Principles of State Policy that mandate states to direct its policies towards securing ""that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good"". A three-judge bench will rule on the validity of HC's madrassa verdict.SC will decide the correctness of Justice Krishna Iyer's singular socialist view in 1978 that public as well as private resources fall within the ambit of Article 39(b), which was upheld by a series of SC judgments between 1982 and 1996. In 2002, a seven-judge bench reopened the issue while adjudicating the validity of an amendment to Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act that had incorporated the stated objective of Article 39(b) and referred it to a nine-judge bench, which reserved its verdict on May 1.Allahabad HC on March 22 had quashed the UP Board of Madrassa Education Act, 2004, terming it to be violative of principles of secularism, and directed the state to admit over 12 lakh students studying in 13,364 madrassas in regular schools recognised by the state education board. This was challenged by various madrassas and madrassa teachers' associations.The HC decision appears to be on shaky ground as even the UP govt defended the validity of the Act before SC even though it had not appealed to the top court against the verdict. The state had said it would defend its legislation before SC and that the law may require reforms to mainstream madrassas, as educational certificates issued by them were recognised only till Class 12. HC had agreed with the UP govt, and while reserving its verdict on Oct 22, had said, ""The state has a vital interest in mainstreaming madrassas, otherwise, how do these institutions produce worthy citizens if they are not acquainted with mathematics, science and other such mainstream subjects? We will interpret the Act that way. But to strike down the Act entirely is akin to throwing the baby out with the bath water.""","Both verdicts will be delivered by benches of different strengths led by CJI D Y Chandrachud.

NEW DELHI: The Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) is celebrating a significant achievement with its student film, ' Sunflowers Were the First Ones to Know ', directed by Chidananda S Naik , qualified for the Oscars 2025 in the Live Action Short Film category.This milestone follows a series of accolades, including winning first prize in the prestigious La Cinef Selection at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, which brought international attention to the film.Created in Kannada, 'Sunflowers Were the First Ones to Know' is inspired by Indian folk stories and traditions. The plot centres on an elderly woman who steals a rooster, disrupting the cycle of sunlight in her village and plunging the community into chaos. In an attempt to restore balance, a prophecy is invoked, and the woman's family is exiled to undertake a journey to retrieve the rooster.Naik, along with a skilled FTII team, brought this vision to life.At Cannes, the La Cinef Jury lauded the film, describing it as ""an illumination that, from the depths of the night, shines with humor and a keen sense of direction."" Naik expressed his long-standing desire to tell this story, stating, ""Our goal was to recreate the experience of not merely hearing these stories but of genuinely living them.""","'Sunflowers Were the First Ones to Know' is inspired by Indian folk stories and traditions.

NHAI to launch first-ever bank-driven toll collection system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhai-to-launch-first-ever-bank-driven-toll-collection-system/articleshow/114890904.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: In a first, NHAI will rope in a bank to collect user fee on a highway stretch, marking a paradigm shift in the tolling system in the country. It has invited bids for selecting an acquirer bank for country’s first multi-lane free flow (MLFF) toll collection on the recently-opened Dwarka Expressway The MLFF tolling stretch will have no physical plaza. The tolling system will consist of field equipment and sensors mounted on gantries, which will capture information from passing vehicles. This data will be transmitted to the electronic toll payment system for the deduction of user fee.There will be no need for a separate toll collector or operator. Banks that offer maximum revenue share will get the tolling rights.The 28-km urban expressway will have only one tolling point at the Delhi-Gurgaon border, about 9 km from the Delhi side. Only vehicles crossing this point will have to pay user fee. Govt has not yet notified the toll rate for the stretch. The successful bidder, which will get the tolling right for three years, will have to put the system in place within three months of securing the contract.Considering that banks have no expertise in direct toll collection, NHAI’s subsidiary responsible for tolling, IHMCL has allowed them to engage sub-contractors to carry out the task. As per the bid document, the sub-contractors must have the experience of implementing MLFF-based tolling on at least 200 km and for 10 years in India or abroad.NHAI is looking at bringing more new greenfield expressways under MLFF to reduce congestion, pollution and make travel hassle-free. “Since banks are regulated by RBI, they will follow a more transparent system and there will be no leakage of revenue,” said an official.While the acquirer bank will deduct toll from the Fastag wallet, the system will also flag vehicles with faulty tags or no tags. It will automatically share the details of non-payment of tolls with the Vahan database, the central depository of registered vehicles. Pending toll will be reflected on the Vahan portal or app with the vehicle's photo for evidence when the owner logs in. Clearing pending dues will be made mandatory for getting NOC and fitness certificate.","The 28-km urban expressway will have only one tolling point at the Delhi-Gurgaon border.

'Not right to play blame game'

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said the grenade attack at the ‘Sunday market’ in Srinagar was ""deeply disturbing"" and that there was ""no justification for targeting innocent civilians"".

As the world’s largest economy and strongest military power, the United States, approaches its presidential election on November 5, the stakes are high for many countries, including world's largest democracy, India.The US presidential polls could have substantial consequences for global stability and growth, especially given the distinct policy differences between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump . The global economy, including India’s own economic landscape, may experience major shifts based on the outcome of this pivotal vote.The United Nations has dubbed 2024 ""the biggest election year in human history."" With nearly half the world’s population eligible to vote, including people across 72 countries, the significance of certain elections overshadows others. Among them, the US election stands out as one of the most consequential. As the US heads to the polls, the world watches with bated breath, aware that American leadership has far-reaching implications across continents.If former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump wins his second term, India’s future relationship with the United States can possibly take a new direction. Trump, who has shown a keen interest in enhancing ties with India, has made public commitments to strengthening what he calls the “great partnership” between the two nations. In a recent post on X, timed just ahead of the US election, Trump reaffirmed his friendship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi , celebrating their close diplomatic relationship.In his strategic outreach to the Indian diaspora, Trump condemned the recent violence against Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh, where reports indicate significant attacks on the Hindu community.This statement comes amid complex South Asian geopolitics, with former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reportedly seeking refuge in India following her ouster. Trump’s message underscores his intent to uphold security and respect for minorities in South Asia, signaling potential shifts in US foreign policy under his administration.""Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America. They have been a disaster from Israel to Ukraine to our own southern border, but we will make America strong again and bring back peace through strength!"" former US president said in a Diwali message on X.Hindu American groups also have applauded Trump for promising to protect the human rights of Hindus across the world, including the US and Bangladesh and protect them from the ""anti-religion agenda of the radical left.""The friendship between Trump and Modi is not new. Their camaraderie was vividly displayed at the 2019 “Howdy, Modi!” event in Texas, where Trump hosted Modi in front of a crowd of 50,000, one of the largest US gatherings for a foreign leader. In early 2020, Trump reciprocated with a visit to India for the ""Namaste Trump"" event in Ahmedabad, attended by over 100,000 people at the world’s largest cricket stadium. These high-profile events reflect a mutual admiration, with Trump praising PM Modi’s leadership and India’s economic progress.PM Modi’s “India first” vision aligns with Trump’s “America First” platform, with both leaders emphasising domestic growth, economic nationalism, and secure borders. Their similar ideologies have fostered an alignment of US-India interests, which could deepen further should Trump win the election. Trump’s emphasis on strategic partnerships may lead to closer economic and defense collaboration with India, impacting areas from trade to military cooperation.A Trump administration would likely pursue US-centric trade policies, pushing India to reduce trade barriers or face tariffs. This could impact key Indian sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles, which have considerable US market exports. Trump has been vocal about his concerns over India’s tariffs, calling the country an “abuser” on the matter while recognizing Modi as a “fantastic man.” By pushing for balanced trade, Trump’s approach may challenge India to recalibrate its trade strategies, though it also opens doors for potential opportunities.Trump’s opposition to China, particularly regarding trade and security, may benefit India. His administration’s push to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing could encourage US companies to diversify their supply chains. With favorable policies, India could attract these companies, positioning itself as an alternative production hub and potentially accelerating economic growth.Trump’s previous administration reinforced the Quad—a security partnership between the US, India, Japan, and Australia—to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Under Trump’s leadership, a second term would likely see a continuation of joint military exercises, arms sales, and technology transfers. Such defence collaboration would bolster India’s military capabilities, especially given its tensions with neighboring countries like China and Pakistan.Trump’s restrictive immigration policies, particularly concerning the H-1B visa program, have affected many Indian professionals in the US. If re-elected, Trump may revive these policies, creating obstacles for skilled Indian workers and potentially impacting sectors dependent on Indian talent, especially technology. Stricter immigration policies could prompt Indian tech firms to explore alternative markets or invest more domestically, creating new dynamics in the global talent landscape.Trump’s South Asia policies may impact India’s regional interests. Though he has shown a willingness to cooperate with Pakistan, Trump has also demanded accountability in counter-terrorism. His “Peace through strength” approach could signal a tougher US stance on terrorism and extremism, aligning with India’s own security concerns. A Trump-led US may exert more pressure on Pakistan to curb militant activities, potentially benefiting India’s security objectives.","The US presidential polls could have substantial consequences for global stability and growth.

The counting of the votes in the US election extends beyond election night, and the timing will vary from state to state. The US has four main time zones( Eastern Time, Central, Mountain, and Pacific Standard Time), and the election timing is also different among the time zones. Many states had early voting though November 5 is the election day.Counting starts after the ballots are cast. Handmarked paper ballots and ballots filled using BMD (Ballot marking devices) are counted using optical scanners and then tabulated by computers.

Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio IPO set to debut on stock market in 2025; may be biggest ever IPO in India: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mukesh-ambanis-reliance-jio-ipo-set-to-debut-on-stock-market-in-2025-may-be-biggest-ever-ipo-in-india-report/articleshow/114943160.cms,"Reliance intends to proceed with the Jio IPO in 2025, following the company's achievement of becoming India's leading telecom provider.

Reliance Jio IPO : Mukesh Ambani , the Indian billionaire, is planning to list his telecommunications company Jio on the stock exchange by 2025. Analysts value the company at more than $100 billion, while his retail business IPO is scheduled for a later date, according to a Reuters report.Despite announcing in 2019 that both Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail would progress toward listing within five years, Ambani has not yet provided updated timelines. As Asia's wealthiest individual, he successfully secured $25 billion in investments from prominent firms like KKR, General Atlantic, and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority for his digital, telecom, and retail ventures.Reliance intends to proceed with the Jio IPO in 2025, following the company's achievement of becoming India's leading telecom provider with 479 million subscribers. However, the retail division's public offering is expected to occur after 2025 due to pending operational matters.The company faces potential competition from Elon Musk's Starlink service in India. Jio, supported by Google and Meta, has established a partnership with Nvidia for artificial intelligence development.While specific valuation details and banking partners remain undecided, Jefferies estimated Jio's IPO value at $112 billion in July. Reliance aims to surpass Hyundai India's $3.3 billion IPO record in India, though IPO timelines could be subject to change.The Indian market has shown strong performance, with 270 companies raising $12.58 billion through IPOs by October, surpassing the previous year's total of $7.42 billion.Reliance plans to stagger the IPOs of its retail and Jio units to avoid simultaneous large public offerings, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.One source indicated there are ""operational issues"" within the retail division that Reliance wants to address before pursuing an IPO. The unit operates India's largest network of 3,000 grocery supermarkets.The retail business has expanded rapidly across various formats, including online sales. However, some physical stores have experienced losses over time, resulting in suboptimal revenue per square foot of retail space.The retail division encompasses fashion, grocery, and electronics stores, and has expanded into e-commerce to compete with Amazon. The company is currently focusing on rapid delivery services to capitalize on the emerging quick commerce sector, offering 10-minute deliveries.The company recorded its first quarterly revenue decline in at least three years during July-September, showing a 1.1% decrease year-over-year. This decline is attributed to increasing competition from quick commerce competitors affecting supermarket sales.Bernstein analysts valued the business at $112 billion last year. The company owns Hamleys and maintains partnerships with premium brands like Jimmy Choo, Marks & Spencer, and Pret A Manger in India.Foreign investors own 33% of Jio Platforms, which manages telecom and digital operations, after investing $17.84 billion. Similarly, Reliance Retail has sold approximately 12% stake to international investors, raising $7.44 billion during the same period.","Reliance intends to proceed with the Jio IPO in 2025, following the company's achievement of becoming India's leading telecom provider.

Why BSE Sensex, Nifty50 have crashed today

Market analysts attribute the selling pressure to the upcoming US presidential elections on November 5 and anticipated stimulus measures from China to boost its economy. Continuous selling by foreign investors also affected market sentiment negatively.

Stock market crash today: The BSE Sensex plunged 942 points to reach a three-month low, while Nifty declined over 1 percent, closing under 24,000. The decline was primarily due to significant selling in Reliance Industries and banking stocks. The BSE Sensex fell 941.88 points (1.18%) to close at 78,782.24, its lowest since August 6. During trading, it dropped as much as 1,491.52 points (1.87%) to 78,232.60. The NSE Nifty decreased by 309 points (1.27%) to 23,995.35.Major decliners in the Sensex included Adani Ports, Reliance Industries, Sun Pharma, Bajaj Finserv, NTPC, Tata Motors, Axis Bank, and Titan.The gainers comprised Mahindra & Mahindra, Tech Mahindra, State Bank of India, HCL Technologies, Infosys, and IndusInd Bank.According to exchange data, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 211.93 crore on Friday.1. The upcoming U.S. presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump has created uncertainty. The election outcome could influence U.S. Federal Reserve policies and subsequently affect Indian interest rates.""In the next couple of days markets globally will be focused on the US presidential elections and there can be near-term volatility in response to the election outcome. However, this is likely to be short-lived and economic fundamentals like US growth, inflation and the Fed action will influence the market trend,"" said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.2. The Federal Reserve's November 7 policy meeting adds to market uncertainty, with expectations of a possible rate cut affecting investor behavior.3. Lower-than-expected Q2 corporate earnings have impacted market sentiment. ""The Indian market is facing headwinds from decelerating earnings growth. Nifty EPS growth as indicated by Q2 results may dip below 10% in FY25 which will render the present valuations of about 24 times estimated FY25 earnings, difficult to sustain. FIIs may continue to sell in this difficult earnings growth environment, constraining any rally in the market,"" said Vijayakumar.4. Oil prices increased over $1 early Monday after OPEC+ postponed its December output increase. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, rose 2.57% to USD 74.98 per barrel.October witnessed the largest-ever monthly outflow as foreign investors withdrew Rs 94,000 crore (approximately USD 11.2 billion) from Indian stocks, driven by high domestic equity valuations and attractive Chinese market opportunities.A National People's Congress committee meeting in China this week has sparked discussions about potential major government spending initiatives for economic growth.Asian markets in Seoul, Shanghai, and Hong Kong closed higher, while European markets showed mostly positive trends. US markets ended positively on Friday.","BSE Sensex plunged 942 points to reach a three-month low, while Nifty declined over 1 percent, closing under 24,000.

"Many Indian Americans turning Republican supporters, feels Srilekha Palle of American Hindu Coalition",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/many-indian-americans-turning-republican-supporters-feels-srilekha-palle-of-american-hindu-coalition/articleshow/114961380.cms,"TOI correspondent from US:

Indian Americans have traditionally supported the Democrats but since 2016, when Donald Trump became President, and after the Covid pandemic, there has been a big change in the mindset among many members of the community and an increasing number are moving towards the Republicans as well, feels Dr Srilekha Reddy Palle, a healthcare executive in the Washington DC area who is also political director of American Hindu Coalition , an organisation that advocates for Hindu Americans, and chair of the Virginia Asian advisory board.“Some of the reasons for Democrats losing favour among the Indian American community are their support for affirmative action in the education sector and over-use of the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion ( DEI ) in employment. Many of us immigrated to the US because we were attracted by the culture of meritocracy and preferred it over socialism that was prevalent in India. But affirmative action has hit many Indians professionals,” says Palle, who is a consultant specialising in healthcare and political consulting.She adds that for the thousands of Indian Americans, who run small businesses in the US, the Republicans and Trump are seen to be campaigning for more tax-friendly policies. “While there seems to be a bigger support among Indian American men for Trump; many women from our community are supporting Harris on the issue of reproductive rights,” Palle says.She adds that American Hindu Coalition does not endorse any one of the Presidential candidates over the other and looks forward to working with the administration that will be elected democratically. “The issues that are important for all of us, including Indian Americans, in this election include unemployment, tackling high crime rates, gas prices and illegal immigration. Going forward, whoever wins the elections tomorrow, our organisation will continue to push for the rights of Hindus in America and advocate for our community in schools, colleges and workplaces,” Palle said.","Indian Americans have traditionally supported the Democrats but since 2016, when Donald Trump became President, there has been a big change in the mindset among many members of the community.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Donald Trump or Kamala Harris Victory: Potential Impacts on Indian Stock Markets Amid US Election Results,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-election-results-what-would-a-donald-trump-or-kamala-harris-victory-mean-for-indian-stock-markets/articleshow/114941118.cms,"Analysts suggest that a Harris victory would maintain current economic conditions with minimal market impact, while a Trump win could significantly affect emerging markets.

Potential Effects of Harris's Victory on India

Historical US Market Performance Analysis:

US Elections : Financial markets appear to be positioning for a Donald Trump victory and Republican dominance in the upcoming November 5 US presidential election, despite the race remaining undecided, according to an ET report.Analysts suggest that a Kamala Harris victory would maintain current economic conditions with minimal market impact, while a Trump win could significantly affect emerging markets, equities, and currencies through reduced globalization policies.""If Trump is elected as President, it could imply higher rates, gold prices, and global USD regime than our base-case forecasts, while crude prices could be lower. A Harris victory could mean that the markets could trade closer to our base-case projections with rates likely to ease and global USD to trade flat,"" ICICI Bank's head of economic research Sameer Narang said.Financial experts indicate that among emerging economies, India could benefit from a Trump presidency due to its domestic consumption-focused growth, potential advantages from reduced commodity prices, supply chain alterations, and foreign relations.A Trump administration's restrictive trade policies could sustain strong US growth, potentially leading to Wall Street's superior performance compared to global markets.Also Read | ‘Mr Modi is fantastic…’: Prem Watsa, known as ‘Canada’s Warren Buffett’, says India can grow at 10% under PM Modi This scenario could trigger increased yields, particularly in long-term securities, as investors anticipate higher supply. ICICI Bank analysts predict stronger US dollar performance, decreased Brent crude prices, lower global base metal prices affecting Chinese growth, and elevated gold prices due to increased safe-haven demand.ICICI Bank projects that with Trump's victory, the US 10-year Treasury yield could reach 4.40%-4.50%, while the Dollar Index might rise to 105-106, potentially reaching 106.50 by December 2024.Nomura's analysis suggests India's predominantly domestic demand-driven economy would experience limited negative effects from slower US growth.According to Nomura's Sonal Varma, India could actually benefit from reduced commodity prices resulting from decreased Chinese growth and lower oil prices, influenced by increased fossil fuel production.A decrease in crude oil prices would benefit Indian oil marketing companies including BPCL, IOCL, and HPCL, while potentially negatively affecting ONGC, Oil India, and GAIL.Also Read | PM Modi highlights Mark Mobius’ ‘love for India’; says renowned global investor believes 50% should be invested in Indian stock market A Harris victory in the election would likely maintain current global and US economic structures, with expectations of a gradual economic alignment between the US and other nations influencing mid-term market dynamics.ICICI Bank indicates that various financial markets, including equities, energy, gold, base metals, and the US dollar, would likely remain stable without significant fluctuations.""In case of a Harris victory, we see the UST 10yr moving to the 4.00%-4.10% range and the DXY trading in the 101.50-103.50 range by December 2024. Global commodity prices could trade flat if Harris wins,"" it said.India's export performance to the US could benefit under Democratic leadership, considering the positive trade relationship during Biden's administration. According to Phillip Capital, Harris's anticipated support for skilled immigration policies would benefit India's IT sector.The Dow Jones, excluding recession-related declines, increased 28% under Bush, 78% during Obama's presidency, and 54% under Trump, while Biden's current term shows 41% growth.The Indian markets showed substantial growth during different US presidencies: Bush's term saw a 200% increase, Obama's presidency witnessed 55% growth, Trump's tenure recorded 63% gains, and Biden's administration has achieved 89% growth so far.","Financial markets appear to be positioning for a Donald Trump victory and Republican dominance in the upcoming November 5 US presidential election.

US presidential elections: New York features this Indian language on ballots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections-new-york-features-this-indian-language-on-ballots/articleshow/114962675.cms,"Representative image

New York City's linguistic diversity encompasses over 200 languages, as confirmed by the Department of City Planning, establishing its status as America's diverse cultural centre. For the US presidential elections, however, ballot papers will be available in only five languages, including English, with the inclusion of an Indian language. A key decision stemming from a lawsuit settlement led to the inclusion of Bengali on the ballot.The Bengali language is included alongside Chinese, Spanish, and Korean. This decision stems from a lawsuit settlement concerning language access for the city's diverse population.“We are required to service four other languages besides English. It is Chinese, Spanish, Korean and Bengali as the Asian languages,” said Micheal J Ryan, executive director, Board of Elections, NYC.The inclusion of Bengali, spoken by people from India and Bangladesh, is particularly significant for the South Asian community in Queens. The 2013 addition of Bengali-language ballots followed a federal mandate requiring the city to assist South Asian minority voters under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.This move aims to improve voter participation within the Bengali-speaking community, although it doesn't represent all languages spoken within the South Asian demographic.“There was a lawsuit about language access and as you know the country of India has a lot of different languages within it. The settlement of that lawsuit required within a certain population density to have an Asian Indian language. Then through some negotiations, they settled on Bengali. I understand the limitations of Bengali being the choice but it came out of a lawsuit.”Dr Avinash Gupta, President of the Federation of Indian Association, believes this initiative will empower the Indian community. “It will help the Indian population to go out and vote. That is how we can get our voices heard. We are a sizable population. It is heartening to see how Indians go out and vote and even contest elections.""New York City, home to over 200 languages according to the Department of City Planning, continues its commitment to facilitating voter participation amongst its diverse population.","The inclusion of Bengali, spoken by people from India and Bangladesh, is particularly significant for the South Asian community in Queens.

Trump supporter Shalabh Kumar hopes to influence Indian American voters with $1 million campaign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-supporter-shalabh-kumar-hopes-to-influence-indian-american-voters-with-1-million-campaign/articleshow/114960323.cms,"Trump supporter Shalabh Kumar during Diwali celebrations

TOI correspondent from US

: Indian American supporter of Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump, Shalabh Kumar , who is the founder of lobby group Republican Hindu Coalition (RHC), is running a whopping $1.2 million campaign, over the past four days, targeted at Hindu American and Indian American voters .“Our educational advertisement is running across 40 TV channels every 15 minutes, in the crucial battleground states; pointing out the policy differences between former President Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris regarding India and Hindu Americans. It talks about their past actions and expected future actions if elected,” Kumar told the Times of India.“Trump has made his support clear about atrocities against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh and in Canada. On the other hand, Harris is Hindu only in her name but has taken a stand against India and Hindus on different issues. Both she and Democratic President Joe Biden are surrounded by several advisors who are known for their radical Islamist and anti-India stand. Harris has also opposed the Indian government and the Bharatiya Janata Party leadership on the issue of the revocation of Article 370 and the status of Kashmir,” Kumar, who raised $1.5 million in 2016 for Trump’s successful presidential campaign, said.Commenting on the recent last-minute campaign, Kumar said that with Trump’s aides focusing on other issues and priorities earlier, the opportunity to target Indian American voters presented itself only last week when the former president put out a message on social media in support of Hindus on Diwali. “We all know that Trump has had big Diwali celebrations at his home in Mar-a-Lago and at the White House when he was president. His Diwali message supporting and greeting the Hindu community gave us the opening and ammunition to launch our campaign. We used some of our earlier recordings of the Diwali celebrations to make our points about the contrast in policies between Harris and Trump with regard to the Indian American community ,” Kumar said.He feels that his campaign, which is focused on the Indian American community in the three important battleground states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, will help influence 200,000 voters and push the needle in favour of the Republican candidate. “The campaigns by the Democratic South Asian community for Harris so far have been more generic and not targeted at the Hindu American community. We are razor focused on Indian Americans in the battleground states and hope to be successful,” Kumar said.","Shalabh Kumar is running a whopping $1.2 million campaign, over the past four days, targeted at Hindu American and Indian American voters. “Our educational advertisement is running across 40 TV channels every 15 minutes, in the crucial battleground states; pointing out the policy differences between former President Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris,” Kumar said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114960579,imgsize-66690,width-400,resizemode-4/114960579.jpg"

According to New York Post, Diddy's today's breakfast includes cereal, fruits and a breakfast cake. The lunch today, served at 11am, includes pasta with marinara sauce, meatballs and a garden salad. His birthday dinner options, to be served at 4pm, are chicken or tufu fried rice with black beans and carrots.The jail meal was revealed on his birthday while a month ago his attorney Marc Agnifilo complained about the jail food and said the food is the roughest part of his client's jail stint.Diddy was arrested in September on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation for engagement in prostitution. Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges and will now face trial next year. His arrest spread scare in the entertainment industry as his famous parties which were a cover-up for the forced sex that went on for days were well attended by Hollywood celebrities.As more and more complaints against Diddy are pouring in, reports claimed Diddy was captured on tape with eight celebrities and a few minors. It is believed that Diddy's ex-girlfriend Kim Porter owned some Diddy tapes which she gave to a man named Courtney Burgess before her death.Diddy's lawyers have asked a judge to restrict statements made by potential witnesses and their lawyers outside of court and cited the name of Courtney Burgess who has given many interviews in recent days. The team filed the documents Sunday asking the judge to expedite the process of responding to Diddy's motion for a gag order.Courtney was called to testify as he claimed he has or has seen ""salacious videos of Diddy and his celebrity friends"". Diddy's lawyers said all allegations of Burgess are false and by not treating such claims as an ""extortion scam"", the government is doing nothing to stop the online conspiracy theories.","Diddy was arrested in September on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation for engagement in prostitution.

SRINAGAR: Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, according to officials. This comes as the neighbouring country strengthens defence ties with Gulf and Western European countries, and its long-standing ally Turkiye, the officials said.The movement of the 155 mm guns, produced in collaboration with a Gulf nation under the supervision of a state-owned Chinese defence company , along the LoC was observed recently, they said.The guns -- a variant of SH-15 that is known for its 'shoot and scoot' capability -- can fire a range of munitions, including high-explosive, armour-piercing and smoke rounds, boasting of a maximum range of approximately 30 kilometres and a firing rate of up to six rounds per minute.Among the arsenal being tested is the refurbished M109, which has a firing range of 24 kilometres and can launch six shells in just 40 seconds. Initially acquired from a Western European country, this artillery system is now undergoing trials in its enhanced version, the officials said.Turkiye has contributed to this military enhancement with the deployment of a modern 105 mm artillery piece manufactured by a Turkish defence company, FNSS, they said.This medium-weight tank is equipped with a two-man turret armed with a standard 105 mm rifled gun capable of firing both armour-piercing and high-explosive ammunition.China has also been instrumental in bolstering Pakistan's military capabilities along the LoC, according to the officials.This assistance includes construction of fortified bunkers, provision of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), combat aerial vehicles, and advanced communication systems, the officials said.Early this year, China's North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) delivered the second batch of 56 SH-15 155 mm calibre wheeled self-propelled howitzers to the Pakistan army.Chinese support has also extended to the installation of encrypted communication towers and underground fibre optic cables along the LoC, the officials said.","Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm.
