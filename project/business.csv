‘Neutralised Pakistani drones through ... ’: CDS Anil Chauhan shares new details on Operation Sindoor; pitches for local tech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neutralised-pakistani-drones-through-cds-anil-chauhan-shares-new-details-on-operation-sindoor-pitches-for-local-tech/articleshow/122554205.cms,"Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan

NEW DELHI: Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan on Wednesday offered new insights into Operation Sindoor , describing how India successfully thwarted Pakistan’s use of drones and loitering munitions without sustaining any damage.Speaking at a defence workshop in Delhi, Chauhan said, “During Operation Sindoor, on 10th May, Pakistan used unarmed drones and loitering munitions. None of them inflicted any damage to the Indian military or civil infrastructure. Most were neutralised through a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic means, and some were even recovered in almost intact condition.”Operation Sindoor was India’s military response to the Pahalgam terror attack and involved airstrikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK). India also repelled subsequent aggression and targeted Pakistani airbases.Chauhan also addressed the strategic use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the need to develop indigenous counter-drone technologies.“When we talk about drones, what do you think these are — are they bringing an evolutionary change or a revolutionary change in warfare?” he said. “I think their development is evolutionary and their employment has been very revolutionary in warfare.As the realisation of their deployment and scope increased, the Army started using drones in a revolutionary manner — you have seen this in a number of wars fought by us. ”""Can't rely on imported niche tech crucial for our missions; dependence on foreign tech weakens preparedness,"" the CDS said.Chauhan was speaking at a workshop and exhibition titled ‘Indigenisation of critical components currently being imported from foreign OEMs in the areas of UAV & C-UAS’, organised by the Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff and the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies.Highlighting the broader historical shift in warfare, Chauhan added, “Evolutionary changes have made weapons and war fighting equipment smaller, faster, lighter, more efficient, more affordable… We had large, weighty rifles; now they are shorter, lighter, with longer ranges. The same applies to tanks and aircraft — they are now lighter, faster, and offer greater protection.”A defence ministry statement had said the event aims to align with India’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision and is expected to produce a strategic policy document focused on indigenisation. Chauhan’s remarks reinforced the urgent need to build indigenous systems suited to Indian terrain.""Recognising the importance of reducing the dependency on OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) for critical UAV and C-UAS components, the upcoming workshop-cum-exhibition aims to bring together all relevant stakeholders, including defence experts, policymakers, military leaders, scientists, and private industry, to develop a strategic roadmap for indigenisation,"" the ministry said.",Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan offered new insights into Operation Sindoor.

NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR: An NIA court in Delhi on Tuesday reserved its verdict on jailed Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid's plea for interim bail or custody parole to attend Parliament's monsoon session starting on July 21.A spokesman of Rashid's Awami Itihaad Party said that his counsels informed the court about an earlier interim bail granted to the MP on Sept 10 last year for campaigning for J&K assembly polls. Then the court had extended the interim bail period thrice, thereby affirming that he didn't pose any security threat, they argued.His counsels also mentioned Delhi HC had permitted Rashid to attend Parliament proceedings in custody on February 10 and March 25.However, NIA opposed the plea and contended that if he is permitted to attend Parliament in custody, he must bear the cost of travel. Rashid's counsel objected to this, arguing that as an elected MP, he is seeking permission purely in the interest of public service and the democratic mandate he represents, not for any personal convenience, and should not be made to bear such expenses.(Inputs from Naseer Ganai)","An NIA court in Delhi on Tuesday reserved its verdict on jailed Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid's plea for interim bail or custody parole.

Shubhanshu Shukla’s mission validates India’s astronaut selection & training: Former IAM chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shubhanshu-shuklas-mission-validates-indias-astronaut-selection-training-former-iam-chief/articleshow/122532761.cms,"File photo: Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla enjoying a stunning panoramic view of the Earth from the International Space Station (ISS). (Picture credit: ANI)

BENGALURU: For the first time, India’s astronaut training protocols are being tested and validated in real space conditions, said Air Vice Marshal Anupam Agarwal, former Commandant of the Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM), which is responsible for selecting and preparing Gaganyaan astronaut-designates.In an exclusive interview to TOI, Agarwal, who was an air commodore when he helmed IAM, described Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla ’s (Shux) current mission to the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the Axiom-4 mission as a critical milestone for India’s human spaceflight efforts.“The entire aerospace medicine process, physiological and psychological selection, is being validated. Not only was he selected well, but also the test standards we developed, the procedures we followed, the psychological selection methods, everything is now being put through a real microgravity test,” Agarwal said.“It is a fulfilling feeling,” he added. IAM’s involvement in astronaut screening goes beyond selection. It collects extensive baseline medical and physiological data before a mission. According to Agarwal, this data is now central to studying how microgravity affects Indian astronauts.“Changes, if any, will be compared with the kind of changes we expect in microgravity. We will study those extensively and try to determine whether our methods for collecting and interpreting baseline data were correct.This will bolster the entire process.”Agarwal said India’s limited past exposure to human spaceflight made missions like Shukla’s especially important. “This is extremely complicated and many developed nations have attempted it and were unable to achieve it. For us, international exposure is the best thing that could happen to this programme.”He added that knowledge about human spaceflight is often not openly shared in literature and can only be gained through experience. “If we want success, we must learn fast, learn accurately and learn what’s relevant.”Looking ahead to Gaganyaan and future Indian space missions, Agarwal said IAM’s role will be critical. “The aerospace medicine specialists are to the human what the engineers are to the spacecraft. They help design the human-use products, the man-machine interface, the safety of crew, acoustic, visual, vibration and acceleration standards, clothing, hygiene products and so on.”Reflecting on his personal experience of selecting India’s first set of astronaut-designates, Agarwal said shortlisting Shukla was a memorable moment for him and his team.“We agreed that we have been extremely lucky in life. The selection process allowed us to meet some of the brightest, most intelligent and professionally sound humans in the country. Shux is one of them. How many people have this opportunity? It was, is and will remain an excellent experience to meet Shux.”","For the first time, India’s astronaut training protocols are being tested and validated in real space conditions.

I-T department tapped many databases to identify likely offenders

NEW DELHI: The income tax department Monday launched a nationwide verification operation targeting individuals and entities facilitating fraudulent claims of deductions and exemptions in I-T returns.The exercise is not limited to deductions for donations to little-known political parties and charities but also those related to health insurance and medical expenses (Sec 80D and 80DDB of I-T Act), HRA (Sec 10(13A), interest on education and home loans and for purchase of vehicles (Sec 80E, 80EE and 80EEB), CBDT said.Those under lens are MNC staff, public sector companies, government bodies, academic institutions and entrepreneurs who have claimed deductions without valid justification, it said.The I-T department is now poised to take stern action against continued fraudulent claims, including penalties and prosecution wherever applicable. The ongoing verification exercise across 150 premises is expected to yield crucial evidence, including digital records, that will aid in dismantling networks behind these schemes and ensure accountability,"" the I-T dept said.This action follows a detailed analysis of ""misuse of tax benefits under I-T Act, 1961, often in collusion with professional intermediaries"", it said. It said that investigations have uncovered ""organised rackets"" operated by certain ITR preparers and intermediaries, who have been filing returns claiming fictitious deductions and exemptions. The move is a signal to individuals who take shortcuts and make claims without having evidence of deductions or expenses shown in returns.Tax authorities tapped multiple databases to identify likely offenders. It conducted search and seizures in several states, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Punjab, and MP, where it found evidence of fraudulent claims.CBDT said the actions follow an outreach conducted programme, asking taxpayers to revise their returns in case discrepancies were noticed. ""As a result, around 40,000 taxpayers have updated their returns in last four months, voluntarily withdrawing false claims amounting to Rs 1,045 crore. However, many remain non-compliant, possibly under influence of masterminds behind these evasion rackets,"" it said.","The exercise is not limited to deductions for donations to little-known political parties and charities.

Will bring Pahalgam attackers to justice: External affairs minister S Jaishankar at SCO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-bring-pahalgam-attackers-to-justice-external-affairs-minister-s-jaishankar-at-sco/articleshow/122534936.cms,"EAM Jaishankar with Chinese President Xi Jinping

NEW DELHI: The Pahalgam terrorist attack was deliberately conducted to undermine the tourism economy of J&K and sow a religious divide, said external affairs minister S Jaishankar at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers’ meeting in Tianjin, as his Pakistan counterpart Ishaq Dar looked on.The minister also said that while India will continue to approach new ideas and proposals by the SCO positively for “collective good”, such cooperation must be based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and in accordance with territorial integrity and sovereignty of member states.Recalling the strong condemnation of the April 22 attack by the UN Security Council (UNSC) – where China is a permanent and Pakistan non-permanent member – the minister called upon the Eurasian bloc to take an uncompromising position on terrorism and stressed India will continue to work to bring the perpetrators of the attack to justice.Jaishankar did not name Pakistan as the SCO Charter prohibits member-states from raising hostilities in bilateral relations but, like in his address at the same meeting in Islamabad last year, reminded his counterparts that the Organisation was founded to combat the 3 evils of terrorism, separatism and extremism.“Not surprisingly, they often occur together. Recently, we in India witnessed a graphic example in the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on 22 April 2025.It was deliberately conducted to undermine the tourism economy of Jammu and Kashmir, while sowing a religious divide,’’ said Jaishankar.The foreign ministers’ meeting looked to finalise the agenda, including the final declaration, for the SCO summit that will be hosted by President Xi Jinping in September and in which PM Narendra Modi is expected to participate too. India is pressing for a strong condemnation of terrorism in the declaration, including the Pahalgam attack.“The UNSC, of which some of us are currently members, issued a statement that condemned it in the strongest terms and ‘underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice’. We have since done exactly that and will continue doing so. It is imperative that the SCO, to remain true to its founding objectives, take an uncompromising position on this challenge,’’ added the minister.In a bilateral meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Monday, Jaishankar had described terrorism as a shared concern, expressing hope that SCO will strongly uphold zero tolerance against terrorism. Combating terrorism and ensuring a terror-free Afghanistan tops India’s priority list in the security-oriented group that is looking to expand cooperation in areas like trade, investment, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges.On Afghanistan, Jaishankar said it had been long on the SCO agenda and the compulsions of regional stability were buttressed by India’s longstanding concern for the well-being of the Afghan people. “The international community, particularly SCO members, must therefore step up with development assistance. India, for its part, will certainly do so,” he said.The minister also lamented the lack of assured transit within the SCO space, saying its absence undermines the seriousness of advocating cooperation in economic areas. This again was a dig at Pakistan which continues to block land access to Afghanistan and Central Asia for India.While talking about a world besieged by conflicts, competition and coercion, Jaishankar said that the challenge before SCO is to stabilize the global order, de-risk various dimensions and “through it all, address longstanding challenges that threaten our collective interests”.“The world is today moving towards greater multi-polarity. This is not just in terms of redistribution of national capacities, but also the emergence of effective groupings like SCO. Our ability to contribute to the shaping of world affairs will naturally depend on how well we come together on a shared agenda. That means taking everybody on board,” said Jaishankar.","The Pahalgam terrorist attack was deliberately conducted to undermine the tourism economy of J&K and sow a religious divide, said external affairs minister S Jaishankar.

NEW DELHI: A house in Bangladesh linked to three generations of Bengal’s most respected literary and cultural figures is being demolished, drawing sharp concern from the Indian government.The building in question is the ancestral home of renowned children’s author and publisher Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury, located in Mymensingh city. Upendrakishore was also the father of poet Sukumar Ray and grandfather of legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray .

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday pulled up a petitioner who claimed he was being harassed for feeding street dogs in Noida. A bench of justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta asked him why he couldn’t feed the animals at home.“Why don’t you feed them in your own house? Nobody is stopping you,” the bench said, adding, “Should every lane and every road be kept open just for large-hearted people? There’s space for animals, but no space for humans.”The petitioner’s lawyer argued that his client was following the Animal Birth Control Rules, 2023. Under Rule 20, the local residents' body or municipality is responsible for designating feeding spots for community animals. The lawyer said Noida authorities weren’t doing so, unlike Greater Noida.In response, the court suggested opening a shelter at home to feed the dogs. It also raised safety concerns, saying morning walkers and two-wheeler riders were often at risk due to street dogs. “Try going cycling in the morning and see what happens,” the court said.The plea pertains to a March 2025 Allahabad High Court order, in which the petitioner requested the proper implementation of the rules and protection from harassment.The high court had noted the need to protect both animals and people, saying that while stray dogs should be safeguarded under the law, public safety must also be considered. It cited recent attacks by dogs that led to serious injuries and even deaths.The high court had asked authorities to be sensitive to both the petitioner’s concerns and those of the general public. It directed them to ensure proper measures were taken to protect both street dogs and pedestrians.","A bench of justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta asked him why he couldn’t feed the animals at home.

Kanwar Yatra diktat: Supreme Court issues notice to UP govt; row over asking eateries to display names of owners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kanwar-yatra-diktat-supreme-court-issues-notice-to-up-govt-row-over-asking-eateries-to-display-names-of-owners/articleshow/122491336.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government on a batch of petitions challenging its directive mandating eateries and dhabas along the Kanwar Yatra route to display QR codes containing ownership information.The court has sought a response from the state.The petitions, filed by Delhi University professor Apoorvanand Jha and activist Aakar Patel, argue that the QR code requirement amounts to a digital version of religious profiling, in violation of a previous Supreme Court order. In July 2023, the court had stayed similar directives by the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, which required food sellers and hawkers to publicly display the names of owners and staff.“We deem it appropriate to pass interim order prohibiting the enforcement of the impugned directives,” the court had said in that earlier order, adding that vendors may only be asked to disclose the kind of food being served, not the identity of those running the establishments.The current petition alleges that the QR code measure is a “wilful disobedience” of the court's previous ruling. “These steps effectively serve the same unconstitutional end through digital means,” it said, citing media reports confirming that the codes allow customers to access ownership details.It further warns of the “grave and imminent risk” of harm to the rights of affected vendors, particularly those from minority communities. “Vague and overbroad directives deliberately mix up licensing requirements with the unlawful demand to display religious identity, and leave scope for violent enforcement… by vigilante groups and authorities,” the plea added.The petitioners have urged the court to immediately restrain the Uttar Pradesh government from continuing what they call an indirect implementation of a previously blocked policy.",Supreme Court issues notice to the Uttar Pradesh government on a batch of petitions.

65 in-flight engine shutdowns reported since 2020: RTI data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/65-in-flight-engine-shutdowns-reported-since-2020-rti-data/articleshow/122471505.cms,"Air India crash

HYDERABAD: Sixty-five in-flight engine shutdowns in five years. Eleven ""Mayday"" distress calls from aircraft cockpits in 17 months, excluding the London-bound AI-171 that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 and a diverted domestic IndiGo flight.These numbers, obtained by TOI through a Right to Information (RTI) query to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), suggest a scary reality: engine malfunctions plague airlines operating in India at the rate of nearly one incident a month.Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's report mentioning fuel cut-off to engines of the crashed AI Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner fits the broader pattern of technical failures being handled by experienced pilots, until one crops up that is unmanageable.DGCA data covers all engine shutdowns, including failures during take-off and mid-air. ""A total of 65 incidents related to in-flight shutdown of engines from 2020 to 2025 (till date) were reported across India,"" states the aviation regulator's RTI reply.In all 65 of these instances, pilots were able to safely manoeuvre aircraft to the nearest airport with a single, unaffected engine. Experts attribute engine shutdowns to technical issues ranging from low fuel to turbine malfunction and faulty electronic components.""Primary causes of engine shutdowns include blocked fuel filters, fuel contamination with water, interrupted fuel supply to engines, and foreign objects entering engine stack, all of which can halt flight operations,"" Capt C S Randhawa, president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told TOI.The RTI data shows that between Jan 1, 2024, and May 31, 2025, there were Mayday calls from 11 flights, reporting various technical glitches and seeking emergency landing. Besides AI-171, the list doesn't include a June 19 IndiGo flight from Guwahati to Chennai that had to be redirected to Bengaluru due to congestion at the destination, only for the aircraft to report low fuel around 35km before landing.RTI data reveals that four of the 11 flights issued distress calls due to technical glitches and landed at Hyderabad.Airline Pilots' Association of India states that Mayday signals are exclusively used in life-threatening situations, distinguishing them from ""Pan Pan"" urgency alerts.""Flight crew initiate MAYDAY calls when confronted with critical emergencies such as aircraft fires, engine failures or situations posing imminent danger, necessitating immediate landing or grounding as continued flight becomes unsafe,"" said Anil Rao, secretary of ALPA India.AX Joseph, director of air safety at DGCA, said the aviation regulator was responsible for promulgating ""civil aviation requirements, circulars, aeronautical information circulars and public notices for compliance by the stakeholders to ensure safe operations"".While experts say that in-flight engine shutdowns and Mayday calls aren't uncommon across the world, India's position in global aviation safety standards may not be confidence-inspiring. The International Civil Aviation Organisation has ranked the country 48th in its worldwide safety oversight mechanism.","Eleven ""Mayday"" distress calls from aircraft cockpits in 17 months.

NEW DELHI: Observing that incarceration does not suspend the right of prisoners to live with human dignity, the Supreme Court has expressed deep concern over the plight of jailed individuals with disabilities and ordered that prisons be made disabled friendly with accessible toilets, ramps and a sensory-safe environment to ensure universal accessibility.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said basic facilities needed for prisoners with disabilities are not being provided and passed a slew of directions to ensure these are made available to them.

DHAKA: In yet another development showcasing growing social intolerance in Bangladesh, the ancestral home of iconic filmmaker Satyajit Ray in Dhaka is being demolished to make way for a new semi-concrete structure, the local media reported Tuesday.Located on Horikishore Ray Chowdhury Road in the city, the century-old house was home to Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. Upendrakishore, a prominent 19th-century litterateur in his own right besides being a painter and publisher, was the father of celebrated poet Sukumar Ray and grandfather of filmmaker Satyajit Ray.A semi-concrete structure with several rooms will be built to house a Shishu Academy at the historically-significant building, the country's leading media outlet 'Daily Star' reported. According to reports, the property - which was built by Upendrakishore more than a century ago and previously housed the Mymensingh Shishu Academy - fell into a state of disrepair after years of neglect by the authorities.The newspaper said that local residents have expressed their concerns over the decision, citing that the demolition will wipe out the legacy of the Ray dynasty in Mymensingh city. However, the authorities insist that the demolition is being carried out in accordance with proper procedures and ""necessary approvals"".Officials from Dhaka's Department of Archeology, while agreeing that the property remains an archeological heritage, admitted that their repeated requests to protect the building have gone unheard.Expressing her anguish, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee posted on X: ""The Ray family is one of the most prominent torchbearers of Bengal's culture. Upendrakishore was among the pillars of the Bengal Renaissance. I feel this house is inextricably linked to Bengal's cultural history. I appeal to the Bangladeshi government and to all right-thinking people of that country to preserve this edifice of rich tradition. The Indian government should also intervene.""In New Delhi, MEA expressed deep regret that the property was being demolished. ""Given the building's landmark status symbolising Bangla cultural renaissance, it would be preferable to reconsider the demolition and examine options for its repair and reconstruction as a museum of literature and a symbol of the shared culture of India and Bangladesh,"" said ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, adding that the Indian govt was willing to extend assistance for the purpose.","The ancestral home of iconic filmmaker Satyajit Ray in Dhaka is being demolished to make way for a new semi-concrete structure.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai and Delhi have posted impressive gains in QS Best Student Cities 2026 rankings, reinforcing India's growing profile in global higher education. Mumbai has re-entered the coveted global top 100, climbing 15 places to secure the 98th position, while Delhi advanced seven spots to 104th.Delhi stood out in the affordability category, being ranked as most affordable student city in the world. Mumbai and Bengaluru also performed strongly on this parameter, being placed within the global top 15.The QS ranking report noted that this is an indication of National Education Policy-2020's (NEP) focus on global engagement and student-centric learning. These gains reflect a strengthening momentum in India's education ecosystem, with its metropolises emerging as increasingly attractive destinations for both domestic and international students.Four Indian metro cities - Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai - featured in the rankings and have improved their positions this year. Bengaluru saw the most dramatic leap, soaring 22 places to rank 108th, while Chennai moved up 12 spots to 128th.In the employer activity indicator, Delhi and Mumbai broke into the world's top 50, underscoring the strong employment prospects for graduates from these cities. Bengaluru made a remarkable 41-place leap in this category to 59th, and Chennai advanced 29 spots, reflecting a growing global recognition of Indian graduates' skill set.CEO of QS Jessica Turner said India's ascent in the rankings was ""more than a statistical bump"" and pointed to a deeper transformation. ""As we approach the fifth anniversary of NEP-2020, its focus on global engagement, quality enhancement and student-centric learning is starting to bear fruit on the international stage,"" she said. ""If this momentum continues, backed by reform and rising global visibility, we're likely to witness an even sharper upward trajectory before the decade is out,"" Turner said.The QS Best Student Cities 2026 ranking assessed 150 cities worldwide. This year's edition highlights a notable shift in the global education landscape - Seoul displaced London to claim the top spot for the first time, while Tokyo held its second position. London, which had dominated the rankings for six consecutive years, slipped to third, largely due to a steep decline in affordability, where it dropped 11 places to rank 137th globally.Where Indian cities scored low was in student mix indicator (number of international students, and how inclusive the city and country is), with Mumbai at the bottom (150), Bengaluru at 148, Chennai at 146 and Delhi at 147.Asia's rise is equally striking in this edition. Alongside Seoul's triumph, Kuala Lumpur entered the global top 15 for the first time at 12th, while Beijing 13th and Taipei 14th achieved their highest-ever positions. Hong Kong also climbed five places to 17th.Over the past decade, India has recorded a 390% increase in number of universities featured in QS World University Rankings. That upward trajectory is now mirrored at the city level, with Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai establishing themselves as globally connected and opportunity-rich destinations for students.","Mumbai and Delhi have posted impressive gains in QS Best Student Cities 2026 rankings.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court expressed concern on Tuesday over the encouragement given to regionalism by political parties to seek votes and said this poses as much danger to the unity and integrity of India as the promotion of communal divide in society.""Regional parties openly promote regionalism and seek votes during elections. Is this not against the unity and integrity of the country?"" a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked while declining to entertain a petition seeking cancellation of the registration of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen. It said it would not single out any one political party when many were indulging in communalism.""No doubt the petition raises an important issue. But this can only be gone into when a neutral petition is filed without accusing a single party,"" the bench said and gave liberty to the petitioner to file a neutral petition raising the larger issues relating to electoral reforms.However, it said a conjoint reading of the clauses of the AIMIM's constitution does not show there is anything which runs contrary to the Constitution of India.""If a religious law is protected by the Constitution, then a political party has the right to propagate that,"" the court said.It said if a candidate of a party, which conforms to the standards set by the Constitution and Representation of the People Act, seeks votes in the name of religion, then s/he is liable for disqualification.For petitioner Tirupati Narasimha Murari, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said AIMIM’s constitution advocates the cause of the Muslim community alone and has the objective of promotion of Islamic education, commitment to Sharia law, formation of Majlis Shura and prioritisation of employment, education and economic welfare of the Muslim community.“This is against secularism, the basic tenet of the Indian Constitution,” he said.As against this, he argued, the Election Commission would refuse to register a political party with a Hindu name and a constitution that espouses the cause of Hindus and promotes Vedic education.The bench disagreed and said, “If the EC refuses to register such a party, then there are forums to challenge the EC decision.”",Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi declined to entertain a petition seeking cancellation of the registration of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen.

Singh hinted at Shukla's return to India around Aug 17, after he completes post-mission protocols and discussions abroad.The minister said the mission demonstrated India's growing stature in global space exploration. ""These are experiments that have never been done before. This marks a new era for India's scientific and technological ambitions,"" he noted, adding that the mission's success would have long-term implications for humankind.Describing the safe return as both a scientific and symbolic achievement, the minister said, ""The call given by Prime Minister Modi to look to the skies and dream big has begun to take shape. This successful mission is just the beginning. It will inspire a new generation of Indians to pursue careers in science and space.""India's growing role in global human spaceflight programmes, including the upcoming Gaganyaan mission , is further reinforced by Shukla's participation in Axiom-4.","Space minister Jitendra Singh hailed the safe return of Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla from the Axiom-4 space mission.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday extended a hearty welcome to Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla on his return to Earth after a successful 18-day stay at the International Space Station (ISS), saying “as India’s first astronaut to have visited ISS, Shukla has inspired a billion dreams with his dedication, courage and pioneering spirit”.“I join the nation in welcoming Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla as he returns to Earth from his historic mission to Space. It marks another milestone towards our own Human Space Flight Mission -- Gaganyaan,” the PM posted on X.When Shukla had talked to Modi from ISS some days back, the PM advised him to learn as much as possible during the Axiom-4 mission, so that the experience could be used for the Gagayaan mission. Shukla had conducted seven Isro-specific microgravity experiments and several others with the Axiom-4 mission crew members.It was Modi who laid the foundation for India’s first trip to ISS, after he met then US President Joe Biden in the White House during a state visit in 2024, with the two countries subsequently collaborating to send an Indian astronaut to the orbital station as part of Axiom-4 mission. During that visit, India also signed the Artemis Accords, an initiative undertaken by Nasa to return humans to the Moon.Earlier, it was PM Modi who gave the astronaut wings to Group Captain Shukla and three other IAF pilots — Group Captain Prashanth Balakrishnan, Group Captain Ajith Krishnan, Group Captain Angad Pratap — and revealed Gaganyaan mission astronauts to the world.On Shukla’s successful return, defence minister Rajnath Singh spoke to Shambhu Dayal Shukla, the father of the astronaut, following his successful return to Earth. ""Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla's successful return from the historic Axiom-4 mission is a proud moment for every Indian. He has not just touched space, he has lifted India's aspirations to new heights,"" Singh said on X.As soon as Shukla made a successful splashdown in the Pacific Ocean aboard SpaceX 's Crew Dragon, thousands of miles away, his hometown of Lucknow erupted with chants of ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" and applause.Shukla's father, Shambhu Dayal Shukla, mother Asha Devi and sister Suchi Misra were charged with emotions as the Dragon splashed in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast. “He has been to space and back and we are all over the moon because this mission has its own importance for the country's Gaganyaan programme,"" Shambhu Dayal Shukla said.Shux’s mom Asha Shukla said, ""We are very excited...We are waiting for our son... We are proud that our son wrote his name in history... We will give him a grand welcome...”.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath called the achievement of Shukla, who hails from Lucknow, ""a glorious symbol of courage, dedication and commitment to science"". ""Every Indian, especially the people of Uttar Pradesh, is proud today. India awaits your return with great excitement,"" he added.","PM Narendra Modi extended a hearty welcome to Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla on his return to Earth after a successful 18-day stay at the International Space Station.

LONDON: A rare Gandhi portrait, believed to be the only oil painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for, sold in an online auction at Bonhams on Tuesday for £152,800 (Rs 1.7 crore.)“Portrait of Mahatma Gandhi” by British artist Clare Leighton sold for triple its estimate of £50,000-£70,000 (Rs 57 lakh to Rs 80 lakh). It was the top lot in the Travel and Exploration online sale and the first time this portrait has been sold at auction.According to the artist’s family, the portrait was on public display in 1974 when it was allegedly attacked with a knife by a Hindu right-wing activist. The catalogue entry refers to signs of restoration to tears in several places.Leighton met Gandhi when he visited London in 1931 to attend the Second Round Table Conference.At the time, Leighton was in a relationship with political journalist Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a passionate supporter of Indian Independence. It was through this connection that she was introduced to Gandhi and was one of the few artists admitted to Gandhi’s office to sit with him to sketch and paint him.In November 1931, Leighton showcased her portraits in an exhibition at the Albany Galleries in London.Journalist Winifred Holtby attended the opening and wrote: “The little man squats bare-headed, in his blanket, one finger raised, as it often is to emphasise a point, his lips parted for a word that is almost a smile… the statesman who knows just how to play on the psychology of friends and enemies alike.”",“Portrait of Mahatma Gandhi’ by British artist Clare Leighton sold for triple its estimate.

NEW DELHI: Using social media to disseminate radical ideology, even if there is no physical act of terror, can attract UAPA provisions, the Delhi high court said, declining the bail plea of an operative of "" The Resistance Front (TRF)"", a terror outfit.HC underscored that the accused posted photos of terrorists and incited people to commit heinous acts and, if released, there is a high possibility of him tampering with the evidence as he is digitally adept.Expanding on the definition of Section 18 of UAPA, a bench of Justice Subramonium Prasad and Justice Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar noted that it is ""framed in such a broad way that even the usage of social media or any digital activity for the purpose of disseminating radical information and ideology falls within its ambit, and it is not necessary that the action (of the accused) must be a physical activity"".HC found enough evidence against the accused, Arsalan Feroze Ahenger, to deny him bail, as provisions in the section deal with punishment for conspiracy, attempt, advocacy, abetment, or incitement to terrorist acts.NIA, the investigating agency in the case, said Ahenger was associated with one Mehran Yaseen Shalla, a terror operative working for TRF and LeT. Shalla, along with two other accomplices, was killed in an encounter on Nov 24, 2021.Prior to that, under Shalla's influence, Ahenger was digitally active on various social media platforms, on which radical content was shared, the NIA submitted.NIA said the accused created several groups on social media like Ansar Gazwat-ul-Hind and Shaikoo Naikoo, apart from multiple Gmail IDs through which radical views were expressed, which aimed to motivate and radicalise vulnerable youth to join terrorist groups like TRF.""The material on record also indicates that the messages shared by the appellant have the tendency to incite people to join terrorist activities. The appellant also used images, videos, etc, of slain Mehran Yaseen Shalla for glorifying terrorist activities, and the appellant has also been propagating the radical ideology of TRF to create unrest within the country,"" the court observed in its order.The lawyer for the accused argued that the trial court failed to appreciate there is no material on record indicating his client's association with TRF and, therefore, UAPA cannot be invoked against him.","Arsalan Feroze Ahenger, an operative of ""The Resistance Front (TRF)"", a terror outfit, was denied bail.

US President Donald Trump called on Republicans to extend their full support to the GENIUS Act, a sweeping bill aimed at regulating stablecoins and asserting America’s dominance in the digital asset space.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote, “HAPPY CRYPTO WEEK! The House will soon VOTE on a tremendous Bill to Make America the UNDISPUTED, NUMBER ONE LEADER in Digital Assets - Nobody does it better! The GENIUS Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe, and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can’t do it.”“Digital Assets are the FUTURE, and we are leading by a lot! Get the first Vote done this afternoon (ALL REPUBLICANS SHOULD VOTE YES!). This is our moment - Digital Assets, GENIUS, Clarity! It is all part of Making America Great Again, BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE.”The US President said America is leading the world and will continue working with the Senate and House to push through more related legislation.Earlier, Trump wrote that he had met with 11 of the 12 lawmakers needed to pass the GENIUS Act, and after a brief discussion, all had agreed to vote in favour of the Rule the following morning.Describing the bill as a cornerstone of his MAGA agenda, he said, “Speaker of the House Mike Johnson was at the meeting via telephone, and looks forward to taking the Vote as early as possible. I want to thank the Congressmen/women for their quick and positive response. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”The GENIUS Act is a proposed law that aims to introduce the first-ever federal framework to regulate stablecoins, cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to assets like the US dollar.The bill is designed to bring clarity and oversight to the rapidly growing digital asset market. Supporters say it balances the need for consumer protection with the push for financial innovation, despite ongoing political debates and concerns around transparency.Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are used widely for digital payments, cross-border transfers, and decentralised finance (DeFi). The market for stablecoins has ballooned to nearly $250 billion, raising concerns about financial stability and the lack of regulation.The legislation sets out rules on how stablecoins are issued, the kind of reserves required to back them, and how transparent issuers need to be.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday declared a sweeping new trade deal with Indonesia, dramatically slashing tariffs on its exports to 19 per cent, down from the previously threatened 32 per cent, while unlocking full market access for American goods in the Southeast Asian nation.Announcing the agreement on Truth Social, Trump said the pact was finalised after direct talks with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. “This landmark Deal opens up Indonesia’s entire market to the United States for the first time in History,” Trump wrote, adding that it marks a “complete and total access” win for US farmers, ranchers, and fishermen to a population of over 280 million.As per Trump, Indonesia has pledged to purchase $15 billion worth of US energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets, many of them the long-haul 777 models. In return, Indonesian goods entering the US will face a flat 19 per cent tariff, while American exports to Indonesia will reportedly be exempt from both tariff and non-tariff barriers.“If there is any transshipment from a higher tariff country, then that tariff will be added on to the tariff that Indonesia is paying,” Trump warned in his post, reinforcing provisions to avoid tariff circumvention.The announcement came as part of Trump’s broader effort to reset global trade terms ahead of the August 1 deadline for elevated import levies.As per Reuters, the Indonesia deal resembles recent US arrangements with Vietnam and the UK. Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick also told CNBC that the agreement “eliminates tariffs on US exports while imposing tariffs on imports.”While Indonesia is not one of the US’s largest trading partners, bilateral trade totalled around $40 billion in 2024, it has been growing. Last year, the US recorded a nearly $18 billion goods trade deficit with Indonesia, importing items like palm oil, electronics, footwear, and rubber.Indonesian official Susiwijono Moegiarso was quoted by Reuters as saying that both countries were preparing a joint statement detailing the agreed tariff and non-tariff arrangements.The deal arrives amid mounting pressure on the US administration to finalise more such pacts, as Trump has sent tariff threat letters to over 20 countries last week, including Japan, South Korea, Brazil, and the EU. Talks with India are also reportedly progressing, with Trump noting, “We’re going to have access to India.”Meanwhile, the European Union is preparing retaliatory tariffs worth over $84 billion if talks with the US fail, warning that Trump’s threatened 30 per cent duties on EU goods would upend bilateral trade.","US President Donald Trump announced a sweeping new trade deal with Indonesia.

Japan’s E10 Bullet Trains For India

The Japanese Shinkansen currently operates E5 trains, with E10 being the next generation model. ""The newest Japanese trains will run on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high speed corridor,"" an official told ET.

""In the spirit of strategic partnership between Japan and India, the Japanese government has agreed to introduce E10 Shinkansen trains in the project,"" an official statement said.

A status report released on Monday regarding the bullet train project indicated that construction of 310 km of viaduct had been completed.

Commercial services of India’s first bullet train project are scheduled to begin in 2027, whilst the initial prototype is expected to commence operations in 2026.

Moving Beyond Japanese Technology

India’s first bullet train project will use Japan’s latest E10 high-speed trains for operations, after initially testing the E5 series of trains. The E10 series of bullet trains are set for debut in Japan in 2030, and are therefore likely to be used on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail corridor at the same time.The 508 km bullet train route, with 352 kms in Gujarat and 156 kms in Maharashtra, is under construction using the Japanese Shinkansen technology. According to railways, the new bullet train corridor will establish new standards in speed, safety, and operational reliability in India.The Indian Railways is now also diversifying its approach to bullet train technology, moving beyond exclusive Japanese collaboration to include European and domestic partnerships.A recent contract for comprehensive signalling and telecommunication systems has been granted to European technology providers working with Indian collaborators.Simultaneously, discussions continue with Japanese firms regarding Shinkansen trainset procurement.Testing of E5 variant Shinkansen trainsets will evaluate their suitability and help determine necessary adjustments for the E10 trainsets currently under development.The government has additionally commissioned Integral Coach Factory (ICF) to manufacture a bullet train that can achieve speeds of 280 kmph.For this project, ICF has established a partnership with the defence public sector company BEML to manufacture these high-speed trains.","India's first bullet train project will use Japan’s latest E10 high-speed trains for operations.

Bengaluru: Imagine burning 3 litres of petrol just to travel 1.5 kilometres.

Frustrated commuters Tuesday took to social media, sharing dashboard screenshots that revealed shocking levels of fuel consumption and barely moving traffic.In one case, a commuter reported using 3.2 litres of fuel to cover just 3.3km in 45 minutes. Another said his car guzzled 3 litres over a 1.5km crawl that took 22 minutes.

At the same time, BMTC should improve frequency and companies must bring back bus services."" Ravi Kumar, a resident of Kasavanahalli, added: ""In the time it takes to cross 2.5km, I could've driven to Electronics City and back under normal conditions.

A recent study published in Nature Medicine by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialised agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), has issued a stark warning: the world is facing a significant surge in gastric cancer cases, with Asia—and particularly India—bearing the brunt. The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk.Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.India must take public health action against gastric cancerTo reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.",Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions.

In an aggressive move to dominate the artificial intelligence race, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is assembling a dream team for the company’s new Superintelligence Lab . The tech giant has reportedly offered record-breaking salary packages ranging from Rs 800 crore to over Rs 1,600 crore to lure top minds from Apple, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. The initiative aims to unify Meta’s fragmented AI projects and leap ahead in the race toward superintelligence, an even more ambitious goal than artificial general intelligence (AGI). With key hires and strategic leadership, Meta is now at the center of Silicon Valley’s escalating AI talent war .Meta’s recruitment spree signals a paradigm shift in the global AI race. As Zuckerberg pours billions into building a centralised AI superteam, rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic will face intensified pressure to retain talent and accelerate innovation. Whether Meta’s Superintelligence Lab will achieve its lofty goals remains to be seen but the talent war has clearly entered an explosive new chapter.Among the standout deals is Apple’s Ruoming Pang, who reportedly joined Meta for a staggering compensation package of $200 million (over Rs 1,600 crore), highlighting the fierce talent war in AI recruitment today. Similarly, OpenAI’s Trapit Bansal was offered $100 million (approximately Rs 800 crore). According to Bloomberg, these packages include base salary, substantial signing bonuses, and large equity grants with performance-linked clauses and extended vesting schedules, ensuring long-term loyalty. These deals make Meta’s AI salaries among the highest in the corporate world, even surpassing many CEO compensation packages at global banks.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab (MSL) is being built to rival OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic in the development of next-gen AI. Zuckerberg has made it clear: AI is the company’s top priority, and he’s willing to pay big to bring the best minds on board. The effort includes unifying Meta’s various AI teams under a central umbrella focused on creating “superintelligence,” a loosely defined concept that goes beyond AGI by outperforming the human brain itself.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab is being led by some of the most high-profile figures in AI and tech:Unlike artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to mimic human cognitive functions, superintelligence refers to AI systems that far exceed human intelligence in all domains. While still theoretical, it is seen as the ultimate frontier in AI, capable of solving complex problems across medicine, science, economy, and creativity. By investing in top-tier AI talent and consolidating its resources, Meta aims to leapfrog competitors and become a global leader in the development of superintelligent systems.The massive salary deals are not simple cash payouts. Instead, they typically include:Industry insiders say this is only the beginning. Meta is reportedly in talks with several more prominent figures in AI research and robotics, indicating further expansions to the Superintelligence Lab. Zuckerberg's vision now goes beyond just algorithms. It encompasses building infrastructure, supercomputers, and even AI-native hardware to support future breakthroughs. The message is clear: Meta is betting its future on superintelligence."," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is assembling a dream team for the company’s new Superintelligence Lab.

Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.W hen Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s comeback to the private sector is not just a career move; it’s an inspiring example of how public service can continue even after leaving office. Unlike many politicians who often retire into comfort, relying on accumulated wealth or government benefits, Sunak is choosing to re-engage professionally in a meaningful way. His decision to take on an advisory role at Goldman Sachs without drawing a salary, and instead donating any earnings to charity, reflects both integrity and a deep sense of responsibility. It sets a strong precedent for how former leaders can remain active contributors to society, not for personal gain, but for a greater public good.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser.

Maharashtra Carpet Area Boost: Govt panel proposes 10% extra carpet area for housing societies to boost Self-redevelopment projects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-govt-panel-proposes-10-extra-carpet-area-for-housing-societies-going-for-self-redevelopment/articleshow/122455974.cms,"Poll Which aspect of the self-redevelopment scheme do you think is the most appealing? Additional carpet area benefit Full control over the redevelopment process





MUMBAI: In a boost for self-redevelopment, a govt-appointed committee has proposed offering 10% additional carpet area to residents of housing societies opting for the scheme.In self-redevelopment, residents redevelop their buildings themselves without a builder. This allows them to enjoy all the construction benefits and profits, which would otherwise go to the developer.On Monday, a committee headed by BJP MLC Pravin Darekar submitted its report to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis at a function at Vidhan Bhavan. The recommendations will be forwarded to the housing, cooperatives and urban development departments.""The proposal based on the suggestions of the departments will be approved by the cabinet. The govt will issue a decision regarding the recommendations made by the study group and a report on the work done in this regard will be submitted in the upcoming session. These important decisions will help in accelerating the work of pending housing projects in the state and help Mumbaikars realise their dream of beautiful and big houses,"" said Fadnavis.The committee has recommended extending the scheme to cluster redevelopment, where more than one housing society can come together for the project. The minimum area required for such cluster self-redevelopment schemes will be 2,000 sq m as against 4,000 sq m for the regular cluster redevelopment scheme.Each occupant in a cluster self-redevelopment scheme will be entitled to a minimum of 376.73 sq ft flat. In case of non-residential occupant, the carpet area to be given in the reconstructed building will be equivalent to the carpet area occupied in the old building.In case of slum-dwellers, the household will be entitled to 300 sq ft.It has been recommended that the scheme must apply to cooperative housing societies on private plots, cessed and non-cessed buildings, Mhada buildings, BARC, buildings on BPT lands and even slums.The committee has proposed that the district co-op bank, which provides loans for such self-redevelopment schemes, should allow the land and sale component to be mortgaged to the apex state cooperative bank. For this, it has requested the govt to direct the apex bank to make the necessary amendments.It has further recommended that agencies such as NABARD should provide funds for self-redevelopment projects. The govt must also ask HUDCO to give loans to district cooperative banks in urban areas to finance such projects.To encourage self-redevelopment in slums, it has been suggested that the govt set up a separate Slum Self-Redevelopment Authority. Just as the govt has allowed housing societies on occupancy class II lands to convert it to freehold, it must allow slum cooperative housing societies to own their land be it state, central or semi-govt agency lands. It has recommended linking the PM Awaas Yojana to this scheme.With regard to Metro Line 3, it has recommended that for affected buildings, govt should take up a time-bound programme and all buildings on either side of the underground metro that are dilapidated and are likely to be impacted once the underground metro becomes operational should be declared project-affected and a new regulation formulated in DCPR-2034 for their redevelopment.","In self-redevelopment, residents redevelop their buildings themselves without a builder.
