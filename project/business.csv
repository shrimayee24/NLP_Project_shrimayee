'India Will Sign FTAs Only When...': Piyush Goyal's Big Statement Before US Trade Deal Announcement

The Congerss leader's post on X

Poll Do you believe Prime Minister Modi will prioritize India's interests in trade talks with the US? Yes, absolutely No, I have doubts

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would ""meekly bow"" to US President Donald Trump , as New Delhi weighs its interests amid ongoing trade talks with Washington.Gandhi's remark was a reaction to Commerce and Industry minister Piyush Goyal 's statement, where he said: ""We are not working towards any specific deadlines, we are working towards national interest"". Trump has set July 9 as the deadline for trade agreements.""Piyush Goyal can beat his chest all he wants, mark my words, Modi will meekly bow to the Trump tariff deadline,"" Gandhi wrote on X.India will enter into a trade agreement with the US only if its interests are protected and it is able to sustain a tariff advantage over its competitors, while prioritising the interests of farmers, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said Friday.Trump had imposed reciprocal tariffs on nearly 100 countries but agreed to a 90-day pause that is to end Tuesday. India was slapped with 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs.There is uncertainty over whether India and US can agree to an early tranche or a mini deal before that even as a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement is negotiated by Fall (Sept-Oct) after a meeting between Trump and PM Modi. For India, lowering tariffs on farm products, such as maize and soybean, as well as dairy products is a concern.While Goyal did not get into the specifics, he said India will not compromise the interests of farm and dairy sectors.""Farmers' interest is always paramount for Modi government. In any negotiation we have done, you have seen UK, Australia, Mauritius, EFTA and UAE agreements, India's farmers have been protected.""The government has refrained from offering concessions in major agricultural products, but for US, it is the main focus. While some government officials said US demands were not very clear, for India, Goyal said Indian expectations for duty concessions in labour-intensive sectors were the focus of the trade deal. India was hoping for duty concessions in leather, footwear, textiles and some auto parts in return for reducing levies on automobiles and American whiskey.","Gandhi's remark was a reaction to Commerce and Industry minister Piyush Goyal's statement.

87% enumeration forms distributed in Bihar; 5% filled up & returned; documents can be added later,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/87-enumeration-forms-distributed-in-bihar-5-filled-up-returned-documents-can-be-added-later/articleshow/122260452.cms,"Special intensive roll revision (SIR) completed in Bihar

NEW DELHI: Booth level officers (BLOs) on Friday completed door-to-door visits to the state’s nearly 1.5 crore households as part of the ongoing special intensive roll revision (SIR), distributing enumeration forms to over 87 per cent or over 6.8 crore, of Bihar’s 7.9 crore electorate. Already, 38 lakh or 5 per cent filled-up and signed enumeration forms, with or without the specified documents, have been received by the BLOs, with the figure expected to touch 15 per cent on Saturday.Sources in the election commission (EC) told TOI that even where enumeration forms are short on one or more required documents, there shall be a window for the elector concerned to submit them anytime before July 25, the last date for submission of the completed enumeration forms. “All those who turn in their filled-up forms by July 25 will be included in the draft electoral roll to be published on August 1, 2025,” said an EC official adding that the BLOs are working with the motto “inclusion first”.“In order to get one’s name in the draft electoral roll, the strict condition is to sign and submit the pre-printed enumeration form before July 25. This step will filter out non-existent voters, either dead or migrated ones who are no longer ordinary residents of that assembly constituency,” said an EC officer.Though BLOs will give their recommendation while submitting/uploading the filled up enumeration form, the electoral registration officer (ERO) or assistant ERO (AERO) is expected to scrutinise the forms “not recommended” by BLOs only after draft rolls are published on August 1.Claims and objections to the draft electoral roll can be filed from August 1 to September 1. “Based on the documents attached or not attached, eligibility verification of each name in the draft roll will start vigorously from August 2 onwards, which is also the date from which political parties or any member of the public can file claims and objections,” said an officer.EROs and AEROs will scrutinise the forms against the eligibility criteria laid down in Article 326, which requires electors to Indian citizens, not less than 18 years of age and ordinarily resident in the constituency.Asked about the remaining 13 per cent enumeration forms still not distributed by BLOs, EC said these could be on account of locked houses, dead electors, migrants or those who may be travelling. BLO will be making two more house visits in such cases.Electors who miss the July 25 deadline can still apply for inclusion during the claims and objections period using Form 6. The over 1.5 lakh booth level agents (BLAs) appointed by political parties, including 52,689 by the BJP 47,504 by RJD, 34,660 by JD(U) and 16,500 by the Congress, can continue to submit up to 10 forms per day even after the draft roll is published.The final electoral roll will be published on September 30, 2025. Those still aggrieved can file first appeal with the district magistrate and final one with the chief electoral officer.Further additions to the electoral roll can be made even after the Bihar poll is announced, that is, till the last day of filing of nominations.","Booth level officers (BLOs) on Friday completed door-to-door visits to the state’s nearly 1.5 crore households.

It also has significant conventional oil and gas deposits, positioning it as a potential long-term energy partner for India.The country is also rich in critical minerals such as lithium, copper, and rare earth elements. These are important for India’s plans for clean energy and industrial growth. Along with Bolivia and Chile, Argentina is part of the Lithium Triangle, a region that holds a large share of the world’s lithium reserves.Lithium plays a central role in rechargeable batteries, which are used in electric vehicles, mobile phones, laptops, and systems that store renewable energy.Modi will hold wide-ranging talks with Argentina's President Javier Milei to explore cooperation in areas like defence, agriculture, mining, oil and gas, renewable energy, trade and investment.""We will focus on advancing our mutually beneficial cooperation, including in the areas of agriculture, critical minerals, energy, trade, tourism, technology, and investment,"" Modi had said.PM Modi will also visit the famous Boca Juniors Stadium to have a look at Argentine football, news agency ANI reported.

Despite global challenges, commerce & industry minister

Piyush Goyal

expects exports to scale a new high this year, aided by FTAs. While remaining upbeat on growth, he tells

Sidhartha

that investment is flowing into several sectors. He is pushing for a review of FTAs with

Asean

and Japan and is cautious on China. Excerpts:

How much export growth is expected this year given the global uncertainty?

How much help will come from FTAs?

The Modi govt opted out of RCEP. In hindsight, was it a sensible thing to do since many experts still argue that India should have joined it?

The Asean FTA is under review. Are you satisfied with the pace or is there a sense of frustration?

Your recent comments on the Asean agreement stirred a controversy. Do you see Chinese goods and investments getting routed through some of the countries that are part of the bloc?

Does the focus on China+1 remain in the US?

Are there opportunities for India?

Despite the focus on reducing imports from China, the trade deficit is near $100 billion. What is being done to check that?

Is there a reluctance to allow Indian goods in China?

Are the conditions conducive to lifting some of the checks?

There are indications of a slowdown in the first quarter. As the minister in-charge of industry, what will be your strategy to accelerate growth in the industrial sector?

Weak capex by the private sector is a major concern. When do you see an improvement in investments?

While gross FDI inflows have grown, there was an increase in remittances and outward FDI last year. How will you step up overall FDI flows?

What changes are you planning on SEZ regulations?

Quality control orders have been a focus. What is the rationale and benefit when a section of industry is objecting to them?

How is the progress on industrial corridors and when will you be ready with the plan for 100 industrial parks?

In the last 11 years of Modi govt, India has navigated uncertainty and volatility quite well. Total exports soared to a record $825 billion in 2024-25, growing over 6%, and sustaining a robust 5.8% CAGR over the past decade. We have seen a remarkable 20% CAGR during the past decade in electronics, and traditional sectors such as engineering and pharmaceuticals have done well. From 2019-20 to 2024-25, goods exports have seen a CAGR of 6.9%, despite the Covid period. From 2019 to 2023, because country-wise data is available up to 2023, commercial services exports registered a CAGR of 12%. Going forward, we may be able to maintain 5-6% growth in goods, especially non-petroleum exports, while services may grow 9-10%. If we can achieve that we are looking at crossing $870 billion in the current year, despite the global problems. Our focus is more and more on value-added and labour-intensive goods and services exports.India has deepened its footprint with FTAs with the UAE, Australia, EFTA and the UK, reshaping our trade dynamics. FTAs do make an impact. With the UAE, services exports have almost doubled in the last four-five years.In Australia, it has nearly tripled. On the goods side too we have grown very well, in Australia’s case at 25%, we have crossed $8 billion, while we were tottering at $3 billion earlier. The same is not true of the ones signed during UPA. Services export to Japan is slowing down. We did not get very wide coverage in areas of interest for India. It’s a sad situation and I hope that our efforts for a review will bear fruit. Japan has not agreed to it and a South Korea review is underway. Now, we sign FTAs after extensive stakeholder consultation and for the Modi govt, national interest is paramount.Before the decision, we held 200 consultations with stakeholders on RCEP and the benefits of joining it, only three suggested we should join. PM Modi showed decisive leadership and sensitivities for our fishermen, farmers, industry and entrepreneurs. He recognised that it was nothing but FTA between India and China because we had agreements with the others. We have signed ECTA with Australia and we should be able to finalise an agreement with New Zealand in the next few months. Just this week at a meeting with exporters, the issue came up and not one of them suggested that we should join.We can do much better and I am hopeful that both Korea and Asean will recognise the asymmetries in the FTAs signed 15 years ago and will make them more contemporary, fair, balanced and equitable.When the US announced its agreement with Vietnam, it focused on transshipment of goods from other countries. Every day we get cases of sub-standard goods coming in, predatory pricing being deployed for exports and to kill Indian industry. We are working on strengthening Make in India, supporting Indian industry wherever it is hurt by predaTOI tory pricing and focusing on Quality Control Orders.It appears to be working on a two-pronged strategy. While recognising that it cannot decouple completely from China, it is also working on strengthening the supply chain.Clearly, India is a much sought after destination for investments, there are collaborations for technology. In the maritime sector, India is recognised as a shipbuilding destination and govt is also coming up with measures to support it. Semiconductors is a success story of the Modi govt. We have seen significant increase in domestic value addition in the sectors where we offered PLI.During the 10 years of UPA, India’s trade deficit with China grew nearly 25 times, but has expanded 1.75 times between 2014-15 and 202324. We have managed to bring some reasonable controls. Electrical equipment, machinery, organic chemicals and plastics are our major imports. Between 2019-20 and 2023-24, there has been an increase in import of these items from China, but there is also a corresponding increase in exports, showing that several items imported from China are raw material, inputs or capital goods used for making finished products in India.There are several non-tariff barriers, including language and procedural delays. Many industries just don’t buy from India even when our products are competitive. Getting more market access is an area in which we are working with China through our embassy.Periodically, China has erected restrictions, whether it is export of rare earth magnets, fertilizer or tunnel boring machines, and recently recalled engineers. Yet, there are demands from Indian industry to lift some of the checks on investment from China, on visas and on apps.Given that there is now engagement with China at the ministerial level, if China is willing to engage on fair terms on trade, India will be willing to talks and see how we can work towards a more mutually beneficial and a fair trading system.Time will tell.We are already seeing an uptick and rural demand has shown significant improvement. You may see a jump in growth in the second half of the year. I see no difficulty in closing the year with RBI’s 6.5% growth which will make us the fastest growing economy.It varies across sectors. There is a lot of interest in investments in sectors that have domestic demand and there is import substitution, such as steel. There are plans to invest Rs 20 lakh crore in 10 years; cement is an ever-green sector as demand and production grow every year. Auto parts, sanitaryware are seeing large investments and there is confidence that Indian companies can compete with anyone. There are some focus areas like white goods, where demand is growing very fast on the back of tax cuts, growing income levels and the finance minister also spoke of GST reduction recently. Auto sector is growing rapidly and our efforts in electronics are showing results. Some of the investment going into GCCs may not be fully captured.With the outflow of investment, India is also building an asset base and its own presence in different sectors across the world, which in the long run will be our strength.There are certain suggestions that will help SEZ units increase their capacity utilisation and help meet the demand that is currently being serviced by some of the FTA countries. We are working with the requisite departments, and we should be able to come up with the changes by the end of the year.We are emphasising on QCOs to implement the PM’s vision of zero defect-zero effect manufacturing. Technical regulations have been strengthened to promote a strong quality ecosystem in India, enhance product safety for consumers, prevent the import of substandard goods, protect the environment and attract investment. It acts as a nudge to produce quality products in India.In Dholera, Shendra-Bidkin, Greater Noida and Vikram Udyogpuri, over 4,200 acres have been allotted and 76% of the developed industrial land is now under committed use. Each city is emerging as an industrial powerhouse: Dholera has emerged as the future semicon city of India, ShendraBidkin in Maharashtra is evolving into an automotive and EV hub. Of the 12 new projects approved by the govt last Aug, tenders have been floated and our target is to get the ground activity started by OctNov. As for the industrial parks, the blueprint is at an advanced stage. They are proposed to be developed and implemented through independent special purpose vehicles in collaboration between the Centre, states and wherever applicable, private players. There will be a single window system for approvals and plug-and-play infrastructure will be maintained."," commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal expects exports to scale a new high this year, aided by FTAs.

"India has no position on Dalai Lama succession, says government; EAM to visit China",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-doesnt-take-stand-on-matters-of-faith-says-mea-on-dalai-succession-issue/articleshow/122258079.cms,"Dalai Lama (AP photo)

NEW DELHI: Following remarks by union minister Kiren Rijiju backing the Dalai Lama’s announcement about his succession plan, including the statement that China will have no role in it, India said Friday that it has taken no position on what was an issue concerning faith and religion.Interestingly, the Chinese foreign ministry after cautioning India at a media briefing, according to agency reports from Beijing, against interfering in Tibetan affairs at the expense of Sino-India ties, omitted its comments objecting to Rijiju’s remarks from the official transcript of the briefing.“We have seen reports relating to the statement made by His Holiness the Dalai Lama about the continuation of the Dalai Lama institution. Government of India does not take any position or speak on matters concerning beliefs and practices of faith and religion,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, responding to media queries on the Dalai Lama’s announcement. He added that the Indian government has always upheld freedom of religion for all in India and will continue to do so.India’s ties with China have shown signs of improvement in the past 9 months, since they resolved the almost 5-year-long border standoff in eastern Ladakh, leading to resumption of high-level bilateral visits.Amid global uncertainties, both sides seem keen to maintain a steady working relationship. External affairs minister S Jaishankar is likely to visit China on July 13 for a meeting of the SCO foreign ministers for what will be the first bilateral visit by the foreign minister of either country since early 2022 when Wang Yi visited India. Jaishankar has not visited China since the Covid outbreak and the beginning of the military standoff in 2020.Defence minister Rajnath Singh too visited China last month for a meeting of the SCO defence ministers. NSA Ajit Doval has twice visited China since PM Narendra Modi’s meeting with President Xi Jinping last year in October on the margins of the BRICS summit in Russia. As Special Representative for boundary talks, Wang himself is likely to visit India this month for talks with Doval. India, however, is yet to confirm PM Narendra Modi’s participation in the SCO summit in China in September.Unlike the US, which officially maintains that China has no role to play in the Dalai Lama’s succession, India has never taken any position on the issue. China maintains that the successor to the 14th Dalai Lama can only be appointed through the “traditional” process that includes approval by the central government. In rare remarks by an Indian minister, Rijiju had backed the spiritual leader’s assertion that no one else other than his Trust will help choose his successor. Rijiju clarified on Friday that he wasn’t speaking on behalf of the Indian government but, as a devotee himself, expressing the perspective of the Dalai Lama’s followers.“All over the world, the people who follow Buddhism and who believe in the sacred, supreme Dalai Lama ji…it is everyone’s wish that the Dalai Lama ji himself will decide. There is no need for the Government of India or for me to say anything…I am speaking as a follower. I am a devotee. This is the wish of the followers. I am not saying anything on behalf of the government of India or on the Chinese government’s statement,” said the minister.",India said it has taken no position on what was an issue concerning faith and religion.

No compromise on interests of farm & dairy sectors: Goyal

NEW DELHI: India will enter into a trade agreement with the US only if its interests are protected and it is able to sustain a tariff advantage over its competitors, while prioritising the interests of farmers, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said Friday.""India has never discussed any trade agreement or even a tranche under any time pressure or under any duress.

NEW DELHI: India faced three adversaries on just one border during Operation Sindoor , with Pakistan being actively supported by China and Turkiye, a top Army officer said on Friday, adding that Beijing was even providing Islamabad with ""live"" satellite inputs on Indian military movements and deployments.""We had one border and two adversaries, actually three. Pakistan was in the front. China was providing all possible support,"" Army deputy chief (capability development & sustenance) Lt Gen Rahul R Singh said at a seminar on 'New Age Military Technologies' organised by Ficci. ""This is no surprise because 81% of military hardware that Pakistan is getting is all Chinese. China, of course, (followed) the good old dictum, kill with a borrowed knife. .. So, he (sic) would rather use the neighbour to cause pain than get involved in the mudslinging match on the northern borders,"" he added.The deep Pakistan-China military collusiveness was reinforced during the cross-border hostilities from May 7 to 10, with Islamabad using a wide array of Chinese weapons and sensor-shooter networks, ranging from J-10 fighters firing the PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to HQ-9 air defence missile batteries, as reported by TOI earlier.Lt Gen Singh, on his part, said China was able to test its weapons against those used by India during the conflict. ""So, it's like a live lab available to them. It is something that we have to be very cognizant about,"" he said.""Turkiye also played an important role in providing the type of support it did,"" he added. Pakistan, for instance, extensively used Turkish-origin Byker Yiha III kamikaze drones and Asisguard Songar drones during the conflict.The senior officer said crucial lessons among the multiple ones to be learned from Operation Sindoor include the need for an effective C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), a more robust air defence network and civil-military fusion.The candid remarks come after Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan, speaking in Singapore on May 31, downplayed China's role in the conflict. While Pakistan may have leveraged Chinese commercial satellite imagery, there is ""no proof of real-time targeting support"" provided by Beijing, the CDS had said.Pointing to China using its extensive satellite network to monitor Indian military movements, Lt Gen Singh said, ""When the DGMO-level talks were on, Pakistan actually was mentioning that we know that your such and such vector is primed and ready for action, and we would request you to perhaps pull it back. So, he (sic) was getting live inputs from China."" Lt Gen Singh also pointed out Indian population centres were not quite at risk during Operation Sindoor.

Make J&K dry like Gujarat: Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/make-jk-dry-like-gujarat-hurriyat-leader-mirwaiz/articleshow/122257107.cms,"SRINAGAR: Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq called Friday for J&K to be made a “dry state like Gujarat” as he opposed authorities’ move to open more liquor shops, claiming such steps were “a deliberate attempt to push our youths further into addiction”.“J&K is a Muslim-majority region and sale and consumption of liquor is against Islam’s tenets,” Mirwaiz said during Friday prayers at Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid. The trigger was a protest the previous day by locals in Srinagar’s Batmaloo against the opening of a liquor shop in the area that had not seen such outlets for decades.“If Gujarat can be declared a dry state, there is no reason why J&K should be exempted,” Mirwaiz said. This was the first call to protest in recent months on any issue from Mirwaiz, who is also chief cleric of Kashmir and has been put in home detention ahead of Friday prayers on many occasions in the past few months.Mirwaiz urged the state’s Omar Abdullah-led National Conference govt and lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha to check the trend. “If govt does not act, we will be forced to protest. This isn’t a minor issue,” Mirwaiz said.Authorities have linked the new liquor licences and shops to a spurt in tourism since the 2019 abrogation of J&K’s special status under Article 370. In the case of Batmaloo, excise officials claimed the shop, now shut after the agitation, was not a new one and had been only relocated from another area.Despite such opposition, J&K’s alcohol sales are on the rise. The Omar-led govt’s economic survey earlier this year estimated excise revenues at Rs 2,000 crore in 2024-25, up 4% over the previous year.Mirwaiz rejected the argument that liquor sales were necessary for tourism, pointing out that J&K had welcomed visitors for centuries without promoting alcohol. “Has J&K become a tourist spot only after 2019 (Article 370 abrogation)? For hundreds of years, tourists have visited us but liquor was never promoted on this scale in every locality,” Mirwaiz said.Drawing a comparison with Gujarat, Mirwaiz stressed that alcohol was banned there due to its impact on society and asked why similar concerns were not valid for J&K. “Don’t we have a society? Don’t we have to live here, too,” Mirwaiz said.According to him, over 1 lakh people in J&K are already affected by drug addiction and govt’s fillip to alcohol sales will only aggravate the crisis.Some local Kashmiri Pandits led by an activist, Sandeep Mawa, had recently demanded a ban on liquor sales in the Valley. In March this year, PDP MLA Fayaz Ahmad Mir had introduced a private member’s bill seeking such a ban across J&K. But the bill was not taken up for discussion or voting in the assembly. BJP, too, has expressed support for the ban, with former J&K party chief Ravinder Raina having led protests on the issue earlier.","Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq called for J&K to be made a ‘dry state like Gujarat’ He opposed authorities’ move to open more liquor shops, claiming such steps were “a deliberate attempt to push our youths further into addiction’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122257172,imgsize-1585837,width-400,resizemode-4/122257172.jpg"

"On choosing life, always",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-choosing-life-always/articleshow/122249739.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. Rithanya was just 27. Within barely 70 days of marriage, she ended her life . Before she slipped away, she sent seven audio notes to her father—apologising for the path she had chosen, unable—she said—to bear the harassment allegedly inflicted by her husband and in-laws. In one voice note, she whispered the most haunting of farewells: “I can’t live this life anymore.” We don’t know the full story. Investigations will unearth the details, and justice, hopefully, will find its way. Almost every human being, at some point, faces that bleak moment where they glance at the abyss, thinking, this is the only way out. But from deep within, something stirs—a raw instinct to survive. We rise. We whisper to ourselves, not yet. Not like this. But for many, it does. India accounts for nearly 38% of global suicide deaths among women and nearly 26% among men. Suicide is the leading cause of death for youngsters. One in three of them takes the step due to family issues. Psychologist Roy Baumeister described suicide as a response to a mind overwhelmed by failure, guilt, and self-loathing. The person visualises not only death, but the aftermath—grief, regret, even revenge. Death becomes not an end, but a statement. What drives this despair? Sometimes, it’s as trivial as a failed exam or a teacher’s rebuke. A heartbreak. Or, as in Rithanya’s case, the crushing belief that “marriage happens only once,” and breaking it is a sin beyond survival . Monogamy is a noble ideal. And yes, history is filled with those who have given up their lives for ideals. But a sacrifice earns nobility only when it serves a higher purpose—when it uplifts others, preserves truth, or advances justice. To give up one’s life because an ideal was challenged by personal suffering is not bravery, but tragedy. Parents, too, must unlearn the habit of clinging to social approval. Let your children fail, stumble, choose differently. If they want to walk out of a marriage, quit a course, skip an exam—so be it. What matters is not community whispers, but their heartbeat. Let them live. Let them outlive us. Let’s tell them that courage lies not in silent endurance, but in speaking out, walking away, or beginning afresh. For centuries, societies glorified suicide in the name of honour. Even Thirukkural praises those who choose death over disgrace: Ilivarin Vaazhadha Maanam Udayaar OliThozhudhu Eththum Ulagu. “The world will always praise and adore the fame of the honorable Who would rather die than suffer indignity.” But remember the context of such couplets. They were meant for warriors and tribes that fought for their identities. Extending them to individuals who are challenged by life events and threatened by societal norms may be in-appropriate. Let the new ideal be this: Honour belongs to those who live. Pride rests with the resilient. Let us stop eulogising those who fall into darkness and instead uplift those who walk through it. If Ridhanya had whispered to herself, ‘ one year from now, none of this will matter’, perhaps she might have lived. Her parents might have been spared a grief no justice can heal. We owe our children a new legacy—not one of quiet suffering, but of radiant survival. Because in the end, life is precious, and to live it—truly live it—takes more courage than we ever speak of.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122250148,imgsize-57366,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/122250148.jpg"

Even CUET high scorers upset over discrepancies

NEW DELHI: Two woman candidates feature among the top three in the Common University Entrance Test for Undergraduate programmes (CUET-UG 2025), results for which were declared by National Testing Agency Friday. But declaration of results has not stopped candidates, including high scorers, from questioning syllabus deviations, errors in question papers and response sheets, as well as the normalisation process.Ananya Jain from Punjab, with an aggregate of 1225.93, emerged as the topper and was the only candidate to secure 100 percentile in four of the five subjects opted for. Arjav Jain from Delhi secured the second-highest score, followed by Purva Singh from Haryana.Aneesh Jain from Rajasthan was in fourth place, followed by Raghav Saraf from Haryana.Around 13.54 lakh students registered for the exam this year, marginally higher than 13.47 lakh in 2024, but the number of candidates who appeared dropped to 10.71 lakh from 11.13 lakh last year.In the top 20 candidates, five are from Haryana, three from Delhi, two each from Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka, and one each from Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Odisha, West Bengal and Maharashtra.This year, candidates scored full marks (250) in just five subjects, compared to full marks (200) being achieved in 45 subjects in 2024. The test covered 37 subjects and 13 languages, and was conducted over 19 days across 300 cities, including 15 international locations. The number of universities participating fell to 239 from 283 in 2024, indicating that some institutions opted out amid concerns about the test's evolving framework and operational challenges.Among subjects, psychology, political science, business studies, Punjabi, and Urdu saw candidates achieving the highest possible score of 250, while the top score in physical education was as low as 219, highlighting variations across disciplines. Seventeen candidates scored 100 percentile in three subjects, 150 managed it in two subjects, and 2,679 aspirants scored 100 percentile in one subject.Candidates continued to express frustration on social media over the exam and many have written to the education ministry seeking remedial action. Even high scorers voiced disappointment over discrepancies. Matangsih Zula from Ahmedabad, who wrote to the local MP and the ministry, said he had raised concerns with NTA about errors in response sheets and answer keys a month ago but got no reply. Zula, who scored 99 percentile in GAT, 97 in English, 94.5 in mathematics and 93 in economics, had challenged six questions in the provisional key, of which three were later corrected.Candidates particularly highlighted issues with the physical education paper, alleging that despite formal challenges, the agency failed to revise key answers. Aspirants pointed out that Unit 3 in the official syllabus allowed them to choose ""one sport of their choice,"" but the test carried mandatory questions from multiple sports. NTA had earlier stated: ""The panel of subject experts decided not to provide options in Unit 3, as it was deemed impractical. Questions included in the paper were fundamental in nature"". The response failed to allay concerns.","Ananya Jain from Punjab emerged as the topper and was the only candidate to secure 100 percentile in four of the five subjects opted for.

CHANDIGARH: Panjab University students have to give an undertaking at the time of admission to stay away from drugs and submit to medical tests at random. This mandatory declaration binds students and their parents to acknowledge university's zero-tolerance policy on drugs, alcohol and tobacco - both in hostels and on campus.According to new rules, students must consent to undergo random drug testing - including breath, blood or urine analysis - if deemed necessary by Panjab University (PU) authorities. The move is in line with a University Grants Commission advisory, calling on all higher educational institutions to implement anti-drug measures. It recommended obtaining written commitments from students, creating awareness, and strengthening surveillance systems to prevent substance abuse.The university's new undertaking warns of strict disciplinary action, including suspension, expulsion or legal proceedings against students found in possession of or involved in consumption or distribution of banned substances.PU authorities have also introduced compulsory guest registration in hostels and are in the process of tightening access control.Officials said the anti-drug undertaking was part of a broader crackdown to safeguard campus environment and student wellbeing.""This isn't just about one incident. The undertaking, awareness drives and improved monitoring are part of a systematic effort to make PU a safe and drug-free campus,"" said a senior official.PU has instructed all departments and hostel wardens to collect signed undertakings from students and their parents before finalizing admissions.The move comes after the death of an outsider of a suspected drug overdose in a PU boys' hostel in Nov.

Relief for commercial vehicles: Up to 50% reduction in toll for elevated sections on NHs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/relief-for-commercial-vehicles-up-to-50-reduction-in-toll-for-elevated-sections-on-nhs/articleshow/122257032.cms,"NEW DELHI: After announcing the Annual Toll Pass for private cars on NHs, the road transport ministry has notified a new rule to reduce the toll rate up to 50% for structures such as bridge, tunnel, flyover or elevated sections. This will bring relief to commercial and heavy vehicles, particularly on tolled sections that have more such structures.TOI on June 27 had first reported the govt decision to rationalise the toll.Till now the toll charge for structures on NHs and Expressways under Central govt was 10 times more than the normal user fee. But as per the fresh amendments to NH Toll Fee Rules notified on June 1, there will be two methodologies to calculate the toll charge and whichever is lower will be applicable.As per the new norm, the toll charge for a section of NH consisting of structure or structures will be calculated by adding 10 times the length of structure to the non-structure or normal road length or five times the total length of section of a tolled NH, whichever is lesser.This will bring major relief to those using highway stretches that have more than 50% length as structures.Take for example, if a tolled section of NH is 40 km — 30 km structure and 10 km normal road — then the minimum length will be computed as 10x30 + 10 = 310 km or five times the total length of the section which is 5x40 = 200 km.So, in this case, the toll charge will be collected for 200 km since it’s lower.But suppose, the 40 km tolled stretch has 10 km structures and 30 km normal road, then the minimum length will be calculated as 10x10 + 30 = 130 km or five times of the total length of the section which is 5x40 = 200 km. So, in this case, the toll charge will be collected for 130 km, something that is in practice now.In case the entire tolled corridor is one or more structures, the toll charge will be simply reduced to 50%.","Till now toll charge for structures on NHs and Expressways under Central govt was 10 times more than the normal user fee.

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: While inaugurating Shri Amarnath Shrine Board’s Yatri Niwas Complex at Baltal, around 92km northeast of Srinagar, J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Friday said more than 20,000 devotees had already performed darshan at the holy cave. Meanwhile, the third batch of 6,411 pilgrims left Jammu’s Bhagwati Nagar base camp for the Himalayan shrine.This year’s annual pilgrimage began on July 3 and will conclude on Aug 9. The yatra is proceeding seamlessly along both routes — Pahalgam (Anantnag) and Baltal (Ganderbal) — amid tight security. Escorted by CRPF, devotees from the third batch travelled in 291 vehicles. Of them, 3,622 pilgrims took the Pahalgam route while 2,789 opted for Baltal.Sinha lauded the people of J&K for extending a warm welcome to the devotees. “There is an atmosphere of celebration across J&K. Pilgrims are feeling blessed to be part of this journey of faith and tradition,” he said.Sinha said the Baltal Yatri Niwas Complex, developed by ONGC under its CSR initiative, can accommodate 800 pilgrims and includes registration facilities. Devotees arriving before their scheduled date would be accommodated, but those with prior registration would be prioritized.ONGC is constructing similar facilities at Sidhra, Nunwan and Bijbehara at a cost of Rs 240 crore, he added.Sinha noted that widened tracks, safety railings, and grid-powered lighting have made the Yatra safer, allowing 24x7 monitoring. Over 3.5 lakh pilgrims have registered online so far.Traffic advisories have been issued for smooth movement on the Jammu-Srinagar NH, with fixed cut-off timings for Yatra convoys.","The third batch of 6,411 pilgrims left Jammu’s Bhagwati Nagar base camp for the Himalayan shrine.

We had trained some NHAI engineers at IIT, Delhi. We could understand that they don’t have the competence to deal with DPRs. They don’t have interest in deep diving into the DPR either because they are too bureaucratic or give that task to an external consultant,” he said in the presence of Ajay Tamta, MoS of roadtransport and highways minietry.Highways passing through urban areas need special attention as the number of fatal crashes are usually higher due to more conflict of different road users.SPA and IIT-Delhi offered to the ministry to take up some pilot projects of evaluating DPRs prepared for NHAI and other agencies. The IIT leadership also suggested the minister to set up a Centre of Excellence to deal with crash investigation.Addressing the gathering, Tamta called for a paradigm shift from reactive construction to proactive, innovation-led planning, where road projects are no longer isolated engineering exercises, but integrated, multi-sectoral development tools. He said there is a need for innovations which not only improve safety, but also tackle chronic issues in road projects such as land acquisition challenges, urban traffic congestion, poor last-mile connectivity, and cost overruns.","Highways passing through urban areas need special attention as the number of fatal crashes are usually higher due to more conflict of different road users.

Poll Do you believe families should have the right to conduct multiple funerals for the same individual in cases of fragmented remains? Yes, it's their right to grieve. No, it should be limited to one.

AHMEDABAD: Six families of victims of the AI 171 crash on Thursday received a ""second set"" of remains from the Civil Hospital here. For some, this may mean a second funeral.These remains were from the 16 more found at the wreckage site in Meghaninagar during post-disaster operations; they were matched with DNA samples provided by kin.A consent form had been distributed among relatives of the deceased, including passengers, crew members, doctors, their relatives and local residents, sources close to the development said. ""The form sought permission to carry out the last rites of remains that may be found during further clearing of the spot or during medical analysis,"" an official said.The six families, all from different parts of Gujarat, including Anand, Nadiad, and Ahmedabad, had asked hospital authorities to approach them in case of a DNA match. ""It is rare for the same person to have more than one funeral, but in this case the families have the DNA match and certificate of handover of the mortal remains. Thus, there will be no issue even if there is more than one funeral for the remains,"" added the official.Of the remaining 10 victims, the families of nine have consented to the hospital carrying out the last rites, whereas a response from the family of one victim is awaited, said the sources.The sources added the new sets of remains are minuscule compared to the first. ""Some have part of the body, whereas some have one or more bones. Due to the nature of the crash, it is possible that victims' bodies underwent intense distress that may have caused fragmentation,"" an official associated with the process said.At June-end, Gujarat's health department put the air crash death toll at 260. The figure included 229 passengers and 12 crew members aboard the ill-fated flight, totalling 241. The remaining 19 people lost their lives on the ground.All mortal remains were sent to forensic laboratories for DNA matching with the existing record of relatives.","Six families of victims of the AI 171 crash on Thursday received a ""second set"" of remains.

‘It’s Up To Them’ Owaisi Ready To Join Mahagathbandhan In Bihar Elections, Says NDA Must Go

EC uploads 2003 rolls, says most voters need not worry

Opposition says revision targets the poor, migrants

EC Trying To Push NRC 'Through Backdoor'- TMC Blasts Poll Body, Alleges 'Nazi' Action | Bihar Polls

Massive on-ground push by all parties

NEW DELHI: A fresh controversy has erupted in poll-bound Bihar over the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the state's electoral rolls, a process the Election Commission of India (ECI) insists is legally mandated, even as opposition parties allege it could end up deleting ""tens of lakhs"" of genuine voters, especially the poor, migrants, and those on the margins.While the EC said that the revision, happening after 22 years, is in line with the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, opposition parties claim the timing is suspiciously close to the assembly polls and could ""skew the voter base"".""There is nothing more transparent in a democracy than the law. “Despite apprehensions of some persons, SIR will ensure that all eligible persons are included,” Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar told TOI.As part of the roll-revise process, voters may be asked to submit documents to support their claims, not just for themselves, but also for their parents if their names are mentioned. Each document must be self-attested and submitted separately for the individual, father, and mother.However, there's one major relief: If a person's name appears in the Bihar electoral roll dated January 1, 2003, that alone will be treated as sufficient proof, no additional documents will be needed in that case.Highlighting the exclusion of Aadhaar from this voter revision process, Congress's in charge of Bihar Krishna Allavaru accused the EC of ""acting under government pressure"".""Whenever the government faces a crisis, its agencies begin such actions,"" he said.""It is strange that the very voters who elected this government are now being asked to prove their identity. By excluding Aadhaar from this voter revision process, eight crore people are being asked to submit documents they don't have,"" the Congress leader added.Trying to calm nerves, the EC clarified this week that 4.96 crore out of Bihar's 7.89 crore registered voters won't need to submit parental documents during the revision. This includes those already listed in the 2003 electoral rolls or born to such electors.To make things smoother for booth level officers (BLOs) and voters alike, the EC has uploaded the 2003 Bihar rolls on its website for easy access.On Wednesday, leaders from 11 opposition parties, including Congress, RJD, TMC, DMK, SP, JMM, and Left parties, met the Election Commission, calling the revision ""disastrous"". They warned that the EC’s guidelines on verifying if someone is ""ordinarily resident"" in a constituency may disqualify large sections of migrants, who form a major chunk of Bihar’s electorate.The opposition argued that a revision this close to elections casts doubt on the EC’s intentions. But interestingly, despite their public opposition, these parties have joined the ground-level process, appointing thousands of booth level agents (BLAs) to keep watch.Contrary to their protests, opposition parties have gone all in. The RJD has deployed 47,143 BLAs, second only to BJP's 51,964. Congress has appointed 8,586, while Left outfits like CPI(ML), CPM, and CPI have sent in their own agents. On the NDA side, JDU, LJP, and RLSP have mobilised more than 30,000 BLAs in total.The election commission claimed it was determined to follow Article 326 of the Constitution, which mandates that only Indian citizens aged 18 or above and ordinarily resident in a constituency should be enrolled.“SIR is in line with Article 326. It’s a straight question (to the parties criticising SIR): Do you agree with Article 326 or not?"" a senior EC official said.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) is revising Bihar's electoral rolls.

BENGALURU: Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) will roll out the first LCA Tejas Mk1A from its new Nashik production line by the end of July, with integration and test firing of the Astra air-to-air missile scheduled for early August, HAL CMD DK Sunil told TOI in an interview.The rollout from Nashik marks a key milestone in HAL’s efforts to scale up Tejas production, even as the programme works through engine supply constraints and indigenous radar integration delays. “The first aircraft from Nashik is already in final assembly and under testing. We expect the rollout in a month,” Sunil said, adding that while the current year may see three to four aircraft from Nashik, the plant has been built to support an annual output of eight.At present, HAL is operating two production lines in Bengaluru and has initiated the third at Nashik. A parallel private-sector supply chain — comprising VEM Technologies (centre fuselage), Alpha (rear fuselage), and L&T (wings) — is expected to contribute towards an additional six aircraft a year, eventually raising the overall production capacity to 30 aircraft annually.He said that despite engine supply delays from GE, HAL is pressing ahead with deliveries.“We have already built six aircraft which are ready and flying,” Sunil said. HAL expects to produce 12 aircraft this year, using available GE engines in rotation to carry out critical test flights. GE has assured delivery of 12 engines this year, with the second engine expected this month after only one had arrived by April.Integration of Astra missile, developed by DRDO, is scheduled for early August. “We need to have some of the other issues sorted out like the firing of the missile, the Astra missile, which we plan to do in August, early August,” he said.On radar integration, HAL faced criticism for opting to continue with the imported ELTA radar from Israel for all Tejas Mk1A fighters under the current contract, instead of switching midstream — from the 41st aircraft — to the indigenous Uttam AESA radar.Sunil clarified that 40 ELTA radars were contracted initially, with a plan to introduce Uttam from the 41st aircraft onwards. However, delays in certification of both the Uttam radar and associated electronic warfare (EW) suite, also being developed by DRDO, forced HAL’s hand.He noted that over the last three years, HAL has held several meetings with senior officials from DRDO and IAF, but the certification timelines have repeatedly slipped. “As a manufacturer, when we’re under pressure for not delivering, the risk becomes ours. If we wait and the systems still aren’t certified, we are left with no aircraft to hand over.”“There was a clear directive from DRDO headquarters in Feb 2024 that if certification is not achieved by year-end, HAL may proceed. That meeting and directive are on record. We waited until March this year, but when progress still hadn’t been made, we moved forward.”In response to persistent concerns from the Indian Air Force about unmet aircraft staff qualitative requirements (ASQRs), Sunil attributed the delays to legacy issues and dependency on various partners including ADA and DRDO. “Parallel efforts are underway to close these issues across multiple aircraft. It’s not that there’s no effort — it’s just that the closure needs to be more structured,” he said.HAL aims to deliver all 12 Tejas Mk1As scheduled for this year, with the full production ecosystem — including public and private lines — expected to reach a steady state of 30 aircraft annually from 2026-27.","HAL aims to deliver all 12 Tejas Mk1As scheduled for this year, with the full production ecosystem — including public and private lines — expected to reach a steady state of 30 aircraft annually from 2026-27.Integration of Astra missile, developed by DRDO, is scheduled for early August.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122234163,imgsize-748620,width-400,resizemode-4/122234163.jpg"

Poll Which acquisition project do you think is most crucial for national security? Mine Countermeasure Vessels QRSAM Air Defence Systems

QRSAMs designed to intercept hostile fighters

NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Thursday gave preliminary nod to three major acquisition projects and seven smaller ones, collectively worth over Rs 1 lakh crore, ranging from specialised spy aircraft and advanced minesweepers to quick-reaction air defence missiles and underwater autonomous vessels.The biggest project to get “acceptance of necessity (AoN)”, which is just the first step in the long-winded procurement process, was for the indigenous construction of 12 mine countermeasure vessels (MCMVs) for around Rs 44,000 crore, which will take almost a decade, sources told TOI.These specialised warships, each with a displacement of 900-1,000 tonne, will be capable of detecting, tracking and destroying underwater mines laid by enemy forces to choke harbours and ports, disrupt shipping and maritime trade.They are crucial amid the expanding maritime collusiveness between China and Pakistan. At present, the Navy makes do with just “clip-on mine countermeasure suites” mounted on some ships to plug the major capability gap.The second big project was the Rs 36,000 crore procurement of the new quick reaction surface to air missile (QRSAM) systems developed by DRDO , with three regiments for the Army and three squadrons for the IAF.Overall, the Army Air Defence (AAD) has projected a requirement of 11 such regiments.These highly-mobile QRSAMs, designed to intercept hostile fighters, helicopters and drones at ranges up to 30 km, will add to the country’s existing multi-layered air defence network that played a crucial role under Operation Sindoor in thwarting multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles launched by Pakistan during the May 7-10 hostilities.The third major project was for three ISTAR (intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance) planes, designed to identify and help target high-value enemy targets on the ground with greater precision and accuracy by fighter jets and missiles, for around Rs 10,000 crore.These aircraft will be equipped with a wide array of indigenous sensors and systems developed by DRDO, like synthetic aperture radars, electro-optical and infrared sensors, for gathering “actionable intelligence” in real-time on enemy infrastructure, build-ups and movements.Another interesting project granted AoN was for semi-submersible autonomous vessels for ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) missions. They will be acquired under the ‘Make-II’ category project, where prototype development is funded by the industry.Two other naval projects included procurement, through competitive bidding, of super-rapid gun mounts (SRGMs), which are the main 76mm guns fitted on warships, and the DRDO-developed “processor-based moored mines” that detonate upon sensing an enemy warship’s acoustic, magnetic or pressure signature.AoNs were also accorded for procurement of armoured recovery vehicles, electronic warfare systems and the tri-Service integrated common inventory management system for better supply chain management, the MoD said.","The defence ministry on Thursday gave preliminary nod to three major acquisition projects and seven smaller ones, collectively worth over Rs 1 lakh crore.

Brooklyn Aleksic’s rapid battle with Transverse Myelitis



Brooklyn Aleksic’s fundraiser launched as family braces for a long and costly recovery

A bright young curler and University of Victoria student, Brooklyn Aleksic, suddenly awoke unable to move her body one June morning. In just two hours, she lost use of her neck and limbs. Now facing life “paralyzed from the neck down,” she and her family have launched a fundraising campaign as they begin an uncertain path toward treatment and recovery.On a summer morning in early June 2025, 20‑year‑old Brooklyn Aleksic woke up ready for her job in Saskatchewan but instead, within hours, she was completely paralyzed from the neck down. Diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis, a rare spinal cord inflammation, the condition is typically sudden and severe. Her mother, Shannon Joanisse, told CTV News that “within two hours of waking up … she was completely paralyzed from her neck down. ”Aleksic is well known in Canada’s curling community. A top student at UVic and a featured athlete in the 2024 documentary Curl Power, she had a full summer planned before this crisis. Retired curler Diane Dezura, now organizing the GoFundMe, called Brooklyn’s condition “rapid and severe,” noting she can no longer sit up, move her legs, or care for herself.The GoFundMe campaign, organized by Dezura on behalf of Shannon Joanisse, reports that extensive rehabilitation, equipment, and 24/7 care will be required. It warns: “The damage to her spinal cord is extensive … her path will be long, uncertain and expensive.” Brooklyn is receiving plasma exchange treatments in hopes of reversing the damage, “at the end of this week, she will have had 14 plasma exchanges.”Also Read: Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al Nassr Deal Worth $700 Million Sets Dangerous New Bar In Sports Salaries Her mother describes Brooklyn as “a ray of light,” bright, positive, and academically driven . Despite losing her physical abilities, she continues to smile and joke, inspiring many around her.

Based on Brad Marchand’s longevity, Steve Yzerman builds a plan around Dylan Larkin and Alex DeBrincat

Steve Yzerman Addresses the Detroit Red Wings Free Agency | July 3, 2025

Finally, a late-career contract: At 37 years of age, the Florida Panther winger has signed a six-year, $31.5-million contract that will keep him in the league through the age of 43. The question being raised there, beyond the headlines: Can the modern athlete extend his prime years? Being a Red Wings general manager, Yzerman believes in this and is cherishing that ideology for his stars, Dylan Larkin and Alex DeBrincat.Brad Marchand’s contract with the Florida Panthers is no longer just money or roster talk; it is a testimony that elite players can remain effective well into their late 30s and early 40s. Scoring 20 points in 23 postseason games, Marchand was the key factor in the Panthers' back-to-back Stanley Cups and delivered a roar of validation for this long-term commitment.For Steve Yzerman, who has been sketching Detroit's highway to playoff relevance, Marchand's scenario has the loud and clear message that even hated stars have huge appeal. Speaking about his core, Yzerman joked about having captain Dylan Larkin ""for another 15 years.""But the philosophy behind it is building a future around players such as 28-year-old Larkin and 27-year-old Alex DeBrincat, who happen to be in their physical prime and aren't slowing down.Larkin's consistency-high 576 points over 734 games and nearly 20 minutes of average ice time performed well with DeBrincat, who has 517 career points, 137 since hitting the ice in Detroit. The Wings front office is probably rather confident this tandem can be counted on for a long-term run, as they continue to groom more youth stars around them.On the other hand, with the NHL about to institute an 84-game schedule, Yzerman has offered his insights into the opportunities and challenges it brings along. He praised the balance it brings to divisional rivalries, yet with another eye placed on player load management, with particular concern for veterans and fringe roster guys.Also Read: Gary Bettman talks about NHL growth, global play and future goals on the Pat McAfee Show The procedure of renewing Brad Marchand’s contract has sparked a new wave of conversation about athlete longevity in the NHL. For executives like Steve Yzerman, it's a timely case study, one he's trying to apply to the development formula of his team. With older players like Dylan Larkin and Alex DeBrincat along with emerging prospects, Detroit's future could very well tread the path of Marchand: experienced, durable, and effective.","Brad Marchand's six-year, $31.5-million contract with the Florida Panthers sparks reaction from Detroit Red Wings general manager Steve Yzerman.

‘I couldn't support Elon Musk any longer…’: Tesla employee resigns after 7 years citing moral conflict with Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/i-couldnt-support-elon-musk-any-longer-tesla-employee-resigns-after-7-years-citing-moral-conflict-with-musk/articleshow/122188860.cms,"Tesla employee resigns after 7 years citing moral conflict with Musk

‘Tesla gave me a future’: Ex-employee on how the company transformed his life

Ex-Tesla employee quits due to Musk’s politics

An emotional exit after 7 years



Respect for the company, not the leadership

After seven years of working at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, former engineering technician Trae Cervantes has made the difficult decision to step away from the company, citing moral discomfort with CEO Elon Musk ’s recent actions. Cervantes, who began his career as a production associate in 2018, steadily advanced to an engineering technician role before formally resigning in March 2025. His departure was not spurred by workplace conditions or job dissatisfaction, but rather by a growing unease over Musk’s political involvement and public conduct.In an interview with Business Insider, Cervantes reflected on both the opportunities and challenges he experienced at Tesla. He joined the company during the high-demand ramp-up of the Model 3 production line and described his early days as physically taxing but professionally rewarding.“I started out on their production line for the Model 3 and I moved up from there,” Cervantes said. “When I started out, it was gruelling work. It was pushing heavy things up and down aisles. I was on my feet for 12 hours a day, but they also give you three to four days off a week to recover.”Tesla supported Cervantes' growth over the years, offering him access to professional development programs, including certifications in advanced manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma through local college partnerships.Cervantes credits Tesla with helping him build a career despite having no formal education or technical training before joining the company.“I was getting paid the most I'd ever gotten in my adult life,” he said. “No education, no real skills to speak of, and Tesla offered me opportunities to take charge of my life and grow my career.”He highlighted how the work culture at Tesla—particularly among peers and supervisors—was largely positive and focused on efficiency, learning, and advancement.“I stayed because they kept treating me well. I didn’t have a reason to leave for a long time,” Cervantes noted.However, Cervantes' sentiment toward the company began to shift as Musk became more active politically and made several high-profile public moves, including acquiring Twitter and engaging in voter-related controversies.“What I took issue with the most was the giveaway for prospective voters,” he said, referring to a public campaign Musk promoted. “It seemed so morally wrong. I didn't want to be associated with that.”The turning point for Cervantes came when Musk's public image, behaviour, and political commentary became more prominent in association with Tesla’s identity.“Last year, I started to be ashamed to tell people where I work,” he admitted.While Cervantes did not go into detail about every incident that caused concern, he made it clear that the cumulative effect of Musk’s public actions led him to feel ethically conflicted about remaining with the company.Cervantes decided to leave Tesla without securing another job. He described his final conversation with his supervisor as emotional and honest.“I have to leave. I can't do this anymore. It's getting to a point where I feel like I'm compromising myself morally by walking through those doors every day,” he recalled telling his manager.The decision was not taken lightly. “I’m not going to lie, I cried a little. Seven years is a long time, and Tesla wasn’t always a bad thing for me,” Cervantes shared.While Cervantes walked away from his position at Tesla, he was careful to clarify that his issue was not with the company’s workforce or its mission, but with its leadership.“There are plenty of good people at Tesla. I didn’t leave the place because of the company. I left because of the face of the company,” he stated, referring directly to Elon Musk.","Trae Cervantes worked as an engineering technician at Tesla's Gigafactory in Nevada for seven years.

What is the Einstein visa? How Melania Trump qualified for a visa reserved for Nobel-level talent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-einstein-visa-how-melania-trump-qualified-for-a-visa-reserved-for-nobel-level-talent/articleshow/122204926.cms,"

What is the EB-1 or 'Einstein' visa?

How did Melania Trump qualify for the Einstein visa?

The larger debate: Loopholes, privilege, and policy





When Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the “Einstein visa,” in 2001, it raised eyebrows and continues to stir debate. Reserved for individuals with “extraordinary ability” in fields such as science, arts, education, business, or athletics, the EB-1 green card is typically associated with Nobel laureates, Olympic medalists, or globally recognized experts. Melania, a Slovenian model at the time, was not widely known for groundbreaking accomplishments, prompting questions about how she met the high bar required. So, what exactly is the Einstein visa, and how did the former First Lady qualify for a program meant for the world’s best and brightest?The EB-1 visa is a US employment-based green card designed for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in specific fields, or who are recognized as outstanding professors, researchers, or multinational executives. Applicants must prove “sustained national or international acclaim” and either win a major international award (like a Nobel Prize) or meet at least three of ten criteria set by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). These include published work, media recognition, contributions to a field of major significance, or commanding a high salary compared to others in the same field.While the standards are rigorous, the process is subjective.Immigration officers ultimately decide if the evidence supports a claim of extraordinary ability. This subjectivity has sparked debate over how consistently the criteria are applied and who benefits most from its loopholes.Melania Trump, then known as Melania Knauss, was living in New York as a model when she applied for the EB-1 visa in 2000. It was approved the following year. Though she was featured in magazines and had some runway experience, she had not received prestigious modeling awards or reached the supermodel status typically associated with international acclaim. Critics argue her qualifications were modest compared to the visa's intent.Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett recently reignited the controversy, questioning whether Melania’s case truly exemplifies merit-based immigration. Her approval has drawn comparisons to other questionable EB-1 recipients, including Playboy models and niche artists who managed to craft narratives aligning with the visa’s requirements.Experts note that while the visa is often seen as exclusive, it can be awarded to applicants whose accomplishments, though not widely known, are well-documented and strategically framed within a narrow field. In Melania’s case, her successful petition may have emphasized uniqueness in her modeling niche, media presence, or professional trajectory.The EB-1 program, limited to around 40,000 visas annually, has been praised for attracting top global talent. But its subjective evaluation process has also made it vulnerable to exploitation. Legal experts and immigration attorneys admit that certain applicants with the right legal guidance can tailor their portfolios to meet the criteria, even without widely celebrated achievements.Adding to the irony, Melania later used her citizenship to sponsor her parents for green cards through “chain migration,” a policy her husband, Donald Trump, has publicly opposed. This contradiction has further politicized her immigration journey and raised broader questions about fairness, privilege, and transparency in the US immigration system.","Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the ‘Einstein visa,’ in 2001.

Microsoft’s middle management is the target in its second largest ever round of layoffs



Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees Wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year. The cuts, affecting less than 4% of Microsoft's global workforce, hit the Xbox gaming division particularly hard, with several high-profile game cancellations and studio closures announced alongside the layoffs.The job cuts span multiple teams across geographies and tenure levels as Microsoft seeks to streamline operations and reduce management layers. The company cited ""organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace"" as the primary driver for the workforce reduction.The layoffs eliminated hundreds of positions across Microsoft's gaming subsidiaries, including King (makers of Candy Crush), ZeniMax, Raven Software, Sledgehammer Games, Halo Studios, and Turn 10 Studios. Microsoft also shuttered The Initiative studio and canceled the highly anticipated Perfect Dark reboot and fantasy game Everwild after years of development.Microsoft's Stockholm-based King division is cutting 10% of its workforce, eliminating approximately 200 positions. The Initiative, a premium Xbox studio established to develop AAA exclusives, will close entirely following the Perfect Dark cancellation .

The gaming division employed about 20,000 people as of January 2024.The latest cuts represent Microsoft's fourth mass layoff in the gaming division within 18 months, following the company's $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition in October 2023. Microsoft previously eliminated 6,000 positions in May, targeting product and engineering roles, plus an additional 300 workers in June.The company cited the need to ""remove layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness"" while redirecting resources toward artificial intelligence development. Microsoft's AI-related expenses reached approximately $80 billion in the last fiscal year as it competes in the generative AI market.“We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the spokesperson said.Affected employees will receive severance packages including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources, with priority consideration for other positions within Microsoft's broader organization.","Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees Wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year.

Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan may be planning this 'big change' in company's chip manufacturing business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-may-be-planning-this-big-change-in-companys-chip-manufacturing-business/articleshow/122214957.cms,"Why Intel’s new CEO may not be ‘happy’ with chipmaking process promoted by ex-chief



Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers. This potential shift deviates from his predecessor's plans and could involve substantial investment. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, two sources familiar with the matter revealed that this new strategy for Intel's foundry business would involve offering outside customers a newer generation of technology. Analysts also reportedly believe that this next-generation chipmaking process would position Intel more competitively against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) in securing large clients like Apple or Nvidia.After taking over as the company’s new CEO in March, Tan has been reassessing the company's investment in its 18A chip manufacturing process, which was promoted by former CEO Pat Gelsinger .The Reuters report cited sources to claim that Tan has expressed concerns that 18A is not attracting enough external clients and may result in a major financial write-off if Intel stops marketing it to new customers. Intel has already spent billions on developing 18A and its variant, 18A-P.While Intel continues using 18A for in-house chips and select commitments to companies like Amazon and Microsoft , Tan may be shifting focus to the 14A process, the Reuters report claims.Intel believes 14A could offer a stronger competitive position against Taiwan-based rival TSMC, whose N2 and N3 technologies are already in production or close to it, the report adds.As per the Reuters report, Tan is expected to present strategic options to Intel’s board, potentially by this month. However, a final decision may not come until later in the year due to the high stakes involved.Meanwhile, Intel continues restructuring under Tan’s leadership, with steps including new engineering hires and streamlined management. Last year, Intel posted a net loss of $18.8 billion, which was its first unprofitable year since 1986, as it works to regain ground lost in past tech transitions.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers.
