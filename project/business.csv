NEW DELHI: The next phase of central assistance (seed funding) for states to take up transformative projects under the Rs 1 lakh crore Urban Challenge Fund (UCF) will focus more on revitalising core areas of cities and fixing legacy infrastructure gaps, such as bad drainage, sanitation and polluted water bodies.Officials said the focus of this funding will be on projects that have a transformative impact. Centre will provide such financial aids to 500-1,000 small cities as well to take up projects, they said.The housing and urban affairs ministry has finalised the UCF scheme and it is likely to be launched soon, sources said.TOI on Jan 13 had reported that PM Narendra Modi has directed ministry officials to focus more on creating facilities, amenities and better transportation network in those areas of cities which naturally attract people and businesses, rather than developing new cities.Following the PM's direction, more thrust is now on having a better framework for transit-oriented development (TOD) for cities to push intensive and planned growth along transportation networks, the sources said.Speaking at a CII-organised conference, additional secretary in the ministry, D Thara, said, ""In UCF, we are looking at revitalisation of cities and fixing of legacy infrastructure as a primary goal.We are not in a hurry to fund. We are clear that these projects should bring huge transformation and big impact. It can't be unfixing small things here and there. The project could be of any size but it has to be make a lot of difference to citizens. "" The focus is not about building afresh but about fixing what already exists, she added.Officials said under UCF, govt is also likely to provide seed fund for developing new greenfield areas, with good rail connectivity, as future cities.In her Budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the seting up of UCF to implement proposals for 'Cities as Growth Hubs', 'Creative Redevelopment of Cities' and 'Water and Sanitation'.","Officials said the focus of this funding will be on projects that have a transformative impact.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: SC Probe Panel Report Says Misconduct Proved, Proposes Justice Varma’s Removal

NEW DELHI: The inquiry committee on the Justice Varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the HC judge in his defence - that the cash could have been planted in the storeroom of his residence and that the storeroom was set afire by an act of arson to implicate him.The committee, constituted on March 22 by then CJI Sanjiv Khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges - Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman.It examined 55 witnesses, including Justice Varma, which were video recorded, to confirm every report of TOI on the sensational controversy. The panel's report also referred to TOI's March 21 story breaking the news.Also read: SC panel proposes impeachment of Justice Yashwant Varma - What probe report said Rejecting Justice Varma's defence - that ""someone could have planted the cash in the storeroom in his absence as it was accessible to everyone"" - the panel in its 64-page report said, ""The overall control and the permission to have access to the storeroom was undeniably with Justice Varma.""This should remove all doubts about the launch of proceedings for removal of the HC judge in the monsoon session of Parliament beginning on July 21.The panel cited the fact that the judge was in control of the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow to reject his defence of conspiracy and arson - essentially that someone with mala fide intention planted the cash at his official bungalow and then set off the fire. Referring to statements of security personnel, the panel noted that no one could access the house without the permission of family members and ""therefore, it's well nigh impossible for currency to be planted in the storeroom of a sitting judge, which is being monitored by static 1+4 guard and a PSO stationed at the gate at all time, apart from the fact that the house abounds with a large number of old and trusted domestic servants with over six staff quarters"".The committee also disregarded the theory of ""arson"" - ""a criminal act of deliberately setting fire to property"" - belatedly flagged by Justice Varma. Members of the panel said that by the judge's own initial version, the fire was triggered by a short circuit, besides noting that he did not follow up by registering a police complaint.Significantly, the panel also underlined that the judge had quietly accepted his transfer to Allahabad HC, in the wake of publication of a report in TOI. ""The categorical acceptance on March 20, immediately, without any demur and, respectfully accepting the decision of repatriation to Allahabad would, in normal circumstances, only be done after discussion with family members at least and after an attempt to find out the reason for transfer, having served in Delhi HC for the last three years,"" the report said.""It is his categorical case that he has served diligently for a decade without any complaint. Thus, he would have liked to find out the reason for the transfer,"" it added.In conclusion, the inquiry panel said, ""In the absence of any plausible explanation coming from Justice Varma or his family members or, for that matter, any other witness, this committee is left with no option but to hold that the trust reposed in him was belied by him by allowing highly suspicious material in the shape of piles of currency notes to be stashed in the storeroom. Whether this stashing was done with tacit or explicit consent of Justice Varma or his family members is of little significance in the face of the larger concept of breach of public trust and probity expected of the high constitutional office held by Justice Varma. ""The committee repeatedly termed the post-cash discovery conduct of Justice Varma as ""unnatural"" and ""illogical"" and said, ""Keeping in view the direct and electronic evidence on record, this committee is firmly of the view that there is sufficient substance in the allegations raised in the letter of CJI (Sanjiv Khanna) dated March 22 and the misconduct found proved is serious enough to call for initiation of proceedings for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma. ""The committee also found it odd that the judge, who cut short his vacation in the Satpura forests after having been informed of the fire, did not deem it fit to visit the site until March 15 when the principal private secretary to the Delhi HC chief justice came for an inspection.The committee also stated that Justice Varma's daughter tried to dissuade firemen from entering the bungalow by telling them that the flames had already been controlled.The report said Justice Varma's private secretary, Delhi HC employee Rajinder Singh Karki, frantically tried to reach the judge on phone from the residence. ""He had a detailed conversation with Justice Varma at 1.23am on March 15"" when the judge asked him to stay back at the residence, the report said.It was Karki who instructed firemen not to mention burnt cash in their report, the panel said. It also found from the security guard's statement that Karki and a trusted servant, Mohd Rahil ""were busy supervising the cleaning up job after the fire wagons had left"".During questioning by the committee, Karki entangled himself in contradictory statements, the report said.The committee was also surprised to find that CCTV footage had been wiped out from the hard disc between March 15 and March 25, when the inquiry started.","The inquiry committee on the Justice Varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the HC judge in his defence.

'Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India Will Be Tough' Says Former CBI Director

LONDON: Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court for orchestrating what he refers to as his “kidnapping” from Antigua in 2021 in an alleged honeytrap plot.Choksi has claimed in the preliminary hearing that five people working for R&AW kidnapped him in Antigua and smuggled him on a yacht to Dominica in a plot masterminded by the Indian state in order to extradite him to India to face charges in the Rs 13,500 Punjab National Bank scam.Antigua police named Gurdip Bath, Barbara Jarabik, Gurmit Singh, Gurjit Singh Bhandal and Leslie Farrow-Guy as the five suspects, mostly UK-based, in the kidnapping. They are all being sued by Choksi alongside the Indian govt. They all deny the charges.The court documents were served on the ministry of external affairs by the British high commission in New Delhi.Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Choksi (66), told Justice Freedman on Monday that Choksi was filing a civil suit against the Indian govt for allegedly ordering Choksi to be kidnapped on May 21, 2021 and smuggled by yacht to Dominica.India denies any involvement, argues it is protected by state immunity and that the UK courts do not have jurisdiction for this case.Harish Salve KC, representing India’s govt, said: “There is no evidence of India having anything to do with the alleged events. The claimant’s account is rife with non sequiturs and unsupported assumptions. Those accused seem a rather unlikely band of state-sponsored conspirators.”Choksi is currently in jail in Belgium where he is fighting extradition proceedings brought by India.Choksi first met Barbara Jarabik, a Hungarian luxury goods expert, in Antigua in Aug 2020. In May 2021 she is alleged to have asked him to visit the apartment she had rented in Jolly Harbour.A group of men of Indian origin burst into the apartment and told Choksi he was “being detained to be interrogated by Indian agencies”, Fitzgerald told the court, London’s Times newspaper reported.Choksi alleges that the men told him they worked for R&AW and beat him up, left him unconscious, and tied him to a wheelchair on the yacht to Dominica to extort a false confession from him and implicate the Congress party.“The evidence points inevitably to India being behind this — they had the motivation, they had the resources,” Fitzgerald told the court, the Daily Telegraph reported.Choksi denies the charges against him. Thenext hearing is expected in September.",Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court.

Indian student's deportation sparks outrage

Over 1,000 Indians deported in recent months

NEW DELHI: The US Embassy in India has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a US visa is a privilege, not a right”, and that violating US laws, even after arrival, can lead to visa revocation and ineligibility for future travel.The statement, posted on the embassy’s official X handle on Thursday, emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.“Using illegal drugs or breaking any US laws while on a student/visitor visa can make you ineligible for future US visas. A US visa is a privilege, not a right… and we may revoke your visa if you break the law,” the embassy said.This is the third such advisory from the US Embassy in India in June alone, each one stressing Washington’s firm stance against visa misuse and illegal immigration.On June 10, the embassy stated that while the United States welcomes legitimate travellers, it ""cannot and will not tolerate"" illegal entry or violation of laws. A follow-up on June 16 went a step further, noting that the US has established new visa restrictions on foreign officials and facilitators of mass or illegal immigration.The latest statement comes amid a surge in deportation cases and the circulation of a viral video showing an Indian student in handcuffs at Newark Airport, allegedly being deported. The clip, shared by Indian-American author Kunal Jain, triggered a wave of concern across Indian social media.“I witnessed a young Indian student being deported from Newark Airport last night, handcuffed, crying, treated like a criminal. He came chasing dreams, not causing harm,” Jain posted on X. He said the student appeared to be from Haryana and was heard shouting: “I’m not crazy… they are hell bent to prove that I am crazy.”Jain, who tagged the Indian Embassy and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, alleged that such deportations were becoming alarmingly routine. “Every day 3-4 such cases are happening,” he wrote, describing the student as “disoriented and helpless.”As per India's Ministry of External Affairs, 1,080 Indian nationals have been deported from the US since the Trump administration returned to power earlier this year. The recent crackdown in Los Angeles has also seen mass immigration sweeps, with Trump declaring, “They spit, we hit,” in a controversial order during unrest in the city.","The US Embassy in India has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a US visa is a privilege, not a right” The statement emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.

NEW DELHI: In a move to improve safety of two-wheeler riders, the road transport ministry has decided to make the anti-lock braking systems (ABS) mandatory for all new scooties, bikes and motorcycles manufactured after January next year irrespective of their engine capacity. The ministry will also soon make it mandatory for manufacturers and dealers to provide two BIS-certified helmets with two-wheelers at the time of sale.Officials said the decisions are important considering that two-wheeler occupants have nearly 44% share of all road deaths in the country and most of these are due to head injuries caused because of not wearing safety gear.The notifications for both these regulations will be out in the next few days.“At present, ABS is mandatory only in two-wheelers having engine capacity of over 125cc and so nearly 45% bikes and motorcycles don’t have this. With the new notification, this will be applicable for all new bikes and motorcycles. As almost all these vehicles can achieve 70 kmph, this feature becomes all the more important to reduce chances of crashes,” said a ministry official.ABS is a safety feature that prevents wheel lock-up during sudden braking, enhancing control and reducing stopping distances, especially on slippery roads. According to different studies and estimates, ABS can reduce road crashes by 35-45%.On the decision to provide two certified helmets at the time of sale, an official said this is aimed at inculcating a behaviour among bike riders to use safe helmets. Till now, it’s mandatory to provide one helmet.","Road transport ministry has decided to make the anti-lock braking systems (ABS) mandatory for all new scooties, bikes and motorcycles manufactured after January next year.

Railways caps wait-list tickets at 25% of train's capacity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/railways-caps-wait-list-tickets-at-25-of-trains-capacity/articleshow/121961262.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: In a significant policy shift, the Indian Railways has started issuing wait-listed tickets for a maximum of 25% of total berths/seats in each class - AC1, 2, and 3, Sleeper, and Chair Car - of a train after accounting for different quotas like for the differently abled. This is aimed at reducing the uncertainty passengers face with non-confirmed tickets, reports Dipak Dash & Manthan Mehta.Officials said the cap on issuing wait-listed tickets is being done considering that in most cases around 20%-25% of them get confirmed by the time the passenger chart is prepared. Following a circular issued by the Railway Board, zonal railways have started implementing it.The decision has been taken considering the uncertainty people face after booking tickets and also in view of that many with wait-listed tickets enter reserved coaches, crowding trains, officials said.Till now, the maximum limit for wait list ticket for AC1 was 30 berths, AC2 was 100, AC3 was 300 and Sleeper was 400, as per a Jan 2013 circular.""Different railway zones will decide capping of wait list tickets as per the booking and cancellation pattern of trains,"" a railway ministry official said. The current practice of a large number of wait-listed tickets created a mismatch between confirmed bookings and the number of passengers boarding trains, leading to chaos, a senior Western Railway official said.","Indian Railways has started issuing wait-listed tickets for a maximum of 25% of total berths/seats in each class.

India kicks off much-needed review of arms procurement procedures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-kicks-off-much-needed-review-of-arms-procurement-procedures/articleshow/121955168.cms,"Review of its cumbersome defence acquisition procedure (DAP) of 2020.

India Air Force Fighter Jets Put Up Stunning Display of Night-Landing Skills on Ganga Expressway

NEW DELHI: India has kicked off the much-needed comprehensive review of its cumbersome defence acquisition procedure (DAP) of 2020, with the aim to slash timelines in procurement of weapon systems and platforms as well as promote self-reliance in design, development and production with greater private sector participation.The defence ministry on Thursday said a committee headed by additional secretary and director general (acquisition) Dipti Mohil Chawla, which includes senior officers and representatives from the industry and academia, has already begun consultations with all stakeholders.Former health and I&B secretary Apurva Chandra, who had a stint as the DG (acquisition) in MoD, is the principal advisor to the committee. “The panel has invited suggestions from stakeholders on various fronts, including procedural changes to streamline the acquisition processes, by July 5,” an official said.The aim of the DAP review is to meet the operational requirements and modernisation of the armed forces “in a timely manner to ensure national security” and align acquisition procedures with govt policies to achieve “atmanirbharta” (self-reliance) by promoting technology infusion through indigenously designed and developed systems.“The ‘Make in India’ policy also needs to be enabled by promoting defence manufacturing in India through facilitation of JVs and transfer of technology for the private sector, encouraging foreign arms manufacturers via FDI alignment, and establishing a global defence manufacturing and MRO hub here,” he said.“The idea is also to promote design and development in both public and private sectors, with a focus on start-ups, innovators, and the private defence industry for indigenous technology infusion,” he added.At present, it often takes several years after a case gets the initial `acceptance of necessity’ (AoN), which is followed by the floating of the initial tender or the RFP (request for proposal), field trials, commercial evaluation and the like, before the final contract is anywhere close to being inked.Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh recently said that the timelines for some of the processes in the procurement cycle have already been slashed, which would save around 69 weeks overall.“There is a need to shift away from the traditional nomination based cost-plus procurement focused mostly on the public sector to a more competitive pricing model where both the public and private sector can compete for orders. This approach is already being implemented for ship-building and recently for the AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft or the fifth-generation fighter) project,” he said.The MoD in the 2024-25 fiscal completely utilised the defence modernisation budget for the first time in the last five years. Moreover, contracts worth Rs 2 lakh crores were inked, which is the highest ever and double that of the figures in 2023-24, he added.The AMCA project, for one, certainly needs to be majorly fast-tracked after the defence ministry last month finally approved a new “programme execution model” for prototype development, with greater private sector participation. Pakistan is on course to acquire at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation jets from China, which is now even flaunting sixth-generation prototypes with tailless airframes like Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50, as reported by TOI earlier.The long meandering developmental history of the fourth-generation Tejas, which began way back in 1983, cannot be repeated. The IAF is still waiting to get the first Tejas Mark-1A `improved’ fighter. Similarly, indigenous development of 110 Kilonewton engines, with or without foreign collaboration, to power the AMCA is critical. The IAF is currently grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets) when 42.5 are authorised.","India has kicked off the much-needed comprehensive review of its cumbersome defence acquisition procedure (DAP) of 2020.

NEW DELHI: In a major policy change, the Centre is preparing a model to provide financial assistance to state govts for one-time improvement of state highways rather than declaring more of these as NHs. The road transport ministry will instead focus on building more new greenfield highways and expressways.This comes after PM Narendra Modi's direction to the ministry to come up with a model by July end for the purpose. State govts will maintain the upgraded state highways. TOI has learnt that in the last infrastructure review meeting, Modi had asked the ministry to come up with innovative models for supporting state highway projects and connecting non-major ports under state govts.This change in approach gains importance considering that in the last 11 years, govt has notified conversion of 55,000 km of state highways to NHs and now, the total length of NHs stands at 1.46 lakh km. This has been highlighted as one of the biggest achievements of govt.Sources said that after expanding the NH network, now there is a need to focus more on widening them and maintaining them. Data shows that till March, India has more than 63 lakh km of road network.","The road transport ministry will instead focus on building more new greenfield highways and expressways.

NEW DELHI: The upper castes availing the economic backwardness quota have trailed the backward classes in the Mains examinations of the Civil Services competition for the last two years. But the dynamic of competitiveness between the two reserved categories is complex, as the forwards have prevailed in the ultimate test by virtue of greater score in the 'interview' part of the competition.In the recent results for CS-2024, the cut-off for the Economically Weaker Sections category in the Civil Services (Main) exams was 696 marks as compared to 702 for the OBCs. But in the Final results after the interview, the EWS had a cut-off merit of 917 marks as against 910 for the OBCs. Under the EWS category, the non-SC/ST/OBC get 10% reservation on the basis of the poverty criteria.The cut-off marks are the minimum qualifying score for a social bloc availing the reservations, and they vary across the categories of SC, ST, OBC, and EWS. In the Mains part of the CS-2023, the OBCs scored a cut-off of 712 as compared to 706 for the EWS. But in the Final, the OBCs trailed with a cut-off of 919 to the EWS which had 923 as the minimum marks.The Mains-Interview contrast is seen as surprising. Shashank Ratnoo, a lawyer who specialises in reservation laws and issues, said, ""There is no starkly noticeable reason for OBCs to have more marks in the Mains than EWS, yet lose out in the final cut off on account of EWS scoring better interview marks. It possibly shows that the EWS group has no or lesser social disadvantages that hurt competitiveness.""Interestingly, the contrast in the merit for OBCs and EWS in the Civil Services Examinations has been a see-saw. In the wake of the fresh EWS quotas introduced in 2019, the OBCs dominated the Mains and the Final both in 2019 and 2020. While it was surprising that EWS, which has groups with lower social handicaps, trailed behind the OBCs, it was viewed as result of the fact that a new quota regime had just come into effect and the facts about its procedures and criteria had not percolated down to the wider eligible umbrella. Later, the EWS overhauled the gap with OBCs and came to score higher in the examinations.According to Ratnoo, what is surprising is that EWS has notched a quicker rise in merit than possibly any social sub-group has done after coming under the reservation system. ""It is interesting that the Centre (DoPT) recently ordered an inquiry into the income certificates of some EWS candidates who were selected in the civil services after the Final exams. Such closer scrutiny may help understand the issue better.

Our famous communist leader, EMS Namboothiripad, said ‘Paavangal' was one of the sparks that led him to communism. Writers like Thagazhi and O V Vijayan have said that in the translated works of French writing, they found a new idiom of empathy, a new narrative possibility and a new lens through which to view the oppressed and the invisible.With ‘Paavangal', Malayalam found a weapon for awakening and that engagement partly contributed to the decades of remarkable visionary and social ferment in Kerala from the 1930s onwards,"" Tharoor said.He also mentioned that many other Malayalis started to translate works of French and Russian fiction and modernist works and that's how the doors to people like Guy de Maupassant, Victor Hugo and Émile Zola were opened to Malayali minds.

PUNE: The India Meteorological Department on Saturday issued a comprehensive rainfall warning of extremely heavy to very heavy rainfall (red and orange alerts) across several states over the next week. Heavy precipitation exceeding 200mm in 24 hours has been forecast for isolated areas in Madhya Pradesh on June 23, with Konkan, Goa, Madhya Maharashtra and Gujarat expected to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall till June 27.According to the forecast, northwest India is set to experience significant rainfall from June 21-27. Heavy showers are expected in Jammu-Kashmir-Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and east Rajasthan throughout the period. Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh are likely to receive heavy rainfall from June 21-26, with intense precipitation likely in UP till June 24. Delhi can expect heavy rainfall on June 22-23.Specifically, very heavy rainfall warnings have been issued for east Rajasthan (June 21-23), south Haryana and Punjab (June 22), and UP (June 22-23).IMD has forecast further southwest monsoon advancement into the remaining parts of J&K, Ladakh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi over the next two days as conditions become increasingly favourable.""The monsoon is progressing towards northern states and is likely to advance to more parts, including Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, with some areas already covered.

One per 699: Probation-officer crunch leaves kids in conflict with law in the lurch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-per-699-probation-officer-crunch-leaves-kids-in-conflict-with-law-in-the-lurch/articleshow/121997952.cms,"One per 699: Probation-officer crunch leaves kids in conflict with law in the lurch

Rohit, a boy in conflict with the law, entered the observation home late one night. He remembers being left alone afterwards for over a month. ""I didn't even know if my parents knew I was here,"" he said. No one explained anything.

With no family visits or emotional support, Rohit's frustration built up. ""The lawyer was driving me crazy. I hadn't seen the sun in days."" Relief came only when hisprobation officer (PO) finally visited. ""They comforted me and told me to spend two hours a day gardening. It helped me calm down."" With their support and a positive report, Rohit moved to an aftercare hostel at 18. His parents never came, fearing arrest, but he stayed in touch with his officer online. ""They motivated me,"" said Rohit, now planning to become a teacher.

Suresh had a similar start. ""That night I cried,"" he recalled of his arrival at Dongri observation home. ""I didn't know where I was or what would happen. I wasn't sure whether to tell the truth or lie."" But the probation officer gradually gained his confidence and helped him sit for his exams.

Both boys were lucky but their stories are rare. ""These moments of care happen despite the system, not because of it,"" says Sachi Maniar, director of Ashiyana Foundation at Umerkhadi Observation and Children's Home in Dongri. ""Sometimes, there's no PO at all, and a superintendent steps in. The child meets caretakers, guards, house masters... everyone but the PO.""Earlier this month, a first-of-its-kind national consultation in Delhi - organised by the resource cell for juvenile justice (RCJJ) at TISS and department of social work, University of Delhi - put this overlooked link under the spotlight. Over two days, Juvenile Justice Board magistrates, POs, NGO workers, and social work faculty from 20 states gathered to discuss how to fix it.""This was the first time voices from across India came together to share what's really happening on the ground,"" said Asha Mukundan, who leads the RCJJ at TISS.What's happening, it turns out, is ""POs are working as social workers, counsellors, escorts, data managers all rolled into one,"" said Mukundan. ""And the case-to-officer ratio is outrageous. In some states, one officer is responsible for hundreds of children.""Most of them are expected to prepare reports, conduct home visits, maintain records, liaise with families, and coordinate rehabilitation, often with little or no support. Bharat Parashar, member secretary of the National Legal Services Authority (Nalsa), shared that the vacancy rate among correctional staff hovers around 45%. The Model Prison Manual recommends one correctional staff per 200 inmates. India currently operates at one per 699.The problem goes beyond numbers. In 2021, the govt introduced the legal-cum-probation officer (LCPO), a hybrid role under Mission Vatsalya, where one person is expected to serve as both legal aid provider and rehabilitation facilitator. In reality, it blurred lines and weakened impact. ""The role of a lawyer is to defend a client, no matter what,"" said Mukundan. ""A PO's job is to help the child understand what went wrong and work on it. If you try to be both, you risk doing justice to neither.""The overlap has also raised doubts about how much weight LCPOs carry in JJB decisions. Many admit they're barely trained to handle the job's social work demands, let alone trauma or aftercare.""Most get a three-day crash course,"" said Mukundan. ""It can't be handed to someone with an administrative background."" POs, she stressed, should hold a degree in social work. ""It's sensitive, child-facing work that needs skill and empathy.""Without trained POs, even basics like social investigation reports or care plans are skipped, forcing JJBs to issue generic orders or by default send children to custodial care. Since a bulk of children are out on bail, not in visible custody, the crisis is easy to miss. In many cases, probation orders aren't passed because there's no one to carry them out.Thus, unlike models abroad, children here are mostly left to fend for themselves. ""At most, they're told to report to a police station,"" said Maniar. In cities like Mumbai or smaller towns like Bilaspur, she's seen children cycle in and out of the system for petty offences up to ten times simply because too often, the PO's role is reduced to just securing bail. ""But rehabilitation isn't bail,"" she stresses. ""And reintegration isn't just about release but whether the child can actually survive outside. """"Without a PO checking in or a plan tailored to their situation, they reoffend or give up,"" said Mukundan.Over two days of the consultations in Delhi, the working groups have now offered practical calls to separate legal and social roles, hire more trained probation professionals, strengthen inter-state networks, and invest in follow-up beyond bail.The two schools leading the effort will send the report to the ministries of women and child development and home affairs. As Mukundan reminded the room, ""If we're serious about giving children a second chance, 'probation' has to be one of the first things we strengthen.""","India has one probation officer per 699 children.

All adults overweight in every 5th Indian household: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-adults-overweight-in-every-5th-indian-household-study/articleshow/121997926.cms,"Danny generated AI Image

A weighty issue

NEW DELHI: In nearly two out of 10 households, all adults are either overweight or obese, a new study has found.Overweight is defined as a body weight higher than what is considered healthy for a given height, commonly assessed using Body Mass Index (BMI). A person is considered overweight if his or her BMI is between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2. On the other hand, obesity is defined as a BMI of 30.0 kg/m2 or greater.Researchers from ICMR-National Institute for Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR), TERI School of Advanced Studies and Symbiosis International analysed data from the fifth round of National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5, 2019-21) to assess the prevalence of overweight and obesity in over 6 lakh households. They found nearly 20% of the households had all adult members classified as overweight while 10% of households had all adults classified as obese.In states such as Manipur, Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, over 30% of households had all adults overweight, according to the study, which was published in Public Health Journal. In Tamil Nadu and Punjab, two out of five households had all adults classified as obese.The proportion of households with all obese members was nearly twice as high in urban areas compared to rural regions.The study reveals that families are literally 'gaining weight together'. When one family member is overweight or obese, others are significantly more likely to be obese/overweight as well, said the lead researcher from ICMR-NICPR Prashant Kumar Singh. ""This clustering pattern underscores the urgent need for family-centred approaches to obesity prevention rather than individual-focused interventions.""Director ICMR-NICPR Shalini Singh, said, ""The household clustering of obesity and overweight represents a paradigm shift in how we understand obesity. This study tells us the family unit is the epicentre of this health challenge.""The study warned that individuals in these family obesity clusters face heightened risk of developing multiple non-communicable diseases. It is already known that obesity serves as a marker for poor cardio-metabolic health and is known to be a gateway to numerous chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and heart failure. It is also linked to 13 types of cancer.","In nearly two out of 10 households, all adults are either overweight or obese, a new study has found.

What DGCA warned Air India about

The aviation regulator's report quoted in the Reuters report revealed that during May inspections, three Air India Airbus aircraft were found operating with overdue mandatory checks on escape slides, which are vital emergency equipment.

An Airbus A320 aircraft's inspection was conducted on May 15, more than a month behind schedule. During this period, AirNav Radar tracking showed the aircraft served international routes including Dubai, Riyadh and Jeddah.

The findings also highlighted that an Airbus A319, used for domestic flights, had checks delayed by over three months, whilst another aircraft's inspection was conducted two days late.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation had issued a warning to Air India regarding safety protocol violations, as three of the airline’s Airbus aircraft continued operations despite pending inspections of emergency systems. The regulatory body also criticised the airline's delayed response in addressing these concerns, according to a Reuters report.These communications and warnings by DGCA were given to Air India days before the crash of the Dreamliner.The DGCA report said: ""The above cases indicate that aircraft were operated with expired or unverified emergency equipment, which is a violation of standard airworthiness and safety requirements.""Also Read | Air India crash: N Chandrasekaran makes important statement; says AI 171 Boeing 787 Dreamliner had ‘new engine’, ‘clean history’ & ‘no red flags’ The regulator noted that Air India ""failed to submit timely compliance responses"" to identified deficiencies, ""further evidencing weak procedural control and oversight.""The airline, acquired by the Tata Group in 2022 from the government, responded that it was ""accelerating"" the verification of all maintenance records, including escape slide dates, with completion expected within days.The carrier clarified that in one instance, the issue was discovered when an AI Engineering Services engineer accidentally deployed an escape slide during maintenance work.Safety checks on emergency escape slides are crucial, as their malfunction during accidents could result in grave consequences, according to Vibhuti Singh, who previously served as a legal expert at the government's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.The aviation regulator DGCA said that aircraft failing to undergo mandatory inspections would have their airworthiness certificates considered suspended.Documentation reveals that Animesh Garg, who holds the position of deputy director of airworthiness in the Indian government, dispatched the warning notices and reports to Air India's CEO Campbell Wilson and other senior officials, including the continuing airworthiness manager, quality manager and head of planning.Also Read | Air India plane crash: After 12/6, demand for Air India's 787s crashes A legal specialist in aviation matters indicated that such violations typically result in financial and civil penalties for both the company and individual executives.In a previous statement to Reuters, Wilson acknowledged that whilst global parts shortages affected the industry broadly, Air India faced greater challenges due to its older fleet, with numerous aircraft remaining unmodernised since their delivery in 2010-2011.Aviation authorities across the globe, including India's regulatory body, impose penalties on airlines for breaching compliance requirements.

Poll Should pilots have more stringent regulations regarding flight duty times? Yes, for safety No, current regulations are sufficient

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered the removal of three Air India officials who are incharge of crew rostering following “lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements”. AI has been warned that “any future violation of crew scheduling norms, licensing, or flight time limitations will attract strict enforcement action, including but not limited to penalties, license suspension, or withdrawal of operator permissions as applicable” — basically the regulator has warned going to the extent of shutting down AI if lapses on this crucial front continue.In response to the order, Air India said: ""We acknowledge the regulator’s directive and have implemented the order. In the interim, the company's Chief Operations Officer will provide direct oversight to the Integrated Operations Control Centre (IOCC). Air India is committed to ensuring that there is total adherence to safety protocols and standard practices.""The DGCA has also issued a showcase to the airline for operating two flights — Bangalore-London on May 16 & 17 — by making pilots fly for longer than the 10 hours that was allowed as per flight duty time limitation (FDTL) dispensation given to AI at that point of time.The June 20 order on the three official says: “Repeated and serious violations voluntarily disclosed by Air India concerning flight crew being scheduled and operated despite lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements. These violations were discovered during review (in crew rostering platform transition). The voluntary disclosures, while noted, point to systemic failures in crew scheduling, compliance monitoring, and internal accountability. Of particular concern is the absence of strict disciplinary measures against key officials directly responsible for these operational lapses.”The order says the three identified senior officials “have been involved in serious and repeated lapses including but not limited to: Unauthorised and non-compliant crew pairings; Violation of mandatory licensing and recency norms; Systemic failures in scheduling protocol and oversight.”The regulator has directed AI to “remove (these three) from all roles and responsibilities related to crew scheduling and rostering. Internal disciplinary proceedings must be initiated against these officials without delay, and the outcome of such proceedings shall be reported to this office within 10 days from the date of issue of this letter. The (three) officials shall be reassigned to non-operational roles pending conclusion of corrective reforms in scheduling practices, and shall not hold any position involving direct influence over flight safety and crew compliance until further notice. Any future violation of crew scheduling norms, licensing, or flight time limitations detected in any post-audit or inspection, will attract strict enforcement action, including but not limited to penalties, license suspension, or withdrawal of operator permissions as applicable.”Apart from this order, the DGCA on June 20 also issued a showcase to AI for violating FDTL norms for pilots of two Bangalore-London flights on May 16 and 17. “Accountable manager has failed to ensure adherence,” the notice while seeking a response within seven days.Comments have been sought from AI on both these issues and are awaited.","The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered the removal of three Air India officials who are incharge of crew rostering.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says Anthropic CEO is very wrong

Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis said about AI job warning

After Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s recent dismissal of apocalyptic job-loss predictions, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has also dismissed the pessimistic predictions made by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei . Recently, Amodei warned of significant white-collar job displacement, Hassabis and Huang present a more optimistic point of view. Speaking at the SXSW London festival, Hassabis stated that AI will disrupt traditional roles but also emphasised that it will also create valuable and new jobs, particularly for those with STEM skills and technical fluency. Hassabis has asked the students and professionals to embrace AI tools and also build foundational knowledge in math, physics, and computer science, calling them essential for navigating the AI-driven future.Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that artificial intelligence could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, potentially driving US unemployment to 20%. The stark prediction comes as AI technology rapidly advances, with sectors including technology, finance, law, and consulting facing the greatest disruption.""We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,"" Amodei told Axios in an interview published Wednesday. The 42-year-old CEO emphasized that most people remain unaware of the impending transformation, calling it a reality that ""sounds crazy, and people just don't believe it.""Nvidia CEO expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Jensen Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has also expressed less concern about widespread job displacement due to AI.

Fresh stolen data could fuel next wave of online crime

Immediate action required for all users

Security researchers have uncovered an unprecedented data breach involving 16 billion login credentials across 30 databases, potentially affecting users of major platforms including Facebook Gmail , Apple, and countless other services. The discovery, made by CyberNews researchers during an ongoing investigation since January 2025, represents what could be the largest credential leak in history.The exposed datasets range dramatically in size, from smaller collections containing tens of millions of records to massive databases housing over 3.5 billion credentials each. The massive trove of stolen data was briefly accessible through unsecured databases before being locked down, though researchers were unable to identify the owners. Most concerning is that virtually all datasets were previously unreported, with only one 184-million-record database having been disclosed before by Wired magazine in May.The leaked credentials span virtually every major online service imaginable, creating a ""blueprint for mass exploitation,"" according to the research team. The databases contain login information for social media giants like Facebook and Instagram, email services including Gmail, developer platforms such as GitHub, messaging apps like Telegram, VPN services, and even government portals.Each record typically follows a standard format: website URL, username, and password. This structure matches the collection methods used by infostealer malware, malicious software designed to harvest sensitive information from infected devices.“Telegram's primary login method is a one-time-password delivered by SMS. As a result, this is far less relevant for Telegram users compared to other platforms where the password is always the same,” Telegram said in a statement to TOI.Unlike recycled data from old breaches, researchers emphasize this represents ""fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale."" The credentials provide cybercriminals with unprecedented access for account takeovers, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing campaigns that can devastate both individuals and organizations.CyberNews researchers warn that new massive datasets emerge every few weeks, highlighting the pervasive nature of infostealer malware in today's digital landscape. The inclusion of recent logs with tokens, cookies, and metadata makes this data particularly dangerous for organizations lacking multi-factor authentication.With approximately 5.5 billion people having internet access globally, the breach potentially affects multiple accounts per person. Security experts recommend immediate password changes across all online accounts, enabling multi-factor authentication wherever possible, and using password managers to generate unique, strong passwords.Users are also advised to regularly monitor their accounts and consider using services like ""Have I Been Pwned"" to check if their credentials have been compromised.Apart from this, it's always better to use the latest software versions, enable automatic updates and access only secure, trusted URLs (preferably HTTPS) while avoiding links in unsolicited email messages.","Security researchers have uncovered an unprecedented data breach involving 16 billion login credentials across 30 databases.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning to American businesses: the real labor crisis isn’t a worker shortage—it’s a skills shortage . Speaking at the Business Routable’s CEO Workforce Forum, Dimon asked the coperate leaders to not wait for the government fixes and should directly partner with the schools to close the growing talent gap. “What you’re really short of is the skills you need,” Dimon said, pointing to critical areas like cybersecurity, coding, project management, and financial literacy . He stressed that the companies must invest in education pipelines and push for curricula which blends job-ready credentials with traditional academics.Jamie Dimon who is an advocate of workforce development , feels that continous mismatch between available jobs and qualified candidates act as a threat to economic growth and innovation across multiple sectors ranging from advanced manufacturing and healthcare to technology and financial services.He also mentioned that global estimates suggest that 10 millions of jobs will go unfilled by 2030 due to lack of skilled talent.""We need to break down the barriers between education and employment ,"" Jamie Dimon stated at a recent economic summit. ""It's time to build a system that helps people learn, adapt, and thrive throughout their careers—not just at the start.""He asked for high-schools and colleges to offer workplace focused courses as part of their curriculum. The billionaire banker also stressed that businesses can’t rely solely on four-year degrees. “They all want jobs,” he said of young graduates. “But many end up in retail or inventory roles, when there are jobs in coding, cyber, and financial management.”Dimon is also calling for unprecedented collaboration between the private sector, government agencies, and educational institutions. He advocates for incentives for companies that invest in workforce training and increased public funding for apprenticeship programs and digital learning platforms. ""No single entity can solve the skills crisis alone,"" he emphasized. ""It will take all of us working together.""",JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning to American businesses: the real labor crisis isn’t a worker shortage—it’s a skills shortage.

Aylo wants Apple, Google to do age verification

France is Pornhub’s second-largest market

Why Aylo is against the age verification law

Major adult websites , including Pornhub , YouPorn, and RedTube, briefly went offline in France earlier this month to protest a new age verification law, according to France24. The law, which required these platforms to verify user ages using government-issued IDs or credit cards, was suspended on Friday (June 20) by a French court pending a review of its compatibility with European Union regulations, allowing the sites to resume operations.Aylo, the parent company of Pornhub, argued that the mandated age verification process posed significant security risks, including potential hacks and leaks of sensitive user data, as reported by France24. The company, which sees seven million daily visitors in France across its platforms, advocates for device-level age verification managed by tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, or Google, stating that the court’s suspension provides an “opportunity to reconsider more efficient approaches” to age verification. France24 also noted that the French government intends to appeal the suspension to the Council of State, France’s highest administrative court.Aylo’s push for device-level verification aligns with emerging tech solutions, such as Apple’s Screen Time or Microsoft’s Family Safety tools, which allow age restrictions to be set at the operating system level. However, implementing such systems globally remains complex due to varying privacy laws and technical standards across jurisdictions.France is Pornhub’s second-largest market globally, trailing only the United States, with the Philippines, Mexico, and the United Kingdom rounding out the top five countries by traffic, according to Aylo’s data. The company did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.The debate over age verification for adult websites extends beyond France. In the United States, 19 states, including Florida and Texas, have enacted similar laws, often requiring users to bypass restrictions using virtual private networks (VPNs). The United Kingdom and Germany also enforce age-related access controls for adult content, with the UK’s Digital Economy Act 2017 mandating strict age verification, though implementation has faced delays and challenges. Germany relies on a combination of self-regulation and legal frameworks to restrict access to adult sites for minors.Critics of such laws, including digital privacy advocates, argue that collecting sensitive personal information increases the risk of data breaches, citing incidents like the 2015 Ashley Madison hack, which exposed millions of users’ personal details. Supporters, however, emphasize the need to protect minors from accessing explicit content, with studies like one from the European Commission in 2023 indicating that over 20% of minors in the EU have encountered adult content online.The French government’s appeal to the Council of State will likely influence future regulatory approaches in the EU, where member states are increasingly grappling with balancing child safety and user privacy. For now, the suspension offers a temporary reprieve for adult platforms in France, but the broader debate over age verification continues to intensify globally.
