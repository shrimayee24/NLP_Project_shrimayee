Dent in exports?

Can’t accept double standards on energy security, says India

Poll Should India take a stronger stand against unilateral sanctions? Yes, to safeguard national interests No, steady diplomacy works best

NEW DELHI: Nayara Energy’s refinery in Gujarat’s Vadinar became the first in India to come under western sanctions as European Union Friday announced fresh curbs on Russian oil exports with the aim of throttling funding for Moscow’s war machine.“For the first time, we’re designating a flag registry and the biggest Rosneft refinery in India,” agencies quoted EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas as saying. India responded, saying it “does not subscribe to any unilateral sanction measures. We are a responsible actor and remain fully committed to our legal obligations.”Govt of India considers the provision of energy security a responsibility of paramount importance to meet the basic needs of its citizens. We would stress that there should be no double standards, especially when it comes to energy trade,” foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.The new measures include lowering the current price cap of $60/barrel, the threshold at which countries outside the G7 grouping of seven developed economies can buy Russian oil and access Western shipping as well as insurance services.Additionally, 105 off-radar vessels have been sanctioned, bringing the total to 223 out of a fleet of 400 oil tankers and limiting Moscow’s ability to evade the price cap.Rosneft, along with partners — commodities trader Trafigura and Russian investment firm UCP (United Capital Partners ) — had acquired the refinery with a capacity of 20 million tonnes per annum and associated assets from Essar Oil for $12.9 billion in 2017.Rosneft holds 49.1% in the venture. The refinery depends on exports to Europe and Africa as a small retail network of 6,750 fuel stations limits domestic sales. Curbs on products derived from Russian oil could cloud exports, impacting operations and threatening jobs. The curbs will also derail Rosneft’s bid to exit the venture because sanctions make repatriation of profit impossible.As reported by TOI earlier, the Russian giant had initiated talks with Reliance Industries Ltd for selling its stake in Nayara but the asking price of $20 billion was proving to be a hurdle. The new price cap will be graded in a band to the market average as subdued prices rendered the present cap less effective.","Nayara Energy's refinery in Gujarat’s Vadinar became the first in India to come under western sanctions.

TMC anti-development: PM in Bengal

PM launches projects worth Rs 7,200 cr in poll-bound Bihar

(With inputs from Madan Kumar in Patna)

KOLKATA: PM Modi’s second rally in seven weeks in West Bengal, in the industrial township of Durgapur Friday, started with a “Jai Ma Kali, Jai Ma Durga” homage to the state’s two biggest Hindu deities. He then took Trinamool’s campaign for the 2026 assembly polls head-on, vowing that “infiltrators will be investigated as per provisions in the legal system”.“We will not allow a conspiracy against Bengal’s ‘asmita’ (pride). It is Modi’s guarantee,” he said to a cheering crowd. “For the sake of vote-bank politics, TMC is putting Bengal’s identity at stake by encouraging and protecting illegal immigrants and that has become a threat to national security as well. An ecosystem has been created to support infiltrators,” Modi claimed, dovetailing barbs against Mamata Banerjee’s “appeasement politics” with a new focus on “Bengali pride”.Other BJP politicians, like former MP Locket Chatterjee and assembly opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari started with the customary “Jai Sri Ram” slogan but the PM’s eschewing of Ram and his focus on Bengal’s deities and past political, cultural and industrial icons (like Bidhan Chandra Roy, Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Kadambini Ganguly, Dwarkanath Tagore and Bishnu Dey) gave a glimpse of BJP’s strategy in the run-up to the 2026 assembly poll: stress BJP’s connect with Bengal to offset TMC’s hammer-andtongs campaign against “the harassment and torture of Bengalis in BJP-ruled states”.Modi also brought up “classical language status” for Bengali, taking credit for “a BJP initiative”, while accusing Trinamool and Left Front of never caring for the language. Trinamool was “anti-development”, Modi said, attributing the flight of Bengal’s youth to other states to that. “People across the country used to come here for employment.The trend has changed now. Existing industries are closing down. We have to pull Bengal out of this situation,” he said. The PM wove this narrative with BJP’s usual anti-Trinamool litany as he blamed its use of “syndicate raj, gunda tax and mafia control” for driving out industries. “It formulates policies encouraging corruption.Which industrialist will dare to come to a state where there are riots,” the Prime Minister asked.Meanwhile, in Patna, PM laid foundation stones, inaugurated and dedicated to the nation multiple development projects worth over Rs 7,200 crore before addressing a public meeting during his Motihari programme.",PM Modi's second rally in seven weeks in West Bengal.

'None Of Pakistani Drones Could...': CDS Chauhan's Big Revelation On Operation Sindoor Success

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s Rahim Yar Khan airbase, which was hit by Indian missiles during Operation Sindoor over two months ago, is still not operational, an indication of the extent of damage the strategic military installation suffered. Pakistan airport authority is learnt to have issued another ‘Notice to Airmen’, aka ‘Notam’, for its runway, declaring it unusable till Aug 5, sources said.The airbase, located around 230 km south of Bahawalpur, holds a strategic place in Pakistan’s southern air defence due to its proximity to India’s Rajasthan border. It had suffered massive damage in the precision strikes carried out by India early in May. In May-end, PM Narendra Modi had said at a rally in Rajasthan’s Bikaner that the airbase was in ‘ICU’.Located within the perimeters of an international airport, the airbase had issued the first Notam on the evening of May 10 declaring the runway non-operational for a week (May 18), and later extended it. Notam was again issued in early June, extending the closure of the airbase until July 4. The latest notice said the runway is unavailable for flight operations due to “work in progress”.The airbase serves as a forward operating base for the Pakistan Air Force central command and was used heavily for military purposes.The missiles fired at Rahim Yar Khan airbase caused a massive crater on its runway, a Pakistan district commissioner had told the local press in May. However, the damage, clearly, was much bigger than a crater as the airbase has been non-functional for over two months.Besides this airbase, simultaneous attacks were carried out on Nur Khan airbase at Chaklala in Rawalpindi, the Rafiqui airbase at Shorkot in Punjab, the Murid airbase in Chakwal and the Chunian airbase in Punjab. Pakistan officials had acknowledged damage to transport aircraft at Nur Khan and technical facilities at Chunian.Similarly, the Markaz Subhan Allah terror camp in Bahawalpur, reduced to rubble in airstrikes, has been shut down indefinitely with the Jaish-e-Muhammed brass looking for a new address, preferably in a densely populated area, sources said.","Pakistan’s Rahim Yar Khan airbase was hit by Indian missiles during Operation Sindoor over two months ago.

Set up NIA courts or will give accused bail, SC warns govt

NEW DELHI: With long delay in trials in hundreds of NIA investigated cases relating to terrorism and heinous crimes, Supreme Court on Friday said designating existing courts as special NIA courts was unacceptable and gave an ultimatum to the Union and Maharashtra govts to set up new, exclusive special courts for trial in these cases by Sept.“You cannot designate existing courts, which are dealing with civil and criminal cases, to put an additional burden of NIA cases on them. If you want to expedite trial in NIA-investigated cases having national ramification, you must establish new courts, appoint senior judicial officers, provide them with staff and adequate infrastructure,” SC said.Senior advocate Trideep Pais argued that his client Kailash Ramchandani was arrested by NIA in a UAPA case and was lodged in jail for the last six years without trial as the judicial officer, manning the special court, had no time to proceed with the case.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi told additional solicitor general Rajkumar B Thakre that this was the last opportunity for Union and Maharashtra govts to set up new special courts to exclusively deal with NIA cases. The bench said if such steps were not taken, then courts would be constrained to consider grant of bail to the accused in these cases on the ground of delay in trial.Rejecting NIA’s affidavit which claimed compliance with Supreme Court’s order for establishment of special courts by designating existing courts, the bench said no effective or visible step was taken by the authorities.In its last order, the Justice Kant-led bench had said, “There are hundreds of trials in different parts of the country under special statutes like UAPA, Indian Explosives Act, MCOCA and other similar statutes in different states. However, trials are not commencing because presiding officers are also occupied with several other criminal and civil cases. In the absence of a judicial audit of the matters, which are actually or likely to be generated with the enactment of a new law, trials pertaining to heinous offences have brought an enormous burden on the existing system. ”It had further said, “The most effective recourse can be the establishment of dedicated courts to whom trials under special statutes can be entrusted, without giving them any other civil or criminal cases. Ideally, the trial should take place on a day-to-day basis.”","Supreme Court gave ultimatum to Union and Maharashtra govts to set up new, exclusive special courts for trial in these cases by Sept. “You cannot designate existing courts, which are dealing with civil and criminal cases, to put an additional burden of NIA cases on them.

Digital arrest is economic terrorism: Spl prosecutor

KOLKATA: In possibly the first such sentencing in the country for cybercrimes, a trial court in Kalyani, in Bengal’s Nadia district, Friday awarded life imprisonment to nine scammers who had extorted Rs 1 crore from a Ranaghat resident by threatening him with ‘digital arrest’ last year, reports Dwaipayan Ghosh. It agreed with the prosecution’s charge that such crimes were nothing short of “economic terrorism”.Arrested from Maharashtra, Haryana and Gujarat, the nine convicts, including a woman, were part of a larger gang that has allegedly amassed Rs 100 crore by cheating 108 people across India. They are also likely to face trials elsewhere in the country.Kalyani additional sessions judge Suberthi Sarkar, who had convicted the nine on Thursday, sentenced them to life imprisonment under BNS 338, which involves forging of documents, and 10 other penal offences under both BNS and Information Technology Acts.The defence indicated they would appeal against the conviction in the HC. IGP (CID) Akhilesh Chaturvedi said the nine cybercriminals were tripped by strong digital evidence.“Probe revealed the fraudsters were siphoning money through multiple bank accounts spread across different states. Police seized numerous passbooks, ATM cards, SIM cards and mobile phones during the operation.A detailed analysis of beneficiary accounts and phone numbers led us to uncover this sophisticated network,” the IGP said.During the five-month trial, 29 witnesses from four different states testified physically before the judge. They included SHO of Andheri (West) PS and branch managers of SBI, PNB, Canara Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, and Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, from four states. The chargesheet ran into 2,600 pages. Special prosecutor Bivas Chatterjee said they highlighted the ordeal of other victims of the gang and stressed that such frauds amounted to economic terrorism.“We told the judge how hard-earned money of two victims — one a retired professor and the other a retired state govt engineer — had been transferred outside the country. This was their life’s entire savings,” he told TOI.","The nine convicts, including a woman, were part of a larger gang that has allegedly amassed Rs 100 crore by cheating 108 people across India.

NEW DELHI: South Asian University (SAU) has expelled a Bangladeshi doctoral scholar and fined the students’ mess secretary Rs 5,000 for their role in a clash over the serving of non-vegetarian food on Maha Shivratri earlier this year. The disciplinary action follows an internal inquiry by the university’s Proctorial Committee.The February 26 incident saw an altercation in the university mess between two student groups after fish curry was served on the Hindu festival. According to students, members affiliated with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad had earlier requested that only vegetarian food be provided on Maha Shivratri as many were observing fasts. When fish curry appeared on the menu, ABVP members allegedly attempted to remove it from the serving counter, leading to a heated exchange and physical scuffle. A female member of the mess committee was allegedly manhandled during the confrontation.The Students’ Federation of India (SFI) accused ABVP members of trying to impose their dietary preferences on others and termed the incident an attack on secular values.ABVP, however, said the serving of non-vegetarian food on a fasting day was “insensitive” and disrupted religious harmony. Police received a PCR call about the ruckus, but officers found no active clash on arrival and no formal complaint was filed, leaving the university to handle the matter internally.After weeks of deliberation, the university found doctoral scholar Sudipto Das guilty of “serious misconduct” and ordered his immediate expulsion, citing repeated instances of indiscipline. He has been permanently barred from reapplying to any SAU programme and instructed to vacate his hostel within 24 hours. The university also noted that Das had previously been warned over a suspension in 2022 for similar disruptive behaviour. Mess secretary Yashada Sawant, while not directly involved in the confrontation, was held responsible for failing to maintain order in the mess and was fined Rs 5,000.The office order, issued on July 15, stated that the disciplinary action was taken with the approval of the competent authority.",South Asian University (SAU) has expelled a Bangladeshi doctoral scholar.

‘Use of derogatory terms go against SC guidelines’

NEW DELHI: A father’s fight for the dignity of his daughter, who has 65% intellectual disability, which made the court of the chief commissioner for persons with disabilities (CCPD) issue directives to remedy the situation, has led to the Indian Railways replacing the use of “mental retardation” with “intellectual disability” on railway concession certificates.A disability rights advocate, Pankaj Maru had failed to get a response from railways regarding the terminology used in the concession certificate issued to his daughter, Sonu (26). On July 12 last year, he filed a complaint with court of CCPD regarding the description of his daughter’s disability —This (the terminology issue) was despite Pankaj Maru submitting the unique disability ID card of his daughter along with the application, wherein her disability was described as intellectual disability, in keeping with provisions of Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016.In its final order Thursday, CCPD said the Railway Board had informed court on July 14 that an instruction dated May 9has been issued stating ministry of railways has decided to replace the term “mentally retarded persons” with “persons with intellectual disability”.The change has been implemented from June 1. CCPD emphasised the criticality of language in ensuring dignity of people with disabilities. While noting that the board had already issued a circular in 2018 whereby words such as “blind”, “deaf and dumb” and “physically challenged” were replaced with terms prescribed in RPwD Act, the court has recommended that railways should review their existing forms and all other documents to determine if similar corrections are required to be made and to ensure that the existing stationery is not used for any certification in future.CCPD cited the concern raised by Maru in his complaint that outdated and derogatory terms like “handicapped” still appear in preprinted concession certificate format, which goes against SC’s guidelines on respectful disability terminology. CCPD has sought an action-taken report within three months and also asked railways to sensitise its staff on types and sub-types of disabilities.In its observations in the case in Feb, CCPD had countered railways’ interpretation of legal provisions as reason for continuing with the use of “mental retardation” in concession forms.It noted that the “Railway Board’s contention that intellectual disability and mental behaviour have been separately defined in the Schedule to RPwD Act, 2016 is correct, but their averment that ‘retardation’ is defined under ‘mental behaviour’ is not. In fact, the definition of ‘mental behaviour’ in the schedule of the law explicitly excludes “retardation’.”","A father’s fight for the dignity of his daughter, who has 65% intellectual disability, has led to the Indian Railways replacing the use of “mental retardation” with “intellectual disability” on railway concession certificates.

Bid to suppress debate on tree-felling: Congress

RAIPUR: Enforcement Directorate arrested on Friday Chaitanya Baghel, son of former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, from his residence in Bhilai after the agency conducted an early morning search at his premises in connection with an alleged Rs 2,100 crore liquor scam during his father’s tenure as CM.Chaitanya was presented at a special PMLA court in Raipur which sent him to five-day ED custody, an agency official said, adding that Chaitanya did not cooperate during the searches. The father-son duo stays in the same house, while Baghel also has an MLA residence in Raipur. When ED carried out searches, Baghel was at his Raipur residence and was proceeding to Vidhan Sabha.The timing of the raid, on the last day of the assembly session, triggered sharp political reactions, particularly from the opposition Congress.ED’s early-morning raid and the subsequent arrest of former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel’s son Chaitanya set off sharp reactions, with Congress alleging that the move was designed to suppress discussion on deforestation in Tamnar region of Raigarh district linked to a particular industrialist.ED had earlier searched Chaitanya Baghel’s premises on March 10 while probing some transactions allegedly linking him and his entities to “proceeds of crime” in the liquor “scam” case.The agency did not disclose details of the charges against Chaitanya, but in an earlier press note, it had claimed that some senior bureaucrat, having protection of “top executive of the state”, carried out the scam.Reacting to the arrest, Baghel Senior said the Centre was misusing its agencies to target opposition netas. “To please their master PM Modi and Amit Shah, they have sent ED to my house. We won’t be scared or bow down,” he said. He, however, said he would cooperate with the probe.In this case, ED had in Jan arrested former excise minister Kawasi Lakhma; Anwar Dhebar, brother of Raipur mayor and Congress’s Aijaz Dhebar; and senior babus, including IAS officer Anil Tuteja and a telecom service officer, Arunpati Tripathi.After the arrest of Lakhma, ED had claimed that he was “aware of the complete affairs of the liquor scam, yet he did nothing to stop it”. The agency has accused Lakhma of receiving Rs 2 crore every month from the syndicate involved in illegal liquor trade.ED had also said Lakhma played an important role in policy change, which led to the introduction of FL-10A licence in Chhattisgarh. “He was an integral part of the syndicate and assisted it by manoeuvring the process and procedures as per their direction,” it said. The agency has so far attached assets worth over Rs 200 crore in the case.Baghel later said, “The adjournment motion moved by Congress in the Chhattisgarh assembly over tree felling being carried out by Adani Group in Tamnar was disallowed by Speaker Raman Singh. The opposition alleged that there has been no adherence to the PESA Act, no compliance with directives issued by the National Green Tribunal, and even the resolution unanimously passed by the state assembly has been disregarded. Not even a discussion was permitted.”Bringing an adjournment motion in the assembly, leader of the opposition Charandas Mahant and Baghel alleged in their speeches that “Tamnar coal mine, which has been allotted to Maharashtra State Power Generation Company with its mine operator and developer being Adani, is being run solely for the benefit of a single industrialist, while local residents are being harassed and displaced”.","Chaitanya Baghel is the son of former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel.

He hoped that the Indian sportspersons’ performance will serve as a recognition of the country’s great potential for sports. “Our aim should be to ensure that at least one athlete from every police force under the All India Police Sports Control Board participates in the next World Police and Fire Games. Each team should aim to win at least three medals. By setting such a goal, the record of winning 613 medals will break,” he told police and fire services personnel.Shah said the Indian team was given an incentive amount of Rs 4.4 crore on Friday.Adding words of encouragement even for those who did not win medals at the 2025 Games, Shah said participation in games was the most important, with winning and losing being a part of life.Shah mentioned the Modi govt, in addition to bidding for Olympics, was also in the race to host the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games in India. The purpose of hosting these events, he underlined, is to make sports an inevitable part of the lives of people.The home minister said the sports budget has grown five-fold in the past 10 years.Shah urged the All India Police Sports Control Board to provide world-class coaches to Indian police teams and give specialized training to medical teams of the forces for treating sports-related injuries.","India has entered the race to host the 2036 Olympics, home minister Amit Shah said.

"For most Indian farmers, costs grow faster than income",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-most-indian-farmers-costs-grow-faster-than-income/articleshow/122772650.cms,"For most Indian farmers, costs grow faster than income

Inflation rate exceeded income growth

Indian farmers are hit by the double whammy of stagnant income and declining profit margins, according to an analysis of data compiled by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). For nearly all major crops, the increase in agricultural income over the last decade has not kept pace with the rural inflation rate.The data also shows that the profit margins for most crops have declined. The analysis of ten major crops for both kharif and rabi seasons shows that, except for maize, groundnut and rapeseed/mustard, the increase in farm income has been less than the rural inflation rate during the same period.In 2013-14, the average input cost was Rs 25,179 per hectare for paddy while the value of family labour was assessed at Rs 8,452 per hectare. The value of the crop was Rs 53,242 per hectare, which meant a profit of Rs 19,611 per hectare. In 2023-24, this profit increased to Rs 30,216 per hectare. Although this was a 54% jump, consumer prices in rural areas increased by 65% between 2013-14 and 2023-24. The crop also saw a decline in profit margins.I n 2013-14, the profit margin was 58% of the input and labour costs, which has now dropped to 49.3% of the cost. The input cost and family labour is taken as the total expense to calculate the profit margin since this spending is also part of the formula for Minimum Support Price (MSP). Wheat, unlike paddy, is primarily a rabi (winter) crop, but a comparison of decadal growth in income and margins shows a similar pattern.The surplus over input cost and family labour was Rs 29,442 per hectare in 2012-13 and increased by 53% to Rs 45,179 in 2022-23. That’s lower than the 71% increase in rural consumer prices between 2012-13 and 2022-23. The profit margin too decreased from 123% in 2012-13 to 103% in 2022-23. Sugarcane, another major crop, also saw a stagnation in net income.From Rs 96,451 per hectare in 2012-13, the profits increased to 1,21,668 in 2022-23. This 26% increase is lower than the increase in consumer price inflation. In 2012-13, the profit margin was 151%, which declined to 102% in 2022-23. Of the ten major crops (based on highest output) for which the comparison is done, only three have shown an increase in income higher than the inflation rate.These are maize (162%), rapeseed & mustard (85.7%) and groundnut (71.4%). For the rest, the increase was lower than the inflation rate. It was between 50% and 60% for gram, between 20% and 30% for soyabean and cotton, and less than 20% for arhar (tur). Apart from stagnant incomes, the profit margins have declined for all of these crops except maize. These per-hectare profits are roughly equal to the seasonal incomes for a vast majority of Indian farmers.The average land holding size in the Agriculture Census of 2015-16 was just under 1.1 hectares, but most farmers (68.5%) are marginal farmers, which means they own less than 1 hectare of land (averaging at 0.38 hectare). This means that seasonal income for them will be even lower. Experts have pointed out that the stagnation as well as lower agricultural income is due to the extent of mismatch between the share of agriculture in GDP and in employment.Despite contributing only 16% of GDP, agriculture employs more than 40% of India’s workforce. In advanced economies like the US, its share in GDP and employment is 0.9% and 2%, respectively. Even in a developing economy like China, agriculture’s contribution to GDP is 6.8% while it employs 22% of the workforce.","For nearly all major crops, the increase in agricultural income over the last decade has not kept pace with the rural inflation rate. The data also shows that the profit margins for most crops have declined. Experts have pointed out that the stagnation as well as lower agricultural income is due to the extent of mismatch between the share of agriculture in GDP and in employment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122772654,imgsize-68912,width-400,resizemode-4/122772654.jpg"
"MGNREGS mobile monitoring being fudged, govt tells states",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mgnregs-mobile-monitoring-being-fudged-govt-tells-states/articleshow/122772603.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: The ministry of rural development (MoRD) has asked states to take immediate corrective action and bolster monitoring of the National Mobile Monitoring System (NMMS) for MGNREGA, saying that several instances have come to its notice about the system for capturing daily attendance and work site photographs being “misused or manipulated”.The ministry has also asked states and UTs to identify users and officials responsible for the “misuse or deliberate manipulation” of NMMS and take strict disciplinary action against them.In the communication dated July 8, the ministry said that “such serious discrepancies undermine the credibility of the digital attendance system and may lead to potential misuse of public funds”. The discrepancies include upload of irrelevant or unrelated photographs, photo-to-photo capturing instead of live work images, and the same photo of workers being on multiple muster rolls.“These irregularities raise significant concerns regarding the lack of monitoring and accountability at the state, district and block levels, which is affecting the integrity of the implementation process and may lead to financial irregularities and potential corruption. Thus, the purpose of NMMS in Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is really at stake,” the note from MGNREGA division of the department of rural development stated.To check the irregularities, MoRD has listed measures the states have to implement. These include a manual verification process to begin with, setting a target number of photos to be verified at the gram panchayat, block, district and state levels. The states have to submit verification reports to the ministry and also set up NMMS monitoring cells.Meanwhile, Congress has lashed out at the Modi govt over the issue, with party general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh pointing out in a statement that Congress had been highlighting its operational problems since the NMMS app was introduced in May 2022. The party has demanded the “immediate withdrawal of the unworkable and counterproductive NMMS model based on photo uploads and reaffirmation of task-based payments, which is the essence of MGNREGA”.Citing the July 8 note, Ramesh said the MoRD has “finally acknowledged various problems associated with NMMS”.","The ministry of rural development (MoRD) has asked states to take immediate corrective action and bolster monitoring of the National Mobile Monitoring System.

They can now be picked up by the private sector and PSUs for jobs suited to their qualifications and aptitude, via Pratibha Setu portal,” minister of state for personnel Jitendra Singh told TOI on Friday.A soft biodata of the non-recommended candidates, with their educational qualifications and contact details, is available on the portal.The first-of-its-kind initiative offers a platform for candidates who cleared UPSC exams but did not get recommended, to connect with prospective employers who are looking for meritorious candidates with high qualifications. Any duly registered private company, PSU, etc. may register on Pratibha Setu portal using their corporate identification number. With OTP-based verification, their nodal officer can access the dashboard and the Pratibha Setu software functionalities.","The Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) has recruited 451 candidates to the post of insurance medical officer.

India warns West on energy security double standards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-warns-west-on-energy-security-double-standards/articleshow/122674405.cms,"Petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri

NEW DELHI: India can arrange alternative supplies if Russian oil exports are sanctioned, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Thursday in what is seen as the first official reaction to the US and EU threat of secondary sanctions for buying those barrels.“India has diversified the sources (of oil). I am not worried at all. If something happens, we will deal with it. There is sufficient supply available,” Puri said at an industry event.Separately, the foreign ministry said govt’s overriding priority was to secure the energy needs of its people, while also cautioning against any double standards on the issue.The comments, in response to media queries, followed NATO chief Mark Rutte’s threat, echoing the US, that countries like India, China and Brazil would take a battering for buying Russian exports.“Let me reiterate, and I have said this in the past as well. Securing energy needs of our people is understandably an overriding priority for us,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.“In this endeavour, we are guided by what is there on offer in the markets, as also by the prevailing global circumstances. We would particularly caution against any double standards on the matter,” he added. India has in the past too accused the West of having double standards on the issue, saying that European countries have themselves benefited from importing Russian energy for prolonged periods.Puri said India has built up “navigational resilience” by expanding the sourcing of oil from 40 countries against 27 countries earlier. “India has been clear that it will buy oil from wherever it has to. The prime minister’s commitment, in the final analysis, is to the Indian consumer,” he said.In addition, Puri said, more oil was coming into the global market from countries such as Brazil, Guyana and Canada that are not members of the OPEC+ grouping. “If a major source goes off the market, you diversify. The current debate in the oil market is whether prices will be in the range of $65-70 or $60-65 (per barrel),” he said.","India can arrange alternative supplies if Russian oil exports are sanctioned, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said.

Poll Should preliminary accident reports be made public before investigations are complete? Yes, for transparency No, it can lead to misinformation

NEW DELHI: The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) on Wednesday raised serious concerns over the preliminary findings and public commentary surrounding the crash of Air India Flight AI171, which went down in Ahmedabad shortly after takeoff en route to London.In an official statement, the FIP said, ""We register our dissatisfaction with the exclusion of pilot representatives from the investigation process. We also firmly object to how the preliminary report has been interpreted and presented publicly.""The federation criticised the report for lacking comprehensive data and relying heavily on ""selectively paraphrased cockpit voice recordings"" that appear to imply pilot error and question the competence of the flight crew. ""This approach is neither objective nor complete,"" the FIP said, urging members and the public not to draw conclusions prematurely.""Assigning blame before a thorough, transparent, and data-driven investigation is both premature and irresponsible. Such speculative commentary undermines the professionalism of highly trained crew members and causes undue distress to their families and colleagues,"" the statement added.The 15-page preliminary report, released a month after the crash, outlines initial findings from the accident that claimed 240 lives out of the 241 people on board. The London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed into a medical hostel complex shortly after takeoff.According to the report, the incident involved mid-air engine shutdowns, cockpit confusion, and failed recovery attempts just seconds into the flight.However, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) stressed that key parts of the investigation -- including wreckage analysis, post-mortem reports, and component inspections, are still under way.At this stage, the AAIB has not issued any safety recommendations for Boeing 787-8 aircraft or its GE GEnx-1B engines.Air India stated it is cooperating fully with investigators. Boeing also said it will defer to the AAIB for updates, in line with international aviation protocols under ICAO’s Annex 13.","The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) has raised serious concerns over the crash of Air India Flight AI171.

A recent study published in Nature Medicine by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialised agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), has issued a stark warning: the world is facing a significant surge in gastric cancer cases, with Asia—and particularly India—bearing the brunt. The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk.Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.India must take public health action against gastric cancerTo reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.",Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions.

GTA 6: What Konvoy analyst Josh Chapman predicted about GTA 6’s success



“🎮 GTA VI: we predict that GTA VI will generate $7.6 BILLION in revenue in the first 60 Days of its launch (current release date: May 26, 2026). This will be the greatest video game release of all time; shattering player, viewership, and revenue records.

For Take-Two Interactive's $2 billion investment into this game, we believe they will break even on that within 30 days of release (see our breakdown in the chart attached).

🚀 Predictions: Our Expectations of GTA VI:

We chatted internally here at Konvoy and decided to write down a few predictions and make them public. In the end, we're just gamers who can't wait to see this title released:

1️⃣ GTA VI is the largest gaming release of all time, shattering records of copies sold and revenue generated within almost every period of time

2️⃣ GTA VI will cost $80 (there will be premium versions of course, but the base price is $80)

3️⃣ GTA VI is the next UGC platform. It will have a UGC component that includes creator payouts for server hosts, mod creators, and more (mimicking the creator economics of UEFN and Roblox)

4️⃣ GTA VI will have 200-person lobbies, and there will be higher risk/reward dynamics where you can raid and steal items from players more easily

5️⃣ GTA VI will break even on its $2bn investment <30 days of release

6️⃣ GTA VI will hit the attached chart of copies sold, revenue, and player targets.

We can't wait for this title to be released in 2026. I'll certainly be playing it.”

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is set to launch in May next year. Meanwhile, investment firm Konvoy has made some major predictions for the upcoming open world title’s financial performance. The video game venture capitalist company suggests that GTA 6 will generate $7.6 billion in revenue within just two months or 60 days of its release. Josh Chapman, a managing partner of Konvoy, shared this forecast on a post shared on the professional networking site LinkedIn. He highlighted that the firm believes that the highly anticipated game will have major commercial success. However, it's important to note that Konvoy's projection is based on certain assumptions that Take-Two Interactive has not yet confirmed, such as an $80 price point for the game and a reported budget of around $2 billion, which the company is said to have spent to develop the game.Konvoy's analysis suggests that GTA 6 could recover its estimated $2 billion budget in under 30 days and build considerable momentum. The firm predicts that it may become the gaming industry’s biggest launch to date and is expected to break records for both copies sold and revenue generated by a game. Considering that analysts have referred to GTA 6 as ""the most important game to ever release in the industry,"" a multi-billion dollar revenue figure may be within reach for the title.In his LinkedIn post, Chapman wrote:",Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is set to launch in May next year.

Andy Byron , CEO of the high-growth data startup Astronomer , has landed in a controversy after a viral kiss cam moment at a Coldplay concert showed him in a close embrace with Kristin Cabot , the company’s HR chief. The incident, which occurred at Gillette Stadium in Boston, sparked widespread speculation of an affair, especially as both Byron and Cabot are married. With frontman Chris Martin joking, “Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy,” the clip quickly went viral—thrusting Byron’s personal life and soaring net worth into the public spotlight.Though Byron’s exact net worth isn’t publicly disclosed, it is believed to range between $20 million and $70 million, driven largely by his equity stake in Astronomer, which recently raised $93 million in Series D funding in May 2025. This round was led by Bain Capital and brought the company’s estimated valuation to around $1.2 to $1.3 billion. As CEO, Byron likely owns between 1% and 5% of the company, putting the value of his stake at $12 million to $65 million, not including salary, bonuses, and past earnings from senior roles at Cybereason, Lacework, and Fuze.“Astronomer’s momentum and investor confidence reflect our vision to build a durable software company,” Byron said at the time, noting the firm’s central role in helping enterprises scale AI and optimize data platforms. Despite the growing scandal, Astronomer has not publicly addressed the situation, nor have Byron or Cabot.At the heart of the controversy is a viral moment from Coldplay’s concert, where Byron and Cabot were captured on the kiss cam sharing what appeared to be an intimate exchange. As the crowd laughed and frontman Chris Martin made his cheeky remark, Byron ducked behind a seat and Cabot covered her face. The awkwardness of the moment only fueled affair rumors online.Byron, 50, is married to Megan Kerrigan Byron, an educator at Bancroft School, with whom he has two children. Following the viral video, Megan reportedly dropped “Byron” from her Facebook profile and deactivated her account. Kristin Cabot is married to Kenneth C. Thornby. Despite mounting speculation, neither party has commented, and Astronomer has yet to announce any internal investigation or HR action.Meanwhile, the scandal has drawn attention from the company’s founder and former executives, with some distancing themselves from what’s now dubbed “ColdplayGate.” As the situation continues to unfold, public interest in Byron’s personal and professional life shows no signs of slowing.","Andy Byron, CEO of high-growth data startup Astronomer, has landed in a controversy.

SDBCT helps families of Indian migrant workers whose bodies were returned from Dubai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/sdbct-helps-families-of-indian-migrant-workers-whose-bodies-were-returned-from-dubai/articleshow/122776496.cms,"



AMRITSAR: Philanthropic organisation Sarbat Da Bhala Charitable Trust (SDBCT) team returned to Sri Guru Ram Dass Ji International Airport on Friday—just four days after their last visit—to receive the mortal remains of yet another Indian migrant worker who died in Dubai.As with countless similar cases, the team was accompanied by the grief-stricken family of the deceased and provided free transportation of the body to the native village for final rites.This time, it was Ranjit Singh, a 40-year-old resident of Gill Manjh village near Batala in Gurdaspur district, whose dreams of securing a better future for his family abroad ended in tragedy. According to his family, Ranjit was working in Dubai for the past four years when he died of cardiac arrest at work on July 4.His mortal remains arrived today at the Amritsar airport, where the Punjab unit of the Trust village Sarpanch Sukhdev Singh received the body in the presence of his mourning family. The body was then transported to his native village in a free ambulance provided by the Trust, which also facilitated the necessary formalities.Speaking about the arrival of Ranjit Singh's body , SP Singh Oberoi, Managing Trustee, SDBCT, said that the Gurdaspur team will assess the family’s financial situation, and based on the findings, a monthly pension will be arranged for Ranjit’s widow.This marks the second such incident in less than a week. On July 13, the Trust also received the body of Satnam Singh (51) from Samrala, Ludhiana, who died after falling from a staircase at his Dubai workplace. His family too was given full assistance, including free ambulance service and future pension support.Oberoi said that with this, the SDBCT has now repatriated over 418 bodies of Indian migrant workers who died abroad—most of them sole breadwinners for their families. The Trust’s free ambulance service, launched recently from Amritsar Airport, continues to serve as a lifeline for grieving families during their darkest hours, he added.","Ranjit Singh, a 40-year-old resident of Gill Manjh village near Batala in Gurdaspur district, died of cardiac arrest at work on July 4.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

NEW DELHI: A 25-year-old man was arrested in April for creating a ruckus inside a Delhi Metro train by drinking alcohol and eating eggs. It eventually turned out it was only in pretence in an attempt to go viral on social media.It is not the lone instance. Delhi Metro has recorded over 12,000 cases of unacceptable behaviour in the past two years.

The number of such cases was 1,043 in 2023-24.In the past few years, there has been a spate of videos on social media showing passengers recording reels inside the trains and at stations, causing inconvenience to other commuters.""DMRC expects its commuters to behave responsibly while using the Delhi Metro and follow all social etiquette and protocols that are acceptable in society,"" said Anuj Dayal, principal executive director, corporate communications, DMRC.""Commuters should also follow prevalent dos and don'ts while travelling by metro for their own and co-passengers' safety, comfort and convenience.

""Offenders are liable for penalty or removal from the metro train under the Operations & Maintenance Act,"" he added.Though DMRC has been running campaigns and displaying messages at metro stations like 'do not make reels and cause discomfort', unsavoury incidents continue to be reported.DMRC has been appealing to commuters to inform them when they notice unruly or prohibited behaviour in the trains rather than make videos of the incidents.""Commuters should inform the train operator if they spot anything objectionable or anyone creating a nuisance inside a train,"" a metro official said. ""Security or DMRC staff at the next arriving station will immediately take necessary action.

The 'Golden Misfit': Jonathan Marchessault

Jonathan Marchessault emerges as a potential target



TOP 10: Replaying Jonathan Marchessault's Top Plays From 24-25 Season

Fit in Edmonton, but worth the risk?

What’s next for Edmonton’s offseason?



The Edmonton Oilers are feeling the heat. As NHL offseason chatter ramps up, insiders suggest the Oilers are among the teams most pressured to make a game-changing trade. Their focus? Boosting their top-six forward group to keep pace in an increasingly competitive Western Conference.Despite recent roster changes, including the arrivals of Ike Howard and Matt Savoie, plus the signing of Andrew Mangiapane, questions remain about scoring depth. Edmonton’s push for a Stanley Cup demands more proven firepower.Among the names floated, one stands out, Jonathan Marchessault of the Nashville Predators. The 34-year-old veteran is reportedly being considered as a potential trade piece. Marchessault joined Nashville just last summer, but could already be on the move after the team’s underwhelming finish in 28th place.His four-year, $27.5 million contract runs through 2028-29 with a $5.5 million cap hit. While that term may cause hesitation, Marchessault's scoring record still holds value. He netted 21 goals and 56 points last season, despite a dip in production from his 42-goal campaign with the Vegas Golden Knights the year before.With Marchessault potentially open to a change of scenery, Edmonton could offer an ideal opportunity to rebound.The team’s high-octane offense and power-play prowess mightbe just what he needs to return to 30-goal form.Still, it’s not a simple fit. Edmonton has already committed to new forwards, and any move for Marchessault would require cap maneuvering. There’s also the matter of his no-movement clause, which could complicate negotiations.But if the Oilers see Marchessault as the missing piece to finally lift the Stanley Cup, they might be willing to roll the dice. Despite the appeal, Edmonton’s front office must weigh the long-term implications. Committing to a 34-year-old forward with four years left on his deal carries risk. The Oilers are already managing several big contracts, and salary cap flexibility is critical for long-term success.As the NHL offseason continues, all eyes remain on the Edmonton Oilers, with championship ambitions and mounting pressure to deliver. Expect them to stay active on the trade front. Jonathan Marchessault may not be the only name on their radar. But he’s certainly among the most intriguing.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Flames’ Rasmus Andersson linked to potential trade for Stars’ $31 million winger in wild proposal","The Edmonton Oilers are among the teams most pressured to make a game-changing trade.

I said that anybody in the Brics consortium of nations, we are going to tariff you 10 percent and they had a meeting the following day, and almost nobody showed up.”Trump, speaking firmly about his approach to global economic rivals, added, “When I heard about this group of six countries in Brics, I hit them very hard, and if they ever really form in a meaningful way, it will end very quickly.” Trump did not name the countries directly but said, “We can never let anyone play games with us.”Trump said protecting the global reserve status of the US dollar is of the highest priority. “We are not going to let the Dollar slide...If we lost the status of the Dollar as the world's reserve currency, it would be like losing a World War,” he said.Trump's comments came as he signed into law the S.1582 GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act), which sets up a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. Trump hailed the law as a major step in cementing American leadership in global finance and cryptocurrency.“This afternoon, we take a giant step to cement American dominance in global finance and Crypto technology, as we sign the landmark GENIUS Act into law,” Trump said. “They named it after me. This is hell of an act!”Addressing the crypto community, Trump said, “For years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out... this signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up... Congratulations on this incredible achievement!”He reiterated his commitment to prevent a US central bank digital currency. “I also remain fully committed to my pledge never to allow the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency in America. It won't happen,” he said.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent praised Trump’s move, saying it would help maintain the US dollar’s place as the global reserve currency.Trump has singled out Brazil for additional penalties, including a 50 per cent tariff on imports starting in August, citing “unfair” trade practices. He had earlier announced the 10 per cent tariff on July 6, targeting any country supporting Brics.The Brics group has recently expanded to include countries like Iran and Indonesia and has denied being anti-American. While Brazil has stepped back from pushing a common currency, the bloc continues to develop Brics Pay, a cross-border payment system aimed at promoting trade in local currencies.Despite Trump's repeated claims, no evidence has been presented to show Brics aims to undermine the dollar or harm the US.",US President Donald Trump on Friday mocked the Brics group as a “little group’ that is “fading out fast” He also reiterated his warning from earlier this month of a 10 per cent tariff on any nation aligning with Brics.

Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson, recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059, reports CBS News. He had reportedly been under the influence of “magic mushrooms” and lost sense of reality.Emerson boarded the flight bound for San Francisco as a passenger from Everett, Washington with 83 other passengers and crew on board. He was assigned the cockpit jump seat located behind the pilot and first officer.""I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,"" he said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday.At that time he was grieving the death of his best friend and reportedly experimented with the psychedelic drug.""You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,"" he said recalling the incident. ""I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life.”""I know what those levers do in a real airplane and I need to wake up from this. You know, it's 30 seconds of my life that I wish I could change, and I can't,” he was quoted saying by ABC News.The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was taken into custody. He is scheduled to face trial next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and also faces numerous state charges, including 83 misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment and one felony count of first-degree endangering an aircraft, reported CBS News.Since then the National Transportation Safety Board has since hosted a first-of-its-kind forum focused on pilot mental health to examine current regulations.The FAA launched its own policy review, with both agencies advocating for reforms to remove barriers to mental health care.""Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,"" said Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber, reported CBS News.Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are spearheading a bipartisan push in Congress to implement reforms within two years through the Mental Health in Aviation Act. The legislation aims to improve access to mental health care for pilots and air traffic controllers and expand the number of medical examiners available.","Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.
