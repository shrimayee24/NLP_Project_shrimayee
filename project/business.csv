'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

CHANDIGARH: Justice Surya Kant, the most senior Supreme Court judge, is poised to assume the office of Chief Justice of India (CJI) next month. Few are aware of the extraordinary journey that brought him to the nation's highest judicial position.Unlike many who come from families with strong legal background, Justice Kant's journey began in Petwar - a nondescript village in Haryana's Hisar. He grew up far from privileges often associated with corridors of power. The first time he saw a city was when he travelled to Hansi, a small town in Hisar, for his Class X board exam.Until Class VIII, he studied in a village school that had no benches. As a student, he shared everyday responsibilities of rural life - working in fields during his spare time to support his family like any other rural boy. His father was a teacher.On formal confirmation, he will be the first Haryanvi to become CJI. He is expected to take over as 53rd Chief Justice of India on Nov 24, and slated to serve until Feb 9, 2027.Those who have worked closely with him describe Justice Kant as a jurist of deep learning and measured wisdom, admired for his balanced judgments and unwavering commitment to justice. Having served for over 14 years in Punjab and Haryana HC before his elevation as Himachal Pradesh HC Chief Justice and later as SC judge, he has consistently demonstrated a keen sensitivity toward matters concerning protection of public resources, land acquisition and compensation, victims' rights, reservation policies, and broader balance of constitutional principles.Sometime ago, while visiting his alma mater, Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak, Justice Kant spoke about his early life and modest beginnings. Electricity was a rarity in Petwar, he recalled and fondly remembered studying at night with friends, huddled under dim lamps, driven by hope of securing a govt job - a goal, he said, inspired him to persevere through every hardship.Born on Feb 10, 1962, Justice Kant completed his early education from Petwar and LLB in 1984 from MDU. He started as a lawyer at Hisar district court before moving to Chandigarh to practice at Punjab and Haryana HC.Justice Kant became the youngest advocate general of Haryana at 38. In 2004, aged 42, he was elevated as a judge of Punjab and Haryana HC. Even then, he continued his academic pursuits, securing first-class-first in his master's degree in law in 2011 from Kurukshetra University's directorate of distance education.After serving as HC judge for over 14 years, he was elevated as Himachal Pradesh HC CJ on Oct 5, 2018. On May 24, 2019, he became SC judge.In his 14-year stint as HC judge in Chandigarh, Justice Kant passed several landmark judgments, including right of jail inmates to have conjugal visits or artificial insemination for progeny.He also passed an order in a case where a husband had killed his wife. While punishing the guilty, he noticed the accused had four daughters. He personally spoke with a college principal, requesting free education for the eldest daughter.In Punjab and Haryana HC, he was part of the full bench that ordered sanitisation of Dera Sacha Sauda in 2017 following violence after imprisonment of the Dera chief in rape cases and directed a central probe into financial irregularities inside it. He served as a member of governing body of National Legal Services Authority from 2007 to 2011. In SC, he was part of benches that passed several landmark judgments.As CJ of Himachal Pradesh HC, he focused on administrative reforms and improving judicial efficiency. He reaffirmed access to basic amenities constituted an integral part of the fundamental right to life enshrined in the Constitution.",Justice Surya Kant is the most senior Supreme Court judge. He is expected to take over as 53rd Chief Justice of India on Nov 24. He will be the first Haryanvi to become CJI. He grew up far from privileges often associated with corridors of power.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124818469,imgsize-67912,width-400,resizemode-4/justice-surya-kant.jpg"

Bihar Assembly Polls: EC Announces Two-Phase Voting, Unveils 17 New Measures For Transparent Voting

Unlike Bihar, pan-India SIR to be announced at press meet

Also read-

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission will on Monday announce the first phase of the pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, covering 10-15 states/UTs, including poll-bound West Bengal, Tamil Nadu , Kerala, Assam and Puducherry.Sources in the poll body said the initial phase will leave out states like Maharashtra, where local body elections are to be held by Jan 31, 2026, as per Supreme Court directives, as well as the snow-bound states/UTs of J&K, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Ladakh. The last intensive revision of electoral rolls in India was undertaken two decades ago.Ahead of the EC presser, Tamil Nadu CM and DMK chief M K Stalin accused BJP of ""plotting to remove names from voter list"" ahead of state polls, as in Bihar . ""It (SIR) deprived nearly 65 lakh voters in poll-bound Bihar of their voting rights,"" he alleged.DMK and other INDIA bloc parties have warned that BJP govt is ""attempting to use EC as its puppet to replicate the same in Tamil Nadu"", Stalin said in a letter to the party cadre.""BJP and its ally AIADMK believe that if the names of voters from the working class, minorities, scheduled castes, women and the poor are deleted through SIR, they can secure victory without facing the people.But this calculation will fail in Tamil Nadu,"" he said.Unlike Bihar, where EC launched SIR with a written order, the pan-India exercise will be announced at a press conference, allowing any queries and doubts to be addressed on the spot.Sources indicated that the nationwide SIR shall be announced and conducted in stages, with three broad categories of states/UTs likely to witness the exercise later. These include states/UTs that will soon be in the grip of harsh winter and snow; ones where local body polls are due over the next three months and which are held with electoral rolls prepared as per provisions of the Representation of the People Act; and where at least 75%-80% of the electorate has already been mapped by matching current electors with entries in the roll from the last intensive revision, requiring only the remaining 20% or so to submit documents to prove their eligibility as per Article 326 of the Constitution.EC sources said the list of documents to be accepted as proof of eligibility will more or less remain the same as in Bihar and will only be indicative and not exhaustive. Aadhaar will only be accepted as proof of identity.Going by the three-month SIR schedule followed in Bihar, the enrolment stage for the first phase of SIR - requiring the elector to sign the enrolment form and, where required, submit proof of eligibility - may start on Nov 1 and the final roll published, after settling claims and objections to the draft roll, by Jan end or beginning of Feb.The groundwork for the upcoming countrywide SIR - the intent for which was announced by EC in its June 24 notification for SIR in Bihar - has been under way for the past two months, with two separate conferences of chief electoral officers held by EC in Sept and Oct. The last CEOs conference on Oct 22-23 saw EC assessing the preparedness of all state/UT CEO offices, particularly progress of the mapping of their current electors with the roll from the last intensive revision.With Bihar having shown the way, sources said, CEOs are better prepared for the SIR and the EC's confident of pulling off a cleaner, error-free electoral roll after removing duplicate entries, illegal immigrants, and dead or shifted voters. All state/UT rolls are digitised and map-ped with the roll from the last SIR, with 50%-70% electors already linked to it; booth level officers have been trained and parties urged to appoint enough booth level agents.","EC will on Monday announce the first phase of the pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.

Indian woman 'pushed into' Bangladesh: Govt moves SC; challenges HC's 'repatriate' order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/repatriation-of-indian-woman-from-bangladesh-centre-moves-sc-challenges-hc-order-to-bring-her-back/articleshow/124834900.cms,"Indian national Sunai Khatun

KOLKATA: Centre has moved Supreme Court challenging a Calcutta HC order on Sept 26 to repatriate Sunali Khatun and five others, who were pushed into Bangladesh on the grounds of being illegal immigrants, within four weeks.Centre's petition, filed on Oct 22, comes amid reports the families of the six, who are from Bengal's Birbhum and were rounded up in New Delhi, are planning to plead with HC for an order to Indian authorities to implement the repatriation order. The four-week period during which Sunali, husband Danish Sheikh, their 8-year-old son Sabir, Sweety Bibi and her two minor sons were to be brought back home ended on Oct 24.A habeas corpus petition filed by Sunali's father Bhodu Sheikh in HC in Aug mentioned that she was eight months pregnant. ""Every entity has the prerogative to move a higher forum challenging an order. But considering the sensitivity of the case, involving a woman with an advanced stage of pregnancy and two sons of Sweety, it was expected that the matter would be sorted out at the earliest,"" said the lawyer who represented Sunali's family.Sunali, Danish and Sweety worked as ragpickers in New Delhi's Rohini. They were picked up on June 21 on suspicion of being Bangladeshis.On June 24, the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in New Delhi ordered they be kept in a community centre in Rohini. A deportation order was passed on June 26 and the six were pushed into Bangladesh the same day. They were arrested in Bangladesh on Aug 21 for illegally entering the country and have been in jail there since.The division bench of Justice Tapabrata Chakraborty and Justice Reetobroto Kumar Mitra had on Sept 26 scrapped the FRRO order before ordering the return of the six within four weeks. The bench criticised the Centre's submission that the burden of proof under the Foreigners Act 1946 was on the detained people, saying the law did not ""empower the executive to pick up a person at random, knock at his or her door, and tell him that he is a foreigner"".HC said Sunali's father was a permanent resident of Birbhum and the detainees had lived there for a long time since their birth.","Centre has moved Supreme Court challenging a Calcutta HC order on Sept 26 to repatriate Sunali Khatun and five others.

KOLKATA: Monica Liu lives and breathes Beijing, the 'Tangra-style' Chinese restaurant that is the beating heart of weekends in Kolkata's Chinatown. But on Sunday night, Guangzhou was on her mind. For the first time in five years, she was on a direct flight from the city she calls home to the country of her ancestors.Liu was among the first of 176 passengers to board IndiGo's resurrected Kolkata-Guangzhou flight that bridged the gap in direct air connectivity between India and China, triggered by Covid pandemic and extended by the diplomatic frost following border clashes in 2020.For someone who once travelled frequently between the two countries to visit relatives, the wait felt longer than five years for Liu. ""I am flying to meet some of my relatives back in China. I was a frequent flyer between Kolkata and China prior to Covid. Now that direct connectivity is back, I wish to resume regular travel,"" she said.The Airbus A320 Neo departed at 10pm, just over a fortnight ahead of IndiGo starting its Delhi-Guangzhou service on Nov 10. China Eastern Airlines is scheduled to resume its Shanghai-Delhi flight a day earlier.More than 40 weekly flights once linked Indian metros with Shanghai, Guangzhou and Kunming.All were suspended in 2020. Union govt's decision to reopen tourist visas for Chinese nationals paved the way for flights to resume, with Delhi and Beijing agreeing in principle to restore air services during foreign secretary Vikram Misri's trip in Jan.PM Narendra Modi's visit to China in late-Aug, his first in seven years, saw him and Chinese President Xi Jinping stress that the two countries should be seen as partners in development rather than competitors.For Arjun Gupta, a New Town businessman running a restaurant and electronics unit in China, resumption of direct flights translates into saving time and money.

"CAC Member Flags RERA Gaps, Urges Mandatory Declaration from Builders on Pending Dues",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cac-member-flags-rera-gaps-urges-mandatory-declaration-from-builders-on-pending-dues/articleshow/124830762.cms,"An AI-generated image

NEW DELHI: A member of the government’s Central Advisory Council (CAC) has told the housing ministry that mandatory registration of real estate projects under RERA has become meaningless as it doesn’t ensure compliance or protect homebuyers. He has urged the ministry to make mandatory the submission of a “declaration” by builders and their group entities before registration of any project, confirming that all dues to buyers, the authorities and courts in other projects have been cleared.In a letter to housing minister Manohar Lal Khattar, CAC member Abhay Upadhyay has suggested that any false declaration by builders result in such promoters being barred permanently from real estate business across India and imposition of heavy penalties on them.Upadhyay, who also heads FPCE, a pan-India homebuyers’ organisation, has sought urgent govt intervention to plug critical gaps in the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), which continue to leave buyers vulnerable to exploitation by builders. The homebuyers’ body has urged the ministry to issue standard operating procedures (SOPs) to all state RERA bodies until formal amendments are made to the Act.“Unlike FSSAI , where the stamp itself instills confidence that the product is safe for consumption, the RERA registration number has failed to become a symbol of trust. Instead, it has become a mere formality that builders flaunt while continuing to flout the law,” the FPCE said. It pointed out that many RERA authorities have not exercised the powers provided to them under the law to penalise errant developers or ensure compliance with their orders.Raising the issue of builders failing to complete or inordinately delaying promised amenities such as clubhouses, swimming pools and landscaped gardens, FPCE said that the existing provisions, which deal only with compensation for delay in possession, are “grossly inadequate”. It urged the ministry to issue SOPs to RERA bodies to ensure developers deposit adequate funds in escrow accounts for completion of such amenities and also compensate buyers until these are completed and made functional.The FPCE has further sought a clear exit policy for homebuyers to remove the uncertainty following a recent Supreme Court judgment that distinguished between ‘genuine homebuyers’ and ‘speculative investors’. It proposed that buyers be entitled to a full refund within one year of booking and a 90% refund thereafter, to ensure fairness and predictability.It also recommended barring developers from collecting more than 75% of the unit cost, with the remaining 25% being collected only after the project is complete in all respects and completion certificate is obtained.",A member of the government’s Central Advisory Council (CAC) has told the housing ministry that mandatory registration of real estate projects under RERA has become meaningless.

I am happy to share that our security agencies have made commendable efforts in this direction.

Seats less reclining: Boeing 787 pilots want duty time cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/less-reclining-cockpit-seats-indian-pilots-urge-dgca-to-reduce-duty-time-for-boeing-787-planes/articleshow/124830730.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian pilots have expressed a fresh concern over the Boeing 787 Dreamliners — extended flight duty time limitation (FDTL) for them despite the aircraft’s less reclining cockpit seats that make controlled rest less effective for them.The Airlines Pilots’ Association of India has urged the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to rollback the extension given to the “already stretched” flight duty time limit (FDTL) for Boeing 787 two-man flight crew operations from 10 hours (flying time) to 10.5 hours and 13 hours of flight duty period (FDP) to 14 hours.ALPA-India has told the regulator this is a “matter of grave operational and safety concern.” The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has mandated restriction on the pilots’ seat recline function on this aircraft.The FAA “airworthiness directives (AD)” for the B787s issued late last year says: “…the fight deck door decompression panel can strike the captain’s seat headrest if a fight deck or below the fight deck rapid decompression event occurs when the seat is in a certain position…. (This order is) to address the possibility that the decompression panel could strike the captain's head or face.The unsafe condition, if not addressed, could result in serious or potentially fatal injury to the captain after a fight deck or below the fight deck rapid decompression event. ”In India, Air India operates Boeing 787s using its own planes and crew members. IndiGo also uses this planes but they are wet leased, meaning hired with pilots, from a foreign airline. So the Indian DGCA FDTL rules for Dreamliner pilots affect only Air India as of now.Multiple senior Indian pilots of this type said: “If any airline is serious about B787 safety from pilot fatigue perspective given the less cockpit seat recline on this plane that makes controlled rest for them left effective, it should reduce FDTL for its B787 pilots. However the opposite has happened and the flying time has been been extended.They strongly feel that until the corrective seat modification is implemented and the FAA AD is superseded with full recline the fight time should be limited to 8 hours or have augmented crew. ""ALPA-India president Captain Sam Thomas has written to DGCA on Sunday: “This regulatory decision appears not only unjustified but also dangerously inconsistent with global safety practices. Extending duty hours instead of mandating an augmented crew, particularly so soon after a recent fatal accident, raises serious questions about the prioritisation of flight safety over operational costs and convenience. Operating long routes with restricted rest capability, compounded by adverse weather and night operations, creates a scenario ripe for fatigue induced errors. These are not theoretical risks ,fatigue remains a well-documented factor in numerous aviation incidents worldwide.”The association has urged the regulator to “immediately withdraw the FDTL extension for two-pilot 787 operations. Mandate augmented crew (3-man operations) for all flights exceeding 8 hours or operating through the window of circadian low (2 am to 6 am). Undertake a comprehensive fatigue risk assessment in consultation with flight crew representatives before approving any further deviation from established limits. ”“This issue strikes at the heart of flight safety. The recent regulatory action, if left unaddressed, exposes not only the operating crew but also passengers and the travelling public to unnecessary and preventable risk,” Captain Thomas added.","The Airlines Pilots’ Association of India has urged the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to rollback the extension.

‘Life's Best Decision’: BJP's Maithili Thakur On Alinagar Contest Against RJD's Vinod Mishra | Bihar

NEW DELHI: CPI(ML) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya on Sunday said that the implementation of the Waqf (Amendment) Act would be blocked in Bihar if the INDIA bloc, of which his party is a member, wins the assembly elections and forms the government.Bhattacharya, who also promised a ""critical review"" of the prohibition law introduced by the Nitish Kumar government, echoed the position of INDIA bloc chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav.

"Ties with Pakistan not at India's expense, says Marco Rubio -- even though it is",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ties-with-pakistan-not-at-indias-expense-says-marco-rubio-even-though-it-is-us-trump/articleshow/124829884.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

‘Indians Are Very Mature…’: US State Secy Marco Rubio’s Big Remark On US-Pakistan Ties

Revitalized US ties with Islamabad will not be at the expense of Washington’s “deep, historic, and important” ties with India, US secretary of state Marco Rubio has said amid what he saw as disquiet in New Delhi about the Trump White House’s pivot towards the military regime in Pakistan.In a chat with pool reporters on his way to the Asean meeting in Malaysia via Doha, Rubio said New Delhi had not directly communicated any unease to the US on the matter “but we know they’re concerned for obvious reasons because of the tensions that have existed between Pakistan and India historically” and “Indians are very mature when it comes to diplomacy and things of that nature.”“Look, they have some relationships with countries that we don’t have relationships with. So, it’s part of a mature, pragmatic foreign policy. I don’t think anything we’re doing with Pakistan comes at the expense of our relationship or friendship with India,” Rubio said, adding that New Delhi has to understand the US will have relations with a lot of different countries, and it currently sees an opportunity to expand its strategic relationship with Pakistan.Rubio’s remarks come at a time US-India relations, long considered a cornerstone of Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy, is under pressure given the trade and tariff tensions with New Delhi and the slack US has cut for China and Pakistan -- at India's expense.Pakistan currently has a 19 per cent tariff on its exports to the US compared to India's 50 percent.When pressed on whether India might need to reduce its reliance on Russian oil to secure a broader trade deal with the US, Rubio noted that India has already expressed interest in diversifying its oil portfolio.“The more they buy from us, the less they’ll buy from someone else,” he said, suggesting that increased US oil exports could displace India’s purchases from other suppliers, such as Russia. Yet, he avoided committing to specifics on trade negotiations, stating, “I’m not negotiating trade deals, so I’m not going to speak on that.”While Rubio appeared to be echoing the traditionalist State Department outlook that continues to hew to Washington's Indo-Pacific strategy, the Trump White House seems less enthused about it in recent weeks as the US president seeks to engage China, having realized Beijing holds many cards – from its stranglehold on rare earth elements to buying American agricultural produce.He is also transparently in thrall of Pakistan following reports of its pledge to supply rare earths minerals and its interest in crypto business run by family associates, with unvarnished admiration for the country de-facto military ruler, field marshal Asim Munir.Rubio is expected meet his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar in Malaysia to continue the ministerial level dialogue since Prime Minister Modi chose to skip the meet, forgoing a meeting with Trump amid apparent misgivings over his grandstanding, with claims of having “solved” the India-Pakistan war – a four day clash that ended when the Pakistani director general of military ops phoned is Indian counterpart to seek a ceasefire.The state department and the national security council, both now run by Rubio – a former Senator who was once derided as “Little Marco” by Trump when he ran for GOP nomination – has had to finesse its position in line with White House priorities even as a trade agreement with India remains in limbo. According to officials who are clued into the talks, an agreement is almost ready, but it needs to be signed off by the President, and “no one has any idea if it will satisfy him. ”","‘Indians are very mature when it comes to diplomacy and things of that nature. I don’t think anything we’re doing with Pakistan comes at the expense of our relationship or friendship with India,’ Rubio said.

BENGALURU: Isro Sunday moved the LVM-3 launch vehicle slated to launch the CMS-03 or Gsat-7R satellite meant for the Indian Navy , to the launchpad in Sriharikota.The satellite, which was initially expected to be launched in late 2024 was delayed. Utilising multiple bands to transmit voice, video and data between naval ships, submarines and aircraft, the satellite is expected to boost India’s maritime defence capabilities.In its fifth operational flight, the rocket will lift off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) carrying the 4,400kg satellite, making it the heaviest communication satellite to be launched to the Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) from Indian soil.“CMS-03 is a multi-band communication satellite that will provide services over a wide oceanic region including the Indian landmass. The previous mission of LVM3 launched the Chandrayaan-3 mission, which eventually saw India become the first country to land successfully near the lunar south pole,” Isro said.With the LVM-3 on the launchpad, Isro has commenced pre-launch operations for the mission, whose launch was being watched closed in the last couple of days owing to predictions of a cyclone.“The direction of the cyclone has changed and we are now good to go for a Nov 2 launch,” a source said. TOI had reported last week that Isro was looking at a Nov 2 second launch.Following the launch of CMS-03, Isro will carry out another LVM-3 mission which will launch US private communication satellite Bluebird. “We are looking at the first week of Dec,” Narayanan had told TOI in a separate interview.","Isro Sunday moved the LVM-3 launch vehicle slated to launch the CMS-03 or Gsat-7R satellite meant for the Indian Navy.

Justin Trudeau dating Katy Perry: Where is his ex-wife Sophie?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/justin-trudeau-dating-katy-perry-where-is-his-ex-wife-sophie/articleshow/124821950.cms,"Katy Perry Confirms Justin Trudeau Romance? ‘48 Hours Ago’ Comment Stuns Fans

The Life After “Sunny Ways”





The Rise of Roar and Order





The Sophie Question





The Optics of Affection





The Liberal Love Arc









There’s an old rule in politics: you can lose an election, but never lose the plot. Justin Trudeau , the man who once embodied Canada’s moral optimism and salon-ready hair, seems to have followed that advice with evangelical zeal. While Canada debates the price of maple syrup and the future of liberalism, the former prime minister is busy trending for something far more cinematic—his rumoured romance with Katy Perry Yes, that Katy Perry, the pop deity who once sang “I Kissed a Girl” and made an entire generation of millennials question their playlists and sexuality. In a twist that sounds like it was storyboarded by Netflix’s marketing team, she’s apparently been welcomed into the Trudeau household with open arms. His kids, the tabloids coo, are “smitten.” The insiders murmur that Justin is “serious.” The headlines scream “wedding bells. ”But before we cue the fireworks and champagne, there’s an obvious ghost at this glossy banquet: Sophie Grégoire Trudeau.Sophie Grégoire wasn’t just Justin’s partner in photo-ops; she was his emotional translator, the one who made the Trudeau brand human. A former TV presenter with a yoga-teacher calm and a charisma that could sell both self-care and social reform, she stood beside him through the selfie years, the scandals, and the slow-motion implosion of Canada’s liberal fairy tale.When they announced their separation in August 2023, the statement was painfully Canadian in its politeness: “After many meaningful and difficult conversations, we have made the decision to separate.” No vitriol, no tell-all memoir, no courtroom drama—just the quiet unravelling of a modern marriage conducted under fluorescent political light.Since then, Sophie has retreated from the paparazzi and leaned into purpose. She published a wellness-themed book, Closer Together, in 2024, half memoir and half meditation on mindfulness, and became a sought-after speaker on empathy and mental health. In short, while Justin’s life turned into an internet soap opera, Sophie quietly reinvented herself as the kind of grounded, post-marital heroine Oprah would applaud.Her most recent social media post captures that evolution perfectly. “Real love isn’t about carrying it all. It’s about learning when to give, when to receive, and when to simply be,” she wrote, in a caption that reads more like a closing chapter than a cryptic comment. “Reciprocity means allowing space for both people to grow, to rest, to rediscover themselves within the relationship. Because love that breathes is love that lasts. ” It’s the sort of message that could only come from someone who has made peace with both endings and beginnings.Meanwhile, Justin’s post-political evolution has been less meditative and more MTV Unplugged. Enter Katy Perry: global superstar, part-time activist, and full-time headline magnet. The two were reportedly first seen together in Montreal this summer, later photographed on a California yacht, laughing, cuddling, and giving the internet enough serotonin to last three news cycles.“Justin loves how easily Katy fits in with the family,” said one insider, presumably between spin classes. “His kids adore her.” Another claimed he’s “serious about building something lasting.” The narrative practically writes itself: the widowed prince of progressivism finds solace in the queen of empowerment pop.It’s hard to ignore the political irony. Trudeau, once roasted for being too performative, has now become the star of his own romantic reboot. The man who apologised for blackface, bad pipelines, and budget overruns is finally living in technicolour, and the world can’t look away.So, what did happen to Sophie? The answer, it turns out, is refreshingly normal. She’s thriving—privately. Her social media remains measured and warm, filled with reflections on love, self-worth, and balance. Friends describe her as “at peace.” There’s no bitterness, no back-channel sniping, no quiet PR war.In a culture that monetises every breakup, Sophie’s restraint feels almost radical. She isn’t auditioning for relevance or competing with Perry’s glitter. She’s doing what many political spouses dream of but rarely achieve: reclaiming her narrative.Her latest Instagram post, now viral for its understated grace, seems to say it all: love isn’t ownership; it’s space. A philosophy that, in retrospect, might be the most sophisticated response to her ex-husband’s new chapter.Still, the Perry-Trudeau affair raises a few questions. Not moral ones, but cinematic ones. How does a former world leader date a pop star without turning it into a trailer? What happens when diplomacy meets choreography? Does she serenade him with “Unconditionally” before bedtime? Does he counter with an apology drafted in both English and French?It’s hard not to see the symbolism. Trudeau’s political brand was always part rock concert, part sermon. Perry’s music, too, thrives on idealism and spectacle. Together, they’re a duet of self-reinvention, two brands trying to age gracefully in a world that devours sincerity.And yet, there’s something deeply human here. Two middle-aged public figures, both famous for their performance of authenticity, may have finally stumbled onto the real thing. Perry, who has weathered the exhaustion of pop fame and the chaos of past relationships, reportedly finds Trudeau “grounding.” He, in turn, finds her “vital.”Maybe that’s all it is: two people meeting at the intersection of burnout and belief, trying to write a new story away from the noise.As for Sophie Grégoire, she’s no longer part of that story, but she’s certainly no footnote. If anything, she’s proof that grace after heartbreak is the rarest form of charisma.So what happened to Trudeau’s ex-wife?She moved on—quietly, intelligently, and without hashtags.And that, in the age of yacht selfies and engagement rumours, might just be the most Canadian ending of all.","Sophie Grégoire Trudeau and Justin Trudeau announced their separation in August 2023.

What does Kerala High Court ruling mean for your PPF deposits?





Public Provident Fund or PPF is a popular savings scheme with the sovereign guarantee and decent rate of returns adding to its charm. But there is a cap to the annual investment in the scheme - if you end up earning interest on any extra contribution made over and above this limit, then you will have to return that amount. Here’s a Kerala High Court judgment to better understand this:On 22 March 1999, three public provident fund accounts were opened by a mother at the post office, including one for herself and two for her children. She consistently made deposits into all three PPF accounts. The first child attained majority on 24 December 2005, whilst the second child turned 18 on 26 September 2007. Despite her children becoming adults, she continued making deposits into the PPF accounts as and when possible.According to an ET report, in 2017, the Post Office dispatched a letter dated 29 September 2017, notifying the mother that the aggregate amount in the three PPF accounts exceeded the prescribed limit under the Public Provident Fund Scheme 1968, as the accounts were opened when the children were minors. Consequently, the Post Office recovered Rs 6,87,021 in accumulated interest from all three PPF accounts.Dissatisfied with this action, the mother initiated a Writ Petition before the Kerala High Court.Whilst a Single bench Judge ruled in favour of the petition, the Post Office subsequently challenged this decision before a division bench of the Kerala High Court.On August 14, 2025, the Kerala High Court scrutinised both the single bench judge's ruling and the Public Provident Fund Act 1968, the ET report said.The court noted that the mother had opened three PPF Accounts on March 22, 1999, including one for herself and two separate accounts for her first and second children.According to Rule 3 of Public Provident Fund Act 1968, there exists a yearly deposit ceiling of Rs 1 lakh for an individual, which includes both their personal account and accounts opened for minors under their guardianship, as stipulated in Rule 3(1) of the Scheme. This limit has seen periodic increases.The court concluded that under Rule 3, any deposits exceeding the limit made into these minor accounts before they reached adulthood would be considered as the mother's deposits, thereby violating the prescribed limit under Rule 3 of the Public Provident Fund Act 1968.The High Court of Kerala presented specific portions of the Provident Fund Act, 1968, highlighting the following:Rule 3 from Scheme 1968, along with its associated clarification, states:- ""3. Limit of subscription:- (1) Any individual may, on his own behalf or on behalf of a minor of whom he is the guardian, subscribe to the Public Provident Fund (thereafter referred to as the fund) any amount not less than Rs 500 and not more than Rs 1,50,000 in a year.”- “(3) The limit of deposit of 1,00,000 in a year by an individual in his selfaccount and accounts opened by him on behalf of his minor(s) of whom he is the guardian is combined under rule 3 (1) of the Scheme. This limit is separate for accounts opened by the HUF or an association of persons or body of individuals vide rule 3 (2) of the scheme.""Section 3 empowers the Central Government to establish and implement the Public Provident Fund Scheme through Official Gazette notification. It authorises the creation of a provident fund accessible to the general public. The section stipulates that the Scheme can encompass matters detailed in the Schedule whilst overriding other existing laws except this Act. Additionally, the Central Government retains authority to modify, supplement or alter the Scheme via Official Gazette notifications, according to the ET report.Section 4 specifies that individuals may contribute to the Fund, either for themselves or as guardians of minors. These contributions must comply with the maximum and minimum limits prescribed within the Scheme framework.Following the analysis of account documents, the court determined that the total forfeited interest amounting to Rs 6,87,021 pertained solely to the minor accounts until they reached legal age.Subsequently, the operations of these accounts continued with regular payments and interest disbursements by the appellants to the respondents. There remains no contention regarding the interest disbursements following the attainment of majority age.Source: ETThe interest forfeiture spans distinct periods for each child: for the first child from March 20, 2002 to March 16, 2005, whilst for the second child from March 20, 2002 to March 24, 2007.Source: ETThe Kerala High Court has clarified that under Scheme 1968, when a mother manages and makes deposits into her minor children's accounts, the combined deposits across all three accounts will be considered together for the prescribed scheme limits.Analysis of the presented charts reveals annual breaches of established limits. The Post Office (appellants) failed to identify these irregularities until an internal audit in 2017 brought them to light. The court noted that paying interest above the prescribed limits constitutes unfair enrichment and places an unnecessary burden on public funds.The Kerala High Court's ruling on PPF accounts has substantial ramifications, particularly concerning accounts initiated by guardians for minor children, as explained by Gyanendra Mishra, Partner at Dentons Link Legal to ET.Gyanendra Mishra believes that the ruling definitively establishes the principle of deposit clubbing, with several key implications for investors:The verdict confirms that statutory deposit limits must account for both guardian and minor's PPF accounts collectively. The combined yearly deposits must not surpass the limits set by the PPF Scheme, 1968.The court affirmed that postal authorities have the legal right to recover interest earned on deposits exceeding annual limits.The ruling precisely outlines when clubbing rules are applicable. Interest forfeiture applies exclusively to excess deposits made whilst the account holder was a minor. Deposits and interest accrued post-majority remain unaffected, with accounts then considered autonomous.This verdict, which supersedes a previous Single Judge's ruling favouring the investor, establishes a clear legal framework. It alerts guardians managing PPF accounts for minor children to monitor their cumulative annual contributions across associated accounts to prevent penalties.Mishra says: ""In summary, the judgment's primary significance is that it removes any ambiguity regarding the treatment of a minor's PPF account. It confirms that such an account is considered an extension of the guardian's account for the purpose of the annual deposit limit, and any violation can lead to a lawful forfeiture of the interest earned on excess contributions.""Deepak Kumar, Partner at Khaitan & Co told ET that there is a pressing need for PPF regulatory bodies and relevant authorities to inform individuals about both benefits and restrictions of PPF accounts opened for their minor children. Regular advisories should be issued warning against over-contributions, as these can result in substantial financial losses owing to interest forfeitures on amounts exceeding legally prescribed limits, he adds.","Public Provident Fund or PPF is a popular savings scheme with the sovereign guarantee and decent rate of returns. But there is a cap to the annual investment in the scheme - if you end up earning interest on any extra contribution made over and above this limit, then you will have to return that amount.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124823759,imgsize-78838,width-400,resizemode-4/ppf-rules.jpg"

Diwali smoke: 23 stns may have recorded levels close to severe





NEW DELHI: Had most ambient air quality stations in Delhi not gone on the blink during peak pollution hours on Diwali night and the subsequent morning, the capital's average AQI the next day is likely to have been much closer to 'severe' levels than official data suggests, a TOI analysis of hourly air quality readings reveals.Only eight out of a total of 39 stations logged uninterrupted hourly data in the 24 hours till 4pm, Tuesday, a period that spans Diwali night and the morning after. It's this data that went into calculation of the city's AQI for the day after Diwali (Oct 21).While there are at times gaps in the hourly AQI data, the scale of the outage this Diwali was quite unprecedented. A total of 173 hours of AQI data went missing across 31 stations. Nearly all of this outage, totalling 163 hours of data, happened in the peak pollution period.By comparison, on the day after Diwali last year, 41 hours of data was missing, including 34 hours in the maximum AQI period. All figures are based on hourly AQI data available on CPCB's website.As per the board's hourly data, Delhi's average air quality slipped into 'severe' category (AQI of 400+) in the hour ending 10pm on Diwali and stayed in the extreme zone for 13 hours.It shows that during the first hour of severe air, all 39 stations were working. At 1am, when the city's hourly average AQI peaked at 489 - a level associated with extreme 'air emergency' - the number of working stations dropped to 19. By 3am, data was available from just 12 stations, less than a third of the total.TOI had reported on the missing data in the edition dated Oct 22. The report had also quoted Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa refuting it. ""All data is available on CPCB and DPCC, there is no missing data,"" he had said.However, five days on, the AQI data continues to be missing in CPCB's website. Delhi officially recorded an average AQI of 351 (very poor) the day after Diwali, a drop of just six points from the previous day's average of 345. However, if hourly data trends are extrapolated to fill in the numbers missing from stations during the peak pollution hours, the day's AQI picture changes significantly.Such an extrapolation isn't too speculative since 29 stations in the city had, before blanking out, recorded an AQI of 500 - the maximum on the scale - and again recorded 500 when data transmission resumed. In these stations, therefore, it's more than likely that AQI in the ""missing"" hours had stayed at 500.TOI analysed these trends and extrapolated data for the outage periods. It found that had most of the stations kept transmitting data, Delhi's average AQI on the day after Diwali was likely to have crossed 380, that is, close to severe. Not just that. The number of stations averaging an AQI of more than 400 (severe) over 24 hours would likely have risen from the current one to eight. While seven monitors had recorded an AQI of more than 380 (very poor, close to severe), the extrapolation shows the number may have been close to 23.In Dwarka Sec 8, Najafgarh, Nehru Nagar and R K Puram, data for at least nine hours was missing. Hence, readings from these stations were omitted in the calculation for the city's average AQI. Analysis of data for the available hours and extrapolation show these were among the city's most polluted spots and the day's AQI at all four was likely to have been in severe range.There's no official explanation yet for the data outage.","Only eight out of a total of 39 stations logged uninterrupted hourly data in the 24 hours till 4pm, Tuesday.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Read full Letter from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella

“Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:

Fifty years after our founding, Microsoft is once again at the heart of a generational moment in technology as we find ourselves in the midst of the AI platform shift. More than any transformation before it, this generation of AI is radically changing every layer of the tech stack, and we are changing with it.

Across the company, we are accelerating our pace of innovation and adapting to both a new tech stack and a new way of working. We are delivering our current platforms at scale while building the next generation, always striving to create more value for our customers, our partners, and the world.

Striking this balance is hard work, and few companies over the years have been able to do it. To succeed, we must continue to think in decades but execute in quarters, approaching each day with the humility and curiosity required to continuously improve, while being guided by our bold vision for the future.

Financially, it was a year of record performance. Revenue was $281.7 billion, up 15 percent. Operating income grew 17 percent to $128.5 billion. And Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue for the first time, up 34 percent. These results reflect the growing demand for our platform and the trust customers are placing in us. We take neither for granted.

We must earn our permission to operate every day, in every country, every community, and every customer interaction. That's why we remain grounded in our mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

Imagine a world where every person can get help from a researcher, a coder, or an analyst on demand. Not just information, but deep, contextual expertise paired with action. Or where every organization, no matter its size or sector, can reinvent employee experiences, reimagine customer engagement, reshape business processes, and bend the curve on innovation for their people, businesses, and industries. This is the new frontier and how we will unlock the next level of productivity and growth for the world.

But it is not some far off vision—we are already seeing what's possible when AI reaches the frontlines of human potential, helping small businesses become more productive, multinationals more competitive, nonprofits more effective, governments more efficient, and improving healthcare and education outcomes.

To share just a few examples across industries: Mercy, one of the largest health systems in the US, has saved caregivers over 100,000 hours by automatically documenting physician-patient encounters. As one physician put it: ""the best thing to happen to my practice in 10 years."" A grandmother in Japan, who lost her hearing at age two, can now communicate with her voice, thanks to an AI app. A judge in Colombia is using Copilot to expedite due process and help tackle a backlog of court cases. Barclays Bank is putting AI in the hands of 100,000 employees, transforming the employee experience by simplifying how they access information and get things done. Ralph Lauren is helping customers find the perfect look for any occasion, thanks to a new conversational shopping experience. Carvana has reduced inbound calls per sale by 45 percent, freeing its staff to focus on complex, high-value support.

These examples, and so many others like them, are made possible by our clear focus on our priorities, our responsibility, and our culture.

OUR PRIORITIES

To deliver on our mission, we remain focused on three core business priorities as our North Star: security, quality, and AI innovation.

Security and quality are non-negotiable. Our infrastructure and services are mission critical for the world. This year, we made significant progress across both our Secure Future Initiative (SFI) and Quality Excellence Initiative (QEI), but we recognize our work here is never done. We must continuously raise the bar for ourselves and our customers.

Security

Through SFI, we have dedicated the equivalent of 34,000 full-time engineers to our highest-priority security work. We strengthened identity protections, secured our networks and systems, enhanced threat detection and response, and embedded security-by-design practices across everything we build.

Quality

With QEI, we created frameworks that increase accountability and accelerate progress against our engineering objectives to ensure we deliver durable, high quality-experiences at global scale. This includes improvements to change management, incident management, platform resiliency, and service health.

Together, these initiatives are laying the foundation for a renaissance of our engineering culture, where we build planet-scale systems that power the world, with the security and quality they require.

AI innovation

At the same time, we have made major advances in AI innovation, including across two foundational areas: our Cloud and AI infrastructure, and our family of Copilots and agents.

Our Cloud and AI infrastructure

We continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave. We opened new datacenters across six continents and now operate more than 400 datacenters in 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. This year alone, we added over two gigawatts of new capacity. Every Azure region is now AI-first and can support liquid cooling, increasing the fungibility and the flexibility of our fleet. And just last month, we announced the world's most powerful AI datacenter, Fairwater in southeastern Wisconsin, which will deliver 10x the performance of the world's fastest supercomputer today.

We are also driving and benefiting from compounding improvements in silicon, systems, and models to improve performance and efficiency. And we continue to invest in sovereign cloud offerings to meet the unique data residency needs of governments and industries worldwide.

We have made meaningful progress on the next frontier in cloud systems: quantum. We announced Majorana-1, the first quantum chip with a topological core, and announced the world's first operational deployment of a Level 2 quantum computer in partnership with Atom Computing.

In data and analytics, Microsoft Fabric is becoming the unified platform for the AI era. It is now our fastest-growing analytics product ever, with 25,000 paid customers. OneLake spans all databases and clouds, including Power BI semantic models, making it the best foundation for building enterprise AI applications.

We also introduced Azure AI Foundry, a platform to design, customize, and run powerful AI apps and agents. Foundry includes access to more than 11,000 models from partners like OpenAI, Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and others, ensuring our customers can choose from the best frontier and open models in one place. Already, 80 percent of the Fortune 500 use Foundry for their AI workloads.

And this fall we introduced our first two in-house models: MAI-Voice-1, a super-efficient natural voice generation model that can generate a minute of audio in less than a second on a single GPU, as well as MAI-1 preview, our first foundation model trained end-to-end in-house.

Copilots and agents

Our Copilot family of products is helping people thrive at home, at school, and at work. This year, we surpassed 100 million monthly active users across both commercial and consumer.

We rolled out a major update to Microsoft 365 Copilot this spring, bringing together chat, search, create, notebooks, and role-specific agents like Analyst and Researcher into a single experience. And earlier this month, we announced Agent Mode, which allows you to start with a simple prompt and then work iteratively with Copilot—steering it as it orchestrates multistep tasks to deliver high-quality Office documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

Give Copilot a prompt like, ""Run a full analysis on this sales data set. I want to understand some important insights to help me make decisions about my business. Make it visual."" Agent Mode gets to work deciding which formulas to use, producing new sheets, and creating data visualizations. It's pretty remarkable.

Copilot Studio continues to grow as well, with more than 230,000 organizations using it to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot or to build their own agents using no-code/low-code tools.

In software development, GitHub Copilot now has more than 20 million users and has evolved into a peer programmer, capable of executing tasks on our behalf asynchronously. In healthcare, Dragon Copilot is being used to document millions of clinical encounters, saving precious time that healthcare providers can spend on patients, not paperwork. And in security, we were the first in the industry to introduce AI agents that help defenders autonomously manage high-volume security and IT tasks.

On the consumer front, Copilot is now integrated across Bing, Edge, GroupMe, MSN,

Windows

, and

Xbox

. We also refreshed our Copilot consumer app this year as a more natural, conversational, and personal AI companion. One highlight is Copilot Mode in Edge, which lets you chat directly with your open tabs.

More broadly, we continue to expand our reach with consumers. LinkedIn is now home to 1.2 billion members, and we are bringing AI agents into the core workflows of sales, hiring, and learning. And across gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY

At Microsoft, we have always believed that we do well when the world around us does well. We demonstrate this, year after year, by making progress on our commitments to create technology that benefits everyone on the planet, along with the planet itself.

This means that as we drive the AI economy, we are also providing the skills and opportunities for everyone to participate in it. That's why we launched Microsoft Elevate this year, an initiative that unites our technology, skills, research, and philanthropic investments, so AI can benefit every classroom, community, and cause. Over the next five years, we will invest $4 billion in cash and AI cloud technology to schools, community and technical colleges, and nonprofit organizations. And we will partner with organizations like UNICEF, Code.org, and more to extend AI skilling opportunities to people around the globe.

Our skilling initiatives will help 20 million people earn AI credentials over the next two years, from foundational fluency to advanced technical training. And to support our work with deeper research and policy insights, our new AI Economy Institute will explore how AI is reshaping education and work, helping us bridge the gap between technological innovation and societal impact.

We are also focused on empowering teachers and students with the latest AI tools, making Microsoft 365 Copilot Personal free for 12 months for every college student in the United States. And we're introducing new LinkedIn courses for teachers and students, enabling them to earn LinkedIn certifications that will help boost their resumes and open doors.

Across all of this, one thing is clear: People want technology they can trust. That's why we are committed to driving responsible AI innovation and building safe and secure technology. As we do, we are guided by our values of respect, integrity, and accountability. They are built into the design of our software and services, the security of our data, our privacy protections, and our engagement with employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and governments around the world.

As a multinational company, we remain dedicated to creating jobs, promoting economic opportunities, and strengthening cybersecurity, digital stability, sovereignty, and resilience globally. In Europe, we announced five commitments to strengthen digital stability this year. They start with an expansion of our cloud and AI infrastructure, so every country can compete in the global economy. And they include a promise to uphold Europe's digital resilience regardless of geopolitical and trade volatility.

Responsible business practices are embedded across our operations and supply chain. Following the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we've strengthened our due diligence processes, expanded stakeholder engagement, and launched new governance mechanisms to ensure accountability. Our second annual Responsible AI Transparency Report highlighted our work to build and deploy AI responsibly. This includes developing new AI tools and resources to help our customers innovate within evolving regulatory requirements.

Another key component of earning trust is contributing to a safer online ecosystem, including protecting those who use our services from illegal and harmful content and conduct. We continue to take new steps to advance safety, especially for children, while balancing our commitments to free expression and privacy. Over the past year, we've focused on addressing risks related to abusive AI-generated content and partnered with StopNCII.org to detect victim-reported imagery in Bing.

Our solutions, partnerships, and programs reach people and organizations of all abilities to help them thrive. More than 5 million people have participated in our AI Skilling programs focused on accessibility. We launched new technology to help people with disabilities play, work, and live—through an Adaptive Joystick for Xbox, sign language detection in Teams, low-vision keyboards for Surface, and AI-powered visual descriptions in Windows.

2025 also marked the midpoint in our journey to become a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company, and to protect more land than we use. We are on track to meet many of our targets and continue to accelerate progress for others.

Our renewable energy procurement increased from 1.8 GW in 2020 to 34 GW in 2024, and we contracted nearly 30 million metric tons of carbon removal—playing a pivotal role in scaling the carbon removal market. We provided more than 1.5 million people with clean water and sanitation and plan to replenish more than 100 million cubic meters of water around the world. We are getting closer to zero waste through new Circular Centers, which contribute to the reuse and recycling of nearly 91 percent of servers and components decommissioned from our datacenters. And we've reached nearly 95 percent recyclability in our product packaging.

We are learning how to make AI more sustainable by design and improve AI-powered solutions. Platforms like our Planetary Computer and our AI for Good Lab are helping us find new ways to address the world's most pressing challenges.

Making progress on these commitments takes time. But here, too—we are guided by a bold vision, thinking in decades and executing in quarters.

OUR CULTURE

Amid this rapid progress, our culture is more important than ever. The AI platform shift is reshaping not just our products and business models, but how we work.

Our growth mindset is essential to our ability to continue leading this AI era. It enables us to innovate both within Microsoft and with those we serve. We must be learn-it-alls, willing to experiment, guided by evaluations, and committed to continuous improvement. I am continually impressed by how our people do just that.

We are focused on being Customer Zero, applying AI to reduce toil and improve flow in our own work while creating a playbook we can share with the world.

We're also embracing a new way of working—one that expands job scopes, reduces handoffs, and gives teams tools to scale productivity in nonlinear ways. This isn't just about driving efficiency. It's about empowering our people to dream bigger and get to ""job complete"" faster, with less friction and greater impact than ever before.

Our employees also continue to find ways to bring their purpose and passion to the causes and communities they care deeply about. This year, they volunteered over 1.2 million hours and gave $263 million (including company match) to 37,000 nonprofit organizations in 110 countries.

In July, after we reported our earnings results—including surpassing $75 billion in annual Azure revenue for the first time—I shared a reflection with all employees. Fifteen years ago, when we set out on our cloud journey, we had a bold vision, and we persisted through all the ups and downs.

I asked our team: What are you working on today that, 15 years from now, you will look back on and say, ""we got it right""? Hundreds of answers poured in spanning near-term priorities and long-term ambitions alike:

""Helping the world be safe from cybercrime"" ""Speech is now a standard human-machine interface"" ""Using AI to improve the lived experience for people with disabilities"" ""We changed the way people learn"" ""Access to millions of agents powered by orders of magnitude larger models"" ""Medical knowledge has become ambient, embedded in clinical workflows""

""We helped billions become skilled in AI""

These responses and so many others reflected a deep sense of purpose and belief in what's possible. And that is precisely what is needed for us to succeed. Microsoft has an immense opportunity and responsibility—not just in building these futures, but in helping shape the world's future. And I'm confident that together, we can continue to think in decades and execute in quarters on this journey to empower us all.

His rationale: as expertise becomes accessible at everyone's fingertips through AI, specialisation loses its premium. ""Intelligence is not the asymmetry. Applying intelligence is the asymmetry,"" Kumar explained.He urged students to ""start to focus on interdisciplinary skills,"" citing examples like historians blending computational skills to become futurists or biology majors using AI to crack drug development cycles.According to Kumar, the corporate pyramid is becoming ""broader and shorter,"" with faster paths to expertise for those who can leverage AI tools effectively.Kumar sees AI handling the ""middle"" work—the execution and problem-solving—while humans focus on the beginning (prompting, conceptualising, finding purposeful problems) and the end (validation and verification). This shift means companies need more ""problem finders"" rather than just problem solvers, opening doors for disciplines traditionally outside tech's core.The shift extends beyond hiring. Cognizant has launched apprenticeship programs in 30 states and partnered with Merit America for mid-career shifts, offering a ""work, earn and learn"" model. Kumar acknowledges a critical caveat: AI's benefits must be ""distributed equitably"" rather than concentrated among a few to truly boost productivity and create wage distribution.""As people are living longer, the life of their skills is getting shorter,"" Kumar noted, emphasising that future workers will need multiple careers in one lifetime—making adaptable, interdisciplinary skills more valuable than narrow expertise.","Cognizant is hiring more school graduates this year than ever before. CEO Ravi Kumar S believes AI will widen the base of corporate employment. He's looking beyond traditional tech majors to liberal arts colleges and community colleges.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky expressed interest in integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the travel platform but noted that the technology isn’t yet up to par. Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” recently, Chesky said the current software development kit “wasn’t quite robust enough for the things we want to do. ” Said to be a close friend of OpenAI founder Sam Altman , Chesky added that Airbnb would “probably” incorporate ChatGPT in the future.Airbnb already leverages 13 AI models, including those from OpenAI and Google, to power its service bot. However, Brian Chesky’s remarks underscored a growing trend: open-source AI models, which developers can customize, are gaining ground against proprietary systems like OpenAI’s. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and DeepSeek are driving this shift, releasing advanced, cost-effective open-source AI systems. At Alibaba’s recent Apsara conference, the company reported hosting over 300 open-source AI models, supporting more than 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem.Alibaba’s Qwen 3 series, launched in May, supports over 100 languages, earning praise for its natural multilingual capabilities. In a report by South China Morning Post, Nicolas de Cameret, founder of BotBot Robotics, called Qwen’s models the best for such applications.Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai argued that AI success hinges on rapid adoption, not just building the most powerful models. He contrasted China’s focus on affordable, open-source AI with the U.S.’s heavy investments in trillion-parameter models, suggesting China’s approach fosters faster global uptake.To date, Alibaba has released more than 300 open-source AI models that underpin over 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem, according to data reportedly released during the company’s annual Apsara conference late last month.",Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky expressed interest in integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the travel platform.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Praise or taunt?

Governor Kathy Hochul's endorsement of Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, drew criticism. Musk's remarks framed this as a leftward shift. Voters expressed concerns about Mamdani's agenda, with some calling it 'far-left' and others linking it to 'communism'.

'Puppet Master In White House': Zohran Mamdani's BRUTAL ATTACK On Trump From NYC Rally





Tesla CEO Elon Musk , in a brief but loaded X post, took a dig at the New York mayor socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani , calling him the ""future of the Democratic Party.""His words came as a reaction to New York’s governor endorsing Zohran Mamdani, naming the candidate as “a chance to reclaim the Senate and America” if elected. The comment, paired with a rally clip that has already garnered over 1.4 million views, quickly sparked a wave of speculation online. Was Musk applauding the move or slyly mocking it?In the video, Kathy Hochul can be seen urging the voters to vote for Zohran Mamdani to ""take back America."" The chants and signs at the rally called for rent freezes that cast Mamdani’s ascent as the party’s new face. The clip comes from an October 26 NYC rally featuring Hochul alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, where hecklers interjected with “tax the rich,” underscoring tensions between moderates and the left wing even as they share a stage for turnout energy.The tweet by Musk invited reactions castigating Mamdani's agenda as 'far-left.' While some critics framed the rent control and tax plans as steps toward “communism,” others argued the party’s post-2024 direction reflects an embrace of democratic socialism.The reply section was filled with analysis and memes indicating the voters' belief of Mamdani trying to 'push communist ideology on America.'One of the users also posted a meme of Mamdani posing against New York's grave.Another user wrote about their concern regarding New Yorkers losing their property to the mega investors and ending up owning nothing. ""Freeze rent. Increase property taxes and expenses. Force private owners to sell. All property is bought by mega investors. Every New Yorker will own nothing and like it,"" wrote the user.Elon Musk’s sharp comment turned what was meant to be a show of unity into a debate about the Democrats’ future, putting Governor Hochul’s practical stance and Mamdani’s progressive views in the same spotlight. As Election Day approaches, the key question is whether promises to make life more affordable can win against criticism over taxes and policing—and whether a viral remark can influence voters more than traditional campaigning.","Elon Musk called Zohran Mamdano 'the future of Democratic Party' igniting debate about the Democratic Party's future.

Stock markets in Asia jumped on Monday after the United States and China outlined a framework for a potential trade deal, raising hopes that tensions between the world’s two largest economies may ease.The development boosted investor confidence across regional markets, which opened higher following a strong finish on Wall Street last week.In early trade, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 2.1% to 50,321.49, while South Korea’s Kospi gained about 2%.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 1% to 26,425.51 and Shanghai’s Composite Index advanced 0.9% to 3,985.83.Taipei also opened higher, supported by improved global sentiment.Markets rallied after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the risk of a 100% US tariff on Chinese goods was “effectively off the table” following weekend talks in Malaysia, as reported by AFP.He added that China had agreed to delay its rare earth export controls and make “substantial” soybean purchases, a key move seen as progress toward a broader trade agreement.Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng confirmed that both sides had reached a “preliminary consensus” on tariffs, export controls and fentanyl cooperation.He described the talks as “candid, in-depth and constructive.”The breakthrough paves the way for US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet later this week in South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.It will be their first face-to-face meeting since Trump returned to office.Trump said he was confident that both countries could reach a comprehensive deal soon. “They want to make a deal and we want to make a deal,” he told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.The US president is currently on a five-day Asia tour. His visit included Asean summit in Malaysia. He is enroute to Japan and South Korea, with trade cooperation at the top of the agenda.Futures for US copper also rose on the trade optimism, signaling stronger expectations for global demand. Analysts said the progress helped ease fears of slower growth that had weighed on markets earlier this month.At the same time, oil prices edged higher, with Brent crude up 0.2% at $66.09 a barrel and US West Texas Intermediate at $61.62.

Oil prices rose on Monday after the United States and China outlined a framework for a potential trade deal. The move raised hopes of improved relations between the world’s two largest oil consumers.By 0027 GMT (local time), Brent crude futures were up 46 cents or 0.7%, at $66.40 a barrel. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 46 cents or 0.75% to $61.96, as reported by Reuters.Both benchmarks had jumped significantly last week, Brent by 8.9% and WTI by 7.7% after the US and European Union imposed sanctions on Russia.Experts say the trade progress has calmed fears that tariffs and export controls could slow global economic growth and reduce oil demand.Haitong Securities stated in a note that market expectations have improved following the imposition of new sanctions on Russia and the easing of US-China tensions. The development has helped counter earlier concerns about crude oversupply, which had pushed prices down in early October.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said top officials from both countries agreed on a “very substantial framework” during talks in Kuala Lumpur.The plan would prevent full 100% US tariffs on Chinese goods and delay China’s controls on rare-earth exports.President Donald Trump also expressed optimism, saying he expected to finalize an agreement soon and hold meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping in both China and the United States.“I think we’re going to have a deal with China,” he said. “We’re going to meet them later in China and in the US, either Washington or Mar-a-Lago.”Analysts say the positive trade development supports oil prices in the short term, even as concerns remain over Russia.Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG, said, “The positive trade-deal framework helps offset concerns that Russia could offset new U.S. sanctions, targeting Rosneft and Lukoil, by offering deeper discounts and using shadow fleets to lure buyers.”However, Yang An of Haitong Securities warned that if sanctions on Russian energy are less effective than expected, oversupply could return and put pressure on oil prices.","Oil prices rose on Monday after the United States and China outlined a framework for a potential trade deal.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Her influencer earnings add another dimension: one estimate records her Instagram income potential at roughly $27,000-$44,000 per month in 2025 from social media content alone.The growth trajectory suggests she is just getting started.

"Delhi pollution push: MCD plans to double parking fees at 400 lots; won’t impact revenue much, says official",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-mcd-plans-to-double-parking-fees-at-400-lots-aims-to-curb-private-vehicle-use-in-pollution-season/articleshow/124839088.cms,"Delhi’s Air Quality Deteriorates Sharply to ‘Red Zone’ as Diwali Fireworks Trigger Severe Pollution

‘Doubling parking fee won’t impact revenue much’





NEW DELHI: Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) is preparing a proposal to double parking fees at all its 400-plus lots in the city.The move is aimed at dissuading travel in private vehicles and promoting public transport instead in pollution season. “The proposal will soon be placed before the House for approval,” an MCD official said.If okayed, revised rates will take effect immediately and remain in place until air quality improves. This isn’t MCD’s first attempt. Multiple proposals for a fourfold increase were rejected by the House, citing implementation challenges and public inconvenience.The last proposal to double the rates was also referred back by the House, which is why we are preparing a fresh one now,” the official said.“We hope the House will support this move as it directly aligns with GRAP norms and Delhi’s broader pollution-control strategy. Though implementation may face hiccups since parking lots are operated by contractors under existing agreements and any change requires revising their terms and conditions, we have estimated that doubling the fee won’t significantly impact overall revenue collection,” the official said.Currently, the capital is under GRAP-II restrictions with the air quality hovering in the ‘very poor’ bracket. New Delhi Municipal Council is also considering doubling parking charges in areas it controls However, unlike MCD, NDMC runs these facilities with the help of its own staffers, giving it the flexibility to introduce changes, such as raising fees, quickly.","MCD is preparing a proposal to double parking fees at all its 400-plus lots in the city.

How big tech went from banning Trump to funding his $300 million White House ballroom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-big-tech-went-from-banning-trump-to-funding-his-300-million-white-house-ballroom/articleshow/124833189.cms,"Trump’s $350M ‘Presidential Ballroom’ Mystery Sends D.C. Into Frenzy; What’s He Really Building?

Here are some of the companies that went back on their stance

Microsoft

In a dramatic turnaround, technology giants that once de-platformed Donald Trump are now among the principal donors financing his $300 million White House ballroom. The 90,000-square-foot venue, which will replace the historic East Wing, has sparked debate over corporate influence, historic preservation, and political optics.The ballroom is now more than a luxury venue—it is a symbol of the interplay between money, influence, and politics in modern Washington.Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reportedly contributed $22 million as part of a legal settlement tied to Trump’s suspension from YouTube following the January 6 Capitol riot. Four years ago, the company blocked Trump from the platform, citing violations of policy, yet today it is underwriting his extravagant White House project.Apple, which publicly criticised Trump’s policies on immigration and climate change during his first term, is now listed as a donor to the ballroom. The tech giant has reportedly pledged funding while also seeking to maintain a favourable relationship with the current administration amid upcoming antitrust and privacy legislation.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and company executives were vocal critics of Trump’s presidency, particularly regarding corporate taxation and market dominance.Now Amazon has made substantial contributions, reportedly tied to procurement and cloud contracts, signalling a strategic pivot towards engagement rather than opposition.Microsoft suspended certain services and publicly condemned Trump-era immigration policies. Today, the company is among the key donors for the ballroom, coinciding with the administration awarding Microsoft lucrative government AI and cloud service contracts.Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, banned Trump for violations of platform rules during the January 6 events. Now, the company has contributed to the White House ballroom project.The ballroom’s construction has already resulted in the demolition of the East Wing, a space historically assigned to the Office of the first lady. Experts argue the project represents a larger story of how corporate America navigates political power, switching between condemnation and support depending on strategic benefit.Ethics observers warn that these donations could present conflicts of interest, as several donors hold or are pursuing contracts with the Trump administration.","Tech giants that once de-platformed Donald Trump are now among the principal donors financing his $300 million White House ballroom.
