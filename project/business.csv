"PRAGATI fast-tracks AIIMS push, brings tertiary care closer to heartland",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pragati-fast-tracks-aiims-push-brings-tertiary-care-closer-to-heartland/articleshow/126386860.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Three long-delayed AIIMS projects—in Telangana’s Bibinagar, Assam’s Guwahati and Jammu—have moved decisively from delay to delivery after sustained intervention through the Centre’s PRAGATI platform, underscoring how high-level monitoring is reshaping access to advanced healthcare beyond major metros.Official sources said the projects gathered pace after being taken up on PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation), a digital monitoring platform that brings Union ministries, state governments and local authorities onto a single dashboard, flags bottlenecks in real time and fixes deadlines through direct review by the Prime Minister.In Telangana, AIIMS Bibinagar gained momentum after a PRAGATI review in June 2023 unlocked long-pending issues related to assured water supply and permanent high-tension power. These hurdles were resolved in May 2025 through coordinated Centre–state action, pushing physical progress to nearly 86% and keeping the project on track for completion by June 2026. The institute is expected to emerge as a major hub for tertiary care, medical education and employment in the region.In the Northeast, AIIMS Guwahati—the region’s first AIIMS—was completed in 2023 after PRAGATI interventions helped resolve delays linked to land development, electricity, stormwater management and water supply.The 750-bed hospital now offers 25 specialty and 11 super-specialty services, with nearly 60% of patients receiving free treatment under Ayushman Bharat, significantly reducing out-of-pocket costs for vulnerable households.A similar last-mile push helped AIIMS Jammu overcome hurdles that threatened to delay commissioning despite near-complete construction. Issues such as relocation of a cremation ground and pending utility connections were taken up through PRAGATI in mid-2023, leading to time-bound action by the Union Territory administration. The institute was commissioned in November 2024 and now serves patients across Jammu & Kashmir and neighbouring regions.At the 50th PRAGATI meeting on December 31, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Viksit Bharat@2047 is a time-bound national resolve and described PRAGATI as a key accelerator that breaks bureaucratic silos and enforces accountability across Centre, state and district administrations.Officials said the three AIIMS projects illustrate how PRAGATI has converted complex, multi-agency healthcare infrastructure from stalled works into operational hospitals. Beyond expanding bed capacity, the institutes are strengthening medical education, research and regional employment, easing pressure on existing centres and bringing quality care closer to people’s homes.","Three long-delayed AIIMS projects have moved decisively from delay to delivery after sustained intervention through the Centre’s PRAGATI platform.

NMC drops MBBS nod for Vaishno Devi College; admitted med students to be moved to other J&K colleges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-drops-mbbs-nod-for-vaishno-devi-college-admitted-med-students-to-be-moved-to-other-jk-colleges/articleshow/126385151.cms,"NEW DELHI: The National Medical Commission’s Medical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB) has withdrawn the Letter of Permission (LoP) granted to the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence to run an MBBS course with 50 seats for the 2025-26 academic year, after a surprise inspection found serious violations of minimum standards.The January 6 order takes immediate effect. NMC officials said the institute was noncompliant with key requirements, including infrastructure and faculty strength, following multiple complaints.To safeguard students already admitted for 2025-26, authorities have been directed to shift them to other medical colleges in J&K as supernumerary seats, as per norms.The move comes amid wider scrutiny of the college. Earlier, NMC had rejected institute’s request to place all 50 MBBS seats under All-India Quota through Medical Counselling Committee, saying seat-sharing policy cannot be altered for a single institution.Located near the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi shrine in Reasi, the institute was sanctioned 50 MBBS seats on Sept 8, 2025 and began operations in Nov from administrative block of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University.The college has also faced protests from Hindu organisations over selection of 43 students from a particular community in its first batch of 50, with allegations that the institute is largely funded by devotees of another faith. College officials said all admitted students were from J&K.With LoP withdrawn, future of institute’s first MBBS batch hinges on swift relocation of students to other colleges.","National Medical Commission’s Medical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB) has withdrawn the Letter of Permission (LoP) granted to the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence.

NEW DELHI: At a time when home minister Amit Shah has vowed to eradicate Left-wing extremism by March-end, Supreme Court on Tuesday said success against Naxalites could not be based on arrests alone and there must be adequate courts and infrastructure for speedy trial of the arrested ultras.One Kailash Ramchandani was arrested in June 2019 for being the person who signalled Naxalites to trigger an IED blast that killed 15 police personnel at Gadchiroli in Maharashtra. He was also accused of supplying material used in IED and walkie talkies to the extremists through a small shop used as a front.Senior advocate Trideep Pais told SC there were scores of cases pending before the same special judge where Ramchandani’s case was being heard and the prosecution had listed 146 witnesses of which only one has been examined in the last three months. Pais said the accused had no criminal antecedents and pleaded for bail, saying he had been in custody for six-and-a-half years.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi the blast was triggered on the signal given by the accused and his hands were red with the blood of 15 police personnel.The bench said, “Your success story against Left-wing extremism cannot be based on arrests alone.There must be speedy trial, which is possible only when govt sets up exclusive special courts to try cases of this nature. Since there are many cases pending before the same trial judge and prosecution has cited many witnesses, the trial is not going to be concluded in the near future.”But the bench was cautious in granting only interim bail to the accused with the condition that he would be under constant watch of police. “If he attempts to get in touch with his associates among Naxalites, the interim bail would be liable to be cancelled,” it said and asked him to report to the police station near his home once a week.",One Kailash Ramchandani was arrested in June 2019 for being the person who signalled Naxalites to trigger an IED blast.

1. Re-introducing tax incentives for the self-employed under the new tax regime can provide a much-needed nudge towards retirement planning.

2.

Formalising retirement savings for gig and platform workers through mandatory contributions deserves priority.

3.

Revisiting the ₹7.5 lakh cap on tax-exempt employer contributions can materially improve retirement adequacy for salaried employees.

4.

Making NPS tie-up mandatory for private sector employers can significantly expand coverage.

5.

Enabling interoperability between EPF and NPS would provide flexibility and empower individual choice.

(Sriram Iyer is Managing Director & CEO, HDFC Pension)

As India aspires to become a developed economy by 2047, one of the most critical yet under-discussed pillars is retirement security. Despite rapid financialisation of household savings, India’s pension assets stand at only about 14% of GDP, significantly lower than comparable economies. The upcoming Union Budget offers an opportunity to accelerate India’s journey towards becoming a ‘pensioned society’ by strengthening and widening the National Pension System (NPS).Nearly 58% of India’s workforce is self-employed, as per the Economic Survey 2024-25. Unlike salaried employees—who benefit from EPF, corporate NPS and superannuation—the self-employed largely remain outside formal retirement systems. Section 80CCD(1B), which allowed an additional deduction of ₹50,000 for NPS contributions, acted as a strong behavioural trigger for this segment under the old tax regime. Its absence in the new tax regime has diluted that incentive.Re-introducing 80CCD(1B) under the new regime, with a higher limit of up to ₹1.2 lakh annually, would encourage early participation in retirement savings.Global experience shows that upfront tax incentives play a decisive role in driving adoption of long-term products like pensions. Over time, this would reduce old-age dependency and fiscal pressures on the State.India’s gig workforce—estimated at nearly 1 crore today and projected to reach 2.35 crore by 2029-30 —represents a fast-growing but vulnerable segment. While the Code on Social Security, 2020 recognises gig and platform workers and provides for insurance and health benefits, structured retirement savings remain absent.A modest mandatory contribution of 2–3% by digital platforms into NPS can meaningfully address this gap. Given the nature of gig work, voluntary retirement savings often take a back seat to immediate income needs. A default, system-driven contribution mechanism would help these workers build a long-term corpus without affecting their day-to-day liquidity. This step would also align well with the Government’s broader inclusion and social security agenda.Currently, the combined employer contribution to EPF, superannuation and NPS is capped at ₹7.5 lakh per annum. In practice, a significant portion of this limit is consumed by EPF and superannuation, leaving limited headroom for NPS contributions - even though NPS allows up to 14% of basic salary as employer contribution. As a result, senior management and key decision-makers often find NPS less attractive, which in turn affects adoption across organisations.Removing NPS from this overall cap—or creating a separate sub-limit for NPS—would enhance retirement replacement rates, potentially increasing them to around 65% when combined with other retirement instruments. This would also encourage leadership within corporates to actively champion NPS adoption.While EPF is mandatory, NPS remains optional, despite its low cost, transparency and market-linked returns. Today, only about 21,000 corporates offer employer NPS, compared to nearly 8 lakh establishments registered with EPFO. Making NPS tie-up mandatory for companies above a certain workforce threshold - say, 100 employees - would substantially widen coverage among private sector employees. A blended approach combining EPF, superannuation and NPS can meaningfully enhance long-term retirement outcomes, while still preserving choice and diversification.India’s workforce is young, mobile and increasingly financially aware. While EPF offers fixed returns and capital protection, NPS provides market-linked growth, low costs and the flexibility to customize asset allocation based on age and risk appetite. Although policy intent to allow tax-neutral transfers from recognised provident funds to NPS was articulated earlier, operational enablement - especially for EPF - remains incomplete.Allowing seamless, tax-neutral transfers between EPF and NPS would give employees the freedom to design retirement solutions aligned to their life stage and financial goals, while also channelising long-term savings into productive capital formation.The Union Budget has a unique opportunity to place retirement security firmly at the center of India’s economic agenda. Targeted tax incentives, inclusion of emerging workforce segments, rationalisation of contribution limits, and greater system flexibility can collectively deepen NPS adoption. These measures would not only strengthen household financial resilience but also support long-term capital formation-creating a virtuous cycle for both citizens and the economy.",The Union Budget has a unique opportunity to place retirement security firmly at the center of India’s economic agenda.

Bank Holidays January 2026: The new year 2026 has just begun and if your to-do list contains a bank visit, it’s a good idea to check when banks will be closed in January. A missed holiday can easily turn a routine bank visit into a wasted trip, especially in the first few days of the year when people are settling back into work and finances.Banks in India observe a mix of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can differ from one state to another.Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.Banks will remain closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu in observance of New Year Celebrations and Mannam Jayanthi.Banks will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh for birthday of Hazrat Ali.Banks in West Bengal will remain closed in observance of birth day of Swami Vivekananda.Banks in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be shut in on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain closed for Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be shut in observance of Thiruvalluvar Day.Banks in Tamil Nadu will remain closed due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha, West Bengal, will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic day.Apart from these holidays, banks also remain closed on every second and fourth Saturday of the month.Knowing bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute delays. However, bank closure does not means that customers can not process their financial transactions during holidays. Even when branches are shut, online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.However, services that require a physical visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and issuing demand drafts, will not be available.

What is at stake

Thackeray brothers unite

Natural allies

Both Sena (UBT) and MNS are “natural allies”. They derive their political legacy from the Shiv Sena, founded by the late Bal Thackeray, which was rooted in Marathi identity. Since then, the emotive issue of Marathi pride has remained central to both parties.

Since launching the MNS in 2006, Raj Thackeray has leaned heavily on an anti-North India stance as his political trademark. Uddhav, meanwhile, has championed the “Marathi manoos” narrative to advance his agenda.

Both parties performed poorly in the Assembly elections held in 2024. Ahead of the local body elections, the issue of Marathi identity—through opposition to the imposition of Hindi—has given both parties renewed energy to ignite Marathi pride among voters.

‘Pawar’ alliance

NCP (SP) to join NDA?

Will MVA disintegrate?

Who won the last local body elections?

Who dominated municipal council polls?

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for the first electoral showdown of 2026 as elections for 29 local bodies in Maharashtra are scheduled for January 15. These elections were long overdue because of legal battles.According to the Maharashtra Election Commission, polls for these corporations were held on different dates between 2015 and 2018. Elections for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which governs Mumbai, and 17 other major cities were last held in 2017. Five municipal corporations, including Vasai-Virar, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli, went to the polls in 2015, while four others — Dhule, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar and Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad — had elected their mayors in 2018.Interestingly, many tectonic shifts were witnessed in the run-up to the elections. While the Thackeray and Pawar families ironed out alliances, many corporators from various parties jumped ship just ahead of the polls.The BMC has a budget of more than Rs 74,000 crore -- larger than the GDP of many states in the country and several countries across the world.Geographically, Mumbai, along with its suburbs, Pune and Nashik do not even constitute one-fourth of Maharashtra’s total area.However, this region is significant because of its wealth and the industries it hosts. Therefore, the corporations in these areas are highly important for political parties.It is thus inevitable that these elections become testing grounds for parties and alliances. The Mahayuti and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) are the main contenders, but regional and smaller parties are also in the fray and determined to make their presence felt at the local level of urban governance.The BJP and Shiv Sena , constituents of the Mahayuti, are contesting 137 and 90 seats, respectively. The third Mahayuti ally, the NCP , is fighting independently and has fielded 94 candidates, meaning the party will take on its state-level partners in nearly 100 seats if no nominations are withdrawn.Meanwhile, Congress has put up 143 candidates, while its new ally, the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), led by former MP Prakash Ambedkar, has fielded 42 contestants even though it was allotted 62 seats in a pre-poll pact with the national party.The Rashtriya Samaj Paksh (RSP), a Congress ally, has fielded six candidates.The Shiv Sena (UBT), led by former chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, is contesting over 150 seats, the NCP (SP) 11, and Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) the rest.In the upcoming elections, the Thackeray brothers - Uddhav and Raj Thackeray - have decided to join hands after 20 years and are contesting the elections on the plank of “Maratha pride”.“We will make sure that Marathi people get what they want,” Raj Thackeray said while announcing the alliance between Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.Meanwhile, the Ajit Pawar-led NCP also announced that it will contest the Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune local body elections together with the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction).“For the sake of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, the ‘clock’ and the ‘tutari’ (trumpet) have united. The parivar has come together,” deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said while announcing the alliance.The announcement, however, came with a rider -- the decision has been taken only for Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, and family patriarch Sharad Pawar was not involved in the decision-making process.This comes two years after Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, split from his uncle Sharad Pawar and joined hands with the BJP and Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. He had raised objections to Sharad Pawar continuing to lead the party despite his age.Ajit Pawar was sworn in as deputy chief minister under the new alliance. He favoured aligning with the ruling coalition, while Sharad Pawar’s faction insisted on remaining with the opposition.The Election Commission later recognised Ajit Pawar’s faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock’ symbol. Sharad Pawar’s faction, NCP (SP), adopted the ‘tutari’ (curved trumpet) symbol.Both factions contested elections separately. After the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where his faction faced setbacks, Ajit Pawar acknowledged that turning his back on family had been a “mistake”.In the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections, Ajit Pawar’s NCP increased its tally from just six Assembly segment leads in the Lok Sabha elections to 41 MLAs, defeating the senior Pawar’s nominees in 27 head-to-head contests; the latter won seven.During the campaign, Shiv Sena minister Sanjay Shirsat floated speculation over the possibility of the NCP (SP) joining the BJP-led NDA government.He said that local-level adjustments could be a precursor to a broader political understanding.“In the coming future, there is a possibility that Sharad Pawar could join the NDA. Did anyone believe that he would join hands with Uddhav Thackeray? But he did, and they were in power for two-and-a-half years,” Shirsat said.“He opposed Sonia Gandhi and left the Congress, and then immediately made an alliance with them. It would not be surprising if he joins the NDA. If you study politics, this has been his career pattern,” he added.The coming together of the Thackeray brothers and the senior and junior Pawars signals a silent end of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) -- the opposition front that Uddhav Thackeray formed with the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s NCP in 2019 to keep the BJP out of power after the assembly elections.The opposition coalition performed strongly in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, winning 30 of the 48 seats in the state. The glory, however, was short-lived as the MVA was decimated in the Assembly elections held later in the year, collectively winning only 46 of the 288 seats.In the run-up to the local body polls, the Congress has been left out of alliances after it refused to join hands with Raj Thackeray’s MNS, given his aggressive “outsiders” pitch against north Indians.The grand old party, which had earlier asserted it would contest the January 15 polls solo on all 227 wards, has now joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar-led VBA, allocating it 62 seats.Apart from the VBA, the Congress has allocated 10 seats to the RSP and two to the Republican Party of India (Gavai faction), unsettling functionaries of the party’s city unit, leaders said.The Congress move to chart its own course in Maharashtra is a bold gambit. The party, which had a fairly strong presence in state politics till 2009, has since seen its electoral fortunes decline.In the 2024 assembly elections, the Congress won only 16 of the 101 seats it contested. Its vote share stood at 12.42% — the lowest for the party in Maharashtra, though still higher than all other players except the BJP.However, this solo fight pits the Congress directly against the BJP, which has been the undisputed winner in recent electoral contests. The move also divides the opposition space in the civic polls, giving the BJP-led Mahayuti an advantage.The last elections in the municipal corporations were largely dominated by the BJP and the Shiv Sena, which formed governments in 15 municipal corporations, including Mumbai and Thane.The BJP secured a majority in 13 corporations on its own, including Pune, Jalgaon, Mira-Bhayandar, Nagpur and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The Shiv Sena achieved a majority in its stronghold, Thane. In Mumbai, they ruled as partners until the tenure ended in 2022.The BJP-led Mahayuti delivered a sweeping verdict after two rounds of the first phase of Maharashtra’s civic elections, winning presidents’ posts in nearly 207 of 288 municipal councils and nagar panchayats.The BJP emerged as the biggest gainer with victories in over 117 local bodies, while the MVA was reduced to 44 posts.Despite emerging as a distant challenger statewide, the Congress checked the BJP's advances in parts of Vidarbha. Western Maharashtra saw Mahayuti allies battling each other as the Congress and NCP (SP) struggled to hold ground.Meanwhile, the BJP made gains in Mumbai and Konkan, encroaching into traditional Shiv Sena, PWP and NCP pockets. The Shinde-led Sena expanded its footprint beyond the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), finishing second across the state.","The stage is set for the first electoral showdown of 2026 as elections for 29 local bodies in Maharashtra are scheduled for January 15.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday backed the use of electric vehicles as Delhi continues to battle air pollution. The apex court said that car ownership has turned into a status symbol and urging greater responsibility from rricher sections of society.Hearing a plea related to air pollution, CJI Surya Kant remarked that personal transport choices were contributing significantly to the crisis.“Car has become a status symbol… People are saving money to buy cars and have stopped using cycles,” the CJI said, as reported by PTI.The CJI said, “The rich people should also sacrifice. Instead of going for high-end vehicles, they should go for good electric vehicles.”Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing in the matter, argued that curbing the ownership of multiple vehicles could be one way forward, while also pointing out that the automobile industry wielded considerable influence.The court also came down heavily on the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), describing it as “failing in its duty” after it sought a two-month adjournment on the issue of temporarily closing or relocating toll plazas at Delhi borders to ease congestion. The bench criticised the authority for a lack of urgency and seriousness in dealing with the pollution emergency.“Have you been able to identify the causes of pollution? … By holding a meeting on January 2 and telling us that we will come after two months, that is not acceptable to us.

The project will connect the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway with the Bundelkhand Expressway and will pass through parts of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.The 420-km expressway, a mix of expansion of existing highway stretches and construction of a greenfield section, would cost around Rs 14,000 crore. Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari confirmed this to TOI on Tuesday. The decision was taken at a review meeting chaired by Gadkari on Monday evening and was attended by MP CM Mohan Yadav and two Union ministers — Bhupender Yadav and Jyotiraditya Scindia.National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will build the 6-lane access-controlled corridor. Officials said the alignment of the project was reworked after the earlier plan faced some issues. “The new alignment falls outside forest and wildlife areas, and also outside the Chambal ravines (beehad).

"In a first, budget likely to be presented on Sunday",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/in-a-first-budget-likely-to-be-presented-on-sunday/articleshow/126380814.cms,"Piyush Goyal Says India Aims to Remain the Fastest-Growing Large Economy for the Next 20 Years

NEW DELHI: The budget for 2026-27 is likely to be presented on February 1, the first, in recent memory, to be presented on a Sunday.The budget session may start from Jan 28 with the President’s speech. Though the final call on the date will be taken by the cabinet committee on parliamentary affairs (CCPA) on Wednesday, TOI has learnt that govt may continue with the tradition of presenting the budget on February 1.Since 2017, govt has been presenting the budget at 11 am on February 1 and former FM Arun Jaitley had unveiled it for the first time on the first day of Feb after govt decided to advance the budget presentation. Prior to 2017, the budget was presented on February 28.This year Feb 1 falls on a Sunday. It is also Guru Ravidas Jayanti, a restricted holiday. Being a holiday, govt offices and the stock markets are closed on Sunday.People aware of the development said that the Economic Survey would be presented on January 29. The next two days — January 30 and 31 — would be holidays. The first part of the budget session is likely to be for three weeks and the second part will last for four weeks.In 2025, February 1 fell on a Saturday and govt presented the interim budget that day. The Union budget had been presented on a Saturday before too, including in 1999 when then finance minister Yashwant Sinha, who read out the budget on February 27, a Saturday. This also marked the beginning of budget speech at 11 am instead of 5 pm, a departure from colonial practice.The 2026-27 budget is keenly awaited as it comes at a time of geopolitical tensions and under the shadow of Trump’s tariffs. Government is expected to unleash reform measures to shield growth and the country’s standing as one of the fastest growing major economies in the world .They added that the themes have been chosen considering govt’s focus to achieve the goal of a developed nation by undertaking major reforms to push growth against the backdrop of global challenges.TOI has also learnt that getting rid of the “mentality of slavery” and the thrust on “reform, perform and transform” are likely to be the central themes of the President’s address at the joint sitting of Parliament on Jan 28. Different ministries have been asked to give their inputs based on these themes for the President’s speech.Removing traces of colonialism has become the talking point for the govt since August 15, 2022, when PM Narendra Modi spoke about it from the ramparts of the Red Fort. This was also one of the five pledges (Panch Pran). “When we see even the smallest thing related to colonialism in us or around us, we have to be rid of it... Indians should shed ‘colonialism’ from their minds and habits,” PM Modi had said.","The budget session may start from Jan 28 with the President’s speech.

Ayodhya Faced Conspiracies But Sanatan Prevailed, UP CM Yogi Adityanath Says At Ram Temple Event

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday conducted a comprehensive review of the progress achieved so far under Mission Karmayogi and the forthcoming action plan.At a high-level meeting, detailed discussions were held on the implementation of the mission, training infrastructure, status of digital platforms and capacity-building initiatives across various departments. Chairperson of the Capacity Building Commission S Radha Chauhan presented a detailed action plan, the government said in a statement.Addressing the meeting, Adityanath said Mission Karmayogi is a transformative initiative of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aimed at developing competent human resources by integrating India's cultural values with a global outlook.He said the initiative is playing a decisive role in making governance more responsive, accountable and result-oriented, in line with future challenges.The chief minister was informed that Mission Karmayogi aims to connect more than three crore civil servants at the central level, nearly 2.2 crore personnel across states, and around 50 lakh personnel in urban local bodies and panchayati raj institutions with capacity-building initiatives.Under the mission, more than 790 government training institutions across the country are being strengthened and modernised.For continuous and comprehensive online training of civil servants, the iGOT (Integrated Government Online Training) digital platform has been established.Adityanath said all departments and government institutions should design need-based courses and upload those on the iGOT portal. He further instructed that a seven-day capacity building programme be made mandatory for all officers and employees and linked with their promotion and ACR.The chief minister also directed that all training centres operating in the state, including the UPAM, must develop capacity-building curricula in line with current requirements to enhance the functional efficiency of new trainees at the training centre level itself. He emphasised that artificial intelligence (AI) and cyber security must be mandatorily included in the curricula of all departments and government institutions.On the occasion, Adityanath highlighted that the ""Amrit Gyan Kosh"", the case study platform of iGOT, hosts case studies from across the world.He said Uttar Pradesh also has several best practices and case studies across departments, which should be uploaded on the platform.","Yogi Adityanath conducted a comprehensive review of the progress achieved so far under Mission Karmayogi.

NEW DELHI: Over 9,000 birds across 131 species were spotted along Yamuna floodplains in the capital during the Asian Waterbird Census this weekend.The survey, carried out by a group of nearly 20 birders in collaboration with eBird, an online avian database, flagged several ecological threats to the habitat, including illegal sand mining on the floodplains, predation by stray dogs, dumping of construction and demolition debris as well as plastic waste along the river.Four teams of birders surveyed a 22-km stretch from Wazirabad Barrage to Okhla Barrage. Black-headed gulls (2,500) dominated the count, followed by 1,700 barn swallows. Pied avocet (136), ruddy shelduck (112), white wagtail (108) and house sparrow (90) were also spotted.The birders highlighted habitat degradation of these birds because of removal of aquatic reeds, cultivation on the riverbed and open burning of waste along the bank. They also flagged declining water quality of the river because of sewage and agrochemical runoff.Pankaj Gupta, Delhi-NCR project coordinator of Asian Waterbird Census eBird, said, ""If the condition of Yamuna floodplains is not improved, there is likely to be a decline in the number of waterbirds in future.""Akash Gulalia, director of Amaltas Nature Walks, said that the river ecosystem faces a massive threat due to increasing agricultural land on the riverbed and rampant use of chemical fertiliser in them.""Cutting and clearing of aquatic and riparian vegetation has left little space for these birds to breed. Illegal mining is another major issue,"" said Gulalia.Apart from Yamuna floodplains, the birders will carry out surveys in smaller wetlands in north Delhi, including Rohini, later this month. Sultanpur, Chandu, Jhanjrola, Bhindawas, Dhigal, Mandothi, Okhla Bird Sanctuary, Surajpur, Dhanuari and Dadri wetlands will also be covered.The census is coordinated by Wetlands International, a global organisation that works to sustain and restore wetlands and their resources, and is carried out in several countries every January.","Four teams of birders surveyed a 22-km stretch from Wazirabad Barrage to Okhla Barrage.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Taking, in what it called, an important step towards environmental governance and reducing dependence on foreign certification systems, India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory here at the CSIR–National Physical Laboratory (NPL) that will develop requisite testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment in the country.Currently, most of the instruments used in India for air pollution monitoring are imported. These imported instruments, however, come with production certification from international agencies based on the environmental conditions of the certificate issuing countries.Since environmental conditions of those countries are very different from the conditions prevalent in India, it affects the quality of measurements by the instrument operating for a long time in Indian conditions, CSIR scientists explained. At present, only the UK has such a laboratory.The National Environmental Standard Laboratory, inaugurated by Union science & technology minister Jitendra Singh on 80th Foundation Day celebrations of CSIR–NPL on Monday, will now not only deal with the anomaly arising out of different environmental conditions but also help in manufacturing of standardised monitoring equipment.Domestic production of such instruments will eventually end India’s dependence on import and make it an exporting nation of such equipment to third world countries.The global market value of air pollution monitoring systems is, currently, estimated at $3,997 million.In addition, Singh also inaugurated the National Primary Standard Facility for Solar Cell Calibration, bringing India among a select group of global leaders in photovoltaic measurement standards. Both these facilities will enhance trust in data and drive investment in pollution monitoring and renewable energy.Describing the National Environmental Standard Laboratory as a “critical step towards strengthening India’s environmental governance framework”, Singh said that reliable, India-specific calibration and certification of air pollution monitoring systems was long overdue and would now enable transparent, traceable, and accurate environmental data.The facility will support regulatory bodies, industries, and startups by ensuring that monitoring instruments are tested under Indian climatic conditions. It will thus improve policy enforcement of various schemes including the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).Terming the facility for Solar Cell Calibration (Solar Energy Complex) a “future-ready facility”, Singh said it would reduce India’s dependence on foreign certification agencies, save foreign exchange, shorten turnaround time for calibration, and enhance investor confidence in the country’s rapidly expanding solar sector.","India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory.

NEW DELHI: Nearly three decades after Supreme Court’s Vishaka judgment mandating a mechanism against the sexual harassment of women at workplaces, it remains unimplemented by many high courts, including Calcutta, Patna, Orissa, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Allahabad and Uttarakhand.Appearing for PIL petitioner Geeta Rani, senior advocate Sonia Mathur told SC that, significantly, district courts in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, too, do not have any such mechanism. The bench sought status reports from registrar generals of the defaulting HCs, and bar associations and bar councils all over the country.The petitioner told the bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the absence of a gender-sensitised complaint-handling structure in many courts, bar associations and tribunals results in serious constitutional violations and discourages women from fully participating in the justice delivery process.“In several courts across the country, there is either no established internal redressal mechanism, or the mechanism is not duly notified, accessible or functional. Information about complaint procedures, responsible authorities, or grievance redressal channels is often unavailable or opaque,” she said. “Sensitisation and awareness among court administration, judicial staff, security personnel and lawyers also remain inadequate.This systemic deficiency exposes women to an unsafe environment and undermines their constitutional guarantees,” the petitioner said.In the Vishaka judgment in 1997, Supreme Court had laid down mandatory guidelines requiring all institutions, including courts, to establish mechanisms for prevention and redressal of sexual harassment at workplace, recognising women’s right to equality, dignity and a safe work environment under Article 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. In 2013, SC, in the Medha Kotwal Lele case, had reaffirmed and strengthened the Vishaka guidelines, and directed all institutions to ensure effective, independent and accessible complaint mechanisms to safeguard women’s rights at workplaces. In 2015, SC had constituted the Gender Sensitisation and Internal Complaints Committee for protection of female lawyers, employees, interns and litigants within court premises.The petitioner said, “The absence of similar mechanisms in HCs, district courts and tribunals results in unequal treatment of women lawyers across judicial Institutions and hence, violates Article 14. A constitutional standard available within SC must be replicated for every court of justice in the country.”","Nearly three decades after Supreme Court’s Vishaka judgment mandating a mechanism against the sexual harassment of women at workplaces, it remains unimplemented by many high courts.

Have authority to assess voter’s citizenship: Election Commission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/have-authority-to-assess-voters-citizenship-election-commission/articleshow/126384392.cms,"Effort to ensure no foreigner is included in electoral rolls : EC



NEW DELHI: Election Commission told Supreme Court Tuesday that the Constitution has cast the authority and duty on it to assess a person’s Indian citizenship prior to inclusion in the electoral roll to ensure foreigners do not vote.Arguing before a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi, EC, through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, repudiated petitioners’ assertion that determination of citizenship did not fall within the remit of the commission, and hence, only Aadhaar details would suffice for inclusion in the voters’ list during SIR in various states.Dwivedi traced the history of the “assessment of India citizenship” of voters for inclusion in electoral rolls to the Constituent Assembly debates and said the framers of the Constitution had unequivocally mandated EC to ensure that only Indian citizens were registered as voters.“It is evident that from its inception, the Constituent Assembly intended that authorities responsible for preparation of electoral rolls would enquire into citizenship and exclude those who were not citizens from the electoral rolls of constituencies, and later, EC was vested with plenary powers with respect to superintendence, direction, and control over all elections, as well as the power to verify the status of citizenship under Article 324 read with Article 326,” he said.Dwivedi said the Constitution is citizen-centric, and hence, insists that every elected representative and the heads of the three governing organs are citizens of India. It does not matter whether SIR detects one or hundreds of foreigners on state electoral rolls, he said and added that effort is to ensure no foreigner is included.On the validity of SIR, the counsel said elections cannot be free and fair unless electoral rolls are intensively revised from time to time. He said Article 324 of the Constitution envisaging “superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral rolls” included the constitutional mandate to revise the voters’ lists, particularly before general elections. “The nature of the revisional exercise is left to the discretion of EC and would depend upon the prevalent circumstances,” Dwivedi said, adding that intensive revision of electoral rolls would consider death and migration, and inclusion of new voters.Countering petitioners’ plea that only the Centre was entitled to inquire into citizenship, Dwivedi said, “The commission’s power to assess citizenship flows from Articles 324 and 326 of the Constitutions, read with Section 16 of the Representation of the People Act 1950.”He said the Union govt alone had the power to terminate citizenship or declare someone as a foreigner. However, EC can exclude a person from the voters’ list on finding him to be not a citizen of India, he added. “Under the SIR exercise, the citizenship of an individual for the purposes of Citizenship Act, 1955 will not terminate on account of the fact that s/he is held to be ineligible for registration in the electoral rolls,” Dwivedi said.“In so far as the burden to prove citizenship is concerned, the necessary documents required to establish citizenship are within the special knowledge of the individual claiming to be a citizen of India,” EC said, thus casting the burden on the person seeking his inclusion in the electoral roll to prove his citizenship. Arguments would continue Thursday.","Election Commission: Constitution has cast authority and duty on it to assess a person’s Indian citizenship prior to inclusion in the electoral roll.

NEW DELHI: About 2.9 crore electors, making up 18.7% of Uttar Pradesh’s 15.4 crore electorate as it stood at the launch of special intensive revision (SIR) in the state on Oct 27, 2025, have been struck off the state’s draft electoral roll published on Tuesday.UP’s draft electoral roll published following the enumeration phase of SIR-Phase 2 lists over 12.5 crore electors; while deleting 46.2 lakh (2.99%) on account of being deceased; 2.17 crore (14.1%) for having permanently shifted or found untraceable or absent during visits by the booth level officers (BLOs); and 25.5 lakh (1.6%) for being enrolled at multiple places.Sources further indicated that while the percentage of electors found permanently shifted from their polling areas in UP is around 8.4%, those marked as untraceable or absent are over 5.1%. An official said the higher rate of permanently shifted electors in UP (8.4%), as compared to Bihar (4.6%) may not be surprising, citing a Down to Earth survey from 2021 that put the overall migration rate for UP at around 28.4% as against 14.2% for Bihar. District-wise draft electoral rolls published on Tuesday show that Lucknow recorded the highest rate of deletions of permanently shifted electors (13.4%), followed by Ghaziabad (12.7%) and Meerut (11.6%).As per district-wise draft voter lists, the percentage of overall deletions in 22 of UP's 75 districts exceeds the state's average 18.7% deletions. These districts include Lucknow (with over 30% deletions), Ghaziabad (28.8%), Balrampur (almost 26%) and Kanpur Nagar (25.5%); the exclusions in the four districts amount to more than one-fourth of their total electorate as it stood on Oct 27, 2025. Meerut has recorded the least deletions at 9.9%, followed by Hamirpur at 10.8%. A study of deletions however shows no pattern on lines like the religious composition of districts or proximity to the international border.A statement put out by the UP chief electoral officer (CEO) on Tuesday explained that the BLOs did not find the ‘deleted’ electors or did not get back their enumeration forms because they “have shifted permanently to somewhere else from their previous place of residence; were found missing or absent from the concerned polling area, or somehow did not submit the form, till Dec 26, 2025”.The statement however added that genuine electors excluded from the draft roll can still be added back during the claims and objection period from Jan 6 to Feb 6, 2026 by filling up Form-6 along with the declaration form and submitting relevant documents to prove their eligibility.“The name of the electors found enrolled at multiple places in electoral rolls will be retained only at one place,” said the UP CEO.The notice period, covering hearings and verification, will stretch from Jan 6 to Feb 27, 2026, followed by publication of the final electoral roll of the state on March 6, 2026.Electors wanting to check the names in UP draft electoral roll may refer to the copy available with local BLO or visit the ECINet app or website of the UP CEO or ECI.Meanwhile, young electors who have attained 18 years of age on or before 01.01.2026 are being encouraged to apply through Form-6 along with the prescribed declaration form and relevant documents. So far 15.8 lakh Form 6 (with or without declaration) have been collected across UP for inclusion of new electors.Booth-level lists of electors reported as deceased, permanently migrated, untraceable, or whose forms were not received have already been shared with the parties’ booth level agents (BLAs) for verification. Printed and digital booth-wise copies have been provided to all recognised parties and also made available on the CEO’s website.The entire election machinery, supported by volunteers, is assisting electors, particularly senior citizens, persons with disabilities and vulnerable groups.As per Para 5(b) of SIR guidelines, no name shall be deleted from the draft roll without notice and a speaking order by the electoral registration officer (ERO)/Assistant ERO. Any aggrieved elector may seek redressal through a two-stage appeal process, first by approaching the district magistrate and finally the state CEO.EC on Tuesday reiterated “its firm commitment to a transparent, participative and inclusive revision process, ensuring that no eligible elector is left out and no ineligible name remains in the electoral roll”.EC is undertaking SIR exercise in UP, along with others 11 states/UTs covered in Phase 2. ""with full transparency at every stage of the process,” said a spokesperson.A total of 12.5 crore of UP’s 15.4 crore of electors submitted their enumeration forms till the last date of enumeration period i.e., 26.12.2025 “reflecting an overwhelming participation in the first leg of SIR,” UP CEO office said on Tuesday.It attributed the successful completion of enumeration phase to the coordinated efforts of district election officers (DEOs) of all 75 districts, 403 EROs, 2,042 AEROs (AEROs) and BLOs deployed at over 1.6 lakh polling booths, supported by volunteers. Field representatives of all recognised political parties, including their district presidents and 5.7 lakh BLAs, also played their part.To ensure universal awareness and participation during the enumeration period, the state CEO, DEOs and EROs conducted extensive awareness campaigns and held multiple meetings with political parties to explain the process and share the progress updates. BLOs conducted booth-level meetings with BLAs, who were allowed to file up to 50 enumeration forms per day to ensure their active involvement in SIR.BLOs carried out house-to-house visits to all electors whose names were in the electoral roll as on 27.10.2025 to distribute enumeration forms, followed by at least three visits for collection.",UP’s draft electoral roll published following the enumeration phase of SIR-Phase 2 lists over 12.5 crore electors.

NEW DELHI: To enhance civil-military cooperation and improve the quality of life in remote border areas, the Indian Army has constructed a 10-KW solar power plant in north Sikkim and a water storage facility in Arunachal Pradesh.“Trishakti Corps of the Indian Army has established a 10-KW solar power plant at Muguthang village, North Sikkim”, located at an altitude of around 15,000 feet near the China border, an official statement said. “Reliable electricity has enabled year-round habitation and improved safety in this remote border village,” it said.Muguthang is a sparsely populated border village with 32 residents from 10 families. The plant has improved night-time safety, enhancing connectivity and eliminating the need for seasonal migration during the harsh winter months. Earlier, due to the absence of a dependable power supply, villagers relied on small personal solar panels and were compelled to migrate to other areas for nearly 5-6 months every year, leaving behind their homes and livestock.In Arunachal Pradesh, Army troops from Spear Corps have constructed a log hut with water storage facility at Ojugo village in Taksing, Upper Subansiri district.The newly constructed facility will provide essential shelter and assured water availability. “The initiative under Operation Sadbhavana ensures basic amenities in remote areas, benefiting local villagers and graziers,” Spear Corps posted on X.Also, the Army on Monday flagged off an eco-tourism exposure tour from Along Military Station, Arunachal, marking a significant step towards youth empowerment and sustainable development in the border regions.Prior to the tour, a comprehensive three-day homestay and eco-tourism training capsule was conducted at Aalo, during which 30 students and two instructors were familiarised with the fundamentals of community-based tourism, responsible travel practices, and the economic potential of eco-tourism in Arunachal.In Manipur, Red Shield Division under SpearCorps inaugurated a textile unit and Yarn Bank at Nungkot, empowering Kom women weavers through skill training and livelihood support. A visit to IDP Camp Lamlai was also organised and raw material for handloom and tailoring units were distributed.","The Indian Army has constructed a 10-KW solar power plant in north Sikkim and a water storage facility in Arunachal Pradesh.

NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at protecting patients as artificial intelligence increasingly enters healthcare, govt has brought AI-based cancer detection and diagnostic software under formal regulatory oversight, treating them on a par with medical devices.According to a notification issued by Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), software that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect or diagnose cancer by analysing X-rays, CT scans and other medical images will now be regulated as Class C medical devices, a category reserved for moderate-to-high risk products.The decision means that such AI tools — already being used in some hospitals and diagnostic centres — will require official approval, safety validation and ongoing monitoring before widespread clinical use. Developers will also have to follow quality standards and report any problems linked to patient safety.Welcoming the move, Dr Pallavi Shukla, associate professor of Preventive Oncology at AIIMS New Delhi, said a clear regulatory framework is essential to ensure ethical use of AI and protect patients. While AI shows promise in cancer screening — particularly for cervical, lung and breast cancers — she noted that most such tools in India remain in the research phase due to limited Indian datasets and are not yet ready for routine clinical application.The regulatory step, she said, is timely and beneficial as it will provide oversight of a rapidly evolving field before wider adoption.Health experts said the move is significant as AI tools increasingly influence decisions on cancer screening and diagnosis. Officials added the step could set a precedent for bringing other AI-based medical devices and software under formal regulatory oversight as their clinical role expands.India has seen a rapid rise in startups offering AI-driven cancer screening solutions, often claiming early detection benefits. Regulators said the framework intends to ensure such claims are scientifically validated and patient safety is not compromised. The risk classification list, CDSCO said, will be reviewed periodically as technology evolves.","Software that uses artificial intelligence to detect or diagnose cancer will now be regulated as Class C medical devices.

OUP India said in a notice published in newspapers Tuesday that certain references on pages 31, 33, 34 and 93 of the book were found to be unverified and that it regretted that the contentious portions went through undetected at the time of publication.Based on a complaint filed by Bhosale, a court had initiated criminal defamation proceedings on April 2, 2005, under Section 500 (defamation) of the IPC against OUP India’s Sayeed Manzar Khan and three others.They appealed in the high court, which referred the matter to its Kolhapur bench.

Clara Rivera’s joint philanthropy activities and the couple’s net worth





Mariano Rivera won and left an everlasting legacy through his performance and conduct on the field. The influence of Rivera cannot be measured in terms of his game. His humility, faith, and generosity are qualities that very few people possess; thus, he is not only a Yankees legend, but also a global sports icon. His wife, Clara Rivera contributes to their net worth through her joint philanthropic acts. For the couple, philanthropy and the sports career walks hand in hand.Mariano’s total career income, endorsements, and post-retirement undertakings have caught the attention of people and have been estimated to range from $80 million to $90 million. While Clara Rivera was not a public figure as such, she has been a constant partner in the management of their wealth and family. Besides, they have made sure that Rivera’s memory will survive not only through the field but also through their investments in real estate, business, and anywhere else that continues to be a source of financial stability for the long term.Rivera’s image as “The Sandman” created a huge market for him, and his diligent method of finances aided him to keep his wealth even after retirement in 2013. Unlike many athletes who face difficulties after their careers are over, Rivera’s meticulous planning combined with Clara’s backing has made it possible for them to not just retain but also increase their wealth.Clara has been instrumental in the transfer of resources from the Mariano Rivera Foundation to the educational, scholarship, and youth empowerment sectors. The common pledge of the couple to giving back is manifested in their values, with Clara often taking a more active part in community projects. She contributed immensely to her husband's wealth.Mariano and Clara Rivera are extremely kind-hearted benefactors, particularly through a Foundation, which emphasizes education, youth empowerment, and community development, among others.

While Hilton clarified that such actions do not align with the company's ethos, both the hotel management and Hilton expressed regret and reaffirmed their dedication to inclusivity.

'Tried To Crush ICE Agents': DHS JUSTIFIES Shooting Of 'ILLEGAL ALIENS' In Maryland





The Hampton Inn by Hilton in Lakeville, Minnesota, which recently refused reservations to ICE and DHS agents, was purchased last year by four Indian partners, according to public records.The hotel was bought for $15 million through an LLC owned by Parmjit Singh, Amanpreet Hundal, Karandeep Nagra, and Mohinderjeet Kaur, according to filings with the Minnesota secretary of state.The incident stirred a row after emails shared on social media by DHS and ICE alleged that staff at the hotel told federal officers their reservations would not be accepted.One email stated said: “We have noticed an influx of GOV reservations made today that have been for DHS, and we are not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property.”Another added: “Please pass on this info to your coworkers that we are not allowing any immigration agents to house on our property.”A Hilton spokesperson told FOX Business that the hotel is independently owned and that the actions described do not reflect Hilton’s values.“Hilton hotels serve as welcoming places for all. This hotel is independently owned and operated, and the actions referenced are not reflective of Hilton values,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson added that the staff have already apologised for their behaviour: “We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologised for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies. They have taken immediate action to resolve this matter. Hilton’s position is clear: Our properties are open to everyone and we do not tolerate any form of discrimination.”The management company operating the hotel, Everpeak Hospitality, also released a statement affirming its commitment to welcoming all guests and following brand standards and applicable laws: “We are in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated. We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologise to those impacted.”The dispute shows a long-standing policy of Hilton Hotels. In 2020, the company publicly opposed using its properties in connection with immigration detention and reinforced the stance across its US hotels.DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin criticised Hilton’s actions, saying, “Hilton has launched a coordinated campaign in Minneapolis to REFUSE service to DHS law enforcement. When officers attempted to book rooms using official government emails and rates, Hilton Hotels maliciously CANCELLED their reservations. This is UNACCEPTABLE.”The matter remains under investigation by Hilton, which has said it is working with the hotel to ensure compliance with its policies.","Hampton Inn by Hilton in Lakeville, Minnesota, recently refused reservations to ICE and DHS agents.

Biden Fumbles “America” in Onstage Slip, Triggering Waves of Mockery and Renewed Scrutiny

Why Biden’s retirement package is historically unusual and how it funds his operations for life

How much do Presidents and Congress members get in pensions





The career politics of former US President Joe Biden have given him the experience to retire with the highest government-funded retirement package ever given to a US President. This is worth $417,000 annually compared to his current salary package as President, worth $400,000. According to Demian Brady, the Vice President at the National Taxpayer Union Foundation , former President Biden’s career experience gave him a chance to retire under two separate retirement plans at the same time due to his roles as a senator, a vice President, and a President. This is twice the retirement package former US President Barack Obama receives.As reported, the income that Biden will receive during his retirement comes from two different sources. First, the income for the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) was calculated depending on the 44 years he had served as a senator and the vice president. His three highest years of income were also taken into account. Brady estimates the income for the CSRS to be at $166,374 a year, with an additional payment of $18,186 to cover the spousal benefit. Without the CSRS restriction on the payment to 80% of the highest paid salary, he would have earned more than 254,000 dollars.The second source would be the Former Presidents Act of 1958, where the presidential pension would be equivalent to that of a Cabinet secretary, at present $250,600 per annum. Moreover, the act also takes care of providing office space and office personnel, office equipment, and travel expenses for free for a lifetime.Brady explains the nature of Biden’s pension by stating that his retirement compensation package is “historically unusual,” stating that very few former presidents have been able to reap the benefits of two prominent retirement systems ever in the nation’s history. The fact that Biden, in addition to his experience in the Senate and his vice presidency, served a complete presidential term gives the retired president the ability to benefit beyond the current sitting president’s salary.Apart from money for the pension, Biden gets quite a lot of money to finance operations for life. For the financial year 2026, the General Services Administration allocated over $1.5 million to finance operations for his office, including $727,000 for office space without any limit to size and location. This takes care of all operational expenditure, as well as employees and office equipment. Brady has expressed reservations that younger presidents, like Obama, should enjoy offices for life that can be used to write a book or land a speaking engagement, as Obama did later in life.As reported, Biden’s generous pension package has reignited debate about retirement benefits for senators and representatives financed by taxpayers. This year, in 2025, a Senate bill titled the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act has been proposed by Sen. Joni Ernst to limit the retirement package to $200,000. An earlier form of the act was passed by Congress in 2016 but was vetoed by President Obama, who would have enjoyed the same benefits, raising questions about fairness, fiscal responsibility, precedent, and long-term policy implications.The issue also goes beyond the presidents alone. Each member of Congress is eligible for a federal pension after five years of service at a cost of around $38 million a year. Controversial ones include Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who retired after meeting the requisite eligibility, earning her a pension of $8,717 a year, in comparison to Rep. Nancy Pelosi's $107,860 a year. Still, Rep. Greene could earn over $265,000 in her lifetime.","Former US President Joe Biden has the highest government-funded retirement package ever given to a US President.

When Amazon founder Jeff Bezos agreed that AI is in an 'industrial bubble' with investors who ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-agreed-that-ai-is-in-an-industrial-bubble-with-investors-who-/articleshow/126354742.cms,"‘AI is for real’



Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ However, he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

""Right after we acquired Blinkit, I asked him (Albinder) to leave. I told him, 'You will not be able to cut it.' He said okay. This happened twice during that timeframe, and we started the transition,""

""All of us have this armour. And when patient coaching runs out, I penetrate this armour. Me being angry is also because I care,""

What is Eternal CEO Deepinder Goyal said about ‘rock bottom phase’



""rock bottom""

""I call this rock bottom, where I hurt people, their self-confidence completely goes for a toss. I do this with people who I think have insane potential, but something in their head is coming in their way,

""

""Over time, the success rate of this is four out of five, where they come out of it,”





Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato 's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the food delivery service acquired Blinkit. Goyal explained that this move was part of his tough leadership reset method. Speaking on a video podcast with Raj Shamani, Goyal noted that these conversations took place soon after the acquisition of the quick commerce startup, when Dhindsa was struggling to adapt to the changes required after the integration.Goyal said on the podcast.These remarks offer a rare public look at how Goyal handles senior leadership changes at Eternal, which owns both Zomato and Blinkit, especially when founders or top executives need to adapt to a new company structure after an acquisition. Goyal explained his leadership style involves extended periods of coaching, but if no progress is made, he confronts the person directly.he noted.The situation reveals the challenges that can arise when successful startup founders join larger organisations through acquisitions and must adjust their working style to fit the new company's expectations.Describing what he calls aphase, Goyal said he sometimes purposely breaks down a leader's confidence to make them start fresh.he explained.According to Goyal, this method has worked most of the time.he added.However, Goyal did not confirm whether Dhindsa's job or duties officially changed during this time. Still, his comments show how intense the process was of bringing Blinkit into Eternal, especially as the company was growing both Blinkit and Zomato while facing more competition in quick commerce.Zomato bought Blinkit, which was previously known as Grofers, in 2022 for Rs 4,447 crore, or about $568 million at the time, in an all-stock deal. This marked Zomato's official entry into India's rapidly growing quick commerce business. Since buying the company, Blinkit has become a key growth area for Eternal, opening many new stores and handling more and more orders.","Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the acquisition of Blinkit.

$45 billion worth of IPO lock-ins expiring over next few months; short-term volatility likely: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/45-billion-worth-of-ipo-lock-ins-expiring-over-next-few-months-short-term-volatility-likely-report/articleshow/126386424.cms,"Representative image

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

A massive $45 billion worth of IPO lock-in periods are set to expire between January 6 and April 30, affecting 96 newly listed companies, according to a Nuvama report. This means pre-IPO shareholders, including promoters and early investors, will be free to sell their shares in the open market, potentially causing short-term price movements.The report, cited by ANI, tracked all shareholders and companies listed up to January 4. While the total value of shares becoming free to trade is significant, not all shares are expected to be sold since many are held by company promoters and their group entities.Several companies will see their lock-in periods end in the coming month. Meesho leads the pack with 110 million shares (2% of total shares) becoming tradeable on January 7. On the same day, Aequs will have 17 million shares (2%) and Vidya Wires will have 9 million shares (4%) freed up for trading.The following weeks will see more companies reaching their lock-in expiry dates. Nephrocare Health Services will have two separate expiries- 2 million shares on January 9 and 3 million shares on January 14. CORONA Remedies and Wakefit Innovations will see their lock-ins expire on January 12, followed by Park Medi World on January 14.Later in January, ICICI Pru AMC will have 7 million shares (1%) released on January 16, KSH International will see 3 million shares (4%) become tradeable on January 19, and Gujarat Kidney & Super Speciality's lock-in will expire on January 27.Market experts suggested that investors should watch these dates carefully. When lock-ins expire, more shares become available for trading. If too many early investors decide to cash out simultaneously, it could temporarily push stock prices down. This makes lock-in expiry dates important for everyday investors who should be prepared for possible price changes during these periods.","A massive $45 billion worth of IPO lock-in periods are set to expire between January 6 and April 30.

Who is Tina Shah





Indian American physician Dr Tina Shah has entered the race for the Democratic nomination in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District, becoming the only Indian American among several Democrats seeking the party ticket.“I am so proud of the support our campaign has earned,” Shah said in a statement quoted by New Jersey Globe. “New Jerseyans want leaders who put patients over industry profits. Our campaign is about serving working families, not special interests,” she said.If elected, Shah would be the first Indian American to represent New Jersey in the US Congress. Indian Americans currently hold only a few seats in the House of Representatives, a number that does not reflect the size of the community. New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District, which includes several suburban areas with a large Indian American population, is expected to be a closely watched race with national implications for control of Congress.Shah has taken aim at the incumbent Republican lawmaker, Tom Kean Jr, calling him a career politician who is out of touch with people in the district.She has also been openly critical of President Donald Trump’s approach to healthcare.Her campaign is also shaped by her background as a second-generation Indian American. She has spoken about her parents coming to North America in search of opportunity and a better life.Her campaign has reported strong early fundraising. In a statement on Tuesday, her team said Shah had raised $1,017,000, crossing the $1 million mark. The campaign said its focus is on lowering costs for families, protecting reproductive rights and expanding access to healthcare.Dr. Tina Shah is a triple board-certified doctor in internal medicine, pulmonary medicine and critical care. Alongside her clinical work, she has held senior policy roles under three US administrations.As a senior adviser to the US surgeon general, she helped shape the federal government’s first plan to address clinician burnout. At the department of veterans affairs, she served as the agency’s first national director of clinician wellbeing, where her work focused on improving electronic medical records and expanding access to primary care for veterans.She later moved to the private sector and became the first chief clinical officer of a healthcare-focused artificial intelligence company. There, she worked on cutting administrative work so doctors and nurses could spend more time with patients.","Dr Tina Shah is a triple board-certified doctor in internal medicine, pulmonary medicine and critical care.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
