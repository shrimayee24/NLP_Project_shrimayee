"'India ain't football you kick around': Ex-Pentagon official Rubin on ties with Canada; calls Khalistan, Nijjar issue 'Trudeau's fictions'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-aint-football-you-kick-around-ex-pentagon-official-rubin-on-ties-with-canada-calls-khalistan-nijjar-issue-trudeaus-fictions/articleshow/121766861.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ex-Pentagon official Michael Rubin criticised Justin Trudeau 's approach towards India and said that it was ""not a football which you kick around but an ally you strive to embrace"". Terming the Khalistan and Hardeep Singh Nijjar issues- the core reasons behind souring of India-Canada ties- ""Trudeau's fictions"", Rubin appreciated Mark Carney for making an effort to rebuild ties with India.""India is not a football which you kick around. It is an ally to be embraced"", Rubin said in an exclusive interview with ANI.""The grievances about Hardeep Singh Nijjar and the Khalistan movement were not real. They were exaggerations that Justin Trudeau amplified...Justin Trudeau may have wanted so much to appease radical Sikh extremists in various constituencies that he was willing to take an organised crime hit between various Sikh groups and mafias and blame an outside power for it, rather than acknowledge the problem and the fault was Canada's alone. That is Justin Trudeau's problem. But now that Justin Trudeau is gone and likely will never return to power, Prime Minister Carney is taking a sober approach and recognising that he is not going to be tied to Justin Trudeau's fictions,"" he added.Contrasting Trudeau's approach towards India with that of current Canadian PM Mark Carney's, he said, ""Mark Carney is working on repairing the relationship rather than following Justin Trudeau down the rabbit hole already shows that Prime Minister Carney is a much more serious person than the former Prime Minister of Canada...Canadanow needs to demonstrate its good faith.""""Canada's relationship with India, especially under Justin Trudeau, was not principled. It was all virtue signalling and politics. The fact of the matter is that India is crucial to Canada, and Canada needs to decide whether ultimately it's going to side with the democracies like India and the United States, or whether it's going to posture the way Justin Trudeau did and allow China, which also has significant interests in Canada,"" he added.Talking about Carney's invite to PM Narendra Modi for G7 summit, Rubin said, ""Canadian PM Mark Carney originally was a banker. He understands the importance of India. Justin Trudeau was a politician who peddled in image and imagination, and therefore it makes sense that Carney wants to restore maturity to the relationship.""""It makes sense for Prime Minister Modi to show that the problem was not Canada itself, but the immaturity and unprofessionalism of Justin Trudeau,"" he added.Canada will host the upcoming G7 summit from June 15 to 17, gathering the world's top industrialized nations—France, Germany, Italy, the UK, Japan, the US, and Canada—alongside the EU and international bodies such as the IMF, World Bank, and UN. The summit will focus on key global issues, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and rising tensions in West Asia.","Ex-Pentagon official Michael Rubin criticised Justin Trudeau's approach towards India and said that it was ""not a football which you kick around but an ally you strive to embrace"" Rubin appreciated Mark Carney for making an effort to rebuild ties with India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121767061,imgsize-759895,width-400,resizemode-4/121767061.jpg"
"India crosses the Rubicon with Op Sindoor but challenges remain; a riveting, action-packed year awaits Modi 3.0",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-riveting-action-packed-year-awaits-modi-3-0-on-the-diplomatic-front/articleshow/121765702.cms,"The first year of Modi 3.0 will be remembered most for Operation Sindoor that followed the Pahalgam terrorist attack, thrusting Pakistan back to the centre stage of Indian foreign policy. By striking terrorist infrastructure deep inside Pakistan, India imposed unprecedented costs upon Islamabad for its support to cross-border terrorism but also raised the stakes for the international community’s indulgence of Pakistan’s duplicity in addressing a core Indian concern.The year also saw milestones being delivered like the India-UK FTA and the India-EU end-of-2025 deadline set by both sides for a similar agreement that the EU has described as the largest deal of its kind anywhere in the world. PM Narendra Modi’s visit to the US within a month of President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, along with the launch of negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement, was also one of the high points.There were other foreign policy pluses, none perhaps more significant than the breakthrough with China in the form of the successful settlement of the 5-year-old border standoff. The thaw in the relationship after the Modi-Xi meeting in October in Russia saw India resuming bilateral visits to Beijing and agreeing on a host of measures to normalize ties.Among the highlights was the upgrade in ties with the Taliban with the first political contact in the form of external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s talks with the acting Afghan foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi. PM Narendra Modi also garnered international attention for his back-to-back visits to Russia and Ukraine, during which he stressed the importance of direct talks to end the war – something the 2 sides are engaged in currently.However, many of these foreign policy hits remain an unfinished business and will test India’s resolve in the new year. On Pakistan, the challenge will be to ensure the global community, particularly the UN Security Council where Pakistan is a member, shows understanding about the punitive terms India has set out in the “new normal” against Pakistan-sponsored cross-border terrorism. This will be critical in the event of another terrorist attack from across the LoC. The all-party delegations have made a beginning but there’s more to be done, while being mindful of the risks of India-Pakistan re-hyphenation that such an exercise might entail.Managing the relationship with the US will be another pressing challenge in the 2nd year of Modi 3.0. This has arisen unexpectedly from Trump’s constant needling of India on bilateral trade and perhaps even more damaging utterances on the India-Pakistan conflict, like his use of the term mediation – a big taboo in Indian foreign policy lexicon - and his drawing an equivalence between India and Pakistan. India is hoping that not just the US but also its other Quad partners will be more liberal in their support for India on cross-border terrorism, like in the form of a joint statement when the foreign ministers and leaders meet this year.The third significant challenge in the next few months will be to decide whether it’s time to reinforce the improvement in ties with Beijing by resuming direct air and normal visa services with China and, more importantly, with a visit to the country by Modi for the SCO summit. Despite China’s ties with Pakistan acting as a deterrent, especially in a supercharged atmosphere with Pakistan, India has kept the door open for continued engagement, with CDS Anil Chauhan recently declaring that “there’s no definitive proof of real-time targeting support” from China to Pakistan during the conflict.Modi has also shown interest in rebuilding ties with Canada by accepting his counterpart Mark Carney’s delayed invitation for the G7 but this will be subject to Ottawa’s handling of Khalistan separatists and also the probe into the Hardeep Nijjar murder that wrecked the relationship. Signs of improvement in Pakistan-Taliban ties and the proposal to expand CPEC into Afghanistan might pose a few problems too. All in all, a riveting, action-packed year is what awaits Modi 3.",The first year of Modi 3.0 will be remembered most for Operation Sindoor that followed the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India imposed unprecedented costs upon Islamabad for its support to cross-border terrorism. The breakthrough with China in the form of the successful settlement of the 5-year-old border standoff was also significant.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121765711,imgsize-1249119,width-400,resizemode-4/121765711.jpg"
"Modi government at 11: Operation Sindoor a success, but defence budget needs to go up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-government-at-11-operation-sindoor-a-success-but-defence-budget-needs-to-go-up/articleshow/121765634.cms,"With the deep military collusiveness between Pakistan and China being rudely reinforced during Operation Sindoor , India needs to raise its annual defence budget to at least 2.5% of GDP, impart a greater thrust to self-reliance in military R&D and production, and invest heavily in unmanned aerial systems, long-range weapons, space-based systems, electronic warfare and other such tech that will be decisive in future warfare.Modi govt will have to contend with the now well-fused two-front challenge along our long unresolved borders, which will see China continue to use Pakistan as a more than willing proxy to bog India down in South Asia.China is, and will remain, India's main strategic threat in the years ahead. ""India will have to tackle a superpower (China), which will also actively continue to support a near-peer military adversary (Pakistan) against us. We need to continue bolstering both our conventional and nuclear deterrence,"" a top military officer told TOI.The wide array of Chinese weapons and sensor-shooter networks used by Pakistan during the May 7-10 hostilities, ranging from J-10 fighters firing the PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to HQ-9 air defence missile batteries, make this quite evident. It's only going to get worse, with Pakistan on course to acquire at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation stealth jets and even the formidable HQ-19 long-range air defence missile systems from China.Despite competing demands from other crucial developmental sectors, India simply cannot let its defence budget languish at just about 1.9% of GDP. The bulk of the allocation, as of now, is gobbled up by the huge salary and pension bill as well as operational sustenance, leaving barely 25% for concrete military modernisation. ""Emergency procurements approved by govt are more than welcome to plug immediate operational gaps, but the overall budget needs a sharp hike,"" another officer said.There is also no getting away from the fact that genuine 'Atmanirbharta' in defence production with a much greater role for the private sector, instead of the present half-hearted measures, is critical for systematically building potent capabilities across the spectrum, ensuring adequate war-wastage reserves and surge capacities in crisis situations. ""It's critical for retaining strategic autonomy. India will have to fight its battles alone or largely on its own,"" the top officer said.The indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter called the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), for instance, needs to be majorly fast-tracked after the defence ministry last month finally approved a new ""programme execution model"" for prototype development.The long, meandering developmental history of the fourth-generation Tejas, which began way back in 1983, cannot be repeated. The IAF is still waiting to get the first Tejas Mark-1A 'improved' fighter. Similarly, indigenous development of 110 Kilonewton engines, with or without foreign collaboration, to power AMCA is critical. IAF is currently grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets) when 42.5 are authorised.Then, there are drones and standoff weapons, which have revolutionised the nature of modern-day combat. From low cross-section loitering munitions and swarm drones to FPV (first person view) drones and UCAVs (unmanned combat aerial vehicles), all need to be produced in India in large numbers.The sheer operational utility of a robust multi-layered air defence also came to the fore during Operation Sindoor, with India using Russian S-400 'Triumf' surface-to-air missile systems (380-km interception range), Barak-8 medium range SAM systems (70-km, jointly developed with Israel), the indigenous Akash systems (25-km) and several short-range systems to thwart multiple drone and missile attacks by Pakistan.Towards this end, DRDO needs to complete its ongoing development of the very short-range air defence system missiles, which have a 6-km range, and the long-range system under Project Kusha, with a 350-km range, on a war footing.Amid all this, long-pending systemic defence reforms like slashing the non-operational flab in the 15-lakh strong armed forces, streamlining long-winded procurement procedures and setting up unified theatre commands for an integrated war-fighting machinery in a cost effective manner, cannot fall by the wayside.","China is, and will remain, India's main strategic threat in the years ahead. India simply cannot let its defence budget languish at just about 1.9% of GDP. The bulk of the allocation, as of now, is gobbled up by the huge salary and pension bill as well as operational sustenance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121765665,imgsize-1759781,width-400,resizemode-4/121765665.jpg"
Modi at 11: PM increases vitality gap with opposition as new challenges loom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-at-11-pm-increases-vitality-gap-with-opposition-as-new-challenges-loom/articleshow/121765620.cms,"One year ago, when Narendra Modi began his record-equalling third term, the mood in BJP and the larger saffron fraternity was far from that of unalloyed celebration. Contrary to the near-total consensus that BJP would surpass its 2019 score of 303, the party's tally had dropped to a modest 240, forcing it to depend on the support of TDP and JD(U) to form the govt. Instantly, commentary was rife that the law of diminishing returns had finally caught up with the man who had defied the capriciousness of public sentiment as well as the headwinds and vicissitudes which had, quite predictably, marked his 10 years, not just to maintain but to improve his standing with the voter.True to himself, Modi struck a sunny note, focusing on the positive takeaways from the less-than-satisfactory outcome. But that was not enough to quell the doubts gnawing at supporters. Rivals, of course, were jubilant, not letting their third consecutive defeat come in the way of celebrations.But it did not take long for the pall of uncertainty to lift. BJP's victories in Maharashtra, Haryana and Delhi proved wrong those who had rushed to write the obituaries. It failed to form a govt in Jammu and Kashmir, but its performance in Jammu was yet another indication of its superiority over Congress in straight contests: something that the defeat in Jharkhand could not erase.Several factors contributed to the outcomes. But Modi's continuing popularity was, unarguably, the common thread. Together, they also showed that the opposition, particularly, had drawn disproportionate conclusions from the setback in the Lok Sabha polls. Also, the gambits, for instance, the unsubstantiated charge about a conspiracy to abolish quotas or the consolidation of Muslims in favour of the opposition, may not necessarily be all-weather winners.Modi, keeping any disappointment over the dip in numbers to himself, had started his third innings on a brisk note, in any case. The electoral wins came as an impetus, countering the hope of opponents and the fear of supporters that his dependence on allies, both of whom were tough bargainers, would force him to govern with one hand tied behind his back. The enactment of the Waqf Bill is a prime example. Both TDP and JD(U) supported the legislation, dubbed communal by the opposition, which tried to bait them into breaking ranks with BJP by saying that the stands of N Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar would be a litmus test of their secular credentials. Changes in the waqf law affect powerful interests among Muslims far more directly than the abrogation of J&K's special status. Understandably, the lobbying against the move was more intense, often threatening to match the feverish heights last seen over the Shah Bano case and the Babri demolition.If Naidu and Nitish stayed firm, it was because of the simple calculation that Modi's enduring appeal would more than compensate for any loss of Muslim support they still had.There is no sign yet of the opposition closing the vitality gap that Modi has opened up. It is 11 years since he took over, but he has not stopped taking either initiatives or plotting counter-manoeuvres to disrupt opposition's plans. The decision on caste census is a classic example of Modi coming up with a move which the rival had not anticipated. With this single move, he undercut Rahul Gandhi's effort over the years to cast himself as a social justice warrior. That it came in the wake of Pahalgam only added to the audacity.Operation Sindoor only served to strengthen Brand Modi. India won this round decisively, with satellite images of the losses inflicted by the Indian Air Force deep inside Pakistan and the destruction of the hostile neighbour's strategic bases providing tell-tale evidence. No amount of scorekeeping of losses, both real and imaginary, and the embrace of US President Donald Trump's claim to have brokered the 'ceasefire' can take away from this. Looked at purely through the prism of politics, it has recharged the PM's 'jo kaha so kiya' persona and, given the performance of indigenous weapons systems, should put an end to the mocking of his 'Make-in-India' ambition.The military confrontation and its aftermath have seen justified criticism of the outlandish claims made by ultra-zealous individuals on social media and in a few newsrooms. But what has gone unnoticed is the readiness of society to back him to the hilt, regardless of what turn a conflict between two nuclear-armed adversaries might take. Starting with Uri in 2016 and through Balakot, Modi had single-handedly created a new national resolve, which speaks to the people's trust in him.The 'surrender' charge does not seem to bother the Prime Minister. Otherwise, he would not have accepted the invitation to attend the G-7 meeting in Canada, where Trump will loom large.The coming days will not be easy. In Bihar, he will have to strain hard to offset Nitish's incumbency. Global volatility, Trump's tariff war, the general uncertainty that he has generated, and the possibility that Pakistan's military-jihadi complex may try to avenge their humiliation: all these add up to a challenging task. The BJP organisation has not been in good shape for quite some time. A reorganisation has been delayed, putting him and his trusted associate Amit Shah under strain. But don't be surprised if he negotiates them well. He has a proven track record, dating back to 2002 when he took over as chief minister of Gujarat, as well as the crucial wherewithal in the form of a reservoir of goodwill.","One year ago, when Narendra Modi began his record-equalling third term, the mood in BJP and the larger saffron fraternity was far from that of unalloyed celebration.

Gold price prediction today: Amidst ongoing US-China trade deal talks, gold prices are likely to continue fluctuating, with geo-political uncertainties adding to volatility. Where are gold prices headed in the short-term and what are the factors that investors need to watch out for?Top trade deputies of the US and China began their talks in London on Monday. Gold gained on Monday on a weaker US Dollar. MCX August gold contract was at Rs 97200, up 0.16% on the day.Earlier, spot gold prices fell 1.25% to close at $3310 on Friday as the US non-farm payroll report (May) came in somewhat better than expected, though details were not so encouraging.Easing US-China trade tensions pressurized the yellow metal further. Despite falling for two straight days on June 5 and June 6, the metal closed nearly 0.63% higher on a weekly basis in the week ending June 6.The metal rose to $3403 on June 5 --highest since May 8- as traders piled into the metal on safe haven demand as US-China tensions escalated.US Treasury Secretary Bessent, Commerce Secretary Lutnick and US Trade Representative Greer met a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng Monday at London's Lancaster House. Presence of high-profile officials in Trump's Team reflects willingness of the US administration to allow some relaxations in the US exports to China, which may include technical supplies, jet engine parts, etc. China, in turn, is expected to ease rare earth exports to the US.Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 88.394MOz as of June 6. ETF holdings witnessed net inflows for the second consecutive week following net outflows for five straight weeks. ETF holdings are up around 6.70% YTD.China's inflation data released Monday showed that China's CPI (May) declined 0.1% y-o-y vs the forecast of -0.2%. It was the fourth straight monthly decline as the Chinese economy continues to struggle with sluggish demand amid a raging trade war. China’s factory deflation continued for the 32nd straight month as PPI (May) declined 3.3% y-o-y as against the estimate of 3.2% and 2.7% decline in April. The deflation threat will continue to linger unless consumer demand remains sluggish.China's exports slowed from 8.1% y-o-y in April to 4.8% y-o-y (forecast 6%) in May as shipments to the US declined 34% y-o-y, worse than a 21% decline registered in April. Chinese imports dipped 3.4% y-o-y due to trade uncertainty as against the forecast of a decline of 0.8%.The US non-farm report (May) released Friday was somewhat better-than-expected as US employers added 139K jobs Vs the forecast of 126K jobs, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Average hourly earnings m-o-m and y-o-y rose 0.4% and 3.9% respectively Vs the respective estimates of 0.3% (prior 0.2%) and 3.7% (prior 3.9%). However, two-month payroll net revision showed a decline of 95K jobs as labor force participation rate slid from 62.6% to 52.4%. The household survey reflected a weakening job market. Even as the population increased by 188k, the labor force dropped by 625k. Thus, even though employment fell by 696k, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.20%.Traders will closely monitor US CPI (May) and PPI (May) data to be released on June 11 and June 12 respectively for clues to the Fed rate cut path.The US Dollar Index, at the time of writing, was seen at 98.95, down nearly 0.24% on the day. The Index fell 0.14% in the week ending June 6. Ten-year and 30-year US yields were a tad lower at 4.48% and 4.95% respectively.Money managers increased their net bullish gold bets to a seven-week high in the week ending June 3.China's gold reserves were up for the seventh consecutive month as PBoC bought around 2 tons of gold in May. China's gold holdings reached 73.80 MOz at the end of May.The lingering deflation threat to China’s economy, positive ETF inflows and not so strong US non-farm payroll report (May) are positive factors for the yellow metal. However, in the near-term, the metal is expected to take its clues from the ongoing US-China trade talks in London. Positive outcomes from the talks will weigh on the shiny metal. In that case, gold may fall to as low as $3260 (Rs 95,000). Interim support is at $3292 (Rs 96,000). Resistance is at $3365 (Rs 98,000)/$3405 (Rs 99,200).In all the possibility, there may be some tentative positive developments in the trade deal talks. In that case, gold may decline to test the support at $3292. However, full resolution of all the trade related issues looks to be elusive for the time being. Nonetheless, traders need to take cognizance of the ongoing US-China trade deal talks. In the meantime, a light sell position can be initiated with due risk management in place.","Gold gained on Monday on a weaker US Dollar.

How former ICICI Bank relationship manager committed fraud: 10 Points

The investigation revealed that Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers and executed multiple illegal transactions.

Investigators found that she had diverted the misappropriated funds into stock market investments, which subsequently resulted in substantial financial losses.

In order to hide the deception, Gupta allegedly substituted the registered mobile numbers of various bank accounts with those of her family members.

The actual account holders were unable to receive transaction notifications and one-time passwords (OTPs) due to this modification, according to police reports.

The investigation revealed multiple fraudulent activities by Gupta, including unauthorised activation of overdraft facilities across 40 accounts.

Further findings showed that she had unlawfully terminated fixed deposits belonging to 31 clients, channeling Rs 1.34 crore to different accounts.

The probe uncovered her unauthorised usage of debit cards, along with their associated PINs and OTPs, to conduct various online and ATM transactions.

Additionally, Gupta was found responsible for processing a fraudulent personal loan amounting to Rs 3.4 lakh.

The investigation also established that she had extensively utilised Insta Kiosk machines and digital banking platforms to execute numerous fraudulent transactions.

The illicit funds were distributed across several Demat accounts, suggesting an attempt to conceal the money trail.

Rs 4.58 crore siphoned off - over 100 accounts of customers accessed - fixed deposits broken: This is not some movie plot - it’s a stunning fraud that a former ICICI Bank relationship manager pulled off! The multi-crore fraud continued for over two years.The accused, Sakshi Gupta, who served at ICICI Bank ’s Shriram Nagar branch in Kota's DCM area from 2020 to 2023, was taken into custody by Udhyog Nagar police on May 31, 2025 after a thorough investigation.According to a TOI report, police records indicate that the fraudulent activities were initially discovered on February 18.Following ICICI Bank's internal probe that identified Sakshi Gupta, who previously worked as a relationship manager at the bank's DCM branch in Kota, as the primary suspect in a significant financial fraud affecting customer accounts, the Kota police have begun their enquiry. The authorities are examining potential accomplices and have asked the bank to furnish pertinent documentation.After identifying irregularities, bank manager Tarun Dadhich registered a complaint, which led to a comprehensive audit and subsequent police investigation.""She systematically transferred funds, sometimes using the account of an elderly woman who had no knowledge of the activity as a pool account,"" said sub-inspector Ibrahim of Udhyog Nagar police station.""By mid-February 2023, over Rs 3 crore had passed through that single account.""Following a one-day police custody, Gupta appeared before the court and was sent to judicial custody. The police continue their enquiries into the matter.A representative from ICICI Bank said, ""The interest of our customers are of paramount importance to us. Immediately upon discovering the fraudulent activity, we filed an FIR with the police. We have a zero-tolerance policy against any fraudulent activity and thus suspended the employee involved. We would like to reassure that genuine claims of impacted customers have been settled.""","Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers. Gupta diverted the misappropriated funds into stock market investments. Gupta was taken into custody by Udhyog Nagar police on May 31, 2025.

"In another step forward, India to host Chinese vice minister for talks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-another-step-forward-india-to-host-chinese-vice-minister-for-talks/articleshow/121762420.cms,"Chinese vice foreign minister Sun Weidong is likely to travel to India this week for what will be the second high-level bilateral visit from either side this year, following foreign secretary Vikram Misri’s visit to Beijing in January during which Sun and Misri had agreed to a slew of measures aimed at normalizing ties.The 2-day visit by Sun will be the latest reinforcement of the improvement in bilateral ties resulting from the completion of the troop disengagement process in eastern Ladakh, after almost 5 years of a military standoff that wrecked the relationship. This was quickly followed by a meeting of PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Russia in October and the resumption of the Special Representatives’ (SR) Talks on the Boundary Question 2 months later.ToI has learnt that Sun will arrive in India on Thursday for a 2-day visit that will likely see him calling on NSA Ajit Doval, apart from holding talks under the foreign secretary-vice minister mechanism. Doval is also likely to host the Chinese Special Representative, Wang Yi, who doubles up as foreign minister, later this year for another round of SR talks.The meeting this week will be an important occasion for India and China to review progress on steps announced in January to normalize the relationship. The 2 sides had then agreed to resume the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in the summer of 2025, an Indian demand that has been fulfilled.While there has also been progress in cooperation on trans-border rivers, both sides are yet to resume direct air services between the 2 countries, something they had agreed to do “in principle” in January.The 2 sides will likely also touch upon the possibility of a visit by PM Narendra Modi to China in September to cap a year of détente in the bilateral relationship. Modi has been invited for the SCO summit in Tianjin but is yet to confirm his participation. The summit will be preceded by a meeting of the foreign ministers which external affairs minister S Jaishankar is likely to attend. The visit by Sun, who served as ambassador to India when the eastern Ladakh standoff erupted, also signals an intent on the part of both sides to build upon the nascent thaw in the relationship, not allowing India-Pakistan hostilities to come in the way.India wants dialogue mechanisms to be resumed step by step, in a way that allows both sides to address each other’s concerns. India is likely to raise its concerns related to trade in the meeting, as it seeks a more transparent and predictable economic and trade relationship. Both sides in the last Misri-Sun meeting had also agreed to facilitate people-to-people exchanges, including media and think-tank interactions.",Chinese vice foreign minister Sun Weidong is likely to travel to India this week. It will be the second high-level bilateral visit from either side this year. Sun will arrive in India on Thursday for a 2-day visit that will likely see him calling on NSA Ajit Doval.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121762444,imgsize-1111745,width-400,resizemode-4/121762444.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday convened with members of all-party delegations who had recently completed their diplomatic missions to various countries, discussing India's firm position against Pakistan-linked terrorism post-Operation Sindoor.""Met members of the various delegations who represented India in different countries and elaborated on India's commitment to peace and the need to eradicate the menace of terrorism. We are all proud of the manner in which they put forward India's voice,"" said PM Modi in a post on X.The delegates, gathered at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, shared their experiences with the Prime Minister. Delegations presented India's position against terror, highlighting Pakistan's sponsorship and utilisation of terror against India. They called for Pakistan to be included in the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) grey list, as per ANI reports.The central government had previously commended the work of seven delegations, which comprised more than 50 people, predominantly serving MPs.The diplomatic teams, which included former parliamentarians and ex-diplomats, conducted visits to 33 international capitals and the European Union headquarters. S Jaishankar , external affairs minister, had previously met with the delegations and commended their role in communicating India's resolute stance against terrorism originating from Pakistan.The leadership of the delegations was distributed between the ruling alliance and opposition parties. Four teams were headed by ruling alliance members - two from BJP, one each from JD(U) and Shiv Sena, while opposition parties led three teams - Congress, DMK and NCP(SP).The delegation leaders included BJP's Ravi Shankar Prasad and Baijyant Panda, Congress' Shashi Tharoor, JD(U)'s Sanjay Jha, Shiv Sena's Shrikant Shinde, DMK's Kanimozhi, and NCP (SP)'s Supriya Sule, each visiting different global regions.The initiative demonstrated national unity in countering terrorism, with opposition members like Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi joining forces with ruling alliance representatives to advocate India's position internationally. Operation Sindoor was launched on 7 May in response to the 22 April terrorist attack in Pahalgam. The Indian Armed Forces executed targeted strikes against terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen.","PM Narendra Modi met with members of all-party delegations who had recently completed their diplomatic missions to various countries.

All new ACs to come with minimum temp setting of 20 degrees C,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-new-acs-to-come-with-minimum-temp-setting-of-20-degrees-c/articleshow/121759311.cms,"NEW DELHI: Soon all new air-conditioners (ACs) will come with a minimum temperature setting of 20 degrees centigrade (degrees C) instead of 16 or 18 degrees and a maximum of 28 degrees against 30 degrees at present, a move that can potentially result in savings of Rs 18,000-20,000 crore for consumers in three years once the mandate becomes effective.Describing it as a “uniqe experiment”, power minister Manohar Lal on Tuesday said the new mandate for AC makers will improve efficiency in cooling operations, mitigating the surge in power demand and electricity bills as summers get hotter.As and when the new norms are notified, the new mandate will apply to air-conditioners used across sectors — from domestic to commercial establishments such as office blocks, malls, hotels and movie theatres, which often run their units at the lowest setting.The ‘experiment’ appears to be inspired by similar moves in Italy and Japan. While Rome has fixed the lowest temperature setting for public buildings at 23 degrees C, Japan follows a fixed temperature of 27 degrees C.Government data indicate that every 1 degree C increase in temperature setting for cooling reduces power consumption by 6%. They also show that if 6 crore urban households and 12 lakh commercial establishments keep their AC setting between 22 and 24 degrees C, it will save 12-15 billion units of power annually and do away the need to build 4-5 coal-fired power plants and substantially reduce carbon emission.Industry bodies representing the manufacturers said the move will raise their R&D expenses but also push up demand for more efficient units, which usually cost more.Based on a 2018 Bureau of Energy Efficiency study, the government had in 2020 mandated a default setting of 24 degrees C for air-conditioners and suggested running the units at 26-27 degrees C, a temperature level it described as healthy.In October 2023, the International Energy Agency said India's demand for electricity from household air-conditioners will increase significantly by 2050, potentially exceeding total power consumption in Africa. It also anticipated India will experience the highest energy demand growth globally over the next three decades, driven by rising incomes and a warming climate.GoThe minister also announced a Rs 5,400 crore VGF funding for 30 gigawatt of battery storage projects and extending the waiver of inter-state transmission charges for green power till June 28, 2028. These decisions are expected to spur investments of Rs 33,000 crore in the battery storage projects and prove to be a boon for Rs 1 lakh crore worth of green transmission projects underway.",All new air-conditioners (ACs) will come with a minimum temperature setting of 20 degrees centigrade (degrees C) instead of 16 or 18 degrees.

NEW DELHI: India’s population for 2025 is estimated at 1.46 billion, says a new UN report, which also flagged a declining total fertility rate (TFR) in the world’s most populous country.The population is expected to grow to about 1.7 billion before it begins to fall, around 40 years from now, said the UN Population Fund’s (UNFPA) 2025 State of World Population Report released Tuesday. China’s population is estimated to touch 1.41 billion this year.India’s population was 1.44 billion last year, according to World Population Prospects-2024, also a UN report, released in July last year.The UNFPA report showed India’s TFR has declined to 1.9, which is below the replacement level fertility of 2.1 births per woman, indicating women are having fewer children than needed to maintain the population size from one generation to the next.It noted that while India has made significant progress in lowering fertility rate, deep inequalities persist across states, castes and incomes.Even as India's fertility rate is declining, many people in India, especially women, still face significant barriers to making free and informed decisions about their reproductive lives, says the UN Population Fund's State of World Population Report released Tuesday.These barriers create what the report identified as India's ""high fertility and low fertility duality"".The fertility rate has come down from nearly five children per woman in 1970 to about two, courtesy improved education and access to reproductive healthcare. The TFR fell below the replacement level rate to 2.0 for the first time in the National Family Health Survey (2019-21).States such as Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh continue to experience high fertility rates. Here, unintended and closely spaced births are common due to poor contraceptive and health services, and gender norms, it said.On the other hand, states such as Delhi, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have sustained below-replacement fertility with many couples delaying or skipping childbirth due to costs and work-life conflict, especially among educated middle-class women.The report called for a shift from panic over falling fertility to addressing unmet reproductive goals as it highlighted that millions of individuals are not able to realise their real fertility goals. ""This is the real crisis, not underpopulation or overpopulation. The answer lies in greater reproductive agency - a person's ability to make free and informed choices about sex, contraception and starting a family,"" it said.In line with these trends, a UNFPA-YouGov survey of 14,000 respondents across14 countries, including India, challenged global narratives around ""population explosion vs population collapse"" as it showed that one in three adult Indians (36%) face unintended pregnancies while 30% experience unfulfilled desire of having either more or fewer children. Notably, 23% faced both.Financial limitation is one of the biggest barriers to reproductive freedom with nearly four in 10 people citing it as a reason stopping them from having the families they want. Job insecurity (21%), housing constraints (22%), and lack of reliable childcare (18%) are making parenthood feel out of reach.","India’s population for 2025 is estimated at 1.46 billion, says a new UN report. The population is expected to grow to about 1.7 billion before it begins to fall.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday criticised the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for appointing Pakistan as the vice-chair of its counter-terrorism panel. Singh said this decision is similar to ""making the cat guard the milk"" as Pakistan has a known history of protecting and supporting terrorists.""What is astonishing is that this Counter-Terrorism panel, was formed after the 9/11 terror attacks. Pakistan had sheltered the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. This (decision) is akin to cat guarding the milk,"" Singh said.At an event in Dehradun, Singh said Pakistan has supported terrorism for many years and described Operation Sindoor, which was carried out in response to the Pahalgam attack, as the ""biggest action"" against terrorism in India’s history.Singh pointed out that both India and Pakistan became independent at the same time, but while India is now seen as the ""mother of democracy"", Pakistan has gained the label of ""father of global terrorism"". He said this comparison should be kept in mind.Singh also said Pakistan is ""stubborn"" and needs to be dealt with using ""strategic, diplomatic and economic pressure"" from the global community to stop terrorism from its land.""Pakistan has always given shelter to terrorists, trained them on its soil and helped them. Pahalgam (attack) was just an example, but I want to tell you that list of Pakistan-aided terrorists is very long. And, Pakistan always tries to justify terrorism. So, it is important that we eliminate not just these terrorists but the entire terror infrastructure that aids them,"" he said.He added that Pakistan has not been able to stop development in Kashmir despite efforts.""Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla railway link is a shining example of the government's relentless pursuit of progress in Jammu & Kashmir. Soon, PoK will join us and say 'I, too, am Bharat',"" he said.Calling terrorism a problem for humanity and a global issue, Singh said that no society should accept it.He also mentioned that some people glorify terrorists as ""freedom fighters"" and said, ""no revolution is born out of the womb of terrorism, it only engenders destruction and hatred"".Singh further stated that ""No religious, ideological or political reason can justify terrorism. No human objective can ever be achieved through bloodshed and violence.""He said Pakistan supports terrorism and a large portion of its foreign aid is used to fund this support.""Funding Pakistan means funding the infrastructure of terrorism. Pakistan is a nursery of terrorism. It should not be nourished,"" he said, asking other countries to stop giving money to Pakistan.Singh said that Pakistan’s land has been a shelter for global terror groups. He named terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar who move freely there, and added that even senior officers of the Pakistan Army have attended terrorists' funerals.""Now, the same country is expected to lead the global community against terrorism. This raises serious questions on the intentions and policies of the international system,"" he said.Singh urged the international community and organisations like the UN to take the issue of terrorism seriously.

"Advocate abused woman trial judge, SC upholds 18-month sentence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawyer-jailed-for-abusing-judicial-officer/articleshow/121762573.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused leniency to an advocate, who was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for using abusive language in 2015 to outrage the modesty of a judicial officer in a Karkardooma courtroom in east Delhi and rejected his plea for reducing the jail term to six months already undergone by him.The convicted advocate, Sanjay Rathod, pleaded with the partial working day bench of Justices Prashant Kumar Mishra and Manmohan that he was the sole breadwinner of the family comprising his old parents, wife and two children and that he was remorseful about the incident that took place in the courtroom nearly a decade back.The bench said the Delhi High Court has already directed the sentences to run concurrently, thus reducing the total period of incarceration from two years to 18 months. It asked the advocate to surrender within two weeks to serve the remaining period of imprisonment.Justice Manmohan, who was the chief justice of Delhi HC prior to his appointment as a judge of the SC, said, “In Delhi, women judicial officers comprise nearly 50% of the total working strength of judges in the trial courts. If their dignity is not protected, it will create an unsafe atmosphere in the courtroom”. At present the female judicial officers constitute 38% of the total judges in trial courts in India.In Delhi their numbers are healthier at 48%.When the woman judicial officer was conducting proceedings in a traffic challan case, the delinquent advocate was informed by the court that his client’s case had been adjourned. Enraged, he started abusing the judicial officer and used intemperate and abusive language to threaten her. The judicial officer filed a police complaint accusing the advocate of outraging her modesty by using filthy language.In the police case, he was convicted and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for insulting the modesty of a woman and three months each for two other offences and was directed to serve the sentences consecutively. On appeal, the additional sessions judge upheld the sentence and directed him to pay compensation of Rs 50,000 to her.The HC in its judgment said it was a case in which injustice was inflicted upon a sitting female judicial officer, within her own courtroom – a space that should embody respect, order and the majesty of law.“Here, where she was entrusted with the solemn duty to dispense 'justice' without fear or favour, she was subjected to misconduct, threats, and humiliation by one who, as an advocate, was duty-bound to uphold the dignity of the court. This is, therefore, not merely a case of individual misbehaviour, but a case where injustice was done to justice itself - where a judge, who symbolizes the impartial voice of the law, became the target of personal attack while discharging her official duties,” the HC had said and upheld the 18-month sentence to the advocate.","The advocate, Sanjay Rathod, pleaded with the partial working day bench of Justices Prashant Kumar Mishra and Manmohan.

Railways working on releasing passengers charts with confirmed seats 24 hours before departure of train,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/railways-working-on-releasing-passengers-charts-with-confirmed-seats-24-hours-before-departure-of-train/articleshow/121759955.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

NEW DELHI: Moving to address a major cause of anxiety among train travellers, railways is working on a mechanism to release passenger charts with confirmed seats 24 hours instead of the current norm of releasing it just four hours before the departure of a train. At present, wait-listed passengers, particularly those coming from far-off places to catch trains, remain uncertain and clueless about their ticket status till the final list is put out by the railways.A senior railway official said that a pilot run started in the Bikaner division in Rajasthan from June 6, and so far, there have been no issues. “We will carry out this pilot for some more weeks to identify any issues and how to fix them. There have been several instances of passengers facing problems as they come to know that their wait-listed ticket has not been confirmed, barely hours before reaching the station. An advanced chart will help people plan better and reduce stress,” he added.Officials said the new system aims to help passengers plan their journeys more effectively. For instance, travellers coming from locations 100 km or more away will have better clarity and time to reach the boarding station without last-minute uncertainty.Sources said the proposed norms won’t have any impact on people who plan to travel at the last minute and book Tatkal tickets. “Since Tatkal tickets are booked 48 hours before the scheduled departure of trains, bringing out the full chart a day before won’t be an issue,” another official said.As of now, there is no clarity if railways will release the second and third lists of passengers with confirmed reservations, as there is a possibility of many passengers with confirmed tickets cancelling their booking within the last 24 hours. “Let the pilot run be over and then decisions will be taken keeping in mind the best interest of passengers,” a source said.Earlier, the railway reservation charts were usually prepared twice. The first chart was prepared four hours before the scheduled departure time of the train and the second, or final, chart was prepared between 30 minutes before the train’s departure.","Railways is working on a mechanism to release passenger charts with confirmed seats 24 hours instead of the current norm of releasing it just four hours before the departure of a train.

'A particularly special feeling': Andy Flower hails Virat Kohli, RCB after historic title win





NEW DELHI: Diageo India, the Indian branch of UK-based Diageo Plc and owner of the IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), has firmly rejected rumours of selling the team. In a letter addressed to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and its Surveillance Department on Tuesday, June 10, a Diageo India representative stated that the media reports suggesting a potential sale are purely speculative.""The company would like to clarify that the aforesaid media reports are speculative in nature and it is not pursuing any such discussion,"" Mital Sanghvi, the company secretary, informed the regulating body of the Indian Stock Market. ""This is for your information and records.""According to a Cricbuzz report, Diageo's statement was in response to a query from the Bombay Stock Exchange, where the company is publicly listed. Since speculation about a possible sale of the RCB franchise began circulating, shares of United Spirits — the Diageo-owned company that holds RCB — have seen a notable uptick.On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Diageo is considering selling the IPL champions.The report surfaced shortly after RCB’s maiden IPL title win on June 3 — a milestone achieved after 17 years — followed tragically by an incident in Bengaluru on June 4, where celebrations turned fatal, leaving 11 dead and many injured.Though Diageo officially dismissed the sale reports as ""speculative,"" the ambiguity of their statement has sparked deeper speculation. A seasoned voice in India’s sports business ecosystem suggested that “being a public company, there will be a lot of pressure on reputational damage,” hinting that Diageo could be weighing its options more seriously than publicly admitted.There are also murmurs about Diageo valuing the RCB franchise at around USD 2 billion. While some industry insiders view that figure as inflated — especially when compared to Torrent’s acquisition of Gujarat Titans at approximately INR 7500 crore (around USD 1 billion) — others disagree. Lalit Modi , the architect of the IPL, told Cricbuzz that a USD 2 billion valuation for RCB is quite realistic.""I will not be surprised if it is sold for a higher price,"" he remarked, adding that comparing the RCB valuation to that of the newer Gujarat franchise isn’t an apples-to-apples comparison.""I will not be surprised if it is sold for a higher price,"" he said , stating that the valuation of GT cannot be compared here since it was a one-year-old deal.The sale report remains speculative, as clarified by the Diageo official in the response to the BSE.""No decision is final and they may decide against selling the team, the people said, asking not to be named as the details are private,"" the Bloomberg report says.","Diageo India, owner of Royal Challengers Bengaluru, has rejected rumours of selling the team.

(AI image)

The Big US Worry

What’s China’s rare earths export ban about?

Will China relent?

The ‘Widespread’ problem of rare earth minerals

China’s monopoly and stringent control on rare earth minerals is causing a major military problem for the US, and it doesn’t seem that this vulnerability is going to be addressed any time soon. The United States and its European allies face substantial difficulties in getting heat-resistant magnets, which are required to replenish their diminished stockpiles of military equipment without access to these essential components.Recent disruptions to samarium come amidst urgent efforts by the US and European allies to restore their advanced weapons inventories. These stockpiles have been considerably reduced due to support provided to Ukraine following Russia's invasion, and in the American case, through military assistance to Israel during the Gaza Strip conflict.The United States has been unsuccessful for over ten years in establishing an alternative source to China's provision of specific rare earth materials, which are essential for producing magnets used in missiles, smart bombs, fighter jets, and various other defence equipment, according to a New York Times report.China maintains exclusive global production of samarium, which is an uncommon rare earth element primarily utilised in defence applications.Samarium magnets retain their magnetic properties even at temperatures sufficient to liquefy lead. These magnets are crucial in high-speed electric motors operating in confined spaces, particularly in missile nose cones.The rare earth minerals situation is a key point of discussion in the ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China in London.On April 4, Chinese authorities announced export restrictions on seven rare earth metals and their magnetic derivatives. China dominates the global market for these materials. China’s Commerce Ministry stated these materials serve both civilian and military purposes, requiring special licensing for future exports. The ministry indicated this decision aims to protect national security interests and adhere to international non-proliferation commitments.The ministry has started issuing permits for magnets containing dysprosium and terbium to automotive manufacturers in Europe and the United States. These magnets, essential for brake and steering mechanisms, can endure heat from conventional engines but prove inadequate for military-grade heat requirements. However, there are no indications of approved samarium exports, a material with limited civilian applications.Also Read | Explained: China’s monopoly on rare earth minerals spooking the world; what does it mean for India & what is it doing? The Donald Trump administration seeks to enhance military aid to Taiwan, a democratic nation that China considers its territory. In response, Beijing has not only restricted rare earth exports for defence purposes but also sanctioned specific US defence contractors involved in Taiwan-related deals.The Chinese sanctions prohibit domestic firms and citizens from conducting financial transactions with these US defence contractors. Initially, these restrictions had minimal impact on samarium trade since China exported the metal to chemical firms, who combined it with cobalt before selling to magnet producers, who then supplied it to military contractors.Chinese and American officials are in the midst of trade discussions in London, focusing on rare earth materials. Whilst the United States prioritises resuming rare earth imports, analysts believe China is unlikely to abandon its newly implemented export licensing regime.""I don't think that's going away,"" said Michael Hart, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, who is coordinating the US private sector's efforts in Beijing to obtain more rare earth materials.Lockheed Martin, a prominent aerospace and defence contractor, is the primary American consumer of samarium, utilising approximately 50 pounds of samarium magnets in each F-35 fighter jet.Earlier, the Biden administration's apprehension regarding the absence of domestic samarium production led to substantial contracts for two production facilities. However, these facilities remained unrealised due to business viability concerns, leaving America completely reliant on Chinese supply.Also Read | Will the Donald Trump administration be forced to give billions of dollars in tariff refunds? The problem of rare earth minerals is not just limited to supply of samarium. Critical minerals and metals such as cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel and rare earth elements serve as fundamental materials in the production of sustainable energy technologies, ranging from wind turbines to electric vehicles with battery systems.China maintains its position on rare earth export restrictions, despite increasing diplomatic pressure from various nations, including India, the United States and European Union.The Indian automotive industry has expressed growing concerns about the scarcity of rare earth magnets, which are crucial components in both electric vehicles and specific parts of traditional combustion engine vehicles.Indian industrial sectors are particularly worried about China's export controls on rare earth materials, specifically germanium, which is a key element in semiconductor manufacturing, fibre optic cables and solar panel production.The International Energy Agency's data reveals China's commanding position in rare earth elements, controlling 92% of global production despite mining only 61% of the world's supply.Officials from India and multiple nations have confirmed ongoing dialogues with Chinese governmental bodies concerning these supply chain issues.India’s Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal has emphasised the risks associated with critical minerals being geographically concentrated, warning that such consolidation could hamper nations' economic development.",China’s monopoly and stringent control on rare earth minerals is causing a major military problem for the US.

Digital economy has eliminated traditional boundaries

Companies report positive results from flexible schedules

Shark Tank judge and millionaire Kevin O'Leary has dismissed the growing four-day workweek movement as ""the stupidest idea I have ever heard,"" arguing that the modern digital economy has already made traditional work schedules obsolete.Speaking on Fox News, the 70-year-old investor took particular aim at France's exploration of shortened work weeks, suggesting a provocative alternative: ""I think we should let the French go to a two-day workweek and then kick their ass internationally,"" he spoke at a Fox TV show.O'Leary contends that pandemic-era changes have fundamentally altered how work functions. ""There's no such thing as a workweek anymore anyway on a digital economy, post-pandemic,"" he explained. With 40% of his staff working remotely worldwide, he focuses on project completion rather than hours clocked.""I don't care when my staff does their work—as long as it gets done on time,"" O'Leary said, acknowledging that while he opposes mandated four-day weeks, the traditional 9-to-5 model is equally outdated.Despite O'Leary's skepticism, numerous organizations are seeing benefits from shortened workweeks. Performance coaching company Exos implemented a four-day schedule for its 3,500 employees, resulting in 24% increased productivity and halved burnout rates.The trend has gained executive attention, with 30% of CEOs now considering organization-wide schedule shifts, according to KPMG survey data.

“Good opportunity to put him in the graveyard,”





When it comes to bad blood in the NFL, no division brews more intensity than the AFC North. It's not just football here — it’s personal. And no rivalry exemplifies that ruthless spirit better than the long-standing war between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers. But with one seismic shift this offseason — Aaron Rodgers joining the Steelers — tensions just reached a boiling point.It didn’t take long for Browns star Myles Garrett to react to Rodgers' surprise move to Pittsburgh. But what came out of his mouth wasn’t your standard opponent-welcoming soundbite, it was a threat cloaked in cold-blooded conviction.Garrett said, eyes set on the future Hall of Famer.For fans unfamiliar with Garrett’s dark sense of humor, the “graveyard” isn’t metaphorical fluff. It’s literal, a Halloween tradition where the All-Pro defensive end dresses as the Grim Reaper and adds gravestones of quarterbacks he’s sacked.

It sent shockwaves through the league. But instead of parting ways, the Browns doubled down on their defensive cornerstone, locking him in with a deal that shattered market expectations.With Rodgers facing Cleveland twice in 2025, all eyes are on the trenches.

Why Tesla has not paid Elon Musk

What’s next for Elon Musk’s pay?

Despite being one of the most influential figures in the tech and automotive industries, Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Musk’s compensation structure has been a subject of debate for years. His 2018 pay package, which was designed to grant him stock options based on Tesla’s performance milestones, was twice struck down in court, leaving him without formal compensation. While Tesla’s valuation has skyrocketed—growing over 2,000% in the past seven years—Musk has not received a paycheck during this period.As mentioned above, Elon Musk’s salary package was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018. As part of the agreement his entire compensation was tied to the company’s overall performance and market capitalisation milestones.Under this structure, Musk was granted stock options that would vest only if Tesla hit specific, escalating targets for market capitalisation, revenue, and adjusted EBITDA. Over the years, as Tesla's valuation soared and it met many of these goals, the package became immensely valuable, potentially making it the largest compensation deal in corporate history.The legal battle over Musk’s $56 billion stock award has prevented Tesla from issuing him compensation. Courts have ruled that the approval process for his pay package was flawed, leading to its rejection despite shareholder support.Musk himself has acknowledged the situation, stating that he has worked without pay for years. However, with Tesla facing market volatility and leadership concerns, some experts argue that it may be time to restructure his compensation to ensure stability and long-term commitment.Tesla’s board is now weighing options for a new compensation plan. Some analysts suggest a performance-based stock package, while others argue Musk should receive a traditional CEO salary to align with industry standards.","Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies.

Spain's economy minister says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year present a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore.Last year, Spain received a record 94 million international visitors, making it one of the most visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to some projections.""It's important to understand that these record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges,"" Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press. ""And we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population.""Tourism is a key sector for the Southern European nation's economy, which grew faster than any major advanced economy last year at 3.2%, and is projected to grow at 2.4% this year, according to the Bank of Spain, well ahead of the expected eurozone average of 0.9%.But a stubborn housing crisis in which home and rental costs have skyrocketed in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona and elsewhere has led to growing frustration about one aspect tied to tourism in particular: the proliferation of short-term rental apartments in city centres.The country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Signs at demonstrations with slogans such as ""Get Airbnb out of our neighbourhoods"" point to the growing anger.In response, the government recently announced it was cracking down on Airbnb listings that it said were operating in the country illegally, a decision that the company is appealing.""We are a 49 million-inhabitants country,"" Cuerpo said. The record numbers of tourists illustrate the ""attractiveness of our country, but also of the challenge that we have in terms of dealing and providing for a good experience for tourists, but at the same time avoiding overcharging (for) our own services and our own housing,"" he said.The Bank of Spain recently said the country has a deficit of 450,000 homes. Building more public housing is critical to solve the problem, Cuerpo said. Spain has a lower stock of public housing than many other major European Union countries.""This is the key challenge for this term,"" the minister said of the country's housing woes.On the possibility of more US tariffs on EU goods, the top economic policymaker for the eurozone's fourth-largest economy said he believed the EU still wanted to reinforce economic ties with the US""From the EU side, we are constructive but we are not naive,"" Cuerpo said, adding that the bloc would pursue ""other routes protecting our firms and industries"" if no agreement with the Trump administration can be reached.A 90-day pause on tariffs announced by the EU and the US is slated to end on July 14. About halfway through that grace period, US President Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs on steel imports. The US has also enacted a 25% tariff on vehicles and 10% so-called reciprocal tariffs on most other goods.On how Spain's current housing woes got here, the minister said a steep drop in construction in Spain following the 2008 financial crisis played a role. So did population growth due to immigration, Cuerpo said, and pressures from an increase in the number of tourists.While building more housing is key, the minister advocated for an all-of-the-above approach, including regulating Spain's housing market and short-term rental platforms.""For us, there's no silver bullet,"" he said.","Spain received a record 94 million international visitors last year, making it one of the most visited countries in the world.

But a stubborn housing crisis has led to growing frustration about one aspect tied to tourism in particular.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121767877,imgsize-880029,width-400,resizemode-4/121767877.jpg"

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Tapping out: Kabul may be first modern city to run out of water; report warns of 'unprecedented humanitarian disaster',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/tapping-out-kabul-may-be-first-modern-city-to-run-out-of-water-report-warns-of-unprecedented-humanitarian-disaster/articleshow/121693383.cms,"Representative image

'Kabul’s Water Crisis: An Inflection Point for Action',

Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, could become the first modern city to completely run out of water, warns a recent report. The report titledreleased recently by the NGO Mercy Corps, outlines in detail the city’s worsening water emergency and urges immediate international and domestic attention.The report says that Kabul’s groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year, with the water table having dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade. According to projections by Unicef, cited in the report, the city’s aquifers could run dry by 2030, potentially displacing up to 3 million people. The situation is already critical—nearly half of the boreholes, Kabul residents’ primary source of drinking water, are dry.An aquifer is an underground layer of rock, sand, or soil that holds water. It acts like a natural water tank. People access this water through wells, but if too much is taken out and not enough refills it (like from rain or snow), the aquifer can run dry.The report says, ""Kabul’s water crisis represents a failure of governance, humanitarian coordination, water regulation, and infrastructure planning... Without immediate intervention, the city risks becoming the first modern capital in the world to fully deplete its water reserves.""Kabul’s water largely comes from three main aquifers, recharged by snowmelt from the Hindu Kush mountains. However, due to climate change and recurring droughts, snow and rain have significantly declined. From October 2023 to January 2024, Afghanistan received only 45–60% of its normal winter precipitation. According to the report, ""Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country in the world to impacts of climate change,"" and Kabul is already seeing the effects, with reduced snowfall and shorter winters reducing the volume of meltwater.""Shorter winters also mean less time for snow to accumulate on the Hindu Kush, and thus less meltwater runoff in the spring, even as the city’s demand for water rapidly increases,"" the report says.On the infrastructure side, only 20% of households in Kabul are connected to centralised piped water systems. Most residents rely on water pumped from borewells, many of which are unregulated or drying up. ""90% of Kabul’s residents rely on water pumped from borewells to supply their daily needs,"" the report says.The report also highlights water quality issues. ""As much as 80% of Kabul’s groundwater is contaminated with sewage, toxins, and dangerously high levels of chemicals such as arsenic and nitrates,"" posing major health risks. In interviews conducted for the report, 70% of residents said their well water had issues such as bad taste, odor, or discoloration.Economically, the crisis has forced families to spend 15–30% of their monthly income on water. In some cases, private water companies extract water and sell it back to residents at high prices. ""Weekly water costs for a single household reach 400–500 Afghanis ($6–7), exceeding food expenses for more than half of households,"" the report notes. ""To meet this financial burden, families are forced to borrow more, placing them deeper into debt. 68% of households incur water-related debt, with informal lenders charging 15–20% monthly interest.""The city’s main water sources like the Qargha Reservoir and Shah-wa-Arous Dam are either underperforming or newly operational. Long-planned projects such as the Panjshir River Pipeline and Shah Toot Dam remain delayed due to funding and political issues.Governance challenges are also severe. The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), responsible for water quality monitoring, has lost about 40% of its technical staff, ""largely due to technical staff fleeing the country."" Due to a lack of international recognition and funding cuts, like from USAID, the agency cannot conduct full water testing and lacks access to basic equipment.The report warns that unless urgent changes are made—including better governance, water infrastructure investment, and international cooperation—Kabul could face a humanitarian crisis. ""Without large-scale changes to Kabul’s water management dynamics, the city faces an unprecedented humanitarian disaster within the coming decade, and likely much sooner,"" it concludes.","Kabul's groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year. The water table has dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade. According to projections by Unicef, the city's aquifers could run dry by 2030, potentially displacing up to 3 million people.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121694249,imgsize-1385292,width-400,resizemode-4/121694249.jpg"
