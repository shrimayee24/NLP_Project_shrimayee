Ties tested but unshaken

The first 100 days of Donald Trump 's second term in the White House have been nothing short of transformative for US-India relations, reshaping the strategic and economic landscape between the world's two largest democracies with unprecedented intensity and ambition.Following his unprecedent return, Trump unleashed a torrent of executive actions - 140 orders in just over three months -signaling a bold, aggressive approach to governance that has directly influenced the trajectory of US-India ties.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's landmark visit to Washington in February became a defining moment for the tectonic shift in US-India ties, cementing a ""COMPACT for the 21st Century"" that PM Modi described as a partnership built on ""TRUST-Transforming Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technology"".Capturing the spirit of this renewed alliance, PM Modi had announced: ""When America's MAGA [Make America Great Again] meets India's MIGA [Make India Great Again], it creates a MEGA partnership for prosperity.""The bilateral talks in February between Trump and PM Modi summit delivered concrete outcomes: A shared vision to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, an ambitious ""Mission 500"" that aims to rewrite the rules of engagement between the two economies.Trade has been a central theme in Trump 2.0's engagement with India.Trump, known for his hardline stance on trade, announced a reciprocal tariff policy targeting India's high tariffs, stating that the US will ""charge as much as India charges"", a move designed to level the playing field and protect American interests. Despite this tough posture, Trump hailed PM Modi as ""doing a great job"" and emphasised their ""great friendship"", underscoring a relationship that transcends transactional diplomacy.The administration imposed a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian goods, targeting sectors such as steel, aluminum, and auto parts, while exempting pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and energy products.This move aimed to protect US manufacturing and address perceived unfair trade practices by India.India responded by reducing tariffs on some imports to preempt harsher US tariff measures. Despite the tariffs, experts suggest India's exposure is relatively limited since most US exports to India face low import taxes.The Trump administration’s directive to impose reciprocal tariffs on trading partners created pressure but also opened the door for negotiations.By late April 2025, the US and India agreed on the Terms of Reference for a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), setting negotiation tracks for goods, services, digital commerce, and intellectual property protections. India offered to reduce tariffs on approximately $23 billion of US agricultural imports, while the US sought better access for manufactured goods, pharmaceuticals, and IT services. Both sides aimed to finalise the first phase of the deal by end of this year, with a goal to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.An important feature under discussion is India’s potential offer of a “forward most-favoured-nation” clause, which would grant the US any more favorable tariff terms India might extend to other countries, effectively future-proofing the agreement.Immigration remains a complex issue in Trump 2.0's India policy.While the administration has cracked down on illegal immigration, it supports legal pathways for Indian students and professionals. Approximately 3,50,000 Indian students currently study in the US, and the administration's support for green cards for international students is a positive sign.The Trump administration has intensified efforts to deport undocumented Indians, estimated at around 7,25,000, with about 20,000 already identified for repatriation.This crackdown has sparked controversy in India. The Cente has committed to legal immigration and cooperating on repatriation, and the issue was a key topic during PM Modi’s and Trump’s discussions in February.To address illegal immigration, both countries have agreed to combat trafficking networks exploiting Indian citizens seeking unauthorised entry into the US. Enhancements in visa processing, including opening new consulates in Bangalore and Ahmedabad, are planned to reduce visa wait times and curb illegal migration.JD Vance’s visit to India from April 21–24, 2025, marked the first US vice-presidential visit in 12 years, underscoring the importance of the bilateral relationship. His trip coincided with a 90-day pause on US tariffs, providing a window for intensive trade talks.Vance’s meetings with PM Modi and external affairs minister S. Jaishankar focused on finalising trade negotiation terms, expanding defense and technology collaborations, and reinforcing India’s role in the shared Indo-Pacific vision.Defense partnership has also reached new heights. The leaders committed to a decade-long framework to deepen military collaboration, with Trump offering advanced fighter jets and PM Modi affirming joint development, production, and technology transfer. Highlighting the strategic convergence amid Indo-Pacific security challenges, PM Modi said: ""India’s defense preparedness is crucial, and America plays a vital role in this.""Trump’s second term has continued to emphasise India’s role as a critical partner in the Indo-Pacific strategy, particularly in counterbalancing China’s growing influence. The administration has reinforced its commitment to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), which includes the US, India, Japan, and Australia, focusing on regional security and economic cooperation. This alignment reflects a shared interest in maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific, with India’s strategic autonomy respected by the Trump administration, which avoids interference in India’s internal affairs-a departure from the more vocal approach of some Democratic lawmakers.The Trump administration’s approach to terrorism and radicalism also finds common ground with India, especially in light of recent terrorist incidents in the US and India’s long-standing battle against terrorism. This shared concern has paved the way for enhanced counterterrorism cooperation between the two nations.The period was also marked by heightened regional tensions following the deadly Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, which targeted 26 tourists and was linked to Pakistan-based terrorist proxies.Following the Pahalgam terror attack in Kashmir, the Trump administration took a firm stance supporting India’s right to combat terrorism and maintain regional stability. The US underscored its commitment to working with India to counter terrorism emanating from Pakistan-based groups, signaling a tougher approach towards Pakistan compared to previous administrations.A US spokesperson emphasised, “The United States encourages all parties to work together towards a responsible resolution,” while reaffirming strong support for India’s fight against terrorism. PM Modi, addressing the nation, declared, “There is deep anguish in my heart... terrorists aimed to destabilize the region’s growing prosperity and peace,” promising severe consequences for the perpetrators.This shift reflects the broader strategic realignment in South Asia, with the US increasingly viewing India as a key partner in promoting peace and security in the region. The enhanced Indo-US cooperation on counterterrorism is expected to strengthen India’s position as a regional leader and contribute to stability in South Asia.Despite the turbulence in global trade and security, US-India ties have remained on an “even keel,” with New Delhi skillfully navigating the complexities of tariffs, immigration, and defense cooperation under Trump’s assertive second term.The relationship now stands as a pillar of stability and shared democratic values in an increasingly volatile world order.",The first 100 days of Donald Trump's second term in the White House have been nothing short of transformative for US-India relations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's landmark visit to Washington in February became a defining moment for the tectonic shift.

Khemka ends career marked by 57 transfers & 'inconsequential' roles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/khemka-ends-career-marked-by-57-transfers-inconsequential-roles/articleshow/120777050.cms,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana bureaucrat Ashok Khemka, whose 2012 decision to cancel a controversial Gurgaon land deal involving Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's husband Robert Vadra and realty firm DLF cemented his reputation as a stickler for rules, retired from service on Wednesday after a career marked by an astonishing 57 transfers . The 1991 batch IAS officer retired as additional chief secretary of transport department.BJP had flagged the Vadra-DLF deal as a symbol of corruption during its 2014 Lok Sabha campaign against the then UPA govt. But Khemka didn't quite become anyone's blue-eyed boy. While BJP came to govt at the Centre and the state, the bureaucrat remained a rolling stone, with no consequential assignment coming his way until the fag end of his career. He was appointed additional chief secretary last Dec in a department headed by minister Anil Vij, who is known to trust him.For some time, Khemka was posted in the science and technology department, which Vij previously headed. Most of his tenure, first under Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress govt and then BJP ministry, was spent in the archaeology and museums department.BJP had once cited Khemka's alleged persecution as a manifestation of Congress getting even with ""a whistleblower"". But even before the party had completed a year at the Centre since winning the 2024 polls, he was back in a purportedly inconsequential role.Khemka had vented on social media and written to the govt about ""mistreatment"" on several occasions. In a letter ex-Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar in 2019, he said some of his transfers at the time were ""not in public interest, but based on extraneous and personal considerations"".Referring to the DLF-Vadra land deal, which he cancelled after noticing alleged irregularities, Khemka had said: ""The promise made to the nation at the time of the 2014 elections is now forgotten.""""Governance is no longer a service; it is a business.

Caste census BJP's bid to stop erosion of broader Hindu unity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/caste-census-bjps-bid-to-stop-erosion-of-broader-hindu-unity/articleshow/120776485.cms,"NEW DELHI: The desire to negate efforts to retard broader Hindu consolidation appears to have played a major role in the decision of the cabinet committee on political affairs (CCPA) to include caste enumeration in the next census. While political watchers are linking the move to assembly elections in Bihar, sources pointed out that the political field had been levelled in the state with the caste survey already completed.Besides, the move was closely associated with chief minister Nitish Kumar , BJP's alliance partner, leaving little space for RJD's Tejaswi Yadav to claim bragging rights. A major consideration appears to have been to check attempts to split Hindus on caste lines, a cause for concern for BJP and RSS, which has been working on Hindu consolidation since inception.Sources pointed out that the decision came hours after a one-on-one meeting between PM Narendra Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday, which capped parleys at different levels of the Sangh and BJP leadership.The electoral success of BJP over the last decade has been facilitated largely by agglomeration of many caste groups coming together with OBCs and upper castes making a common cause. Starting with the 2024 general elections there has been a concerted attempt to splinter the coalition by reviving the thesis of OBC-dalit-Muslim unity, which may have resulted in some groups moving towards the Mandal pillar. The latest move may help BJP arrest the drift and make fresh bridges.It was, however, not clear that the estimate of a nationalist resurgence, which will supplant any 'savarna' resentment over caste census, was part of the larger calculus. In addition, BJP insiders suggested the party stands on a stronger footing, having seized the main talking point from the opposition by taking the initiative, which Congress could not achieve despite its long governance tenure.They said that the party can rightfully claim that it has delivered while Congress only talked about it. While there was initial apprehension about the decision on caste enumeration, the overall assessment was that the caste surveys in some of the states had not caused much turbulence on the ground.BJP sources said that there was no ""unease"" as PM Modi is himself an OBC, while parties like Samajwadi Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal, are identified with dominant OBC castes, which can repel with polarisation of smaller castes against it. The party is also confident of upper caste support as it has already implemented a 10% quota for the economically weaker sections (EWS).Janata Dal (United) national working president Sanjay Kumar Jha also welcomed the move, calling it a significant step for the upliftment of deprived sections. ""Nitish Kumar clearly believes that it is necessary to have accurate data of various castes for the purpose of reducing socio-economic inequality and making accurate plans for the welfare of the targeted sections,"" he added.",The move was closely associated with chief minister Nitish Kumar. A major consideration appears to have been to check attempts to split Hindus on caste lines. The decision came hours after a one-on-one meeting between PM Narendra Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120776491,imgsize-64496,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Centre's big caste census move: Masterstroke or political compulsion?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centres-big-caste-census-move-masterstroke-or-political-compulsion/articleshow/120770419.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Caste census , which has been a key demand of several opposition parties in the last many elections, will finally be a reality with the Centre on Wednesday announcing nationwide caste count along with the next population census.The government, which had till now strongly resisted opposition demands for a caste census, justified its U-turn, citing the ""political and non-transparent"" caste enumeration being conducted by some opposition-ruled states in the name of surveys.Announcing the decision taken by the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs, Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the census comes under the purview of the Centre, but some states have done caste enumeration in ""non-transparent"" manner, which has created doubts in society.""Considering all these facts and to ensure that the social fabric is not disturbed by politics, caste enumeration should be transparently included in the census instead of surveys,"" the Union minister said.However, the opposition was quick to claim victory and, as expected, there were many credit-takers within their ranks. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , who had made caste census a key issue in the last several elections and was very aggressive with his attacks on the government, welcomed the ""sudden"" decision and said, ""We want people's census, not bureaucrats' census.""""We had said in Parliament that we will make the caste census happen. We had also said that we would scrap the 50 per cent cap, the artificial wall that is in place. Narendra Modi used to say that there are just four castes. Don't know what happened but suddenly after 11 years, caste census has been announced. We completely support it, but we want a timeline. We want to know that by when this will happen,"" Rahul said.The Congress leader was also quick to pitchfork the party-ruled Telangana model of caste census as a blueprint for the national count. ""This is the first step. Telangana has become a model in caste census and it can become a blueprint. We offer our support to the government in designing the caste census. There are two examples - Bihar's and Telangana's and there is a vast difference between the two,"" he added.RJD chief Lalu Prasad said that the Centre's decision is yet another example of how socialist ideas, once dismissed or ridiculed, are eventually adopted by mainstream political forces.""What we socialists proposed 30 years ago -- be it reservation, caste census, equality, fraternity, secularism -- others take decades to follow. There is still a long way to go. But make no mistake -- we will keep making these Sanghis dance to our agenda,"" Lalu Yadav said.Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP John Brittas claimed the government has done a ""volte-face"" in view of the upcoming Bihar elections ""Welcome the caste census, though it is a reversal looking at the Bihar elections. The PM had said he only recognised four castes -- the poor, youth, women, and farmers!! This volte-face is ok but this nation has been denied of the census which was due in 2021!"" he said.The Centre's decision to include caste enumeration in the forthcoming census exercise was a ""hard-earned victory"" for the DMK and Tamil Nadu government, said Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin.The DMK chief said: ""After the failure of all its attempts to deny and delay the much-needed caste enumeration, the Union BJP Government has finally announced that it will be conducted along with the forthcoming Census. But key questions remain unanswered - when will the Census begin? When will it conclude?""""The same Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) who once accused opposition parties of dividing people on caste has now yielded to the very demand, he maligned repeatedly,"" the Tamil Nadu CM said.Caste census was essential, but not optional, for objective policymaking, targeted welfare, and the pursuit of real social justice. ""You cannot remedy injustice without first recognising its scale,"" he added.For the Tamil Nadu government and DMK, this was a hard-earned victory. ""We were the first to adopt a resolution in the Legislative Assembly demanding caste census. We championed this cause in every forum. We reiterated this demand in every meeting with the Prime Minister and through multiple letters, consistently urging the Union Government to take responsibility,"" Stalin said.Ironically, several allies of the BJP in the NDA also welcomed the Centre's decision.The JD(U) said it was its president and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar who created a favourable ground for the development by carrying out a caste survey in Bihar. Its working president, Sanjay Kumar Jha, said the decision will help make a programme for the deprived sections of the society more focussed.Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president Chirag Paswan said it is an important decision in national interest, saying that his party had long called for it. The decision will be a big step in the country's equitable development, the Union minister said, adding that caste census will help ""make more just and focused policies"". Paswan said that ""misleading claims"" were made about relations between him and the central government over the issue, and that the decision is a clear answer to such rumours.Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde called the government's decision a historic milestone in the country's journey towards social justice that will help in the equitable distribution of resources. ""The caste census will usher in a new era of social justice by enabling accurate policy-making based on the actual demographic data of different castes,"" Shinde said.Several BJP leaders and Union ministers welcomed the government's move and slammed the Congress for its double standards on the issue.Home minister Amit Shah, BJP president JP Nadda and a host of other leaders, including the party's OBC faces, lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan describing it as an unprecedented development towards the cause of social justice.Now, contrast this to what Prime Minister Modi had said on caste census when 26 opposition parties led by the Congress under the INDIA bloc had passed a resolution in favour of caste census.""The Congress is trying to create a divide among people in the name of caste, language and region in its attempt to regain power,"" the Prime Minister had said in February 2024 at an election rally in Madhya Pradesh’s Jhabua district.Clearly, with the opposition's relentless caste census pitch, the BJP seems to have made a course correction. The saffron party will hope that this move will leave the opposition bereft of an important election plank, especially in Bihar, where elections are due later this year. The opposition, meanwhile, will not just claim victory but will also claim that its consistent pressure had forced the government to change its stand on an important social issue. As Rahul Gandhi claimed, ""we have shown that we can pressure the government.""","Caste census has been a key demand of several opposition parties in the last many elections. The government justified its U-turn, citing the ""political and non-transparent"" caste enumeration being conducted by some opposition-ruled states in the name of surveys.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120771259,imgsize-239898,width-400,resizemode-4/Image-generated-by-AI-for-representation-.jpg"

: Though this UPA-era effort collected caste data, the findings were never fully released or utilised, prompting criticism. State-level surveys: In recent years, states like Bihar, Telangana, and Karnataka conducted their own caste surveys to guide welfare schemes and reservations. Bihar's 2023 survey found that OBCs and Extremely Backward Classes made up more than 63% of its population.

Why caste census matters

What next?

NEW DELHI: Caste enumeration was a regular feature of census exercises during British rule from 1881 to 1931. However, with the first census of independent India in 1951, the government chose to discontinue the practice, except for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).By 1961, the central government permitted states to conduct their own surveys and compile state-specific lists of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), if they wished.More than six decades later, amid growing political and social demands, the government has now approved the inclusion of caste enumeration in the upcoming nationwide census.The last attempt at caste data collection at a national level took place in 2011 through the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), intended to assess the socio-economic condition of households alongside caste information.A caste census involves systematically recording individuals’ caste identities during a national census. In India, where caste influences social, economic, and political life, such data can offer valuable insights into the distribution and socio-economic status of various caste groups. This information can help shape policies related to affirmative action and social justice.Beyond statistics, the caste census has deep social and political implications.According to activists, the data could help redesign affirmative action policies , improve representation, and address entrenched inequalities.“Much of access to essential services in India—education, healthcare, nutrition, and social protection—is shaped by structural inequalities of caste, region, religion, and economic status. A caste census is critical to uncover these intersectional disparities and to design policies and programs that are truly equitable and inclusive,” Poonam Muttreja, executive director, population foundation of India told news agency PTI.While some view the caste census as necessary to uplift marginalised communities, others argue it may reinforce caste divisions.The decision marks a major shift after more than 70 years of hesitation. However, details on how the data will be collected, categorised, and applied are yet to be clarified.The move is expected to significantly influence governance, electoral politics, and India's broader battle against inequality. A timeline for the census exercise has not been announced.","Caste enumeration was a regular feature of census exercises during British rule from 1881 to 1931.

Courts can modify arbitral awards: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/courts-can-modify-arbitral-awards-sc/articleshow/120776743.cms,"NEW DELHI: Settling divergent judicial pronouncements on the scope of judicial interference in an arbitral award, a five-judge bench of Supreme Court on Wednesday said that to avoid protracted litigation, courts have powers to modify an award to sustain it by severing the 'invalid' portion from its 'valid' part rather than quashing it entirely.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna , CJI-designate B R Gavai and Justices Sanjay Kumar, K V Viswanthan and A G Masih was grappling with a long-standing grey area - when the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, does not expressly permit courts to modify or vary an arbitral award, should courts strike down awards even when it could be saved by minor modifications? Under Section 34 of the Act, a court can only strike down an award.Writing the 37-page 4:1 majority judgment, CJI Khanna said, ""We are of the opinion that modification represents a more limited, nuanced power in comparison to the annulment of an award, as the latter entails a more severe consequence of the award being voided in toto.""""The limited and restricted power of severing an award implies a power of the court to vary or modify the award. It will be wrong to argue that silence in the 1996 Act, as projected, should be read as a complete prohibition,"" he said. Justice Viswanathan penned a 130-page dissent and said courts do not have the power to modify an award as the parties had eschewed the path of litigation to go for arbitration.CJI Khanna said, ""We are thus of the opinion that the court can apply the doctrine of severability and modify a portion of the award while retaining the rest. This is subject to parts of the award being separable, legally and practically.""The majority judgment said courts can also correct clerical, computational and typographical errors apparent in the award and modify the post-award interest rate. CJI Khanna said striking down an award in its totality just because there was no agreement over rate of interest would cause grave prejudice to parties, who would then have to undergo a fresh round of arbitration.""This limited power is significant, as it can help avoid further rounds of litigation. Without it, the court may be forced to set aside the entire award or order a fresh round of arbitration because of an erroneous interest rate rather than simply adjusting this rate,"" the CJI said.Referring to the extraordinary powers of SC under Article 142 of the Constitution, which enables it to pass any order for the purpose of doing complete justice, the five-judge bench sounded a caution and said this power must be exercised with great care and caution while dealing with arbitral awards .","The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, does not expressly permit courts to modify or vary an arbitral award.

Man loses interim custody of daughter for failing to give home-cooked food during her stay with him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/man-loses-interim-custody-of-daughter-for-failing-to-give-home-cooked-food-during-her-stay-with-him/articleshow/120776711.cms,"AI generated image

NEW DELHI: A man lost interim custody of his eight-year-old daughter, ordered by Kerala HC to stay with her estranged parents alternatively for 15 days in a month, for not being able to provide home-cooked food even for a single day during the stay with him.After interacting with the child, a bench of SC Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta found several reasons - the girl not getting home-cooked food, separated from her three-year-old brother, and no one except father for company - for quashing the HC order on the ground that even though he is a doting father, the surroundings and circumstances at his place is not conducive for her.The man, working at Singapore, had rented out a place in Thiruvananthapuram and used to fly down every month to be with his daughter.Writing the judgment, Justice Mehta said, ""Continued consumption of food procured from restaurants/hotels would pose a health hazard, even to a grown-up person, what to talk of a tender aged child of eight years. The child requires nutritious home-cooked food for her overall well-being, growth and development. Unfortunately, the father is not in a position to provide such nutrition to the child.""SC said it would have considered asking the father to provide home-cooked food, but ""the fact that the child gets no company whatsoever except for that of the father during the interim custody period of 15 days is an additional factor which weighs heavily against his claim for the child's custody at this stage.""Finding the mother works from home and has her parents with her, SC said the girl would get better company at mother's place in addition to the company of her brother.SC also frowned at the HC order granting 15-day custody every month of the three year-old son to the man, terming it ""grossly unjustified"" which could have serious adverse effect on the emotional and physical well-being of the son being forced to be separated from the mother at a tender age.""Hence, the emotional and moral support which the child gets at her mother's home is manifold than what is being provided by the father during the interim custody period. The period of 15 days during which the daughter would be with the father would also lead to deprivation of her company to her sibling, the boy child aged three years,"" it said.SC allowed the man to get interim custody of the daughter on alternate Saturdays and Sundays of every month and interact with them on video call two days every week. ""On either of these two days, father will be entitled to meet & have interim custody of the child for a period of four hours subject to the comfort of the child and under supervision of a child counsellor,"" it said.","A man lost interim custody of his eight-year-old daughter, ordered by Kerala HC to stay with her estranged parents alternatively for 15 days in a month.

New Delhi: Ruling that right to digital access is an intrinsic part of the fundamental right to life and liberty , Supreme Court Wednesday said it is a constitutional imperative for the Centre and its authorities to bridge the digital divide faced by large sections of the country's rural population, senior citizens, economically weaker communities, linguistic minorities and differently-abled persons.SC passed a slew of directions to revise the current KYC process for visually- and hearing-impaired users, and to develop alternative formats - including Braille and voice-enabled services - to ensure accessibility for all.At this juncture, we may also wish to observe that in the contemporary era, where access to essential services, governance, education, healthcare and economic opportunities is increasingly mediated through digital platforms, the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution must be reinterpreted in light of these technological realities. The digital divide — characterised by unequal access to digital infrastructure, skills, and content — continues to perpetuate systemic exclusion, not only of persons with disabilities, but also of large sections of rural populations, senior citizens, economically weaker communities, and linguistic minorities. The principle of substantive equality demands that digital transformation be both inclusive and equitable,” Supreme Court said.Justice R Mahadevan, who penned the verdict for the bench also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala, on petitions filed by two acid attack victims who suffer facial disfigurement and 100% blindness, said that true inclusion requires that technological advancements accommodate the diverse needs of all citizens, thereby fostering an environment where no individual is left behind. The petitioners alleged that they are facing difficulties in completing the digital KYC/e-KYC process due to their inability to click a “live photograph” by blinking and which has prevented them from opening a bank account and purchasing a SIM card from the telecom providers.Allowing their plea, the bench directed govt authorities including RBI to issue guidelines to adopt alternative modes for verifying the “liveness” or capturing a “live photograph” of the customers for the purpose of conducting digital KYC to ensure inclusivity and user-convenience. It also ordered them to continue with the paper-based KYC process.“Bridging the digital divide is no longer merely a matter of policy discretion but has become a constitutional imperative to secure a life of dignity, autonomy and equal participation in public life. Right to digital access, therefore, emerges as an intrinsic component of right to life and liberty, necessitating that State proactively design and implement inclusive digital ecosystems that serve not only privileged but also the marginalised, those who have been historically excluded,” it said.","SC passed a slew of directions to revise the current KYC process for visually- and hearing-impaired users, and to develop alternative formats - including Braille and voice-enabled services. “The principle of substantive equality demands that digital transformation be both inclusive and equitable,” Supreme Court said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120776603,imgsize-157042,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Despite notching its first quarterly sales gain in over a year, the coffee giant acknowledged that its recovery is still in progress.Visa shares rose slightly, up less than 1%, after the company exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for second-quarter revenue and earnings. Visa noted that consumer spending remained strong last quarter, despite recent consumer confidence surveys showing growing concern about the effects of Trump’s tariffs.Investors were also awaiting quarterly earnings reports from tech giants Microsoft and Meta, parent company of Facebook, scheduled for release after the market close.Corporate leaders have voiced uncertainty over how long their companies can sustain profits amid the ongoing trade war, citing a lack of clear direction from the Trump administration.There are growing fears that the president’s tariff policies could trigger a recession by disrupting global trade and driving prices higher across a wide range of products.Later Wednesday, the government is expected to release its first estimate for US first-quarter GDP growth, with economists predicting growth of less than 1% during the January–March period.A separate report on consumer spending, which includes the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, is also due.In Europe, the eurozone economy grew by 0.4% in the first quarter—an improvement from the last quarter of 2024.

Elon Musk's connection to Ozempic

In a major crackdown, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seized hundreds of counterfeit Ozempic injections on April 9, 2025, amid growing concerns over unregulated and fake versions of the popular diabetes and weight-loss drug. Europe’s largest drugmaker, Novo Nordisk, warned that these counterfeit units were circulating outside its authorized supply chain in the United States, posing potential risks to patients. Ozempic, chemically known as semaglutide, has skyrocketed in demand due to its effectiveness in treating diabetes and aiding weight loss. Novo Nordisk is also Europe's largest company by market cap.The drug, also the active ingredient in Novo’s weight-loss drug Wegovy, gained further attention when Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk revealed on Christmas 2024 that he used a similar medication, Mounjaro, to shed pounds. In a festive social media post captioned “Ozempic Santa,” Musk joined a growing list of public figures openly discussing their use of GLP-1 agonists, a class of drugs hailed as a breakthrough for obesity and diabetes management.The FDA is now investigating the seized counterfeit Ozempic injections, conducting visual examinations and chemical testing to determine their identity, quality, and safety. Neither the FDA nor Novo Nordisk has released further details about the fake drugs’ composition or potential dangers. Novo Nordisk has urged pharmacies to source Ozempic only from authorized distributors and advised patients to inspect their medication for signs of tampering or counterfeiting before use.The rise in counterfeit Ozempic comes amid a broader surge in unregulated and compounded versions of semaglutide-based drugs, fueled by their popularity. On April 24, 2025, Novo Nordisk won a significant legal battle to halt certain compounding pharmacies from selling knockoff versions of its GLP-1 drugs, reinforcing its efforts to protect patients and maintain supply chain integrity.As the investigation continues, the FDA and Novo Nordisk are emphasizing the importance of vigilance to ensure the safety of patients relying on these life-changing medicatioOn Christmas 2024, Elon Musk posted a photo of himself on Twitter dressed up in a Santa costume, captioning the picture, ""Ozempic Santa."" ""Technically, Mounjaro, but that doesn't have the same ring to it,"" he added. Musk's post highlighted just how mainstream weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy have become in recent years as public figures openly admit to using them, helping transform perceptions and conversations around weight loss.Mounjaro, Ozempic, and Wegovy belong to a trending class of medications called GLP-1 agonists, widely regarded as transformative for those battling obesity and diabetes, and at risk of heart attack or stroke. Elon Musk is among the latest high-profile figures to openly share their use of weight-loss drugs.","FDA seized hundreds of counterfeit Ozempic injections on April 9, 2025, amid growing concerns over unregulated and fake versions of the popular diabetes and weight-loss drug.

Read Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan full letter to employees

Team,

Today we reported our Q1 2025 results. It was a step in the right direction as we delivered revenue, gross margin and EPS (earnings per share) above our guidance, driven by Dave and Michelle’s leadership. I want to thank them both, and all of you, for the good execution.

We need to build on this progress — and it won’t be easy. We are navigating an increasingly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment, which is reflected in our Q2 outlook. On top of that, there are many areas where we must improve. We need to confront our challenges head-on and take swift actions to get back on track.

As I have said, this starts by revamping our culture. The feedback I have received from our customers and many of you has been consistent. We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways — and we need to change.

Our flatter Executive Team (ET) structure that I shared last week was a first step. The next step is to drive greater simplicity, speed and collaboration across the entire company. To achieve these objectives, today I am announcing some important changes.

Becoming an Engineering-Focused Company

We need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers. That’s why I elevated our core engineering functions to the ET. And many of the changes we will be driving are designed to make engineers more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation.

To make necessary investments in our engineering talent and technology roadmaps, we need to find new ways to reduce our costs. While we have taken significant actions in the last year, our current cost structure is still well above competitive benchmarks. With that in mind, we have reduced our operating expense and capital spending targets going forward, which I will discuss during our investor call this afternoon.

Flattening the Organization

As we refocus on engineering, we will also remove organizational complexity. Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down. I have asked the ET to take a fresh look at their respective orgs, with a focus on removing layers, increasing spans of control and empowering top performers. Our competitors are lean, fast and agile — and that’s what we must become to improve our execution.

I’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people. We will embrace this mindset across the company, which will include empowering our top talent to make decisions and take greater ownership of key priorities.

There is no way around the fact that these critical changes will reduce the size of our workforce. As I said when I joined, we need to make some very hard decisions to put our company on a solid footing for the future. This will begin in Q2 and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months.

We are going to be very intentional about where we focus these efforts and how we stack up against the best in the industry. We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities. These decisions will not be made lightly, and we will keep you regularly informed.

Streamlining Our Processes

It has been eye-opening for me to see how much time and energy is spent on internal administrative work that does not move our business forward. We need to radically simplify this to maximize the time spent focusing on our customers.

I am instructing our leaders to eliminate unnecessary meetings and significantly reduce the number of meeting attendees. Too much valuable time is being wasted. We will also modernize processes with a focus on live dashboards and better data to ensure we have the real-time insights we need to make better and faster decisions.

In addition, I have decided to make our formal Insights and OKR requirements optional. While it’s crucial for us to stay accountable for our results and receive feedback on our performance, I believe we can achieve this in a simpler and more flexible way. Along the same lines, we will cut back on time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation.

Returning to the Office

Our existing policy is that our hybrid employees should spend approximately three days per week on site. Adherence to this policy has been uneven at best. I strongly believe that our sites need to be vibrant hubs of collaboration that reflect our culture in action.

When we spend time together in person, it fosters more engaging and productive discussion and debate. It drives better and faster decision-making. And it strengthens our connection with colleagues.

With that in mind, we will be updating our policy to require four days per week on site by Sept. 1. I wanted to tell you well in advance so that you have time to make any adjustments to your daily routines. We are going to work hard in the meantime to ensure sites are ready to operate at full capacity. Your local leadership will share site-specific details and seek your input on how to create the best possible on-site experience.

Building a New Intel

I realize this is a lot to take in, but we are playing from behind and we need to rally as a team to put ourselves in the best possible position to win.

This requires us to be laser-focused on developing the best products. We need to delight our customers and earn their trust by delivering the performance, quality and reliability they need to succeed. We must demonstrate predictable execution and ensure on-time delivery. And we need to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders.

There are two ways teams can respond at make-or-break moments like this: They can look at the gap they need to close and give up — or they can look inside themselves and fight like never before.

I made my choice last month when I decided to join you all, and there is no place I would rather be right now. I came on board knowing full well this would be the most challenging job of my career, but also the most motivating and fulfilling — because we have opportunities ahead that most people don’t get in their careers.

I’m talking about the opportunity to fundamentally reinvent an industry icon. To pull off a comeback that will be studied in business schools for generations to come. To create new technologies and deploy them at scale to change the world for the better.

Intel was once widely seen as the world’s most innovative company. There’s no reason we can’t get back there, so long as we drive the changes needed to improve.

It’s going to be hard. It will require painful decisions. But we will make them knowing it’s what we must do to serve our customers better as we build a new Intel for the future – and I have great confidence in the power of our team and our people to make it happen.

Thank you for everything you did in Q1. I look forward to talking more tomorrow during our All Company Meeting.

Lip-Bu Tan

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has announced sweeping restructuring measures including layoffs, management cuts, and an expanded return-to-office mandate as the struggling chipmaker attempts to regain its competitive edge. The changes aim to eliminate ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" and streamline operations to foster innovation, and Tan notes that “this starts by revamping our [company’s] culture.""""I've been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I'm a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The company didn’t specify the exact number of job cuts, but with around 108,900 employees at the end of last year, reports suggest up to 20% of the workforce could be impacted.""Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The new CEO, who has been at the helm for only five weeks, is targeting $1.5 billion in operating expense reductions over the next two years.The flattening will begin in Q2, and Tan says will be continuing into the next few months.These cuts follow a previous round of layoffs just eight months ago when Intel eliminated 15,000 positions.The restructuring prioritizes engineering talent and aims to make engineers ""more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation."" Tan is shifting focus away from measuring management success by team size toward a leaner structure emphasizing execution.The announcement followed Intel's underwhelming first-quarter earnings, highlighting the company's ongoing challenges in adapting to the industry's pivot toward artificial intelligence—a priority CEO Tan emphasized for the future.Intel also recently announced that starting September 1, it will require four in-office days weekly from its employees. This change replaced the company's two-day remote policy to boost collaboration. Tan made this announcement as a part of a strategic roadmap during the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call.","CEO Lip-Bu Tan: ""We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways"" ""We need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers,"" Tan says.

Elon Musk acknowledges Tesla ‘pain’ during Q1 earnings

Tesla CEO Elon Musk , a close ally of Donald Trump leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has reportedly lost $113 billion since January this year. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Musk’s wealth has declined by 25% since January 17. The tech CEO owns multiple private companies that include space firm SpaceX , brain-chip company Neuralink , electric vehicle company Tesla microblogging platform X and AI company xAI . The loss is largely attributed to a decrease in Tesla shares which have dropped by up to 33% since Trump’s inauguration. Musk has played an important role in Trump’s second term as US President so far. He has attended meetings with President Donald Trump, foreign leaders, and top government officials. He has also led efforts to shut down many government agencies as the public face of DOGE .So much so that Elon Musk reportedly joined Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, an indication of his strong ties with the US President.However, Tesla, the only one of Musk’s companies that is publicly traded and a major part of his personal wealth, took a hit of his close association with the Trump administration. Since Trump’s inauguration, Tesla’s stock has fallen 33%. The company’s sales have dropped and Tesla stores have also become victims of several protests across countries.A Bloomberg report quotes Elaine Kamarck, the director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution in Washington who said “This is 100 days of destruction. DOGE is cutting into muscle, not fat. Elon Musk is taking a lot of the heat for Trump’s decisions, and people have decided to hate Musk more than Trump.”Speaking at Tesla Q1 earnings call, Elon Musk said “Starting next month, May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly”. He also addressed protests against Tesla, stating “The protests that you’ll see out there, they’re very organized. He further claimed that some of these protesters are likely protesting “because they’re receiving fraudulent money” or are “recipients of wasteful largesse.”","Elon Musk's wealth has declined by 25% since January 17, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Now the Modi government is making arrangements for counting.

But how long can the voice of millions demanding their rights be suppressed? Now the Modi government has agreed to conduct a caste census. Well, better late than never! This is a decisive step towards ensuring social justice. This is a victory for millions of people in India. It is a victory for all those who have been fighting for years for equality, fairness, and representation,"" he added.However, BJP's IT cell head Amit Malviya countered this narrative, pointing out the Congress party's historical resistance to caste-based census.""Congress governments have consistently opposed caste-based census until now. In every census conducted since independence, caste has not been counted. In 2010, then Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh assured in the Lok Sabha that the Cabinet would consider the caste census. After this, a Cabinet Committee was formed, in which most political parties recommended a caste-based census. Despite this, the Congress government deemed it appropriate to conduct only a survey (SECC) instead of a caste census,"" BJP leader Amit Malviya said.""Even after this, Congress and its allied parties used the issue of caste census merely for their political benefit,"" he added.Union minister Kiren Rijiju also attacked Congress for taking credit and said that grand-old-party can ""only talk.""I fail to understand why is Congress party taking credit??"" Rijiju said.""Congress Party had opposed Caste Census & Reservations on records. PM Narendra Modi ji has taken right decision at right time.

Thank you, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the cabinet,"" he added.A caste census involves systematically recording individuals’ caste identities during a national census. In India, where caste influences social, economic, and political life, such data can offer valuable insights into the distribution and socio-economic status of various caste groups. This information can help shape policies related to affirmative action and social justice.Caste enumeration was a regular feature of census exercises during British rule from 1881 to 1931. However, with the first census of independent India in 1951, the government chose to discontinue the practice, except for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).","The Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs has approved the inclusion of caste enumeration in the forthcoming census.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"
Cheap parcels from China will no longer be duty-free. Here's what it means for buyers and sellers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cheap-parcels-from-china-will-no-longer-be-duty-free-heres-what-it-means-for-buyers-and-sellers/articleshow/120783444.cms,"AI Image

NEW YORK: Consumers can expect higher prices and delivery delays when the Trump administration ends a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China Friday.The expiration of the so-called de minimis rule that has allowed as many as 4 million low-value parcels to come into the US every day - mostly from China - is also forcing businesses that have built their models on sourcing production in China to rethink their practices in order to keep their costs down.But some might actually benefit from the termination of the duty exemption. For instance, companies that make their goods in the US may feel relief from the competition of cheap Chinese imports, and likely experience a brighter sales outlook.The move, which applies to goods originating from mainland China and Hong Kong, comes on top of President Donald Trump 's new tariffs totaling 145% on China. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on the US, fueling a trade war between the world's two largest economies. Sellers are already seeing cautious consumers.On Wednesday, Trump called the de minimis exemption ""a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.""""We put an end to it,"" he said.What's the de minimis provision? Introduced in 1938, the de minimis exception was intended to facilitate the flow of small packages valued at no more than $5, the equivalent of about $109 today. The threshold rose to $800 in 2016. But the rapid rise of cross-border e-commerce, driven by China, has challenged the intent of the decades-old customs exception rule.Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service. And the US market has been a major destination.Former President Joe Biden proposed a rule last year that said foreign companies can't avoid tariffs simply by shipping goods that they claim to be worth $800 or less. Trump tried in February to end the exception but his initial order was called off within days when it appeared the US was not prepared to process and collect tariffs on the deluge of parcels coming in.What's the impact on shoppers? Consumers will face higher prices and delivery delays now that parcels will go through a more complicated customs process to enter the US involving declaration and duty payment.Businesses could factor tariffs into the final price, or they can list them separately in the same way as sales taxes. For instance, Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, now lists "" import charges "" that have reportedly doubled many items' prices. (The retailer also has a ""local warehouse"" option for some products, which are shipped from within the US and therefore avoids the import charge.)Meanwhile, Shein, now based in Singapore, has a checkout banner that reads, ""Tariffs are included in the price you pay. You'll never have to pay extra at delivery.""Amazon says it's not planning to display added tariff costs next to product prices on its site - despite a report that sparked speculation the e-commerce giant would soon show the new import charges, and the White House has made fiery comments denouncing the purported change.What about sellers and carriers? Parcel carriers will be burdened with collecting duties, and the paperwork to comply with the new rule could result not only in higher prices but also delays and even disruptions to delivery, said Ram Ben Tzion of the vetting platform Publican.Major commercial carriers such as UPS and FedEx have said they are well-equipped and prepared to collect duties on international parcels in compliance with local laws, including the new US rule.Commercial carriers will be collecting 145% tariffs on declared values. The US Postal Service, a government agency that offers international mail service, can choose either to charge a 120% tariff on low-value packages or a flat fee of $100 per shipment, which is set to rise to $200 on June 1.The US Customs and Border Protection says it ""stands ready to fully implement the restrictions on de minimis shipments and collect all revenue owed for these shipments on May 2, 2025.""However, experts have expressed concerns that the surge in the workload could be a serious challenge.In January and February, more than 70% of the 216 million packages coming into the US were originating from China, according to CBP.What's the impact on businesses? Those that relied on the de minimis exemption are now having to adjust.John Curry, owner and chief executive officer of HAPARI International, an Arizona-based swimwear business, had switched from bulk shipping to de minimis shipping about six months ago to improve cash flow, speed up delivery, and eventually eliminate US-based warehousing. His company makes its products in China and sells them directly to US customers via its own online storefront.Curry said he planned to stay the course and pay the additional 145% duty - one parcel at a time - while waiting for the US and China to work out a more sustainable approach.""There has to be a solution because both countries cannot survive this way,"" Curry said.Izzy Rosenzweig, founder and CEO of the logistic company Portless, helps businesses like HAPARI to ship goods from its China-based warehouse using the de minimis exemption. He says US businesses are likely to stay in China for now given the competitiveness of the manufacturing base and of the supply chain in China but can be expected to raise prices.And while businesses with good profit margins probably will continue to ship from China, those that run on razor-thin profit margins are likely to ""go local"", setting up more US-based warehouses to defray tariff costs, he said.Who benefits? Trade groups representing flag manufacturers and bike dealers said they expect to benefit from the end of the duty exemption.In written comments on the US Trade Representative portal, for instance, the Flag Manufacturers Association of America said its members have been bombarded by an onslaught of American flag imports mostly made in China that are falsely marketed and significantly discounted. The group cited a drop of 25% to 35% in industrywide sales of American-made US flags last year.Larry Severini, CEO of Embroidery Solutions Manufacturing LLC, which makes the star fields for US flag manufacturers, had to shutter one of his two plants in South Carolina earlier this year because of stiff competition from cheap imports. He noted sales have fallen 20% since 2021 in part because of the de minimis exemption.""We need duties to level the playing field to make it fair,"" Severini said.The National Bike Dealers' Association's Heather Mason said shoppers often check out $2,000 bike from a trusted brand like Trek and then they find a lookalike online for $1,200 - often with lower quality parts, no warranty, no service, and safety risks.""Reputable brands follow strict safety, labor, and warranty standards,"" she said in an email to The Associated Press. ""De minimis allowed bad actors to dodge these.""",The Trump administration is ending a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China. The move applies to goods originating from mainland China and Hong Kong. It comes on top of President Donald Trump's new tariffs totaling 145% on China.

"Starbase, Texas? Elon Musk’s SpaceX hub may soon become an official city",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/starbase-texas-elon-musks-spacex-hub-may-soon-become-an-official-city/articleshow/120781718.cms,"(This is an AI image)

Billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long embraced Texas as both a business hub and a playground, launching rockets, building cars, and envisioning a utopian community for his workers on the rural outskirts of Austin.Now, a new Musk venture is nearing success: a vote on Saturday that could officially transform a small area of coastal South Texas, home to his SpaceX rocket company, into a city called ""Starbase,"" the Associated Press reported.The initiative appears headed for success, given that many eligible voters are his employees. This would mark a positive development for the billionaire, whose public image has suffered following his involvement in federal spending reductions and an unsuccessful $20 million investment in Wisconsin Supreme Court elections.His Tesla automotive enterprise has experienced declining profits.County election records indicate that by Tuesday, approximately 200 of 283 eligible voters had participated in early voting. While Musk voted in the county during November elections, his name does not appear among early voters.The proposed municipality, whilst appearing as a wealthy individual's personal project, enjoys considerable local support. However, there are growing worries about how the city's establishment and related legislative measures might affect public access to a beloved recreational area traditionally known as the ""poor people's beach.""The prospective municipality, situated at Texas's southernmost point near the Mexican border, encompasses roughly 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometres).The area features sparse roadways, scattered airstream caravans and basic houses from the 1950s. Voters will cast their ballots in a facility on Memes St, a playful reference to Musk's social media platform X.The concept of establishing Starbase was initially proposed by Musk in 2021. SpaceX leadership has remained reticent about their motivations for creating a company-controlled municipality and has not addressed recent enquiries.However, ongoing disputes regarding beach accessibility indicate potential underlying interests.SpaceX's operational activities, including rocket launches , engine testing, and equipment transportation at the launch facility, necessitate closing nearby highways and restricting access to Boca Chica State Park and Beach.Currently, these closures require coordination with Cameron County authorities. Pending state legislation would transfer primary oversight to the new municipality, coinciding with SpaceX's application to the Federal Aviation Administration to increase annual launches from five to 25.SpaceX representatives indicate the proposed legislation would enhance operational efficiency for the company, which maintains contracts with the Department of Defense and NASA for its Starship heavy rocket programme, including planned lunar missions and eventual Mars expeditions.""This fully reusable rocket system keeps the US ahead of global competitors like China, and its being developed right here in South Texas,"" SpaceX Vice President of Starship Legal and Regulatory Sheila McCorkle wrote to state lawmakers.""We need to carry on our mission of turning South Texas into the Gateway to Mars and making humankind multiplanetary,"" McCorkle added. She noted the company's $4 billion investments and thousands of jobs in Texas.Public response has been mixed. Numerous SpaceX employees submitted identical supportive statements, while opponents express concerns about private control over public beach access.Supporters of SpaceX’s plan praised the company’s contributions to the area, highlighting job creation and investments. However, opponents argues that granting Musk and his company too much control over a popular beach, which attracts tens of thousands of visitors annually, would be a mistake.Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino Jr emphasised that the county has managed beach closures responsibly and sees no need to shift authority to the new city. ""SpaceX is a strong economic driver in our region, one of which we are extremely proud,"" Trevino said in a letter to state lawmakers, the Associated Press reported.Another proposed bill would make it a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to 180 days in jail, for failing to evacuate the beach when ordered. However, this measure would only take effect if the new city gained control over beach closures.In a temporary setback for Musk and SpaceX, a state House panel recently rejected a bill that would have transferred the authority to close beaches for rocket launches from the local county government to the proposed new city.","Billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long embraced Texas as both a business hub and a playground.

Poverty, witchcraft

Lively prayer

VATICAN CITY: Ghana's Cardinal Peter Turkson is seen as one of the Church's most influential men from Africa, where Christianity is quickly growing -- and which some believe could be the birthplace of the next pope.The 76-year-old born into a humble family of 10 children is the first clergyman from the west African country to receive a red hat, having been made cardinal in 2003 by John Paul II.Turkson currently serves as chancellor for two pontifical academies, that of sciences and social sciences.Even before former pope Benedict XVI's surprise resignation in 2013, the cardinal had been considered Africa's frontrunner for papal contender -- generating countless speculative headlines about the first black pope .But Turkson demurred in a 2010 interview: ""I wouldn't want to be that first black pope.""""I think he'll have a rough time.""The possibility of Turkson as pope reflects shifting Church demographics -- from Europe, where membership is dwindling, to Africa, where Christianity is growing the fastest.Born in the southern mining town of Nsuta-Wassa, Turkson was the fourth of 10 children to a Methodist mother who sold vegetables and a Catholic father, a carpenter.He was ordained in 1975 before leaving Ghana to study in Rome and New York.In 1992, then-pope John Paul II named Turkson the Archbishop of Cape Coast, a diocese of about 300,000 Catholics that grew under his watch.In 2003, the pontiff promoted him to cardinal.In Ghana in 2008, Turkson acted as mediator on a peace council following close elections that threatened to erupt into violence.A year later he was chosen by Benedict XVI for a key role within a special assembly for Africa by the Synod of Bishops, weighing in on such topics as reconciliation, poverty, AIDS, the brain drain and witchcraft.Benedict again tapped Turkson in 2009 as president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, charged with social justice and human rights.As part of a reform of the Roman Curia -- the government of the Holy See -- Pope Francis in 2016 named Turkson head of a newly created department, the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, that merged the justice and peace council with three others.Shepherding the economic and social issues deemed priorities to Francis, including the environment, Turkson -- who speaks six languages -- visited the World Economic Forum in Davos multiple times to convince business leaders of the perils of trickle-down economics.In 2016, he was dispatched as papal special envoy to South Sudan to try to reconcile warring parties, and during the Covid-19 pandemic, he headed a task force to study the crisis' economic and social fallout.But Turkson resigned as prefect of the dicastery in a 2021 shakeup following an external review and rumoured internal tensions within the division, leaving no Africans among the Vatican's top posts.Although Turkson has criticised anti-gay legislation in Uganda, he defends Catholic sexual morality and has denied that homosexuality is a human rights issue.On the key issue in Africa of condoms, he has suggested they could be useful for monogamous couples in which one partner is HIV-positive, but also that money would be better spent on anti-retroviral drugs for those already infected.Turkson had to apologise in 2012 after a high-profile blunder in which he showed a scare-mongering YouTube video about the rising rate of Muslims in the world during a synod of bishops.Regarding Africans' view of Catholicism, Turkson has suggested that the Evangelical movement has done a better job at converting because the Church has become too cerebral, while Evangelism appeals ""to the heart, with lively music, lively prayer"".""Sometimes we Africans make fun of how Europeans and Americans are such enthusiastic sports fans,"" Turkson said in 2012.""They can yell and shout and sing their hearts out at a soccer or football game, but in church even to sing a hymn seems to be such a penitential exercise.""",Ghana's Cardinal Peter Turkson is seen as one of the Church's most influential men from Africa.

SAN FRANCISCO: A US judge on Wednesday accused Apple of defying an order to loosen its grip on the App Store payment system to the point that criminal charges could be warranted.US District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple ""willfully"" violated an injunction she issued at trial, with the company instead creating new barriers to competition with the App Store and even lying to the court in the process.""That it thought this court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation,"" Gonzalez Rogers said in an order allowing Epic Games to enforce the injunction against Apple.""As always, the cover-up made it worse. For this court, there is no second bite at the apple.""Fortnite-maker Epic launched the case in 2021 aiming to break Apple's grip on the App Store, accusing the iPhone maker of acting like a monopoly in its shop for digital goods or services.After a trial, Gonzalez Rogers ruled that Apple's control of the App Store did not amount to a monopoly, but that it must let developers include links to other online venues for buying content or services.The judge also found at the time that the 30 percent commission Apple charges on App Store sales allowed it ""supracompetitive operating margins"" that were anticompetitive, according to the injunction.Apple's response to the trial order included charging a commission on purchases made linking out of its app store, according to the judge.Apple also imposed new barriers and new requirements including ""scare screens"" to dissuade people from buying digital purchases outside of its App Store, the judge concluded.""In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this court's injunction,"" Gonzalez Rogers said in the ruling.""In stark contrast to Apple's initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option.""An Apple spokesperson told AFP it strongly disagrees with the judge's decision and will appeal to a higher court, but plans to comply.""Apple's 15-30 percent junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act,"" Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.Sweeney's post included a ""peace proposal"" promising to drop current and future litigation on the matter if Apple extends the court's ""Apple-tax-free framework"" worldwide.The judge called on the US attorney's office to investigate whether punitive criminal contempt sanctions against Apple are warranted ""to punish past misconduct and deter future noncompliance.""","Apple accused of defying an order to loosen its grip on the App Store payment system.

"Pakistan military dismisses India’s accusations, tensions soar over Pahalgam attack",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-military-dismisses-indias-accusations-tensions-soar-over-pahalgam-attack/articleshow/120741715.cms,"Poll Do you believe Pakistan's military evidence against India is credible? No, it lacks detail Yes, it is credible

Islamabad: Pakistan’s military rejected on Tuesday India’s accusations linking it to the deadly Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 people, mostly tourists.Addressing a press conference in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) head Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan , particularly Balochistan, while presenting limited evidence. The sharp exchange of allegations has deepened the India-Pakistan rift, raising concerns about a broader confrontation.Chaudhry revealed the arrest of Abdul Majeed near Jhelum on April 25, alleging he was trained in India to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan. Authorities recovered a drone, an IED, and Rs 25,000 (approximately $90) in cash from Majeed, which Chaudhry claimed was proof of India’s covert operations. “India is actively supporting terrorist networks on Pakistani soil,” he alleged, challenging New Delhi to substantiate its claims about Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack. “Seven days have passed, and India has failed to provide a single shred of evidence,” he added.However, Pakistan’s evidence lacks detailed substantiation, raising questions about its weight.India, too, has accused Pakistan of orchestrating the Pahalgam attack without publicly disclosing evidence. In response, India announced the suspension of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, closed the Attari and Wagah borders, and recalled its defence attachés from Islamabad. Pakistan rejected India’s treaty suspension, closed its airspace to Indian flights, and warned that disrupting its water rights would be an “act of war”.Analysts warn that the current standoff risks spiralinginto a broader conflict. The Indus Waters Treaty, a rare success in India-Pakistan diplomacy, has survived previous tensions, and its suspension could have catastrophic consequences for Pakistan, a lower riparian state dependent on the Indus river system.Pakistan’s allegations of Indian-sponsored terrorism, while serious, also demand scrutiny. The evidence presented – centered on Majeed’s arrest – lacks granular detail, and Islamabad’s narrative risks being dismissed as tit-for-tat rhetoric. Both nations’ reliance on public accusations over backchannel diplomacy underscores the erosion of trust.","Pakistan rejects India’s accusations linking it to the deadly Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 people, mostly tourists.
