India plans to position itself as global green hydrogen hub: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-plans-to-position-itself-as-global-green-hydrogen-hub-pm-modi/articleshow/113275747.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday announced his plan to make India a global hub for green hydrogen (GH2), building upon the country's achievement of becoming the first among G20 economies to meet green energy commitment made at 2021 Paris UN climate change conference (CO) nine years ahead of the 2030 target.""We are not resting on these achievements and the nation remains focused on strengthening existing solutions while also looking at new and innovative areas.This is where green hydrogen comes into the picture... We aim to position India as a global hub for production, utilisation, and export of green hydrogen. National Green Hydrogen Mission ( NGHM ) launched in 2023 is a critical step toward realising this ambition. It will drive innovation, build infrastructure, stimulate industry growth, and attract investment in the sector,"" he said in his inaugural speech delivered virtually at the 2nd International Green Hydrogen Conference.Pointing out India's installed non-fossil fuel capacity ""increased 300% and solar energy capacity received a boost of 3,000%"" in the past 10 years, Modi said GH2 can help decarbonise heavy industries and long-haul transport. GH2 is produced through electrolysis using renewable power as opposed to extraction from natural gas, which is termed 'grey'.The rapid expansion in renewables capacity since 2014, when Modi first became PM, provides the foundation for NGHM with a target of achieving five million tonnes of annual GH2 production capacity by 2030. Govt is offering a production-linked incentive of Rs 13,050 crore for GH2 production and Rs 4,440 crore for electrolyser manufacturing.Renewable energy minister Pralhad Joshi said NGHM has the potential to attract Rs 8 lakh crore in investments, generate six lakh jobs and lead to savings of Rs 1 lakh crore by reducing natural gas and ammonia imports. Oil minister Hardeep Puri said NGHM will reduce 15 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.","PM Narendra Modi announced his plan to make India a global hub for green hydrogen.

Looking at the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, your party was not able to agree on seat-sharing policies with your alliance partner Mamata Banerjee-led TMC.

After a pause, he replied that “A” stood for “Alliance,” a moment that seemed to throw the crowd off balance.The student further asked whether it wouldn’t make it redundant to call it the INDIA alliance.Rahul did manage to clarify the ideological foundation of the INDIA bloc. “No, it’s not redundant because the whole idea of the alliance was to put across to the people of India that India is being attacked,” he said, bringing the conversation back to what the alliance stands for, describing it as a united front to challenge BJP’s monopolization of power.Critics from the ruling party were quick to pounce, painting the moment as a representation of the opposition’s broader internal confusion.This comes amid a row over Rahul's remarks where he said that today the ""fight in India is whether a Sikh person will be able to wear his turban, kada, and visit Gurdwara"".","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi at the center of an unexpected candid exchange with a student about the opposition’s much-touted ‘ INDIA Alliance ’ The episode, which began as a straightforward question on coalition dynamics, quickly transformed into a moment that went viral on social media.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113231415,imgsize-502422,width-400,resizemode-4/113231415.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Faced with a huge financial burden caused by the ruling of a nine-judge bench of Supreme Court enabling states to collect royalty on extracted minerals and to levy tax on mineral-bearing land, Centre has sought a review, pointing out several ""errors apparent in the judgment"".Interestingly, the Centre has roped in Madhya Pradesh as a co-petitioner to seek review of the July 25 judgment in an open court hearing and argued that the issue raised by it ""pertains to the fundamental rights of the citizens of the country and raises larger issue of public interest and grave injustice would ensue if the application for oral hearing of the review petition is not allowed"".When senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi , appearing for some mineral-rich states, sought early listing of pending cases relating to dues before a regular bench to follow the nine-judge verdict and give the intended financial relief, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocate A M Singhvi told a bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud about filing of the review petitions by the Centre and a Tata group entity.""Review of a Constitution bench judgement,"" exclaimed the CJI.Dwivedi said the review plea was indicative of the fact that PSUs, who have benefited immensely from extraction of minerals without paying royalty or tax on mineral-bearing land for decades, did not want to pay the minimum amount fixed by the apex court.After Centre and private companies requested the court to make the levies on minerals by states prospective, the nine-judge bench, with Justice B V Nagarathna dissenting, had clarified on Aug 14 that arrears of royalty and tax on mineral-bearing land would be paid in instalments to states from 2005 over the next 12 years. It was also clarified that arrears would not attract interest.The financial implication for public sector undertakings, without interest, has been estimated to be Rs 70,000 crore. This jumps to 1.5 lakh crore if the arrears due from 2005 to be realised from private sector industries are included. Mineral-rich states which will benefit majorly are Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan.Pleading with SC for prospective implementation of its nine-judge bench ruling, Union govt had argued that retrospective application would create a burden humongous enough to ruin many PSUs and industries, dent the larger economy and send prices of almost every product soaring.","The Centre has roped in Madhya Pradesh as a co-petitioner to seek review of the July 25 judgment.

Pocso is now the new weapon in the hands of WB Police, which is being misused to target opposition leaders and more recently protestors, demanding justice in the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital rape and murder,"" the BJP functionary said.He added in this particular instance, after Bengal Police failed to secure police custody of rival party's workers, under the stringent Pocso case, presumably on the instructions of a local TMC functionary, it was decided to attack the judges and harm them physically.""The district police officer, Kumaresh Das, named in the letter, sent criminal elements to cut off electricity at judges' home before assaulting them in the dark of the night.

PM told industry leaders at SEMICON India 2024 as he sought to position India as a manufacturing base and investment destination.He said India's ambition is to ""do whatever it takes to become a semiconductor powerhouse"" of the world.Modi said India's time to lead the ' Silicon Diplomacy ' has arrived, as he flagged the over Rs 1.5 lakh crore investments in semiconductor manufacturing and design that will see the country emerge as a trusted partner for supplying the coveted chips across the world. The comments came amid wariness in the business community in China.Modi said the positive power of technology is amplified when it is combined with democratic values, and reaffirmed India's focus on creating a world that remains functional even in times of crisis. ""India's semiconductor ecosystem is a solution not just for India's challenges but also for global challenges... Our dream is that every device in the world will have an Indian-made chip,"" he said.He highlighted India has been chosen as vice chair of Indo-Pacific Economic Framework's Supply Chain Council and is a key partner in the QUAD Semiconductor Supply Chain Initiative. ""Additionally, agreements have been signed with countries like Japan and Singapore, and India is deepening its cooperation with the US in the semiconductor sector.""He said govt has made special efforts to ensure it provides not just financial incentives to companies investing in semiconductors, but also gives them ease of doing business.The PM also said semiconductor chips are not just limited to technology in India but have also become instrumental in fulfilling the aspirations of citizens through initiatives such as digital public infrastructure (DPI).","PM Narendra Modi set an ambitious target of more than trebling electronics manufacturing in India to $500 billion in six years.

El Niño & Reduced Solar Radiation Linkedto Collapse Of Indus Valley Civilization,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/el-nio-reduced-solar-radiation-linkedto-collapse-of-indus-valley-civilization/articleshow/113241295.cms,"Pune: A study by researchers at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology ( IITM ) has revealed that an interplay of climate factors, strikingly similar to those affecting modern-day monsoons, likely led to the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization over 4,000 years ago.By analyzing ancient cave formations (speleothems) from Gupteswar and Kadapa caves in south India, the study found how reduced solar radiation, El Niño, southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and a negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) collectively weakened the monsoon, triggering the downfall of the ancient civilization.The Indus Valley Civilization included major urban centres like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, along with settlements such as Dholavira, Lothal, and Rakhigarhi. The research team analyzed cave deposits in peninsular India, uncovering a 7,000-year climate record that provided insights into the region’s past climate variations.“What’s fascinating is that the climate patterns we see affecting monsoons today were at play thousands of years ago, shaping the fate of entire civilizations,” said Naveen Gandhi, lead researcher from IITM.The study found that around 4,200 years ago, ITCZ — a critical weather system often described as a “rain belt” — shifted southward, depriving the Indus region of crucial rainfall. Simultaneously, a negative phase of the IOD cooled the eastern Indian Ocean, further weakening the monsoon by reducing moisture transport to the subcontinent. Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is a climate pattern affecting the Indian Ocean.These factors, combined with a period of reduced solar radiation and increased El Niño events, led to prolonged droughts in the Indus Valley.","A study by researchers at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology ( IITM ) has revealed that an interplay of climate factors, strikingly similar to those affecting modern-day monsoons, likely led to the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization over 4,000 years ago.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113241292,imgsize-556952,width-400,resizemode-4/113241292.jpg"

The static-test campaign for the 168mm rocket motor took place at the company’s Propulsion test facility, located at the Indian Institute of Science’s (IISc) Challakere campus, some 200km from Bengaluru.“The test demonstrated impressive results, with the engine achieving a maximum recorded pressure of 11 bar and a peak thrust of 2000N.The total impulse generated during the test reached 54,485.9 Ns, utilising an HTPB-based composite propellant,” Apurwa Masook , co-founder and CEO, told TOI.SpaceFields has chosen Titanium grade 5 (Ti-6Al-4V) as the primary material for constructing the engine, citing its superior strength-to-weight ratio compared to conventional materials like Inconel or steel. This choice allows for significant weight reduction while maintaining the structural integrity needed to withstand the extreme pressures and thrust generated during operation.“A key innovation in the engine’s design is the use of a patent-pending GFRP-based ablative thermal insulation to protect the aerospike’s surface. This composite insulation liner undergoes pyrolysis above 1400K and has been tested to withstand temperatures up to 3000K,” the firm said.The AeroSpike design offers a unique advantage over traditional bell nozzles: altitude compensation. This feature allows for optimum efficiency across various pressure regimes, potentially leading to reduced staging and fuel requirements for orbital missions. SpaceFields is also exploring ways to incorporate thrust vectoring into the aerospike engine, further enhancing its capabilities.This successful test marks a milestone in space technology development, potentially paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective space launch systems in the future.SpaceFields, which has received funding from Startup India Seed Fund , and additional grant support from Boeing India, Govt of Karnataka and Govt of Odisha, in Feb raised $800,000 (Rs 6.5crore), which was earmarked for development and testing of critical hardware and various subsystems, R&D in energetic materials and expanding the company’s team.","IISc-incubated space startup SpaceFields has successfully conducted a hot-fire test of the country’s first AeroSpike Rocket Engine.

Minister for animal husbandry and veterinary services (AHVS) Nilkanth Harlankar has proposed stringent new regulations for pet dog owners in Goa which he said would be notified this week. The new rules have been proposed in the wake of the incident at Anjuna , where a seven-year-old boy was fatally mauled by a pitbull while visiting a neighbour.“The file is already cleared and sent for publication on the Official Gazette . The new regulations will be notified this week. We have rules and guidelines for stray dogs but there is no policy for pet dogs,” Harlankar toldThe minister has mandated that all pet dog owners must now keep their dogs on a leash and use a mouth guard when taking them out in public. Additionally, pet owners will be required to register their dogs and sign an affidavit accepting full responsibility for their pets’ behaviour.“We do not want another Anjuna incident,” Harlankar said. “To ensure the safety of the public, we are enforcing these measures. A strong, secure chain leash and a face shield must be used when the dog is taken outside the owner’s private property. If a dog leaves the compound and causes harm, the owner will be held fully accountable,” he said.He also warned pet dog owners against the potential spread of the rabies virus. “In the event of any rabies infection, the owner is obligated to notify the authorities immediately. There should not be any harm to any person or loss of another animal because of the pet dog,” he said.In the aftermath of the Anjuna incident, PETA India wrote to the department of animal husbandry and veterinary services in Goa and urged govt to implement a policy that bans the breeding, sale, or keeping of aggressive dog breeds.",The new rules have been proposed in the wake of the incident at Anjuna.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"'America's no. 1 condom' allegedly contains cancer-causing 'forever chemicals,' lawsuit claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/americas-no-1-trojan-condom-allegedly-contains-cancer-causing-forever-chemicals-lawsuit-claims/articleshow/113207169.cms,"Study reveals PFAS contamination in condoms and lubricants

PFAS absorption through skin higher than previously thought

A new lawsuit claims that Trojan condoms, marketed as ""America's No. 1 Condom,"" contain toxic ""forever chemicals"" linked to cancer. Plaintiff Matthew Goodman filed the proposed class action in Manhattan federal court, alleging that the condoms contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are harmful to health. PFAS , known for their persistence in the environment and human body, are used in many consumer products for their non-stick and water-resistant properties.Goodman claims lab tests of Trojan Ultra Thin condoms revealed the presence of organic fluorine, a marker for PFAS, and that these chemicals are not disclosed on the packaging. He argues that had he known about the presence of these chemicals, he would not have purchased the product or would have paid significantly less. The lawsuit seeks at least $5 million in damages for customers nationwide who purchased Trojan condoms.PFAS exposure has been linked to several health issues, including cancer, low birth weights, and reduced immune response. Church & Dwight, the manufacturer, has not yet responded to requests for comment following the lawsuit.A study by consumer advocacy group Mamavation has uncovered potential contamination of condoms and lubricants with PFAS, or ""forever chemicals."" The EPA-certified lab testing found traces of PFAS in 14% of the 29 products tested, including Trojan Ultra Thin condoms. The tests detected organic fluorine, a sign of PFAS, in 3 out of 25 condom samples and 1 out of 4 lubricants. These chemicals are widely used for their water, oil, and stain-resistant properties but are persistent and toxic.The contamination is believed to stem from manufacturing processes, where PFAS may be unintentionally introduced into the products. Linda Birnbaum , a scientist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, raised concerns about exposure in sensitive areas of the body, saying, ""The vagina and penis are highly vascular areas, making them more vulnerable to the effects of toxic chemicals.""Mamavation has called for the condom industry to take action to remove PFAS from these products, stressing that the full health risks of exposure in intimate areas are not yet known. Consumers are encouraged to seek safer alternatives while manufacturers work on addressing potential contamination.Recent research, titled Dermal bioavailability of perfluoroalkyl substances using in vitro 3D human skin equivalent models, has shown that perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can be absorbed through the skin at higher levels than previously believed. In the study, human skin models were exposed to 17 different PFAS compounds, and certain chemicals, such as perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), had the highest absorption rates, at 58.9% and 48.7%, respectively.Shorter-chain PFAS, particularly those with carbon chains of eight or fewer atoms, showed greater absorption compared to longer-chain variants, which tend to accumulate in the skin rather than being directly absorbed. The study also suggested that factors like skin pH could influence how PFAS penetrate the skin. Even in ionised forms, PFAS can still permeate the skin, indicating that dermal exposure may be a significant source of PFAS absorption.","Plaintiff Matthew Goodman filed the proposed class action in Manhattan federal court.

In a remarkable archaeological discovery, a homeowner in Klotzow, Germany, has unearthed a rare 12th-century "" picture stone "" while conducting construction work. This ancient artefact, known as a ""bildstein,"" is a valuable addition to the limited number of such stones found along the Baltic coast of Germany and Poland, with only about 20 having been discovered to date.The intricately carved stone features a detailed depiction of a figure believed to be Otto of Bamberg , a prominent bishop known for his role in spreading Christianity throughout the Pomerania region.Otto, who lived from 1060 to 1139, was instrumental in the Christianization of what is now modern-day Germany and Poland and, and was noted for his diplomatic and religious influence in the area.The carving on the stone includes a figure dressed in a cap, shawl, and robe, and holding what appears to be a banner. A distinctive cross etched onto the shawl suggests that the figure could be a high-ranking religious official. This detail aligns with historical records indicating that Otto of Bamberg was known to have worn a pallium—a special garment granted to archbishops and bishops—when he received one from Pope Paschal II in 1111. The pallium’s presence in the carving supports the theory that the stone depicts Otto.The precise purpose of these mediaeval picture stones remains a topic of scholarly debate. They might have served as memorials or tombstones commemorating important individuals of the time. Given the religious symbolism of the cross on this particular stone, it is likely that it was intended to honour a significant figure in the Christianization of the region.Following further analysis, the stone is set to be permanently displayed in Klotzow, providing the local community and visitors with an opportunity to explore this important piece of mediaeval history. The discovery not only enhances the understanding of the Christianization process in Pomerania but also sheds light on mediaeval religious art and practices.","A homeowner in Klotzow, Germany, has unearthed a rare 12th-century "" picture stone "" This ancient artefact, known as a ""bildstein,"" is a valuable addition to the limited number of such stones found along the Baltic coast of Germany and Poland.
