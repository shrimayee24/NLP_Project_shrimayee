Ethiopia’s ash cloud heads toward India

Here's the top 10 things to know:

DGCA issued an advisory on Monday asking airlines and airports to prepare for possible disruptions from the volcanic ash plume drifting from Ethiopia.

According to IndiaMetSky Weather the ash cloud entered Gujarat Monday evening before moving towards Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab. The service stated: ""Ash cloud is about to enter Gujarat (West side) and move towards Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab by 10 pm, and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions.""

The plume is travelling 100–120 km/h at altitudes between 15,000 and 45,000 feet, carrying ash, sulphur dioxide and microscopic glass and rock particles.

Akasa Air, IndiGo and KLM have cancelled flights, with routes to the Middle East and Europe particularly affected. Akasa Air said: ""Following recent volcanic activity in Ethiopia and the resulting ash plume in the surrounding airspace, our flights to and from Jeddah, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi scheduled for 24th and 25th November 2025 have been cancelled.""

DGCA instructed airlines to avoid ash-affected airspace, revise flight planning and immediately report any suspected ash encounter, including engine anomalies or cabin smoke/odour.

Airports have been told to inspect runways, taxiways and aprons and restrict operations until cleaning is completed if ash contamination is detected.

Mumbai airport warned passengers: ""A volcanic eruption in Ethiopia has affected airspace over parts of West Asia, which may impact some international routes.""

Authorities watched the plume’s movement towards Delhi and Jaipur, with early signs spotted near Jamnagar around 5.30 pm, leading to disruptions as the situation developed.

The explosive eruption, which began around 8:30 am UTC [1.30 pm IST] on Sunday, marks the first activity from the nearly 10,000-year-dormant volcano.

After the eruption, volcanic ash activity has been reported over parts of the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in airlines issuing cautionary notices for passengers flying through the Middle East, though no advisories have mentioned ash drift toward India.

NEW DELHI: Airline operations across parts of the country faced disruptions after volcanic ash from Ethiopia’s Hayli Gubbi eruption drifted toward western and northern regions, prompting the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on MondayThe ash plume, travelling at high altitudes and significant speed, entered Gujarat and moved eastward through Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.With the cloud containing volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and fine glass particles, airlines have begun cancelling and diverting flights to avoid the dangerous plume.Airports have also been asked to remain vigilant and inspect surfaces for ash contamination that could affect aircraft engines and airfield operations.Multiple carriers, including IndiGo, Akasa Air, and KLM, have already modified schedules, while authorities continue monitoring the cloud’s trajectory. Disruptions are expected to evolve as the plume moves across northern India.IndiGo's Kannur-Abu Dhabi flight (6E 1433) diverted to Ahmedabad on Monday to avoid the affected corridor, while another Indian carrier operating into Abu Dhabi conducted extensive engine checks before beginning its return journey, reported news agency ANI.",The ash plume is expected to reach the Indian state of Rajasthan on Monday night. Airports have been told to be on alert for possible ash contamination. Airline flights to and from the Middle East have been cancelled.

NEW DELHI: An ash cloud from Ethiopia's Hayli Gubbi volcano hit parts of India Monday evening, according to IndiaMetSky Weather. The plumes first entered Gujarat from the west and then moved rapidly toward Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab by around 10 pm, and is drifting towards the Himalayas and other northern regions.Authorities watched the plume’s movement towards Delhi and Jaipur, with early signs spotted near Jamnagar around 5.30 pm, leading to disruptions as the situation developed.The ash plume is travelling at altitudes between 15,000-25,000 feet, rising up to 45,000 feet in some layers, and carries volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide, and tiny particles of glass and rock.IndiaMetSky Weather warned that skies could appear ""darker and hazier than usual"" and said that the plume may disrupt air traffic and lead to ""delays and longer travel.""The Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) said the explosive eruption began around 8:30 am GMT on Sunday, marking the first activity from the almost 10,000-year-dormant Hayli Gubbi volcano.Thick columns of ash rose up to 14 kilometres into the sky from the Afar region, located around 800 km northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border.The VAAC confirmed that while the eruption had stopped, ""a large ash plume is moving toward northern India.""The volcano sits within the geologically active Rift Valley, where two tectonic plates meet. After erupting, the ash swept across the Red Sea toward Yemen and Oman before drifting eastwards into India and northern Pakistan, according to VAAC and regional media outlets.The windborne ash cloud swept across vast stretches of northwest India on Monday night, passing over Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi-NCR and Punjab. Visibility dipped in several pockets as the plume drifted eastward.IndiaMetSky Weather said, ""Ash clouds moving towards North India. A large ash plume can be seen stretching from #HayliGubbi Volcano region upto #Gujarat. The eruption has stopped ever since the eruption, but this Ash plume has been sent up into the atmosphere, which is moving at a speed of 100-120km/h toward North India.”It added that the plume, containing volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and ""small particles of glass/rock,"" would likely darken the skies and impact flight routes. ""The Ash cloud is about to enter #Gujarat (West side) and move towards #Rajasthan NW #Maharashtra, #Delhi, #Haryana and #Punjab by 10 pm and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions,"" the agency said.By late night, the sulphur dioxide–rich plume was already moving over Delhi, NCR, Haryana and adjoining districts of Uttar Pradesh. IndiaMetSky Weather explained that although some pockets of ash could be seen over Rajasthan, chances of ashfall on the plains remained ""less.""Also read: 'Moving at a speed of 100-120km/h': Ethiopian volcanic ash drifts towards India — 10 things to know According to the meteorological service, the ash cloud’s altitude means that India’s surface-level AQI is not expected to deteriorate.It reiterated that the event was ""mostly safe"" and said it would ""not like to impact surface AQI levels as Ash clouds are in 25,000 to 45,000 feet above the surface.""The agency said the plume was stretching from the Oman–Arabian Sea region into northern and central India. ""Its will not impact AQI levels but it will impact So2 level at #Hills of #Nepal, #Himalayas and adjoining Terai belt of #UttarPradesh as some of the material will bump into the hills and later move into China,"" it posted on X.It clarified that the plume would drift over Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan, but the impact on the ground would be limited to darker skies and hazier conditions.While a few particles might fall to the surface, IndiaMetSky described the likelihood as ""low.”The agency also noted that residents might notice skies resembling a dust storm, though without harmful concentrations of particulate matter at ground level. People were advised to wear masks as a precaution, but officials stressed that the event was occurring at ""middle levels of the atmosphere.""Following the ash drift, airlines issued cautionary notices for flights operating through Middle Eastern airspace. In India, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) released an advisory on Monday instructing airlines and airports to prepare for possible disruptions.It directed carriers to avoid volcanic-ash-affected routes and adjust flight plans, routing and fuel loads based on the latest advisories. The DGCA also said airports must immediately inspect runways, taxiways and aprons if ash contamination is suspected and restrict operations until cleaning is completed.Several carriers, including Akasa Air, IndiGo and KLM, cancelled flights on Monday. Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport also alerted passengers that volcanic activity in Ethiopia had affected West Asian airspace and may impact some international routes, advising travellers to check with their airlines before heading to the airport.","Ethiopia's Hayli Gubbi volcano erupts for first time after 10,000 years.

NEW DELHI: Police on Sunday detained 15 people protesting against Delhi’s worsening pollution at C Hexagon after they allegedly refused to disperse.A senior officer said the protesters used pepper spray on personnel, triggering a brief scuffle.Three to four policemen suffered irritation from the spray and were taken to hospital.Police said legal action will be taken against those involved.""Some of the protesters had entered the C-hexagon and attempted to cross the barricades put up to restrict movement. We tried to explain to them that many ambulances and medical personnel were stuck behind them and required emergency access, but they got very agitated,"" the senior officer said.The police personnel sensed the situation could escalate to a scuffle and advised the protesters to step back.""They refused, broke the barricade, came onto the road, and sat there. When our teams were trying to remove them, some of the protestors attacked police personnel using chilli spray. Three to four personnel sustained injuries and are undergoing treatment,"" the officer said.The protestors were subsequently removed from the C-hexagon to avoid traffic disruption.""This was very unusual. For the first time, protestors used chilli spray on officers managing traffic and law and order,"" deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Devesh Kumar Mahla told PTI.Earlier, on November 9, several people were also detained after they gathered at India Gate as part of a “clean air protest,” demanding urgent government action and strict policies to tackle what they called an “air emergency.”Some women even brought their children, holding nebulisers and medical prescriptions, to the site — symbolic reminders of the pollution crisis that has choked the city.Some took to social media, sharing visuals of people being herded into police buses. A post on X read: ""India Gate clean-air protest. We are being taken away, shoved into a bus"". A few protesters alleged that they were manhandled and some children also detained, but police denied both claims.In a press statement, the protesters demanded ""urgent, accountable and transparent action"" from Delhi govt to tackle the crisis. They called for the creation of an independent air regulator, real-time air quality data transparency, clear health advisories during pollution spikes and public accountability for funds to tackle pollution.Delhi woke up to dense smog on Monday, and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data indicates that the AQI has crossed the 400 mark in several areas, including Akshardham, ITO and Ghazipur, placing it in the ‘severe’ category.Water sprinklers were deployed as authorities attempted to tame the thick smog enveloping the area.Meanwhile on Sunday, Bawana recorded the highest AQI level of 435 at 7 am, falling under the 'severe' category.

NEW DELHI: In a major crackdown on synthetic drug trafficking, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and Delhi Police’s special cell seized 329 kg of methamphetamine worth Rs 262 crore from a house in south Delhi’s Chattarpur on Nov 20. Two people were arrested.The joint exercise, codenamed Operation Crystal Fortress, was an intelligence-driven effort to dismantle a transnational drug network. Investigators believe the cartel is linked to a foreign-based kingpin who is also wanted in last year’s seizure of 83 kg cocaine in Delhi.Saying that the Centre “is shattering drug cartels at an unprecedented pace”, Union home minister Amit Shah called the operation “a brilliant example of seamless multi-agency coordination to achieve PM Modi’s vision for a drug-free India”.Officers in the know of things said that the breakthrough followed months of surveillance and technical intercepts that exposed a well-oiled cartel using multiple couriers, safe houses and layered handlers, with Delhi as a key hub for domestic and overseas distribution of drugs.One of the arrested suspects, Shane Waris (25), a resident of Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, was picked up from Noida’s Sector 5 on Nov 20. Employed as a sales manager in a company, Waris allegedly operated under instructions from his handler.He was directed to use fake SIM cards and encrypted apps, such as WhatsApp and Zangi, to discreetly run the operations.During interrogation, Waris admitted to his role in the syndicate and provided crucial leads to the investigators, including identifying a woman associate, Esther Kinimi from Nagaland, who recently managed one of the narcotic consignments transported through a rider of a logistics platform.Waris shared her address, contact numbers and other operational details with the investigators.Acting on Waris’ inputs, NCB personnel raided Kinimi’s Chattarpur Enclave Phase 2 residence the same day, recovering the massive consignment. She was arrested with assistance from Nagaland Police.Preliminary findings suggest that the syndicate was part of a larger cartel. “The investigation indicates Waris was actively involved in a synthetic drug trafficking syndicate functioning under foreign operators,” an officer said.Authorities are now working with international enforcement agencies to trace the kingpin and secure his deportation to India so that he could face legal proceedings.Further investigation is required to map the entire supply chain, financial trail, logistics nodes, and potential storage points, the officer said.This seizure is among the largest of methamphetamine in Delhi. The investigators said efforts are underway to dismantle the entire network and prevent its tentacles from spreading to overseas markets.","The joint exercise, codenamed Operation Crystal Fortress, was an intelligence- driven effort to dismantle a transnational drug network.

Of 16 management quota seats, 4 taken by EWS candidates

Almost 140 candidates from the economically weaker section (annual family income less than Rs 8 lakh) have chosen postgraduate seats in clinical specialties from management and NRI quotas of private medical colleges, for which tuition fees alone range from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1 crore plus per year. This has raised questions about the credibility of EWS certificates.""They apply for PG NEET exam as EWS candidates and when their ranks turn out to be very low, they become NRIs and pay fees in crores or take management quota seats that can also cost more than Rs 1 crore for the entire course.

This had happened last year too and yet there was no inquiry by govt into the issue of candidates with fake EWS certificates who affect the chances of deserving candidates, added the doctor.An EWS candidate whose NEET rank was lower than 1.1 lakh has taken an NRI quota seat for MD in dermatology in Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Belagavi, where the annual tuition fees for NRIs are over a crore per annum for this specialty. Another EWS candidate with a rank below 84,000 has opted for an NRI quota seat for MD in general medicine in Vinayaka Missions Medical College in Puducherry, for which the tuition fee is over Rs 55 lakh per year.Three EWS candidate have opted for postgraduate seats in Santosh Medical College in specialties such as radio diagnosis (Rs 76 lakh per year), general medicine and obstetrics and gynaecology, which cost Rs 50 lakh per year. Out of 16 management quota seats for postgraduation in general medicine in Dr DY Patil Medical College in Navi Mumbai, four have been taken by EWS candidates.

Trial futile as public money is returning to banks: SC

NEW DELHI: In a first of its kind order to drop criminal proceedings in a multi-crore bank fraud case after the accused agreed to pay back the money, Supreme Court allowed fugitive Sandesara brothers - Nitin and Chetan of Sterling Biotech Ltd - and their associates to be let off after the Centre and Enforcement Directorate agreed to their proposal to pay Rs 5,100 crore as one-time settlement (OTS) to put quietus on the litigations with respect to cases by CBI, ED, SFIO and income tax department.The siblings have till Dec 17 to deposit the amount.Though the bench said its order should not be treated as a precedent, some in govt think it might have implications for cases involving fugitives such as Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya who can seek similar relief.A bench of Justices JK Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi in its November 19 judgment said continuation of criminal proceedings would not serve any useful purpose, considering that public money is coming back to lender banks.Centre, after consulting various agencies, which were pursuing cases against the Sandesaras, gave the figure of Rs 5,100 crore as OTS and the assurance that it will have no objection to quashing of criminal proceedings against the accused. ""In view of the foregoing, subject to deposit of Rs 5,100 crore as indicated towards full and final settlement with the lender banks and investigating agencies, these petitions deserve to be allowed granting the following reliefs - writ petitions filed by the petitioners are allowed directing quashing of proceedings...The quashing would be operative on deposit of Rs 5,100 crore as a full and final payment based on consensus, on or before Dec 17, 2025,"" the order said.""The litigation with respect to the loan amount of the petitioners for which FIR was registered and OTS was sanctioned and approved, shall be put to an end by way of full and final settlement as per consensus and this litigation shall be put to quietus. These directions as issued are in peculiar facts of this case, therefore, they shall not be treated as precedent,"" the order said. SC directed its registry to disburse the amount to the respective lender banks on proportionate basis.The willingness of Sandesara brothers also marks a success of agencies in choking their funds and leaving them with few options than to negotiate. Besides them, Chetan's wife Dipti and family member Hitesh Patel were also declared Fugitive Economic Offenders in Sept 2020. The four, including the Sandesara brothers, had pending non-bailable warrants against them and have been forced to move from country to country, including Nigeria, the UAE, the UK and the US to escape arrest since 2017, according to ED.Late Congress neta Ahmed Patel, political adviser to Sonia Gandhi, was among the dozens who were investigated for their alleged dealings with the Sandesaras. ED had attached more than Rs 14,500 crore of assets in this case, which included Rs 4,700 crore in India and over Rs 9,778 crore overseas, including oil rigs, ships, aircraft and properties in the US, the UK and other countries, an action that brought the Sandesaras under pressure.Govt's acceptance of the Sandesaras's offer is also for the fact that a large part of the attached assets are in foreign jurisdictions and were difficult to realise because most were paper attachments, and foreign countries were not cooperating with ED orders, sources said.They also said the Sandesaras owed over Rs 14,000 crore, including interest and penalties to banks, and banks have recovered almost Rs 3,500 crore through deposits by the fugitive siblings and by selling off properties worth Rs 1,100 crore through insolvency. After OTS, banks will have recovered Rs 8,600 crore - a good amount, considering that they very often take haircuts of up to 80% during insolvency proceedings.The bench noted that proceedings in the case from inception were focused on bringing back public money as the accused had agreed to pay back the amount.","Supreme Court allowed fugitive Sandesara brothers to be let off.

Justice Surya Kant , the 53rd CJI , will have a tenure of nearly one year and three months. He spoke to Dhananjay Mahapatra shortly after taking oath

Hailing from a family of agriculturists, what encouraged you to choose law as a profession?

Justice Surya Kant, Known For Article 370 Ruling And Pegasus Scrutiny, Takes Oath As India’s New CJI

Did you ever dream of becoming CJI?

In a hierarchical seniority-cum-merit-based system, is becoming CJI more dependent on luck and timing rather than merit, ability and suitability?

Your priorities as CJI, the first from Haryana?

Have PILs served the purpose for which they were invented by SC, or are they increasingly becoming tools to malign, political vendetta and corner the establishment?

Does distorted projection of court proceedings in social media impede the justice delivery process?

Growing up tilling the family fields in Petwar taught me patience in the most practical way. Every farmer knows growth can't be rushed, it needs time, care and resilience. This lesson early in my life shaped my approach towards law, to handle every case steadily and thoughtfully, listen intently, weigh evidence and let the process run its course. Justice, like harvest, can't be forced. It has to be nurtured with consistency and respect for due process.My decision to study law came from a genuine love for debate and a curiosity about social issues. But choosing law was still a leap of faith. It is a demanding profession that asks for long-term commitment and ability to adapt. Choosing law meant taking responsibility for shaping my own journey in a field that is challenging and deeply rewarding.Every person who enrols as an advocate, dreams of making a difference. I was no different. As a young lawyer, I wanted to have a meaningful career. The dream of heading the judiciary never crossed the mind as long as I was an advocate. I didn't plan my career. From being a govt pleader to becoming the advocate general of Haryana to becoming an HC judge, all happened organically.One thing remained common with me, both as advocate and a constitutional court judge - I am immensely passionate about the law and court craft.I got good guidance from my seniors and able assistance from my juniors, who are the real architects of my career in law.Journey to chief justiceship is a long and winding one built on years of hard work, integrity and the ability to decide cases with fairness and balance. No one arrives in SC (as a judge) suddenly or by accident. It comes after decades of judging difficult cases, carrying institutional responsibilities, consistently exhibiting fairness in letter and spirit, clarity of thought, and restraint.A judge's demeanour and conduct in the courtroom, ability to inspire confidence among colleagues and an unwavering commitment to institutional values form the core of what ultimately determines suitability of leadership. But, yes, timing and circumstances may play a small role in the sequence of appointments. But this can never replace merit, credibility and character. Every judge entrusted with the CJI post puts in a lifetime's labour.The CJI post is not a reward of chance or luck. It is an outcome of sustained excellence, measured ability and a reputation for balance and integrity built over entire judicial life. The CJI post casts an additional duty to strive to improve, perform at your best and remain genuinely committed to constitutional fidelity.It is, of course, a moment of personal pride to be the first from Haryana to become CJI. But once one takes oath, he does not belong to any particular state, he belongs to the entire country. My duty is to every litigant, from every corner of India, to keep intact his hope and trust in the judiciary.My priorities are clear and pressing. We must bring down the backlog in a steady and meaningful way, not through short-term measures, but through structural improvements in case management. Speedy justice must not be at the cost of fairness, but delay must not frustrate justice. It is important that justice reaches the marginalised, poor, voiceless and the invisible victims of the system who often do not have the wherewithal to knock at the doors of temples of justice. By making the system more accessible, humane and responsive to them, we strengthen its very purpose and honour the cardinal constitutional goals.PIL has been one of the most significant judicial innovations in our constitutional history, essentially to advance and protect the rights of the poor and voiceless and those who do not have access to justice. The guarantees under Article 32 of the Constitution cannot be diluted as the reliefs given by constitutional courts through PILs are always to achieve the larger objective of protecting the rights of those who do not have access to justice.At the same time, SC judges are conscious of jurisdictional limitations, and in some cases, are cognisant that there has been flagrant misuse of such petitions which bypass HCs. We have repeatedly emphasised that such petitioners must approach HCs which have wide power under Article 226. HCs are well attuned to the jurisdictional demographic needs. Asking such petitioners to move HC is to ensure that the tiered judicial structure functions effectively.By and large, judges remain detached from social media, and that is a blessing. We simply do not have time, nor the inclination, to take to heart what is said or circulated about us outside the courtroom.About two decades ago, judges functioned almost entirely outside the public view. But in today's digital age, every utterance, every exchange in the courtroom, is instantly broadcast, often without context or accuracy. A stray sentence is clipped, shared and misconstrued within minutes, sometimes creating a wholly misleading impression. This has happened several times over the past year itself.That said, while the present environment naturally makes us more cautious in expression, it cannot and must not deter us from asking probing questions necessary for justice. We may weigh our words carefully today, but we cannot allow fear of distortion or dilute the pursuit of truth. Ultimately, justice delivered in accordance with law is the only measure that matters.",Justice Surya Kant is the 53rd CJI of India. He took oath at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Monday.

SC to hear plea to end income tax exemption for political parties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-hear-plea-to-end-income-tax-exemption-for-political-parties/articleshow/125550275.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday agreed to hear a plea to do away with the exemption granted to political parties under Income Tax law and to restrain the parties from receiving donations in cash.The court sought responses from Centre and Election Commission on the plea which challenged the validity of a provision of the Income Tax Act that allows political parties to receive ""anonymous"" cash donations below Rs 2,000.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta also issued notice to all recognised political parties and sought their response on the PIL.According to section 13A, the income of a political party from the following sources is exempt from tax: income from house property, income from other sources, capital gains and income by way of voluntary contributions the party receives from any individual.The petition, filed through advocate Jayesh K Unnikrishnan, said that clause (d) of section 13A of Income Tax Act is violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, and political parties must disclose the names and all other particulars of persons donating any sum of money and no amount must be received in cash so as to maintain transparency in political funding.""The clause allows political parties to receive anonymous cash donations below Rs 2,000.This lack of transparency deprives voters of crucial knowledge about the source of political funding, including the donors and their motives, preventing them from making a rational, intelligent and fully informed decision when casting their vote. Ultimately, this undermines the purity of the election process and compromises the integrity and accountability of a healthy democracy by allowing the potential influence of undisclosed or tainted money,"" the petition said.It said political parties are central entities in a democratic form of govt, and they must function in a transparent manner, with there being special reason for financial transparency to avoid unlawful influences of money power in the policymaking of the political party in govt. Receipt of huge amounts by political parties through purported donations from undisclosed sources is a breach of the public trust doctrine, it said.The bench was initially reluctant to entertain the PIL and suggested that the petitioner move the high court but agreed to examine it after senior advocate Vijay Hansaria stressed that the issue had pan-India implications and involved all recognised political parties.","Supreme Court agrees to hear a plea to do away with the exemption granted to political parties under Income Tax law.

Justice Surya Kant, Known For Article 370 Ruling And Pegasus Scrutiny, Takes Oath As India’s New CJI

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India Surya Kant said on Monday that right to freedom of speech and expression ""is doubtless one of our most valued rights"" requiring further strengthening but emphasised the need for a framework that ""ensures responsibility, accuracy and respect in public discourses"".Speaking to TOI after taking oath as the 53rd CJI, the first from Haryana, Justice Kant said, ""It is not freedom of speech that causes harm to the dignity or reputation, it is the misuse of that freedom and the inefficiency of our remedies that causes it.""Importantly, his predecessor, ex-CJI B R Gavai also shared the view. ""Right to free speech is always subject to reasonable restrictions specified in the Constitution. If a person's speech is in violation of those reasonable restrictions, it falls foul of the fundamental right,"" Gavai said.Asked whether the existing mechanism provides for adequate remedies against abusive or hate speeches, the outgoing CJI said, ""I feel there should be a regulatory mechanism that needs to be put in place regarding this. It is for Parliament to take a decision on this issue.""CJI Kant said the right to free speech comes with an equally important obligation - exercise in a manner that aligns with a citizen's fundamental duties.""The Constitution envisions not just a free society, but a respectful and harmonious one. When we forget that duties are intrinsic to rights, we distort the balance that keeps democracy functional and we risk making the Constitution unworkable,"" he said.To a question whether distortions in social media through selective reporting is a deterrence for judges from posing probing questions or criticising actions of litigants, CJI Kant said such incidents, which have proliferated in the past few years, ""makes us more cautious in expression, but it must not deter us from asking probing questions necessary for delivering justice"". On Saturday, he had told the media that he does not get pressured by social media.Asked whether the rich, influential and powerful, represented by renowned senior advocates, get more time from Supreme Court compared to common litigants, the CJI said, ""The guiding principle of all courts in the country, including SC, is that the justice system must be equal for all regardless of status, profession, or representation.""""Cases are taken up based on objective criteria such as urgency, nature of rights involved and the stage of proceedings. Individual stature or resources cannot, do not, and shall never determine priority or even time allotted to such cases,"" he said.He said it is a myth that senior and renowned advocates get a better audience in courts. ""Every judge reads the petition and pleadings in each case prior to commencing adjudication in the courtroom. If a matter requires more time due to its complexity, that consideration applies to the case, not for the counsel representing the litigant. In my courtroom, many will attest that I regularly encourage junior advocates to argue their cases, irrespective of whether or not their seniors are present,"" he said.","Chief Justice of India Surya Kant said on Monday that right to freedom of speech and expression ""is doubtless one of our most valued rights"" He emphasised the need for a framework that ""ensures responsibility, accuracy and respect in public discourses"" The 53rd CJI is the first from Haryana.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125551471,imgsize-1005130,width-400,resizemode-4/article-43.jpg"

NEW DELHI: BJP on Monday slammed comments by functionaries of governing parties in West Bengal and Jharkhand targeting the special intensive review of electoral rolls, as it accused INDIA bloc of being the biggest roadblock in ensuring a free, fair and transparent polling process.BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi also played the angry comments of West Bengal CM and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee in Lok Sabha in 2005 against the presence of suspected infiltrators from Bangladesh in the state, which was then governed by the Left, and her demand that voters must have a proven citizenship.She raised the issue of infiltrators 14 times in 22 minutes and then threw a file towards the Speaker after a discussion was not allowed, he said, and referred to her current stand against SIR to prod the Bengal CM for the reason behind her about-turn on the subject.Trivedi referred to reports of suspected infiltrators in the state crossing over to Bangladesh to escape action by authorities to note that infiltration into India used to make news earlier. Under Modi govt, infiltration had come to a stop, he said, adding that an Assam governor had once stated that over 5,000 people were illegally crossing over into the country daily.In a swipe at Trinamool and Congress, Trivedi said he understood why people with suspected citizenship are scared and leaving, but he could not fathom the fear in these two parties.This, he suggested, is because of their dependence on the votes of infiltrators.Jharkhand minister and Congress neta Irfan Ansari, he said, had asked people to lock up booth-level officers if they seek to delete their names from the voters' list in the absence of documents.

"India-EU summit: FTA, defence and connectivity among key outcomes, EU seeks Paris commitment",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-eu-summit-fta-defence-and-connectivity-among-key-outcomes-eu-seeks-paris-commitment/articleshow/125548280.cms,"'Some Last-Mile Issues...': Piyush Goyal Remarks On Trade Pact With EU And US, India's Export Growth

Feeling the heat from an unpredictable Trump administration, EU and India have lined up ambitious outcomes for the summit in late January that the 27-nation bloc believes will help set not just bilateral but also global agenda. These include not just the free trade agreement (FTA) under discussion but also a defence and security partnership and a determined effort to accelerate the IMEC connectivity project.These are expected to be among the key takeaways from a joint statement that will follow the summit. Both sides have not allowed the lack of a geopolitical alignment, most noticeably on Russia, to come in the way of trade negotiations in a sign of the political will at the highest level to carry the relationship to the next level.While a dozen chapters are yet to be closed, India and EU are confident they will be able to reach a deal in time for the summit that is tentatively scheduled for January 27. However, both sides need to address differences over critical issues related to steel, cars and the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a carbon tax on certain goods. These 3 issues remain major sticking points in the FTA talks.If the summit does materialise on the same day, EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa, will likely also be the chief guests at India’s Republic Day parade a day earlier.India has invited both to attend the annual celebrations. Before that summit though, the EU will observe with interest the outcomes of another summit that PM Narendra Modi will have with Russian President Vladimir Putin in December.Another contentious issue is the Paris Agreement, the international treaty for climate action, that both sides have joined but EU wants the same commitment as an essential element in the agreement. India, however, sees it as a sovereignty issue that should not be mixed with trade. Political intervention at the highest level will likely be required to break this deadlock.The FTA of course tops the list of expected deliverables from the planned January summit. Keeping in mind that both sides are at different stages of development and have different sensitivities, diplomatic sources said, the EU is looking for a balanced, commercially meaningful and living FTA agreement that will evolve over time, allowing both sides to engage on any difficult issue in the future.According to the EU, the economic case for an FTA with India, which can facilitate reliable trade relations along with stable and integrated supply chains, had always been there but it has now been reinforced by the geopolitical situation. The FTA will be tailored specifically to meet the needs of both sides and the EU, accepting an asymmetry in favour of India, is ready to liberalise five percentage points more trade than India does.While only 12 chapters have been closed so far, and a lot of difficult technical and political work is still required, the EU believes that’s not really a good indicator of progress in talks as 90-98 percent of work on most remaining chapters or issues, including agricultural and non-agricultural market access, has been completed. India and EU need to address each other’s concerns related to steel and cars respectively for a relevant agreement though. While the Indian government seeks greater clarity about its steel exports, the EU wants decent market access for its car sector for the agreement to be commercially meaningful.Carbon import tax levied by EU remains a contentious issue amidst reports that it could even act as a deal-breaker. According to the EU, both sides have their own internal laws and one can’t negotiate amendments to these through an FTA. Any politician doing that would be dead-on-arrival back home, said a source on condition of anonymity. However, both sides are looking at whether they can use a “living FTA” as a platform to facilitate the navigation of each other’s regulatory environment.Fortunately for the FTA, India’s purchase of Russian oil is not an issue in the ongoing talks. Creation of an EU-India Security and Defence Partnership that would also facilitate defence industrial collaboration, without discounting technology leakage threat, is expected to be a significant deliverable. Progress is also expected in efforts by the EU to advance, in the IMEC framework, the EU-Africa-India Digital Corridor through a submarine cable system connecting Europe to India via the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Eastern Africa. This EU initiative, as the new strategic agenda says, will provide ultra- high-speed, secure, and diversified data connectivity resilient to disruptions caused by natural disasters or acts of sabotage.","EU and India have lined up ambitious outcomes for the summit in late January.

SRINAGAR: Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council–Kargil chairman Dr Muhammad Jaffar Akhoon alleged Monday that LG Kavinder Gupta is sidelining the district in development planning and demanded a white paper on all works undertaken in Ladakh since its 2019 transition to Union territory status after Article 370’s abrogation. It marks a rare public charge by an elected body in Ladakh against the LG.Akhoon said Kargil’s health infrastructure has faced “systemic neglect” for decades. “We were sanctioned a 100-bed hospital in 1979. Since then, we have been running it as a 200-bed hospital with staff strength of a 100-bed facility,” he said, adding the district has sought an AIIMS for years without progress. Winter deployment of civilians and the armed forces pushes the hospital to capacity, he said, adding Kargil needs a full-fledged 300-bed facility capable of handling a high load of emergencies, including cardiac cases.He contrasted this with Leh, which has been sanctioned a medical college set to begin MBBS admissions next year and already has a 300-bed hospital alongside a major Army-run medical facility. He said Kargil lacks an airport, forcing civilians and Army personnel to travel through Srinagar or Leh for flights. While Leh remains connected by several daily services, Kargil is cut off through winter.Akhoon said he recently met Gupta, who allegedly agreed Kargil has faced discrimination “but it doesn’t reflect anywhere”.He added: “The LG is LG of the entire UT of Ladakh. He should treat every region equally.” Gupta was not available for comments.LAHDC-Kargil is currently the only elected body functioning in Ladakh. LAHDC-Leh completed its five-year term on Oct 30, but govt has yet to announce new polls. Panchayat elections have also been pending for several years.The Leh council was created under the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council Act, 1995, during PM PV Narasimha Rao’s tenure, with its first elections held the same year.

PM Narendra Modi participated in the IBSA Leaders' Meeting on G20 margins, stressing that UNSC reform is imperative, and said that there should be no room for double standards while fighting terrorism.PM Modi joined the trilateral mechanism meet hosted by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and attended also by Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.While all three countries have had their share of problems with the US under Trump, diplomatic sources played down suggestions that the meeting was a response to the Americans as they cited the fact that a substantive IBSA summit meeting took place on the margins of 2024 G20 summit too in Rio.The US boycotted the G20 summit in South Africa because of alleged mistreatment of white Afrikaners.PM Modi said global institutions do not reflect the realities of 21st century. ""None of us is a permanent member of UN Security Council. This clearly demonstrates that global institutions no longer represent today's world. Therefore, IBSA must send a unified message to the world: institutional reform is not an option but imperative,"" he said.""Similarly, we must work in close coordination in the fight against terrorism. On an issue of such gravity, there can be no room for double standards. For the sake of global peace and prosperity, united and decisive action is essential,"" he added, calling for institutionalising the NSA-level meeting of the countries to strengthen security cooperation.Describing the meeting as timely, PM Modi noted it coincided with the first G20 summit on African soil and marked the culmination of four consecutive G20 presidencies by Global South countries, of which the last three were by IBSA members. This, he said, had resulted in several important initiatives focused on human-centric development, multilateral reform and sustainable growth. Modi emphasised IBSA is not just a group of three countries but an important platform connecting three continents, three major democratic nations and three major economies.""Highlighting technology's crucial role in ensuring human-centric development, the PM proposed establishing an 'IBSA Digital Innovation Alliance' to facilitate sharing of Digital Public Infrastructure like UPI, health platforms like CoWIN, cybersecurity frameworks and women-led tech initiatives among the countries,"" said an Indian readout, adding the PM also emphasised IBSA's potential to contribute to development of safe, trustworthy and human-centric AI norms. He invited IBSA leaders to the AI summit next year.""Appreciating IBSA Fund's work in supporting projects across 40 countries in sectors like education, health, women empowerment and solar energy, the PM proposed IBSA Fund for Climate Resilient Agriculture to further advance South-South Cooperation,"" said the Indian government.","PM Narendra Modi participated in the IBSA Leaders' Meeting on G20 margins.

Justice Surya Kant, Known For Article 370 Ruling And Pegasus Scrutiny, Takes Oath As India’s New CJI

Ex-HC CJ not in ambit of detailed in-house proceedings

NEW DELHI: Outgoing CJI B R Gavai disclosed Sunday that it was a high court chief justice who had attempted to influence a judicial member of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), Chennai, for a favourable order for a corporate entity, and that he narrowly escaped an in-house inquiry due to his retirement and other reasons.The CJI said he had sought a report from NCLAT judicial member Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma who had startled everyone by disclosing in open court on Aug 13 that ""one of the most revered members of the higher judiciary of this country"" had approached him to secure a favourable order and recused himself from hearing the case.The CJI said by the time Justice Sharma sent a detailed report, the HC chief justice in question had retired; thus, a formal in-house inquiry could not be ordered against the errant member of the judiciary.The CJI said that shortly after he initiated deliberations among his colleagues over the process or procedure to be adopted to weed out such attempts in future, the President appointed Justice Surya Kant as his successor to the post of CJI. ""That is why I thought it better to leave it to the new CJI to take appropriate action on the issue,"" he said.The retired HC CJ is out of the ambit of detailed in-house proceedings, an adverse finding in which could persuade the CJI to recommend govt to initiate a motion in Parliament for the judge's removal.However, he may not be completely out of the arc of accountability as the new CJI, Justice Surya Kant, could still recommend registration of FIR under Prevention of Corruption Act.On November 14, addressing the matter, a bench of CJI-designate Justice Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi had told advocate Prashant Bhushan, who was appearing for a petitioner, that ""action will have to be initiated at the highest level (of the judiciary, that is the CJI) against the one who attempted to interfere with the administration of justice. If Supreme Court takes up this issue on the judicial side, then it would run counter to the power vested in the highest authority. The highest authority cannot be guided by judicial orders to take a decision.""Noting the seriousness of the matter, the bench had said that under the existing legal framework for fixing accountability on constitutional court judges, the issue raised by the petitioner should be dealt with on the administrative side.","Outgoing CJI B R Gavai disclosed Sunday that it was a high court chief justice who had attempted to influence a judicial member of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.

Stephen Curry's frustration with Under Armour's lack of vision

Stephen Curry had been with the sports apparel brand Under Armour for well over a decade. He joined as a brand ambassador in 2013 and was with them until recently, when their partnership ended earlier this month, in November 2025. While the sudden end to this business venture came out of nowhere, slowly, more information is coming to the forefront about what led to Curry's exit.And what might surprise many, is that one of the reasons that led to the end of this partnership was Caitlin Clark. Or more like Under Armour's indecisiveness in landing her as a brand ambassador. The Indiana Fever star was one of the prospects that the brand was looking to land, but they weren't invested enough in the deal, which led to a missed opportunity. And allegedly, Curry thought enough was enough, and decided that it was time his relationship with the brand ended. Stephen Curry , at the end of his partnership with Under Armour, was allegedly unhappy with how the brand was handling things. He had become ""frustrated by what they viewed as underinvestment,"" as well as the lack of sales, as they were not “meeting the company’s or Curry’s expectations."" With nothing seemingly working out, both parties decided to mutually end the partnership.And another nail in the coffin came in the form of their unsuccessful attempt to recruit Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark to join the brand last year. Both Curry and the company allegedly ""pursued the phenom, but Under Armour's offer trailed the total value of Nike's pitch."" Clark decided to drop out of the negotiations, and UA did not pursue the WNBA star further either.The Golden State Warriors star had also hoped that Under Armour's founder & CEO Kevin Plank ""would invest more in his line,” but that didn't work out either. But more business is not completely off the books for either party, as UA will “debut the final Curry shoe in February.” Currently, Curry is like prime real estate, and a lot of brands are looking to snatch him up before the opportunity closes on itself. The GSW star, though, is not in any hurry and is taking his time to decide which way he wants to go.Also Read: “Not your average GOAT” – Stephen Curry unveils new poster of his highly anticipated movie with Ayesha Curry","Stephen Curry had been with the sports apparel brand Under Armour for well over a decade.

Who is Fei-Fei Li: The ‘Godmother of AI’ who started with dry-cleaning shop and is now building a $1 billion AI empire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-is-fei-fei-li-the-godmother-of-ai-who-started-with-dry-cleaning-shop-and-is-now-building-a-1-billionaiempire/articleshow/125537716.cms,"Source: BBC

Fei-Fei Li’s education and early work experiences shape her AI breakthroughs





Fei-Fei Li combining science and perseverance to build AI





How early experiences shaped Fei-Fei Li’s AI work









Fei-Fei Li, often called the ""Godmother of AI,"" is the founder of World Labs, a rapidly growing AI startup valued at over $1 billion within its first year. Her journey, however, began far from the tech spotlight. Li immigrated from China to the United States at the age of 15. Her family faced financial difficulties, and they decided to open a small dry-cleaning business in Parsippany, New Jersey, to make ends meet.Li spent seven years running the shop alongside her parents. She handled customer calls, billing, inspections, and daily operations, joking that she was the ""CEO."" This early immersion in responsibility not only developed her resilience but also taught her critical problem-solving skills that would later guide her scientific career and influence her leadership approach in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence.Even while pursuing her education, Li remained closely connected to her family’s business. She attended Princeton University for her undergraduate degree, deliberately staying near the dry-cleaning shop. Later, during her Ph.D. at Caltech, she continued managing the business remotely. She credits this period with teaching her how to balance demanding responsibilities, reinforcing her work ethic and adaptability.Li first gained prominence through her work on ImageNet, a large-scale visual database that transformed computer vision. ImageNet provided AI systems with vast amounts of labelled visual data, enabling them to recognise objects and understand images with unprecedented accuracy. This innovation laid the foundation for modern AI research and demonstrated the potential of teaching machines to ""see"" and understand the world.At World Labs, Li is now focused on building world models, advanced AI systems designed to understand and interact with the physical world. Unlike current large language models, which primarily process text, world models integrate spatial and visual intelligence. This allows AI to perceive its environment, reason about complex situations, and make informed decisions. Li believes this approach represents the next phase of the AI revolution, moving beyond language-based intelligence toward machines capable of more human-like understanding.Li attributes her career achievements to two qualities: resilience and curiosity. Her experience as an immigrant managing her family’s shop taught her perseverance in the face of challenges, a mindset that is essential in scientific research, which is often non-linear and filled with trial and error. Her innate curiosity, fostered from a young age, led her to explore science passionately rather than pursue other distractions common among her peers.Li’s work in AI is closely connected to her personal history. Managing a business as a teenager and young adult required her to navigate complex problems, communicate effectively, and stay organised under pressure. These skills translated naturally into her research career, where problem-solving, adaptability, and persistence are paramount. She sees her AI work as an extension of this early foundation, striving to create systems that can learn, adapt, and act intelligently in the real world.","Fei-Fei Li, often called the ""Godmother of AI,"" is the founder of World Labs, a rapidly growing AI startup valued at over $1 billion.

Nvidia’s historic milestone



JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn’t sugarcoat AI impact on jobs





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has now hailed Nvidia as an unbelievable company and has also cautioned investors that some artificial intelligence stocks may be trading at an unsustainable levels. Speaking with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Dimon said that the US remains the ‘most prosperous’ economy in the world. He adds that the US economy is supported by diverse and deep capital markets including venture capital, private credit and hedge funds. “There’s no question some people will lose money,” Dimon said, drawing parallels to the dot-com era. “But mankind should benefit,” he added, emphasising that the underlying technology is real and transformative—even if valuations are currently inflated.Dimon emphasized that AI is a genuine productivity revolution, comparing its current stage to the early days of the Internet. “It’s almost at the beginning,” he said, noting that while not every company will succeed, AI will produce transformative winners just as the internet gave rise to Google, Facebook, and Amazon.Dimon acknowledged that valuations in the AI sector may be inflated, but stressed that the underlying technology will reshape industries and improve lives.“Mankind should benefit,” he said, even if “valuations today may be too high for some of these folks.”In October 2025, Nvidia became the first company in history to surpass a $5 trillion market valuation. Its market cap currently stands at $4.74 trillion, underscoring its dominance in the AI chip market. Dimon’s remarks came shortly after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted that China will win the AI race, a claim that drew sharp pushback from President Donald Trump, who vowed the U.S. would not allow other nations access to Nvidia’s most advanced chips.In another interview with Bloomberg TV, Dimon talked about the impact of AI on the job market. “People shouldn’t put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs,” he said. “AI will enhance some aspects of work, but also eliminate some jobs.” However, Dimon also stressed on the fact that JPMorgan is focused on retaining and redeploying employees whose roles are impacted by automation. “We’ll have more jobs, but there’ll probably be less jobs in certain functions,” Dimon added. “You’re better off being way ahead of the curve,” Dimon added.Dimon also added that the bank has invested about $2 billion as an annual investment in AI and is already making $2 billion in direct benefits. This includes the headcount reductions and operational savings. “We know about $2 billion of actual cost saves,” he said. “It’s the tip of the iceberg.”","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has hailed Nvidia as an unbelievable company.

What’s next for Apple’s executive team





Apple CEO Tim Cook may not be retiring anytime soon. Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Tim Cook is planning to step down as soon as next year. However, a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggests that Cook has no plans of stepping down in the near future. Apple has been preparing for a leadership transition for quite some time. In 2024, Bloomberg revealed that Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus was at the center of succession discussions. Ternus the youngest member of Apple’s executive team looks after the hardware division and is also widely respected by Apple CEO Tim Cook and former COO Jeff Williams.Then in October this year, Bloomberg suggests that the internal spotlight on Ternus was ‘intensifying’, making him the likely candidate to succeed Cook.Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook may step down from his position in between January and June 2026. As per the report, the current CEO Tim Cook is said to be succeeded by John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice-president of hardware engineering. However, no final decision has been made, sources told the publication. They also stressed that the transition plans are not tied to Apple’s current performance, as the company heads into what is expected to be a strong holiday season for iPhone sales.Taking about this upcoming transition, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman wrote, “Based on everything I’ve learned in recent weeks, I don’t believe a departure by the middle of next year is likely.” This means there are less chances of Tim Cook retiring anytime soon.Cook, who turned 65 this month, took over as CEO in 2011 after co-founder Steve Jobs died. Under his leadership, Apple’s valuation has climbed from around $350 billion to $4 trillion. Despite strong results last month, Apple’s roughly 12% stock rise this year trails rivals like Alphabet, Nvidia and Microsoft, which have surged on AI momentum.“Yes, Apple will eventually have a new leader. And, yes, it’s probably Ternus. But unless there is some unexpected event that forces Cook to step down sooner than planned, that moment is not at hand. But there still may be significant movement on Apple’s executive team. As I recently reported, silicon chief Johny Srouji is seriously evaluating his future at the company, while Apple has been on the hunt for a new AI leader,” said Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.While the retirement of Apple CEO Tim Cook is not imminent, Bloomberg reveals that the company will still witness some leadership changes in the coming weeks. As per the report,Apple’s silicon chief, Johny Srouji may be evaluating his future at the company. Also, Apple is actively looking for a new AI leader in order to strengthen its position in generative AI sector.","Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Tim Cook is planning to step down as soon as next year.

Moody's warns that many US States showing recession signs





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy. Bezos has urged the consumers and businesses to postpone their large purchases as the fear of recession is mounting. Speaking to CNN’s Chole Melas in an interview, Bezos has cautioned that the coming months could bring prolonged downturn. Bezos has recommend that households should consider putting a hold on purchasing big-ticket products such as cars, televisions and appliances. He urge the consumers to save that money as it will make a lot of difference if the economic worsens. Along with this, Bezos has also advised the small businesses to avoid large capital expenditures or acquisitions during this uncertain period.“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”Despite his cautionary advice, Bezos struck an optimistic tone about the long-term future, saying he believes the American Dream remains attainable. He even projected that within his lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public. Last month, Bezos tweeted a warning to “batten down the hatches,” advice he reiterated in his CNN interview as relevant to both consumers and business owners.Ironically, if the consumers follow Bezos’ advice, then it could mean lower sales for Amazon. Recently, Amazon announced its plans to layoff 14,000 employees. In October, Amazon projected holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street expectations, citing inflation and shifting consumer behavior. Americans are spending more on travel and dining out and less on discretionary goods.Recently, Mark Zandi, chief economist at credit rating agency Moody' warned about recession in the US. A new analysis of state-level data suggests that the US economy is ""on the edge of recession,"" said Mark Zandi of Moody's. ""Based on my assessment of various data, states making up nearly a third of US GDP are either in or at high risk of recession, another third are just holding steady, and the remaining third are growing,"" Zandi wrote on social media.The data reveals a mixed picture across the country. States in the South are generally the strongest, though their growth is beginning to slow. Meanwhile, some of the nation's largest economies, like California and New York, are described as ""holding their own,"" and their stability is seen as critical to preventing a full-blown national recession.However, many states are showing signs of vulnerability. Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Kansas, and Massachusetts were all identified as being at high risk of recession. The broader Washington, D.C. area is also notable for its economic struggles, which Zandi attributes to government job cuts.Adding to the forecast, Zandi predicts that the annual inflation rate, currently at 2.7%, could rise to nearly 4% within the next year, further eroding purchasing power for consumers.Along with this, Zandi also warned about the restrictive immigration policies which could hurt the tech sector. He urged the lawmakers to protect access to global talent especially in AI, software engineering, and data science. ""If it feels like we're coming to the end of the tariff increases, or like we're going to get a more rational immigration policy,' I think that would be a signal that the coast may be cleared,"" Zandi told BI.“It’s no mystery why the economy is struggling; blame increasing U.S. tariffs and highly restrictive immigration policy. The tariffs are cutting increasingly deeply into the profits of American companies and the purchasing power of American households. Fewer immigrant workers means a smaller economy,” added Zandi.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy.

In a recent internal memo to colleagues, Altman acknowledged that the AI startup rival's success couldHowever, Altman reassured that OpenAI isand anticipates emerging as the leader in the AI race. It's important to note that Altman's memo was written before Google's Gemini 3 was released, a model the tech giant has described as its most capable to date. Software developers have reported that the new model performed well on tasks such as automating website and product design and writing code, which is a lucrative revenue stream for OpenAI and its competitors, such as Anthropic.Concerns about OpenAI's slowing growth arose late this summer. During a recent quarterly earnings call with investors, the company’s CFO, Sarah Friar, confirmed that user engagement with the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT had cooled, despite the company's otherwise positive financial results.According to a report by The Information (as seen by The Economic Times), Sam Altman's memo noted that competitors such as Google and Anthropic are narrowing the gap in the AI raceAnthropic’s Claude model generates computer code for various tasks using conversational prompts.Meanwhile, Google has been integrating its Gemini AI chatbot into its search app, productivity tools and other services. However, recently, Claude gained a new challenger from OpenAI with the introduction of Codex.Google also holds an economic advantage. OpenAI’s growth has been rapid and the company now carries a valuation of around $500 billion as a for-profit entity. It is expected to bring in about $13 billion in revenue, but is estimated to burn roughly $100 billion in its push toward superintelligence.With a market value of about $3.5 trillion, Google reported free cash flow of over $70 billion in the past four quarters. A significant portion of this comes from providing cloud services to OpenAI, Anthropic and other competitors.Sam Altman also encouraged OpenAI employees to stay confident and focus on the company's larger goals.Altman wrote in the internal memo.Altman added.Recently, OpenAI partnered with Apple's biggest suuplier Foxconn to design and build AI data-centre components in the US.

Indian spending shifts: Families move beyond basics as survey shows asset-building rising; urban–rural gaps narrow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-spending-shifts-families-move-beyond-basics-as-survey-shows-asset-building-rising-urbanrural-gaps-narrow/articleshow/125555114.cms,"AI image

Household spending habits in India are undergoing a clear transformation, with families moving away from basic essentials and channelling more money into asset-building purchases, according to a new survey by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister.As per news agency ANI, the report shows that categories such as Personal Goods and Cooking & Household Appliances are gaining priority over traditional necessities like clothing and footwear — a trend that is now visible even among the bottom 40 per cent of households.The survey stated that “Household spending is shifting from basic necessities like clothing and footwear towards asset-building expenditure on personal goods, and cooking & household appliances.”This change is being driven by rising awareness, greater financial access and improved market connectivity, all of which are contributing to improved productivity and better living standards.Using data from the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey of 2011–12 and 2023–24, the EAC-PM found that motor vehicles have become the fastest-growing durable asset in the country.The growth reflects a strong urban–rural convergence, with the bottom 40 per cent of households catching up significantly with the broader population, particularly in cities.Better roads, stronger market links and expanding vehicle-financing options have played a key role in this rise.However, television ownership has grown far more slowly. In fact, TV ownership has fallen in several urban areas across both the overall population and the bottom 40 per cent.The report attributes this to near-universal mobile access, which has shifted viewing habits as phones increasingly replace or complement televisions for entertainment and information.Across four key asset groups — motor vehicles, refrigerators, televisions and mobile phones — the report found clear signs of narrowing gaps between consumption segments, especially in urban regions.Refrigerator ownership is also showing strong convergence, again propelled by urban growth.Mobile phones now enjoy almost universal adoption across both the top 20 per cent and bottom 40 per cent groups, making them the most evenly distributed durable asset in India.The report further observed that households with no durable assets now make up just 5 per cent or less across all consumption groups and regions, indicating a sharp reduction in asset poverty.","Personal Goods and Cooking & Household Appliances are gaining priority over traditional necessities like clothing and footwear.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

NEW DELHI: An ash cloud from Ethiopia’s Hayli Gubbi volcano reached parts of India on Monday evening, according to IndiaMetSky Weather.The plumes first crossed into Gujarat from the west and then moved quickly over Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab by around 10 pm, continuing their drift toward the Himalayas and other northern regions.An ash cloud plume is sweeping across Delhi-NCR, carrying tiny particles of rock, glass, and sulphur dioxide at altitudes of 15,000–45,000 feet.The ash cloud is travelling at 100-120 km/h at altitudes of 15,000 to 45,000 feet and contains volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide, and tiny particles of glass and rock.While it may make the sky appear darker and hazier, experts said it is unlikely to significantly affect Delhi’s air quality.Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst of think tank EnviroCatalysts, said, “The volcanic ash consists of dust, silica, rocky material, and other minerals and can be hazardous for health.

Market watch: Asian shares rebound as rate-cut optimism lifts tech stocks; crude holds steady amid supply risks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-watch-asian-shares-rebound-as-rate-cut-optimism-lifts-tech-stocks-crude-holds-steady-amid-supply-risks/articleshow/125554670.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AP)

Asian stocks climbed on Tuesday, buoyed by growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December, while crude prices steadied as traders balanced geopolitical uncertainty with forecasts of a softer oil market next year.As per Reuters, MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares excluding Japan rose 1%, led by a rebound in technology names after last week’s sharp 4% drop.The index is still on track for a 3.8% fall for the month – its first monthly decline since March. Japan’s Nikkei also gained 0.8% on reopening after a holiday, recovering from last week’s 3.5% slump.South Korea’s Kospi surged 2.39%, while the small-cap Kosdaq gained 1.7%, supported by strong moves in heavyweight chipmakers SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, which were up as much as 5% and 4%, CNBC reported.Australia’s ASX 200 trimmed earlier gains but stayed slightly above the flatline. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 1% and the Hang Seng Tech Index jumped 1.74%, while the mainland’s CSI 300 added 0.53%.As quoted by Reuters, investment director Charlie Aitken of Regal Partners said the return of broad gains was “classic bull equity market behaviour”, noting how markets often bounce after “a short, sharp pullback”.Rate-cut hopes strengthened after Fed Governor Christopher Waller said data showed the US job market remained weak enough to justify another quarter-point cut.Markets now expect an 85% chance of a December cut, significantly higher than the 42% seen a week earlier, according to Reuters.San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly similarly supported lowering rates, telling the Wall Street Journal she saw signs of deteriorating labour conditions.Wall Street rallied overnight, with the Nasdaq jumping 2.69% in its strongest daily performance since May 2024, reported Reuters.Treasury yields were steady in Asian hours, while the dollar softened slightly. The yen, however, stayed fragile near last week’s 10-month low, with political tensions between Tokyo and Beijing over Taiwan still simmering.Bloomberg reported a further uplift in sentiment across Asian markets, with Japanese and South Korean stocks tracking Wall Street. Traders drew confidence after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping held talks viewed as a positive step in repairing relations following their tariff truce.Fed officials’ consistent signals of support for a December cut reinforced belief that the recent market wobble was a temporary pullback rather than the start of a deeper slide.In commodities, Brent crude slipped 0.3% to $63.20 a barrel and US crude eased 0.2% to $58.71, according to Reuters.Prices had gained 1.3% in the previous session amid doubts over a Russia-Ukraine peace deal that could eventually free up sanctioned Russian shipments.Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank warned of a potential two-million-barrel-per-day surplus in 2026, expecting a “bearish” outlook to persist even into 2027, reported Reuters.Still, crude found some support from rising expectations of a US rate cut, which could help strengthen economic activity and oil demand.","MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares excluding Japan rose 1%, led by a rebound in technology names after last week’s sharp 4% drop.

Who is Lakshmi Mittal?

The Cost to Naïa Island

Looking ahead





Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal has stepped back from full-time UK residency and will spend far more time in Dubai and Switzerland as Britain tightens tax rules for the super-rich. The move follows Labour’s package of wealth and inheritance tax changes that have prompted several high-net-worth individuals to rethink their tax residency.The exodus of Lakshmi Mittal from the UK, where his family owned the legendary ""Taj Mittal"" mansion, is fundamentally driven by economics. The billionaire is moving away from the UK’s impending tax reforms, which include a proposed 20% exit tax, a potential mansion tax, the abolition of the non-domicile tax regime, and high 40% inheritance taxes.Dubai’s financial landscape is the polar opposite. By making Dubai his main residence, Mittal benefits from a system built on certainty and growth, most crucially offering zero inheritance tax. This stability allows him and his peers to manage and protect their immense global wealth, making it the preferred destination for a growing list of individuals seeking to secure their assets from high tax levies and policy unpredictability in their home countries. This financial security, in turn, allows for investment in Dubai’s most exclusive residential projects.Reports say Mittal has cemented his commitment to the UAE by acquiring property on Naïa Island, an ambitious new luxury enclave developed by Shamal Holding, in addition to an existing residence.This island is engineered specifically to attract the UHNW segment, offering unmatched privacy and prestige off the Jumeirah coastline.The specialty of Naïa Island lies in its unique, low-density features:Naïa Island is positioned as a legacy investment, a timeless retreat where exclusivity, natural beauty, and sophistication converge, with the project expected to reach completion around 2029.Lakshmi Niwas Mittal is one of the world's foremost figures in the steel industry, known for his relentless consolidation of the fragmented global market. Born in Rajasthan, India, his career trajectory led him to become the founder and Executive Chairman of ArcelorMittal, the world’s leading steel and mining company outside of China. Mittal built his empire through a series of bold and often aggressive acquisitions throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including a landmark merger in 2006 that created the current global giant.His company is critical to the construction, infrastructure, and renewable energy sectors globally, reflecting his influence on modern industrialization. Previously one of Britain's wealthiest residents, his move from the UK to Dubai signifies a major shift in the global financial landscape for this steel magnate.Lakshmi Mittal's future residence on Naïa Island will be a custom-built, ultra-low-density estate leveraging the island’s exclusive design. His property, likely on one of the large 21,000 to over 48,000 square foot estate plots, will feature mandatory private beachfront access and seamless access to the private residents' marina for yachting, while benefiting from integrated, hotel-standard services provided by the nearby Cheval Blanc Maison (LVMH).For those aspiring to buy a piece of this luxury, the cost is immense: while small 4-bedroom villas are estimated to start around AED 45 million (INR 109.3 crores), a custom estate plot requires substantially higher capital. The purchase process is strictly managed as an off-plan development (completion expected around 2029), necessitating an Expression of Interest (EOI), adherence to a structured payment plan, and the payment of a 4% DLD fee, though the investment qualifies the owner for the coveted 10-year Golden Visa.For Dubai, the arrival (or increased presence) of well-known billionaires notably brings headline value, increasingly potential local spending and faster growth in the ultra-luxury property and services sectors. For the UK, these departures are however politically sensitive, and they highlight how tax policy discreetly influences where mobile wealth ultimately chooses to liveThe broader pattern is already visible: bankers, industrialists and investors are weighing residency options as fiscal rules change. Policymakers on both sides will watch whether the trend is temporary or a sustained reshaping of where global capital and wealthy families choose to base themselves.","Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal has stepped back from full-time UK residency and will spend far more time in Dubai and Switzerland as Britain tightens tax rules for the super-rich. The move follows Labour’s package of wealth and inheritance tax changes that have prompted several high-net-worth individuals to rethink their tax residency. Mittal's future residence on Naïa Island will be a custom- built, ultra-low-density estate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125534852,imgsize-1107002,width-400,resizemode-4/laxmi-mittal.jpg"
