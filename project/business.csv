NEW DELHI: Calling the imposition of Emergency on India ""the darkest chapters in India’s history,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the values enshrined in the Constitution were set aside, and several people were jailed at that time; it was as if the Congress at that time placed democracy under arrest.On the completion of 50 years of the Emergency, which was imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on June 25, 1975, PM Modi said no one can ever forget the manner in which the spirit of the Constitution was violated and the 42nd Amendment is a prime example of Congress's shenanigans.Also read: Compile, preserve documents tied to Emergency: PM Modi ""Today marks fifty years since one of the darkest chapters in India’s democratic history, the imposition of the Emergency.

It was as if the Congress Government in power at that time placed democracy under arrest!"" PM Modi said in a post on X.""We salute every person who stood firm in the fight against the Emergency! These were the people from all over India, from all walks of life, from diverse ideologies who worked closely with each other with one aim: to protect India’s democratic fabric and to preserve the ideals for which our freedom fighters devoted their lives.It was their collective struggle that ensured that the then Congress Government had to restore democracy and call for fresh elections, which they badly lost,"" he also added.He also reiterated the commitment to strengthen the principles of the Constitution and working together for the vision of a Viksit Bharat. ""May we scale new heights of progress and fulfil the dreams of the poor and downtrodden,"" he said.On the 50 years of Emergency, BlueKraft presented a new book: The Emergency Diaries - Years that Forged a Leader. According to the BlueKraft, the book delves into the compelling role that PM Modi, then a young RSS Pracharak, played in the fight against Emergency.""This book is a tribute to the grit and resolve of those who refused to be silenced, and it offers a rare glimpse into the early trials that forged one of the most transformative leaders of our time,"" BlueKraft said.Talking about the ‘The Emergency Diaries,’ PM Modi said that it has the compilation of his journey during the Emergency years.

NEW DELHI: After a campaign for assured pension, there is only a small proportion of central govt employees who have opted for the Unified Pension Scheme , offering assured 50 per cent pension, with several seeking further clarifications to exercise the one-time option.As a result, govt has extended the June-end deadline by three months. Employees want to be absolutely sure about the terms of the agreement before deciding to switch to UPS.A concern for employees who joined national pension system from 2004 is the lack of clarity on death benefits. While an assurance was given last week, there are still a few issues that are to be resolved.Under the UPS, while an employee will contribute 10 per cent of his or her salary towards pension, a matching contribution will be made by the Centre, which was 14 per cent under NPS. Under the new scheme, apart from the 10 per cent pension payment, another 8.5 per cent contribution is to be made by the Centre which will not reflect in the balance of the subscriber’s account. While most employees understand the change, there are some who believe that the payout may be lower.Further, some of the all India service officers want to know about the difference in contribution between the Centre and states, which don’t have a scheme yet.An IAS, IPS or Indian Forest Service officer spends time in the state with some of them also opting for central deputation. While the rules are quite clear, some of the officers have raised doubts.Meanwhile, fund managers, who have been asked to conduct outreach programmes, are smelling a rat and allege that some private players are sowing doubts as they stand to lose out on the annuity business under UPS.Employees now have time to exercise the switching option up to the end of September. The option can be exercised by 23 lakh government employees.",Only a small proportion of central govt employees have opted for the Unified Pension Scheme.

Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is all set to travel to the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday. He will lift off from Nasa 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday at 12:01pm IST as part of the Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4).This mission marks India's return to space nearly 41 years after Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian in space.Shukla, born in 1985, is an Indian Air Force pilot who grew up inspired by Sharma's journey. Now, he is carrying not just scientific instruments but also some personal items close to his heart.While astronauts are usually advised to pack light, Shukla is taking specially-prepared Indian sweets with him. At a press conference, he revealed he will carry mango nectar, carrot halwa, and moong dal halwa into space. He said he plans to share these with his fellow astronauts aboard the ISS.""There will be plenty of food to eat in space, but I will be carrying mango nectar, carrot halwa (gajar ka halwa) and moong dal halwa with me,"" as BBC quoted him from press conference.He is also taking a secret souvenir for Rakesh Sharma, who he considers a mentor. ""He has been advising me on many things, including how to prepare for this mission,"" Shukla said.He did not reveal what the souvenir is, only saying it will be a surprise when he returns.Joining the Axiom-4 crew on the spacecraft is a small white toy swan named Joy. The swan will act as the mission’s zero-gravity indicator, floating once the capsule enters space. The crew chose it for its cultural significance. It symbolises wisdom and is the vehicle of Saraswati, the goddess of learning. In Poland, it represents purity and resilience, while in Hungary, it stands for loyalty and grace.The Ax-4 mission is being carried out by Axiom Space, a private company, in collaboration with Nasa, Isro, and the European Space Agency.The crew will fly aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule launched by a Falcon 9 rocket. The team includes commander Peggy Whitson from the US, Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland, and Tibor Kapu from Hungary.Over the two-week mission, the astronauts will conduct around 60 scientific experiments, including seven designed by ISRO.

""The EP route continues to be a key enabler in bridging urgent capability gaps and ensuring timely induction of vital operational equipment,"" an official said.Among the systems contracted include an additional lot of Russian-origin Igla-1S very short range air defence systems (VSHORADS) with launchers and missiles, which have interception ranges of up to 6km.The Army has been inducting these man-portable Igla-1S systems, which are assembled in India by Adani Defence, in batches over the past couple of years.Another contract was for about a dozen integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (IDDIS) with much-improved capabilities than the existing ones. Both Igla-1S and IDDIS were used during Operation Sindoor, among other air defence systems, to thwart the multiple waves of drone swarms launched by Pakistan.The other deals were for low-level lightweight radars, night sights for rifles, bulletproof jackets, ballistic helmets and quick-reaction fighting vehicles. Several types of drones, including large remotely-piloted aerial vehicles and smaller loitering munitions, have also been ordered.They include around 450 Nagastra-1R kamikaze drones for Rs 158 crore from Solar Defence and Aerospace Ltd and Switch surveillance hybrid mini-UAVs with VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) capabilities for Rs 137 crore from ideaForge Technology, as reported by TOI Tuesday.""Procurements under EP-6 will be much larger and include imports.

NEW DELHI: The Centre will promote the agri-clinics initiative across the country to provide expert advice and services to farmers on various aspects of farming, Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Tuesday.He said the issue of how to expand the network of agri-clinics was discussed in detail on Tuesday, in light of inputs received by officials and scientists from farmers during their fortnight-long (May 29-June 12) ‘Viksit Krishi Sankalp Abhiyan’, a pan-India campaign to connect scientists with farmers under the Centre’s ‘lab to land’ initiative.A pan-India network of such clinics would help farmers get crop-specific advice when they faced problems with their standing crops or relating to use of inputs such as pesticides and fertilisers.Though the agriculture ministry has been implementing the ‘Agri-Clinics and Agri-Business Centres’ scheme in collaboration with Nabard since 2002, the initiative has not gained the desired traction.The initiative was devised in a way that it could tap the expertise available in the large pool of agriculture graduates and facilitate their setting up agri-clinics or agri business centres to offer professional extension services to innumerable farmers.The agri-clinics are expected to assist farmers on soil health, cropping practices, plant protection and post-harvest technology.At Tuesday’s meeting, the ministry also decided to discuss crop-specific issues with farmers, given that every crop throws up its own set of challenges.Chouhan said the ministry will launch the exercise by engaging with soybean farmers in Madhya Pradesh on June 26, followed by similar discussions on cotton, sugarcane, pulses and oilseeds in different states.At another meeting, the ministry approved the procurement of moong (green gram) and urad (black gram) in Madhya Pradesh, and urad in Uttar Pradesh under the centrally funded Price Support Scheme (PSS).The scheme is implemented as and when market prices of notified pulses and oilseeds fall below the notified minimum support price (MSP) during peak harvesting period, providing remunerative prices to farmers.",The Centre will promote the agri-clinics initiative across the country to provide expert advice and services to farmers.

Blake Lively devastated as Taylor Swift cuts all ties

Legal troubles add fuel to the fire

After years of red-carpet glam, family vacations, and public admiration, the once-adored friendship between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift has reportedly come to a painful end—this time, for good. According to multiple insider sources, the fallout is not only personal but now tangled in legal drama, forcing Lively to surrender private texts to the legal team of actor Justin Baldoni . The emotional toll appears to be heavy on Lively, while Swift remains distant—and firmly supported by her current inner circle, including NFL star Travis Kelce The bond between the ""Gossip Girl"" actress and the global music sensation had been iconic. Taylor Swift, godmother to Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ three children—James, Inez, and Betty—was often seen vacationing and celebrating milestones with the couple. But those memories have now faded into silence.“After months of radio silence, Blake has stopped trying to reach out. She’s heartbroken, but she knows it’s time to let go. Taylor’s not coming back,” a source told Radar Online.Another insider close to Swift confirmed the emotional rupture: “The friendship is done.” The source alleged that Lively “exploited the Godmother of her children and manipulated the public into thinking that she was watching out for her best interests.”The emotional heartbreak coincides with a troubling development in the legal arena. Blake Lively has been ordered by a judge to submit her text exchanges with Swift in connection to Justin Baldoni’s ongoing sexual harassment case.The ruling stems from Lively herself identifying Swift as someone with whom she discussed workplace grievances.Reports also suggest Blake Lively may have allegedly used her connection with Swift as leverage. Rumors swirled that Lively had threatened to release past messages unless Swift publicly supported her during the controversy.Taylor Swift, who was dramatically subpoenaed in the case, has attempted to maintain her distance. Yet, her silence has been interpreted as a deliberate break from the actress she once trusted.Through the storm, Swift isn’t alone. Travis Kelce, her current partner and Kansas City Chiefs star, has remained low-key but steady in his support. While Kelce hasn’t spoken publicly about the situation, insiders close to the singer say he’s been a “calming force” during the fallout.With Swift preparing to release her next album, rumored to address themes of betrayal and trust, Kelce’s presence has reportedly been “grounding” for the Grammy-winner.Also Read: Taylor Swift breaks from Blake Lively after shocking betrayal as Travis Kelce becomes her emotional shield While the headlines continue to swirl, one thing is certain—this is no longer just celebrity gossip.

BENGALURU/BAGALKOT: A tongue-in-cheek remark by Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara about shortage of funds in the state govt has triggered a political firestorm and social-media frenzy, after a video of his speech in North Karnataka's Badami went viral.This prompted Parameshwara to issue a clarification on Tuesday, insisting his comments in jest had been misconstrued as a suggestion that the Congress govt was facing a financial crunch.Speaking at the inauguration of a fire station in Badami Monday evening, Parameshwara urged local Congress MLA BB Chimmankatti to think big and push for a Rs 1,000-crore development plan for the region, once the capital of the Chalukya dynasty.""Draft a plan worth Rs 1,000 crore for the development of Badami assembly constituency and send it to the Union govt. We don't have money, and neither does Siddaramaiah,"" he said, prompting laughter from the audience.The home minister doubled down on the point for comic effect. ""After providing rice, lentils, and oil, the funds are depleted,"" he quipped, before gesturing to excise minister RB Timmapur and adding with a grin, ""The 'enne' (liquor or excise) minister is right here,"" drawing peals of laughter from the crowd.While the humorous tone elicited chuckles at the event, the viral clip has since ignited serious political chatter and left the govt red-faced.The minister said on Tuesday: ""I have not said like that, who said there is no money? I have defended the govt, saying we have presented a record budget... as someone said things jokingly during the speech, I reacted in a similar fashion, that's all.""Reiterating the fiscal strength of the state, the minister said, ""A sum of Rs 22,000 crore has been allocated for irrigation in the budget. Allocations have been made for the five guarantee schemes, and instructions have been made to prepare an action plan for Rs 50 crore in every constituency.""He added, ""I'm now saying officially that there is no financial distress in our govt. I'm saying it very clearly. Sometimes, there may be a delay in the release of funds, as DPR and estimates have to be prepared before releasing money. There may be some delay in that; other than that, there is nothing else.""Despite the explanation, Parameshwara's remark - ""We don't have the money, and neither does Siddaramaiah"" - continues to dominate discussions, with political opponents questioning the fiscal health of the state and the delivery of five welfare guarantees.",Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara's tongue-in-cheek remark about shortage of funds in the state govt has triggered a political firestorm and social-media frenzy.

Chennai: Actor Sivaji Ganesan's family has informed the Madras high court that they have reached a settlement in his grandson Dushyanth's loan dispute case. As a result, Danabhakiyam Enterprises, which earlier sought to seize Sivaji's 'Annai Illam' residence, has now withdrawn its appeal.Dushyanth borrowed ₹3 crore from Danabhakiyam Enterprises to produce a film titled ‘Jagajala Killadi'. The company filed a case in the high court demanding repayment of ₹9 crore, including interest. Based on an HC directive, the matter was taken up for arbitration. The arbitrator, after hearing the case, ordered that all rights to the film ‘Jagajala Killadi' be transferred to Danabhakiyam Enterprises.Following this, Danabhakiyam Enterprises filed a petition seeking enforcement of the order and also requested the seizure of 'Annai Illam' residence. Justice Abdul Quddhose, who heard the petition, ordered the seizure of the 'Annai Illam' house.However, actor Prabhu (Sivaji Ganesan's son) filed a petition stating that the house legally belonged to him as it was willed to him by his father, Sivaji Ganesan. He requested that the seizure order be cancelled. After reviewing the petition, Justice Abdul Quddhose ruled that Prabhu is the rightful owner of the 'Annai Illam' house and revoked the seizure order.Danabhakiyam Enterprises appealed this decision, and the case came up for hearing before Chief Justice KR Shriram and Justice Sundar Mohan. Danabhakiyam Enterprises informed the high court that a settlement was reached outside the court and that they wished to withdraw the appeal. The bench accepted the submission and granted permission to withdraw the appeal.","Sivaji Ganesan's family has informed the Madras high court that they have reached a settlement in his grandson Dushyanth's loan dispute case.

KOLKATA: Falguni Dey, the geography professor from Kolkata who got stranded in war-ravaged Iran, returned to the city on Tuesday morning after a gruelling 10-day wait. Dey, along with other Indian passengers, was evacuated by the Indian embassy on a Mahan Air flight from Mashhad late on Monday night.""Over the past 10 days, I was caught between hope and despair. Even after the flight took off from Mashhad, I was not sure of getting back home. In the past 10 days, my hopes were shattered a number of times. When the flight landed in New Delhi and I came out of the immigration checks, it started to sink in slowly,"" Dey said.After Israel launched a missile strike on June 14 — a day before his scheduled departure — Dey was on the run to evade the destruction caused by Israeli missiles and drones. With $200 in his pocket, he travelled from the north to the west of Iran. His attempts to cross Iran first through Azerbaijan and then through Armenia were unsuccessful. He reached Mashhad on Sunday and got himself registered with the Indian embassy for evacuation. When he returned home on Tuesday morning, he had $20 left with him.On Monday afternoon, Dey received a phone call from the Indian embassy in Tehran. ""They asked me to reach Sadr Hotel in Mashhad immediately where the list for the evacuees was being prepared.They asked me to pack my bags and be prepared for checkout from the hotel in the evening. Five buses parked outside the hotel took us to the airport in the evening,"" he recounted.The flight took off from Mashhad at 1:30 am and reached New Delhi around 4 am. Two officials from the Bengal govt were present at the airport. ""My flight to Kolkata was scheduled at 5 am and the Bengal govt officials helped to complete the formalities in time,"" he said. Dey called his wife to inform her about his return after he reached New Delhi. When he reached Kolkata airport, his wife was waiting outside.""My phone rang at 4 am and it was a call from his India number. I could not believe my eyes. He asked me to reach the airport fast,"" said Kanyakumari Dey, his wife. Since Dey was stuck in Iran, it was a prolonged fight for her, too. From their Jadavpur home, she coordinated with officials at the Tehran office, filed visa applications for him, followed up with the embassy offices, counselled him when he was depressed, and continued to keep the hope in him alive.""I lost hope twice when Azerbaijan and Armenia declined his visa and I felt that we would not be able to bring him back. He was stuck in a situation where everything was at odds. He survived as he has a steely nerve,"" she said.","Falguni Dey, a geography professor from Kolkata, got stranded in war-ravaged Iran.

'Luggage to be delivered to passengers home addresses'





PATNA: Passengers arriving on two Air India Express flights at Patna's Jayprakash Narayan International Airport on Saturday morning were stunned to find that none of their checked baggage had made it to the city.What began as a routine landing turned into chaos as weary flyers circled the empty conveyor belts only to realise their belongings were missing entirely.The incident involved flights IX-2936 from Bengaluru and IX-1634 from Chennai, which landed at 8.23am and 8.50am, respectively. Passengers were directed to collect their luggage from belts 4 and 3, but after prolonged waits, it became clear that no baggage was arriving.""I waited for more than an hour, but the belt was empty,"" said Vivek Sharma, a passenger from Bengaluru.""Airport staff informed us that due to bad weather in Bengaluru, our luggage was not loaded. Despite repeated enquiries at the airline's counter, we were given no clear answers about where our bags were or when we would get them back,"" Sharma added.Tempers flared as frustrated travellers confronted airline staff.One furious flyer shouted that the airline should be shut down if it could not handle basic operations. Another demanded same-day delivery. ""All my medicines are in that luggage. I can't wait another day,"" he said.CISF personnel and airline staff had to step in to manage the crowd, assuring passengers that arrangements were being made to bring the baggage on subsequent flights. Airline representatives blamed the issue on bad weather in Bengaluru and Chennai, compounded by Patna airport's short runway. They also cited weight restrictions and safety protocols as reasons for not loading the baggage.""The luggage will be delivered to your home addresses once it arrives,"" airline staff told the crowd.Airport officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the primary issue was the aircraft's load factor. ""This happens occasionally when departing from Patna where airlines are forced to unload checked baggage to meet the maximum take-off weight. The airport's shorter runway makes it more likely,"" said an official.As of Saturday evening, Air India had not issued an official statement. Airport authorities, however, indicated that the missing luggage would likely reach Patna by Sunday.Affected passengers remained stuck with little more than their cabin bags and mounting frustration.The episode has once again placed Air India in the spotlight, raising questions about its operational preparedness and passenger communication.","Two Air India Express flights landed at Patna's airport on Saturday morning.

Elon Musk is the world’s richest person, but he reportedly doesn’t like living like a typical billionaire. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has a total net worth of $409 billion, as per Forbes. He once said that he avoids spending money on things that most wealthy people enjoy – like mansions, fancy food and expensive cars. Elon Musk, on the contrary, prefers a simple lifestyle with very few belongings. In Twitter post in May 2020, he wrote “I am selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house”. The tech billionaire, in a Joe Rogan podcast has also said “I think possessions kind of weigh you down. They're kind of an attack vector.” Over the years, Elon Musk has made it clear that he doesn’t care much for luxury, even if he can afford it. Here are five things that he said will never own:Between 2020 and 2021, the billionaire sold seven of his California homes for about $100 million. The Tesla CEO, then reportedly moved into a smaller Boxabl home near the SpaceX site in Texas. According to reports, the house is only 375 square feet in size, which is smaller than some studio apartments, and is worth $50,000.During a previous interview on Neil deGrasse Tyson's, the X owner said that during his early startup days, he lived on fast food and spent every spare dollar on his business. He stated that at 17 he tested if he could live on just $1 a day for food.Describing the experiment as ""StarTalk"", Musk then said “In America it’s pretty easy to keep yourself alive. So my threshold for existing was pretty low. I figured I could be in some dingy apartment with my computer and be okay, and not starve.”Google co-founder Larry Page has previously shared that Elon Musk sometimes asked to crash at his house when he had nowhere else to stay. In a 2022 TED talk, Elon Musk said, “I don't even own a place right now, I'm literally staying at friends' places.”Musk’s former partner Grimes once told Vanity Fair that he lived “at times below the poverty line.” During the interview in March 2022, she said “Bro does not live like a billionaire” adding “Bro lives at times below the poverty line.”She then recalled staying in a “$40,000 house” with no security and a mattress that had a hole in it. Instead of replacing the mattress, Musk told her they should just “switch sides.”According to a Benzinga report, Musk once bought a $1 million McLaren F1 but crashed it while showing it off. “Watch this,” he said before losing control of the car. It flew into the air and crashed.“It wasn’t insured,” he later admitted. The billionaire never replaced it and now mostly drives Tesla cars.","Elon Musk is the world’s richest person, but he reportedly doesn’t like living like a typical billionaire.

Google never silenced Geoffrey Hinton, but self-censorship kicked in

5 biggest AI announcements at Microsoft Build 2025

""We would never accept this mindset in any other field""

Geoffrey Hinton , who's known as the "" Godfather of AI ,"" has revealed the internal pressures that influenced his decision to leave Google after more than a decade, citing self-censorship concerns that prevented him from speaking freely about artificial intelligence dangers .Speaking on the ""Diary of a CEO"" podcast that aired June 16, Hinton explained how corporate loyalty created an unspoken barrier to discussing AI risks. ""If you work for a big company, you don't feel right saying things that will damage the big company,"" he said, describing the psychological constraint he faced while employed at Google.The neural network pioneer, who quit Google in 2023, emphasized that the tech giant never directly pressured him to remain silent about AI safety issues. ""Google encouraged me to stay and work on AI safety, and said I could do whatever I liked on AI safety,"" Hinton noted. However, he admitted that employees naturally ""censor yourself"" when working for major corporations.Hinton's departure came as he grew increasingly concerned about AI's potential dangers, including the spread of misinformation, job displacement, and what he termed ""existential risk"" from digital intelligence surpassing human capabilities.

AI agents drive transformation

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy delivered a stark warning to the company's 350,000 corporate employees this week, announcing that artificial intelligence will fundamentally reduce the workforce over the next few years through ""efficiency gains."" The memo has sparked immediate backlash across internal company channels, with workers questioning leadership's vision and expressing concerns about the aggressive AI push.""We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,"" Andy Jassy wrote in his company-wide message, predicting the transformation will ""reduce our total corporate workforce"" as AI agents and generative AI systems take over human roles. Despite the job displacement warning, Jassy urged workers to adapt, stating that ""Those who embrace this change will be well-positioned to have high impact.""Employee reaction was swift and critical across multiple internal Slack channels viewed by Business Insider. ""There is nothing more motivating on a Tuesday than reading that your job will be replaced by AI in a few years,"" one worker wrote sarcastically. Others voiced deeper concerns about over-reliance on artificial intelligence without proper safeguards.""It's dangerous, and it will have real consequences,"" warned one employee about leaning too heavily on AI systems that aren't always reliable sources of truth.

With the ongoing wave of layoffs, fear of AI-driven job losses ripple through the professionals around the globe, however, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky is suggesting a more balanced perspective. He emphasises that AI will undoubtedly bring ‘a ton of disruption’ , but it will also reshape the nature of work and will create more opportunities. In an interview with Bloomberg, Roslansky linked the present technological shift to Industrial Revolution. He stressed on the fact that despite initial problems, AI will ultimately create more industries and multiple new job opportunities .Ryan Roslansky emphasised that the rise of AI doesn’t mean the end of work—it means the evolution of work. “We’re seeing a shift in the skills employers are looking for,” he noted, pointing to LinkedIn data highlighting increase in demand for AI literacy, human-AI collaboration skills and prompt engineering.""There's going to be, over time, more and more options to build careers without having to go work for a big company,"" Ryan Roslansky suggested. He also said that the skills needed for the same jobs are also evolving. For instance in India, the job skills required for the same job have changed by 40% since 2015 and he expects this figure to rise to 70% by 2030.Ryan Roslansky's views align with those of LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman , who has also publicly stated that people are underestimating the impact of AI on jobs but rejects the notion of a ""bloodbath."" Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, has direct advice for those who claim artificial intelligence (AI) isn't useful and yet to find practical applications for the technology, suggesting that a lack of perceived utility stems from insufficient effort. He also shared examples of how he uses the tool effectively in his daily life.“Frankly, if you haven’t found something where it's useful to you, about something you care about, then you're not trying hard enough, you're not being original enough,” Reid Hoffman stated during an interview on The Economist podcast, broadcast this week (via Business Insider).Both LinkedIn executives emphasise on the fact that it is important for workers to shift their focus from static jobs and master their tasks by learning new skills.","LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky says AI will reshape the nature of work and create more opportunities.
