The History of India (V) c. 1550-1605

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar attended the launch of historian Vikram Sampath 's book Tipu Sultan at the India Habitat Centre in Delhi on Saturday.During his address at the event, Jaishankar described Tipu Sultan as a ""very complex figure in history."" ""Tipu Sultan is actually a very, very complex figure in history. On the one hand, he has the reputation as a key figure who resisted the British colonial control over India, and it is a fact that his defeat and death can be considered a turning point when it came to the fate of peninsular India,"" Jaishankar said.He also pointed out that in Tipu Sultan’s case, a ""particular narrative"" has been promoted over the years, which has largely focused on his anti-British stance while downplaying other dimensions of his rule.""History in all society is complicated, and the politics of the day often indulges in cherry-picking facts. To a considerable extent that has happened in the case of Tipu Sultan,"" he remarked. According to Jaishankar, this narrative focuses on the ""Tipu-English binary"" while excluding a broader and more nuanced understanding of his role in history.The EAM noted that the current political environment in India has allowed for ""alternative perspectives"" on historical figures like Tipu Sultan to emerge. He said, ""In the last decade, the changes in our political dispensation have encouraged the emergence of alternative perspectives and balanced accounts. We are no longer prisoners of a vote bank, nor is it politically incorrect to bring out inconvenient truths. There are many more subjects on which the same degree of objectivity is needed.""Jaishankar discussed the importance of studying history with an open mind and engaging in genuine debates. He emphasized that a pluralistic society and vibrant democracy require objective accounts of history. He suggested that much of India’s past has been edited to suit specific political or ideological purposes. ""How much of our past has been airbrushed, how awkward issues have been glossed over, how facts are tailored for regime convenience—these are basic questions which confront us all today,"" he said.Referring to Tipu Sultan’s actions in different regions, Jaishankar noted that opinions about him remain divided. While many remember him for resisting British colonial control, others have strong negative sentiments about his rule, particularly in regions like Mysore, Coorg, and Malabar.He acknowledged that Tipu Sultan’s resistance to the British was significant, saying, ""There can be no doubt that Tipu Sultan was fiercely and almost consistently anti-British. But how much of it was inherent and how much a result of their allying with his local rivals, that is difficult to distinguish.""The minister also highlighted Tipu Sultan’s alliances with foreign powers, which complicate a straightforward interpretation of his legacy. ""To counter British ambitions, Tipu Sultan had no hesitation in collaborating with the French and that makes a ‘straightforward anti-foreign narrative’ very difficult to assert,"" he said.Touching upon Tipu Sultan’s foreign policy, Jaishankar said Tipu reached out to the rulers of Turkey, Afghanistan, and Persia for support, often on the basis of shared religious ties. He noted that this reflects the historical context of the time, where the modern sense of nationhood was absent. ""Perhaps the truth is that the sense of nationhood, all of us have now, was simply not there then,"" he observed.Jaishankar praised Vikram Sampath’s book for providing a detailed and ""balanced"" account of Tipu Sultan’s life and the era he lived in. He said the book goes beyond being a simple biography, offering insights into politics, strategy, administration, sociology, and diplomacy. ""To call Sampath's book a biography would be a serious understatement. It is something very much more, capturing the flavour of a fast-moving and complicated era but offering insights into politics, strategy, administration, sociology and even diplomacy,"" he said.He also appreciated the challenges Sampath might have faced in presenting a more comprehensive view of Tipu Sultan, given the strong existing narratives. He emphasized that the book allows readers to make their own judgments by presenting a detailed context.Jaishankar concluded by reiterating the importance of objective historical accounts. He shared his perspective as someone who has experienced what he calls politically influenced historical narratives during his education. ""As a product myself of an institution that was at the centre of these politically driven endeavours, I could well appreciate the need to present an actual representation of history,"" he said.Jaishankar spoke about selective narratives at a time when, as part of the syllabus ""rationalization"" process, NCERT last year removed significant portions of Mughal history from its textbooks for Classes 7-12. As a result, Mughal history is now briefly covered in Class 7, touched upon in Class 8, omitted entirely in Classes 9 to 11, and included in a shortened form in Class 12.This reduction is not limited to school education. At the undergraduate level, Delhi University’s BA History Honours program has also revised its curriculum to exclude references to the Mughals. In the 2019-20 academic year, the syllabus for Semester 4 dropped the topic The Consolidation of Mughal Rule under Akbar from the course. This topic had previously covered Akbar’s military campaigns, administrative reforms, and responses to revolts and resistance."," External affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar attended the launch of historian Vikram Sampath's book Tipu Sultan at the India Habitat Centre in Delhi on Saturday. During his address at the event, Jaisankar described Tipuultan as a ""very complex figure in history"" He said the current political environment in India has allowed for ""alternative perspectives"" on historical figures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115858304,imgsize-796892,width-400,resizemode-4/115858304.jpg"

"In top 'clean' cities, air is not so fresh, data shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-top-clean-cities-air-is-not-so-fresh-data-shows/articleshow/115855837.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indore may be the cleanest city in India, having secured the top rank seven times in a row, but when it comes to air quality, it reported a 21% rise in the level of the pollutant PM10 in 2023-24 compared to 2017-18. The city joined 30 others including Navi Mumbai, Vizag, Cuttack, Guwahati, Gwalior, Patna, Raipur, Chandigarh and Bhopal that reported increase in the level of annual average particulate matter (PM10) - a critical air pollutant - during that period.All these 31 cities are in the list of 130 which are under National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched by environment ministry in Jan 2019 with an aim to improve air quality by reducing PM10 up to 40% by 2025-26 from the 2017-18 level or achieving the national standards during the period.Incidentally, Navi Mumbai was the third ranker and Vizag fourth in the list of cleanest cities after Indore and Surat in 2023. This ranking is based on the cities performance in terms of their performance in sanitation and municipal waste management. On the air quality front, Vizag reported 58% increase (second worst in the list of 31) in level of PM10 in FY 2023-24 compared to FY 2017-18 while Navi Mumbai reported 11% increase during the period.Surat, on the other hand, reported 21% reduction in the level of air pollutant in 2023-24 compared to 2017-18 but the city's PM10 continues to be much higher than the acceptable limit of 60 g/m3. Though both kinds of cleanliness - sanitation/waste and air - cannot be compared due to the very different nature of the problem, it shows that the efforts on one front may not make cities liveable unless air quality is also be taken care of by dealing with multiple other factors in neighbouring areas or in a region.On a positive note, the comparative data on level of pollutant shared by environment ministry in the Parliament, shows 97 out of 130 cities have shown improvement in air quality in terms of annual average PM10 concentrations in FY 2023-24 compared to FY 2017-18.Though 55 cities have achieved reduction of 20% or more during the period, most of them still reported higher level of pollutant than the acceptable standards. Varanasi turned out to be the best performer by reducing level of PM10 by 68%highest percentage reduction in the list of 97 - but the city still has higher level of pollutant than national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).Total 18 out of 130 cities conform to the national ambient air quality standards in terms of PM10 during 2023-24. Among big cities, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Delhi, Nagpur, Chennai and Surat are among others which have shown improvement but their pollutant levels are still not good enough to meet the annual average acceptable limit.","Indore reported a 21% rise in the level of the pollutant PM10 in 2023-24 compared to 2017-18.

Bangladesh carriers cancel 3 daily flights as flyer count nosedives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-carriers-cancel-3-daily-flights-as-flyer-count-nosedives/articleshow/115854778.cms,"No. of B'desh-Kol flights down by half since July

KOLKATA: At least two daily flights between Kolkata and Dhaka and one between Kolkata and Chittagong have been cancelled by airlines operating between the two countries as passenger count continues to nosedive in the wake of continued unrest in Bangladesh, attacks on minorities and curbs on travel due to Indian visa restrictions.Bangladesh's flag bearer, Biman Bangladesh, has cut operations between Kolkata and Dhaka from twice daily to a single flight a day. The country's private carrier, US-Bangla Airlines, has reduced the frequency to Dhaka from twice daily to once and has discontinued the flight to Chittagong.Indian carrier IndiGo still continues to operate its twice-daily schedule, but sources said the airline was closely following the situation in Dhaka. The dip in passenger loads over the past few months, which has further accentuated in recent days, was a cause for concern, they said.The number of flights from Kolkata to Dhaka/Chittagong has dipped from 125 in Sept to 97 in Nov. Consequently, the count of departing passengers has reduced from 15,479 in Sept to 12,747 in Nov. The number of arrivals to Kolkata from Bangladesh has dipped from 114 in Sept to 96 in Nov, resulting in a drop in passenger count from 12,540 in Sept to 10,121 now.Bangladeshi carriers have been the worst-hit due to the crisis in the country. Biman Bangladesh flights from Kolkata are down from 59 in July to 28 in Nov while US-Bangla Airlines has fared worse with flight departures down from 84 in July to 24 now.In contrast, IndiGo flight departures are down from 62 in July to 45 in Nov, while arrivals during this period are down from 64 in July to 44 now.While Bangladeshis who depend on Kolkata for both commerce and healthcare are majorly impacted, a section of the economy in Kolkata, particularly hotels, restaurants and hospitals that serve Bangladeshis, have been dealt a body blow. Hotel occupancy in the Marquis Street-Sudder Street belt is down to 20% while shops and restaurants in and around New Market have witnessed a 65%-70% slide in sales.""Tourism, both conventional and local, as well as business, are impacted by the ongoing turmoil there. For most middle-class Bangladeshis, India is a foreign country within reach for medical as well as religious tourism where affordability, food and language are not a barrier. Unless the situation gets resolved, everyone will feel the pinch,"" said Travel Agents' Association of India chairman (East) Anjani Dhanuka.","Bangladesh's flag bearer, Biman Bangladesh, has cut operations between Kolkata and Dhaka from twice daily to a single flight a day.

The city's 24-hour average AQI reached 325 ('very poor') at 4pm, according to the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) daily national bulletin.This was a deterioration from Wednesday's reading of 303 ('very poor').Weather analysts noted consistent wind speeds of 10-12 km/hr during both days, but predict reduced speeds over the weekend due to an approaching western disturbance. ""The winds will slow down within the next two to three days, going calm. This will impact the air quality negatively,"" said an official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).IITM's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi (EWS) has predicted: ""The air quality is likely to be in the Very Poor category from November 29, 2024, to December 1, 2024.

His pulse rate and blood pressure are normal. Blood samples were checked and don't show any symptoms of dengue or malaria. He was given an injectable dose on Saturday evening for bacterial infection (Monocef and Beplex saline 100ml).""When asked about the reason behind the health deterioration of Shinde, Dr Karpe said, ""He travelled a lot in the last month and also worked on his farm, resulting in exertion. We have suggested he rest for the next two days due to weakness. CM Shinde started feeling ill from Friday night. He felt better on Saturday morning but again at noon he started having a fever. We have stationed an ambulance, physician, a surgeon, and a brother along with medicines equipped in the ambulance,"" added Dr Karpe.Meanwhile, former minister from Shiv Sena, Deepak Kesarkar, arrived at Dare Tamb village to meet CM Shinde on Saturday but had to return without meeting the CM after learning about his health condition.Earlier on Friday, the Shiv Sena chief left for his native place a day after meeting Union home minister Amit Shah at his residence in Delhi.

Maha govt formation meet unlikely before Monday

A day after the Mahayuti leaders' meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi, caretaker CM Eknath Shinde left for his village Dare Tamb in Mahabaleshwar taluka in Satara district. Sources said the BJP is working on him to get him to accept the deputy CM's post.The swearing-in of the Maharashtra cabinet is unlikely until Dec 5 as the talks could only progress after partners agree on the return of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis as CM with nominees of Shiv Sena and NCP as the two deputies.The swearing-in was earlier expected to be held on Monday. However, the negotiations are unlikely to be wrapped up because of the preoccupation of Amit Shah, who has to balance the competing demands of Mahayuti partners with the DGPs' conference until Saturday. Sources now expect the oath-taking to be scheduled on Dec 5 at Azad Maidan both because of the tricky nature of Shah's assignment and the engagements of PM Modi, who is billed to be the star of the show.The deliberations at Shah's residence late Thursday night saw outgoing CM Eknath Shinde signing up on the logic that BJP, with 132 MLAs of its own and having lined up another five, was the natural claimant for the CM's office, sources familiar with the negotiations said.While Shinde did not spell out whether he would serve as deputy CM along with NCP's Ajit Pawar , BJP sources remained hopeful of persuading him to be part of a Fadnavis team, with NCP sharing the optimism. There also appears to be an understanding among the partners over the Speaker, an important figure when it comes to coalitions, being a BJP nominee. Significantly, Shinde dropped hints about Sena's interest in having his nominee as chairperson of the legislative council and BJP, according to sources, did not look averse to acceding to the desire as part of compensation to Shinde.The appreciation of Shinde's contribution in Mahayuti's grand return and the ""sacrifice"" he is likely to make for the sake of the unity of the alliance will not extend to BJP acquiescing in an insistence for the home department. Fadnavis would get to retain home, while Ajit Pawar is seen as a shoe-in for sixth term as finance minister of the richest and the most industrialised state.Both Shiv Sena and NCP have argued that the power-sharing arrangement cannot be worked out merely on the basis of mathematics because doing so would, for all practical purposes, mean installing a BJP regime, given that the party's own numbers are within striking distance of the magic mark of 145. However, unlike a scheme based on numbers where berths are assigned on the basis of who has got how many MLAs, crafting an arrangement expected to be based on abstract considerations like ""fairness"" and ""objectivity"" can be difficult, with each partner having notions which may not gel.In Delhi, Shinde, speaking to the media on Thursday night, said the meeting with Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda, along with his colleagues from the Mahayuti-Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar-was cordial. ""The meeting was to discuss govt formation. Today was the first meeting; tomorrow, a second meeting will be held in Mumbai on CM and portfolio allocation. I have already announced Shiv Sena's support to Mahayuti CM candidate, so that deadlock was resolved,"" he said.When no Mahayuti meeting happened and news came that Shinde would be in the village for the next two days, his colleague Uday Samant told media that Shinde was running a fever the past couple of days and went to his village, to a healthier environment to recuperate.Asked if Shinde would accept dy CM's post, Samant said, ""We want Shinde Saheb to be in Maharashtra politics, and he should be in govt."" Sources said there is Shani Amavasya on Saturday and Sunday, additional reasons for no action happening.BJP sources said its elected MLAs have so far not been called to Mumbai to elect the party's legislative leader. ""This meeting is likely to be held on Monday. Thereafter, the legislative heads of the three parties will meet to decide on the CM, Dy CM posts and portfolio allocation,"" sources said.BJP sources said if Fadnavis, a former CM, could be dy CM, then Shinde too could take up the post, adding it would send out a clear message that it is not just BJP netas who have to compromise.",Maha govt formation meet unlikely before Monday.

'Sounded happy 15 minutes before suicide': What we know so far about Air India pilot Srishti Tuli's death,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sounded-happy-15-minutes-before-suicide-what-we-know-so-far-about-air-india-pilot-srishti-tulis-death/articleshow/115841543.cms,"Tuli's family alleges foul play, as she sounded happy 15 minutes before her death.

What do we know so far about Air India pilot Srishti Tuli's suicide?

Tuli was found hanging with a data cable in her flat after a distress call to Pandit.

Police detained Pandit based on an FIR filed by Tuli's uncle, accusing him of abetment of suicide under Section 108 of the BNS.

Tuli’s family revealed she spoke with her mother shortly before her death and appeared happy. Her uncle said, “What went wrong in those 15 minutes is something the police have to find out.”

Tuli’s uncle claimed Pandit had coerced her into transferring Rs 15,000 last month and Rs 50,000 in November. He also allegedly made her pay for his shopping and food bills via QR codes.

Pandit’s lawyer argued his client made 90 calls to Tuli while returning to Mumbai after her distressing video call. “If his intentions were wrong, why would he return and take her to the hospital?” said the lawyer.

Investigators have seized Pandit’s mobile phone and are attempting to recover deleted WhatsApp messages, which they believe could provide crucial insights into their relationship and the incident.

Pandit told the police he deleted the messages because he had threatened self-harm if Tuli died. ""When questioned about the deleted messages, he stated he had threatened self-harm if she died. Police are sceptical of his explanation and are working with forensic experts to recover the deleted content,"" a police officer told TOI.

Authorities told TOI that Tuli had been in a heated argument with Pandit before her death. On the night of the incident, she reportedly made a video call threatening self-harm.

Police are scrutinising Pandit’s failure to alert authorities about Tuli’s threats and his decision to access her flat without involving law enforcement.

Tuli and Pandit met two years ago while training as commercial pilots in Delhi. Pandit, who reportedly failed his qualification exams, is believed to have contributed to Tuli’s mental distress.

NEW DELHI: As the mystery surrounding the suicide of Air India pilot, Srishti Tuli continued, her family members told TOI that she spoke to them just 15 minutes before taking the extreme step. Her boyfriend, Aditya Pandit, whose custody has been extended until 2 December, also allegedly made Tuli pay for his food and shopping bills by sending her QR codes. According to her uncle, he also made her transfer Rs 15,000 in October and Rs 50,000 in November.Meanwhile, Pandit's lawyer maintained that he was falsely implicated in the case. He claimed that after speaking with Tuli, who said that she would end her life, Pandit immediately rushed back midway from Delhi and called her at least 90 times.Tuli was found hanging in her rented flat in Mumbai's Marol area on 25 November.

Shimla court dismisses plea against demolition of Sanjauli mosque’s 3 unauthorised floors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shimla-court-dismisses-plea-against-demolition-of-sanjauli-mosques-3-unauthorised-floors/articleshow/115845106.cms,"NEW DELHI: Shimla district court on Saturday rejected an appeal filed by the All Himachal Muslim Organisation (AHMO) challenging an order from the Shimla municipal commissioner’s court that directed the demolition of three floors of the Sanjauli mosque.The controversy surrounding the mosque's expansion dates back to 2011 when the Shimla municipal corporation issued a demolition notice. The building, originally a single-story structure, had been reportedly expanded to five stories without the required approvals.According to a PTI report, Latif Mohammad, president of the Sanjauli mosque committee, offered to voluntarily remove the three unauthorized floors in response to the court’s order. He sought permission from the municipal commissioner to proceed with the demolition. The municipal commissioner’s court subsequently issued an order on October 5, 2024, authorising the demolition, and gave two months to complete the task.AHMO contested the demolition order, arguing that Latif Mohammad lacked the authority to represent the mosque in this matter. However, Mohammad has consistently maintained that he has held this position since 2006 and was notified by the municipal commissioner’s court in his capacity as president regarding the demolition order.Mohammad also cited logistical challenges in carrying out the demolition, noting a shortage of available labor, as many workers had returned to their home states. ""However, whatever decision the court will take, we will accept it,"" he said.The Waqf Board claims ownership of the land on which the mosque stands. However, local residents have disputed this, asserting that the land belongs to the state revenue department.

NEW DELHI: Stating that state should not arbitrarily reject a scheme for petty political gains, Centre has urged Tamil Nadu (TN) government to reconsider its decision to reject the Prime Minister’s Vishwakarma Scheme, which aims to uplift traditional artisans and craftspeople on Saturday. Minister of state for skill development and entrepreneurship (MSDE), Jayant Chaudhary , emphasised that the scheme is designed to foster social and economic mobility for individuals engaged in 18 traditional trades and crafts, and is “not caste-oriented,"" as alleged by TN.Chief minister M K Stalin recently informed union minister for MSMEs Jitan Ram Manjhi that Tamil Nadu would not implement the scheme in its current form, citing concerns over caste-based discrimination and a lack of inclusivity . Instead, Tamil Nadu plans to develop its own initiative to support artisans. Stalin also highlighted issues with the scheme's eligibility criteria, proposing changes such as removing the requirement for applicants’ families to have a history in traditional trades and raising the minimum age for eligibility to 35.Responding to these concerns, MSDE reiterated the inclusivity of the PM Vishwakarma Scheme . A statement from the ministry clarified that the scheme transcends caste and gender barriers, offering support for artisans from diverse backgrounds. Nationally, 2.45 crore applications have been received, with Tamil Nadu contributing 8.52 lakh registrations, of which 75.78% are from women. The MSDE also noted that the scheme’s demographic representation includes 19.89% scheduled castes, 6.69% scheduled tribes, 50.28% other backward classes, and 23.14% from the general category.Highlighting the scheme’s achievements, the Centre reported that over 10 lakh artisans have been trained, and loans worth Rs 1,909.43 crores have been sanctioned to over 2.21 lakh beneficiaries. Chaudhary warned that TN’s rejection of the scheme would deprive its artisans of significant benefits, urging the state to reconsider what he termed a “partisan approach to governance.”Centre also reaffirmed its willingness to collaborate with TN to address local concerns while preserving the scheme’s core principles of respect, skill enhancement, and prosperity. “By adopting a partisan approach to governance, the Tamil Nadu State Government is only denying its citizens their rightful benefits of a scheme with a national footprint; further, one that is designed with the culture & spirit of the people of Tamil Nadu at its core!” said Chaudhary.",PM Vishwakarma Scheme aims to uplift traditional artisans and craftspeople.

All of this was further amplified by certain media with vested interests. But even in the face of such adversity, our commitment to our principles remained strong,"" said Adani.He said that after successfully raising Rs 20,000 crore from India's largest-ever FPO, the company made ""the extraordinary decision"" to return the proceeds.""Moreover, our all-time record financial results in the same year showcased our commitment to operational excellence.

""The bolder your dreams, the more the world will scrutinise you. But it is precisely in that scrutiny that you must find the courage to rise, to challenge the status quo, and to build a path where none exists. To pioneer is to embrace the unknown, to break limits, and to believe in your vision even when the world cannot yet see it,"" said Adani.He also recalled the resistance to the group's investment in a coal mine in Australia. ""In fact, it was so intense that we ended up funding the entire project of $10 billion with our own equity,"" Adani said, referring to opposition from NGOs.""While we now have a world-class operating mine in Australia, and it could be seen as a great sign of our resilience, the fact is that 100% equity funding took away over $30 billion of debt financing from our green energy projects,"" said Adani.""Looking back, while we have had our successes, our challenges have been even bigger.

It has been alleged that he is operating with gangster Kapil Sangwan , who is behind many extortion and firing cases in the city.Sangwan, who is in alliance with gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, is currently in the UK and has a red corner notice against him. Two of his shooters went on a rampage early Nov, firing indiscriminately at two business establishments in Paschim Vihar and Chhawla on the same day following extortion demands from Sangwan. At the end of Aug, Sangwan sent his shooters to fire at a popular confectionery outlet in west Delhi's Tilak Nagar after the owner refused to pay Rs 2 crore as protection money.The AAP MLA was under investigation since last year after an audio clip of a purported conversation between him and Sangwan, also known as Nandu, surfaced. On Saturday, Balyan was called in for questioning in the case. ""However, he didn't co-operate and was evasive, prompting the need for custodial interrogation,"" a senior crime branch officer said. He was arrested around 7 pm in FIR number 191/23, police said.The case pertains to a purported audio recording in which Sangwan and the MLA were allegedly overheard speaking on the phone and discussing 'vasooli (recovery)'. They talked about ""escalating threats, demanding ransom and distribution of the money collected"".""In one of the alleged cases discussed, the recovery was purportedly done from Guru Charan, the owner of ASD Builders. Charan was given death threats if he didn't make the payment, it was alleged. Charan filed a complaint with Delhi Police, prompting the action,"" the officer added.In the recording seized by police, the MLA allegedly asked about the target, to which Sangwan replied, saying that Guru Charan, a builder in Puran sector, was on his list. The gangster asked if the MLA would arrange recovery, he would make the ""necessary phone calls"".Balyan, who represents Delhi's Uttam Nagar constituency, also served as the DDC chairman for south Delhi.Sangwan has occupied a place in the list of top wanted gangsters after he orchestrated the assassination of INLD Haryana unit chief Nafe Singh Rathi. The fugitive has been operating a lucrative extortion racket through shooters recruited via social media. His brother, Jyoti Baba, is currently serving time in Tihar Jail.Sangwan has a rivalry with gangster Manjeet Mahal since the latter bumped off Sangwan's brother-in-law in 2015.

Every fifth road death was of a pedestrian in 2023,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-fifth-road-death-was-of-a-pedestrian-in-2023/articleshow/115852441.cms,"NEW DELHI: Every fifth death in road accidents was a pedestrian and 45% of all fatalities were those riding two-wheelers in 2023. In a first official statement, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said“over 1.72 lakh people died” in road crashes last year and around 35,000 of them were pedestrians.At an event in Lucknow, the minister said nearly five lakh crashes are registered annually and last year around 10,000 of the persons killed were below 18 years and approximately 35,000 road accidents were reported in areas outside schools and colleges (institutional areas). “Around 54,000 deaths were due to non-wearing of helmets by two-wheeler riders, 16,000 died for not wearing seatbelts and 12,000 were killed due to overloading of vehicles. Around 34,000 accidents were caused involving drivers without valid licence,” the minister said.Neither the road transport ministry nor National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) have released the reports of road and accidental deaths of last year. TOI on October 19 had first reported how 2023 recorded the maximum road fatalities (nearly 1.73 lakh) with Uttar Pradesh topping among states and UTs, followed by Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.Gadkari said the highest number of road accident deaths in the world occurs in India and out of this, the maximum number of deaths are recorded in UP. “There were 44,000 road accidents in UP and 23,650 persons were killed. Of these, 1,800 deaths are those below 18 years and 10,000 are of pedestrians and two-wheeler riders. There were 8,726 deaths due to speeding in UP,” he added.The minister said road crashes are rising despite efforts to minimise them because people neither have respect nor fear for the law. “There are many reasons for accidents, but the biggest reason is human behavior. It’s also true that there are potholes on roads, there are not enough underpasses and foot over bridges. We have identified the black spots and these are being rectified on the National Highway by spending about Rs 40,000 crore. There are many state highways and district roads. It concerns the state govts as well. The cause of the accidents can be found and rectified,” Gadkari said.On the rising pedestrian deaths, road safety expert Rohit Baluja said, “The one major factor missing in our road development and traffic management is the traffic engineering. We are definitely making roads, but not managing them and pedestrians have no sense of safety. The authorities must understand that road users' habits are formed based on traffic engineering.”Responding to questions from students about the need for a mandatory curriculum on road safety in schools, the minister said that they are trying to ensure the state govts include “Rules of the Road”. Welcoming the move, former chief of International Road Federation K K Kapila said, “We have been suggesting this to the govt. Making children aware about rules of the road and safe behavior will help check road deaths.","Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said“over 1.72 lakh people died’ in road crashes last year.

Q:

Why don't you tell us in a nutshell what 'Finding Forgotten Cities' was all about?

A:

Q:

What were the firsts that you unearthed during the course of this research

A:

Q:

In the hundred years since this research was made visible and more, how is it that archaeological excavations are being made more cost effective? Would new tools of say, AI, help in this way?

A:

Listen here:Excerpts from the interview:When I began the research which eventually culminated in 'Finding Forgotten Cities', it did not begin as research about how the Indus Civilisation was discovered. As a matter of fact, I was thinking of doing a biography of John Marshall, director general of the Archaeological Survey, who in fact announced the discovery of the Indus Civilisation on Sept 20, 1924. So, you know, just a little over 100 years ago. And I thought it would be in the 'life and times' genre. As it so happened, when I began looking at the material which was in the file room of the Archaeological Survey of India, there was so much material which I felt could actually be woven into a story around the discovery of the Indus Civilisation. This is because the story itself covers a large part of Marshall's career. And what eventually emerged from these files was very different from what the given story that people thought about when they thought about the discovery ofMohenjo-daro and Harappa .I think there were several. My most favourite bit relates to the Italian Luigi Pio Tessitori . I knew that he had worked in Bikaner and had visited Kalibangan, but I didn't know the whole story about the fact that he had excavated Kalibangan, a Harappan city as we now know it, the first Harappan city to have been excavated after Alexander Cunningham's excavations of the 19th century at Harappa. And he had discovered seals there which were exactly like those from Harappa. He could not actually get the credit that he deserved because he passed away in his 30s after having contracted the Spanish flu. He died in Bikaner, and he's actually buried there.The second thing, which was very new to me, and this again is around another individual who is much better known. Rakhal Das Banerjee. Rakhal Das Banerjee was the excavator of Mohenjo-daro. But I didn't realise that when he actually went to excavate Mohenjo-daro in the winter of 1922, he knew that this was his last season in that part of India. That was because he had been involved in all kinds of financial irregularities. So he had got permission to excavate at Mohenjo-daro, but it was just by accident that these seals within the first few days were found below the platform where you have a large historical Buddhist stupa. And he was trained as an archaeologist. So he immediately realised the importance of what he had discovered. This again was a story that I was not aware of. The other thing that came as a big surprise to me was the kind of pressure that the Archaeological Survey worked under. Non-commercial departments in the British Raj were always under threat.I don't know how AI would help, but I can tell you the post-Independence history of the Indus Civilisation, which will provide some kind of insight into the shifts that have taken place in the way in which archeology is done. Now, when you think of a Mohenjo-daro or Harappa being excavated in the 1920s, you didn't actually have specialists from elsewhere as a part of the team there. So that, for example, when skeletons were found, they went immediately into disrepair because you didn't have anthropologists there. So today, on the other hand, you have these large multidisciplinary teams. So I think there has been a change in the way excavations are conducted.

Dhankhar criticised the misuse of parliamentary tools like Rule 267, which he said was being “weaponised as a mechanism of disruption.” He lamented, “We are creating a very bad precedent. We are dishonouring the people of this country and not coming up to their expectations.”Dhankhar urged political parties to put aside differences and focus on national priorities, saying, “We cannot, under any situation, keep any interest above our national interest.” He commended the orderly conduct of the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly, calling it a “beacon of hope” and contrasting it with the chaos in Parliament. He also highlighted India’s economic progress, noting that while the country is now the fifth-largest global economy, achieving developed nation status will require collective effort and significant growth in citizens’ incomes.The opposition, meanwhile, has criticised the government, accusing it of enabling parliamentary adjournments rather than opposing them.

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari held a high-level meeting here on Saturday to review the progress of critical road infrastructure projects in the state, particularly those aimed at facilitating the Maha Kumbh scheduled in Prayagraj next year.The review covered multiple projects, including the widening of the 63.17-km Raebareli-Prayagraj national highway, construction of four-lane bypasses at four locations, a 7.6-km segment of the Prayagraj Inner Ring Road , and the development of a six-lane bridge parallel to an existing one over the Ganga river at Phaphamau.The Maha Kumbh Mela will be held at Prayagraj from January 13 to February 26. The world's largest religious congregation is expected to see a footfall of more than 43 crore pilgrims this time, according to official estimates.""Both leaders emphasised the timely completion of all ongoing works, instructing officials to ensure their readiness by December 25, 2024, with strict adherence to quality and safety standards,"" the Uttar Pradesh government said in a statement.Describing the Maha Kumbh as a confluence of India's religious, cultural and social heritage, Adityanath said he expects the event to draw millions of devotees and tourists.He also stressed the need for robust infrastructure, directing officials to install CCTV cameras, streetlights and safety mechanisms along the key highways.Additional facilities like ambulances, recovery vehicles, patrolling units and medical-and-traffic-assistance posts should also be prioritised, the chief minister said.Gadkari highlighted the broader roadmap for road development in Uttar Pradesh, including discussions on proposals worth Rs 1.39 lakh crore.This includes strengthening NH-530B in Bareilly, constructing a bypass at Pratapgarh, upgrading the Prayagraj-Dohri Ghat road to four lanes and completing the Barabanki-Jarwal-Bahraich road (NH-927).According to the state government, the projects in their advanced stages include the Shamli-Gorakhpur and Aligarh-Moradabad-Bijnor corridors for which bids have already been secured.Connectivity initiatives such as the Ayodhya (Utraula)-Prayagraj and Prayagraj-Varanasi-Ara-Patna corridors are also underway. Feasibility studies and detailed project reports (DPRs) for other significant routes like the Gorakhpur-Jamania-Saidraja and Gorakhpur-Kishanganj-Siliguri corridors are progressing, the government said.Adityanath also pressed for expedited land acquisition and approvals for the upcoming projects, urging the authorities to mitigate road-accident risks through coordinated efforts.""Both leaders also explored proposals for bypass construction in 10 districts and the enhancement of the existing highways like the Lucknow-Gorakhpur, Banda-Kanpur and Gorakhpur-Varanasi routes,"" the statement said.The meeting held at the chief minister's official residence was attended by state Transport Minister Dayashankar Singh, senior state and Central officials, and representatives from the National Highways Authority of India and Public Works Department.At the meeting, officials highlighted that two out of four bypasses on National Highway-30 (Rae Bareli to Prayagraj section) at Jagatpur, Babuganj, Unchahar, and Alapur have been completed, while the remaining two are scheduled for timely completion.Additionally, construction of the 10.98 km two-lane Pratapgarh bypass and the 5.10 km four-lane Jasra bypass was emphasised as crucial for improving traffic flow.The chief minister directed that ambulances and recovery vehicles be stationed at intervals of 20 km on national highways to ensure rapid emergency response.He also instructed the integration of nearby hospitals with an incident management system for improved road safety and emergency handling.Further measures included the installation of additional lighting at key points along the highways and extra toilet facilities at the toll plazas on Maha Kumbh routes.Adityanath also called for repairing the major highways such as the Lucknow-Gorakhpur, Banda-Kanpur, and Gorakhpur-Varanasi routes to ensure smooth travel for the pilgrims.Gadkari instructed the officials to develop proposals for bypasses in 10 additional districts, including Auraiya, Bulandshahr, Mainpuri, Bahraich, Baghpat, Bhadohi, Sambhal, Kaushambi, Chandauli, and Shravasti.He also directed the officials to prepare DPRs for the new corridors such as the Gorakhpur-Shamli and Kanpur-Ghaziabad routes.Gadkari noted that bypasses are operational in 53 districts, with work underway in eight more.Senior officials attending the meeting reported progress on the Shamli-Gorakhpur and Aligarh-Moradabad-Bijnor corridors, for which bids have been received.Connectivity improvement between Ayodhya (Utraula) and Prayagraj, as well as the Prayagraj-Varanasi-Ara-Patna corridor were also highlighted, with DPR preparations underway for the Gorakhpur-Jamania-Saidraja and Gorakhpur-Kishangarh-Siliguri routes.","The Maha Kumbh Mela will be held at Prayagraj from January 13 to February 26.

CHENNAI: Four people were killed in electrocutions in different parts of Chennai as Cyclone Fengal (pronounced Feinjal) brought 9cm to 13cm of rain across different parts of the city since Saturday morning.In its 7pm bulletin, IMD said the forward sector of spiral bands associated with the cyclone entered the land, and the system might take another three to four hours to further move and cross the coast near Puducherry.On Sunday, the weather system might continue to bring rainfall after it moves inland, as IMD issued an orange alert for heavy to very heavy rainfall for Chennai and 13 districts, including the city's three neighbouring districts. A red alert for extremely heavy spells was issued to Villupuram, Kallakurichi and Cuddalore as they are closer to the landfall location.Bloggers said the cyclone was caught between high-pressure ridges, and much of the clouds around the storm on the seaside vanished by Saturday evening due to high wind shear.""Cyclone Fengal is going to be stuck off the Cheyyur-Marakkanam coast till Sunday morning,"" said blogger Pradeep John in one of his online posts.Tamil Nadu's coastal districts and Chennai on Saturday escaped with long spells of rain and strong winds. There was flooding and tree falls, but not to the extent feared. Public transport was kept to a minimum and since it was the weekend and schools, colleges and most offices were shut, people hardly ventured out.The centre of the cyclonic storm, which slowed down from 10kmph to 7kmph, changed directions from 90km southeast of Chennai to 90km south of the city after 2.30pm.As many as 13 flights to and from Chennai were cancelled on Friday owing to bad weather and operational reasons.After the formation of Cyclone Fengal was confirmed by IMD, two IndiGo flights, one from Chennai to Mangaluru and another from Chennai to Trichy, were cancelled.

List of unsold player in IPL mega auction

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn. Notable names like David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, and Kane Williamson , who have been cornerstones in the IPL for years, found themselves without bids.Each had a base price of Rs 2 crore, but despite their immense experience and proven track records, none of them attracted offers. Their absence from the auction table raised questions, particularly given their global stature in T20 cricket. It’s a stark reminder of how the dynamics of the auction can sometimes overshadow established stars in favour of fresh talent.In addition to these marquee international names, other seasoned players like Shardul Thakur Ajinkya Rahane , and Glenn Phillips also went unsold. Rahane, a reliable middle-order batsman, and Thakur, an all-rounder with vast IPL experience, both entered the auction with a base price of Rs 1.5 crore, but failed to secure a contract.Similarly, Phillips, known for his explosive batting and wicketkeeping skills, and Thakur, a consistent bowler, were left out despite being integral parts of their national teams. This reflects the fierce competition in the auction, where franchises appear to be banking on younger, more explosive talent rather than experienced hands.Perhaps the most surprising snub was former U-19 captain Prithvi Shaw , who had once been considered one of India’s brightest young talents. With a modest base price of Rs 75 lakh, Shaw was expected to generate significant interest.However, despite his impressive domestic performances, Shaw failed to attract any buyers. This highlights a growing trend in the IPL, where franchises are increasingly looking for players who can deliver immediate impact, while the burden of expectation weighs heavily on players like Shaw, who have not yet lived up to their early promise.The unsold list also includes several uncapped players, such as Yash Dhull, Kartik Tyagi, and Piyush Chawla, who could have added value to any team. With base prices ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, these players were considered potential investments, but their inability to secure deals underscores the auction's unpredictable nature.As franchises continue to focus on emerging talent from India and abroad, the auction results serve as a reminder that the IPL is not just about star power but also about fitting the right players into the right roles, irrespective of their past achievements.","IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn.

Real reason behind Gronkowski’s absence from Fox NFL Sunday



Rob Gronkowski just might be retarded

Is there tension between Rob Gronkowski and Terry Bradshaw?



Rob Gronkowski ’s absence from Fox NFL Sunday this past week sparked rumors and speculation, especially after a playful jab from co-host Terry Bradshaw . Fans quickly wondered if the two were involved in some sort of on-air fallout. However, the truth behind Gronkowski ’s missing appearance is far simpler than the gossip suggests.Rob Gronkowski, former Patriots star, made headlines when he missed this Sunday’s Fox NFL Sunday broadcast. Speculation quickly swirled—did Terry Bradshaw’s recent jab at Gronk’s on-air analysis play a part in his absence? The two have co-hosted the show for two years, but this week, Gronk wasn’t there.The truth behind Gronkowski’s absence is much simpler and a bit less dramatic. He was actually in New Hampshire on November 24 to honor a commitment with Dick’s Sporting Goods, a date he’d set before the so-called ""beef"" with Bradshaw even happened. So, despite rumors, there was no falling-out or retirement plans at play here.Still, Bradshaw’s comment about Jimmy Johnson filling in for Gronk sparked curiosity. Johnson, who retired from his role last year, was replaced by Gronkowski two years ago, and his name resurfaced after Bradshaw’s November 17 remark about the four-time Super Bowl champion. The speculation about a rift between Bradshaw and Gronk was fueled, but it seems there’s no drama, just a prior commitment for Gronk.So, despite the chatter, Gronkowski’s absence had nothing to do with any tension with his co-host.Also Read: Andy Reid’s Chiefs highlight major TE injury as Travis Kelce struggles against NFL veteran After the Lions' dominant 52-6 victory over the Jaguars on November 17, the Fox NFL Sunday crew shared their thoughts on the game. Rob Gronkowski, a broadcaster for the show since 2022, highlighted how the Lions’ performance reflected Bill Belichick's philosophy of never underestimating an opponent.However, Terry Bradshaw couldn’t resist poking fun at Gronkowski’s analysis.“The guy whose seat you’re sitting in right now, while he’s on vacation” Bradshaw joked, referring to his absence.Gronkowski, slightly nervous, responded,“I’m part of the show, Terry, okay? Where are you going with that?” Bradshaw quickly backtracked, apologizing with, “I apologize Gronk, you know I love you.” (via: EssentiallySports)While the comment may have caught Gronk off guard, it was all in good fun—especially after the 35-year-old legend jokingly confirmed why his 76-year-old co-host sees him as a “part-time” worker due to his commitments to a $16 billion company.","Rob Gronkowski made headlines when he missed this Sunday’s Fox NFL Sunday broadcast.

China’s lone-wolf attacks pose challenge for Xi Jinping’s security state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-lone-wolf-attacks-pose-challenge-for-xi-jinpings-security-state/articleshow/115834532.cms,"Xi’s Covid Zero regime exposed the limits of citizens’ tolerance for state overreach.

Eradicating risks

School security

President Xi Jinping has built a sprawling security system to prevent violent forces from destabilizing society. A new wave of deadly attacks is putting pressure on officials to expand that surveillance state.China was stunned this month by its deadliest act of public violence since a string of terrorism strikes rocked the remote Xinjiang region in 2014. Dozens were hospitalized and 35 killed by the bloody car-ramming in Zhuhai city that was the culmination of a spate of violence this year — mostly stabbings — which have sparked nationwide anxiety.Xi responded to spouts of ethnic violence a decade ago by installing a network of facial recognition cameras, tightening Internet controls and expanding a national resident database. Now, the ruling Communist Party is calling on its army of local officials to weed out would-be attackers, drawing on the nation’s troves of big data for that mission.Scattered lone-wolf attacks will likely prove hard to contain, even for the all-seeing Communist Party. The assailants don’t hail from a single group or have a unified cause. While some have pointed to low pay and property woes as their motivation, there’s no quick fix for economic problems leaders have been battling for years.Showing the urgency of the problem, Xi ordered officials up and down the nation to prevent such violence shortly after the Zhuhai attack. “Resolve conflicts and disputes in a timely manner,” he instructed apparatchiks. “Strictly prevent extreme cases, and do your best to protect the lives of the people and social stability.”For decades, Chinese leaders have held their grip on power through an unspoken grand bargain: Citizens sacrifice some freedoms in exchange for security and prosperity. The recent fatal outbursts come as officials also struggle to deliver greater wealth, with the economy battling its longest deflationary streak since 1999 and a yearslong property crisis wiping billions of dollars off households’ books.While the Chinese government has spent years pointing to mass violence in America as proof of the inferior US system, stepping up domestic surveillance carries its own risks.Xi’s Covid Zero regime — which imposed long quarantines, regular mass testing and strict curbs on movement — exposed the limits of citizens’ tolerance for state overreach. That policy crumbled in late 2022 after nationwide protests that, at times, called for the downfall of the top leader.Chinese society is “fed-up and angry with a bunch of issues,” said Lynette Ong, professor of Chinese politics at the University of Toronto. “Unless the leadership comes to the realization that you need to go to the root cause of the problem — which is letting people release their pressure and anger and having more pressure valves — doing more repression actually will not work.”Chinese officials in recent weeks have rushed to reinforce Xi’s security message. Anti-corruption chief Li Xi told local governments to “take practical measures to consolidate the party’s ruling foundation” by resolving grassroots problems. Graft busters should make that their priority when inspecting villages, he added.Ramping up tech surveillance would require more resources at a time when public finances are tight. Government spending on security — with the bulk coming from indebted localities — only grew by 3.1% last year, the lowest during the Xi era excluding the pandemic, according to China’s latest statistics yearbook.Policymakers are instead focusing fiscal policy on stabilizing the housing crash, and a $1.4 trillion plan to rebalance struggling local governments’ books. Top leaders are now preparing for next month’s Central Economic Work Conference, where they’ll map out economic priorities for 2025 when US President-elect Donald Trump returns to office.One less costly tool officials are leaning on is the “Fengqiao experience:” A Mao Zedong-era surveillance campaign used last century to root out anti-party forces, that Xi has revived in recent years to prevent local disputes and disruptive groups from bubbling up to the national level.Already officials in Dingxi city, in China’s northwest, are conducting visits to the families of those who are deemed to have lost hope in life and displaying abnormal behavior along with paranoia, according to an official police WeChat account. Local leaders will try to educate and counsel the needy, it added.Prosecutors in a Guangdong city have now started prioritizing clearing a backlog of cases related to residents’ unhappiness with the judicial process to prevent frustration from spilling over, according to a person familiar with the issue who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.Authorities will utilize existing technology in their push. Officials should mine the “rich” well of legal data to find people who pose a risk, Yin Bai, secretary-general of the party commission in charge of law enforcement agencies, said in eastern Zhejiang recently. He also advocated for strengthening “data identification, screening, analysis and evaluation” to stop attacks.Schools have emerged as a focus, with several attacks this year targeting students. Police officers have been enlisted to oversee school opening and closing hours in the southern province of Guangdong, according to a person familiar with the arrangement, who requested anonymity.In Beijing, where a slashing incident near a primary school injured three children last month, another school has increased its number of guards and armed them with new anti-riot steel forks and batons, according to a person familiar with that set-up.A kindergarten in Shanghai that previously allowed parents to walk their children to the classroom stopped that arrangement this month, citing “multiple vicious incidents that happened consecutively” and a need to “implement instructions from the higher authorities about school safety,” according to a notice seen by Bloomberg.For a nation where violent outbursts are considered rare, such measures are a significant departure. But to many residents, the extra precautions suddenly seem necessary.“I hope that the overall security of the school could be ramped up more,” said Vikki Shu, a 40-year-old mother in Shanghai. “When the economy is not stable, there are a lot of crazy people.”","Xi responded to spouts of ethnic violence a decade ago by installing a network of facial recognition cameras, tightening Internet controls and expanding a national resident database.

Taylor Swift reportedly furious over Travis Kelce's bedroom admission to a fan

NFL star Travis Kelce has now fallen out of Taylor Swift 's good books after he let it all hang out on an episode of his New Heights podcast in October about their love life. Even though they are often supportive of each other's careers, they hardly ever talk about each other publicly. They do not shun questioning but prefer talking about their other-halves on their own terms. In October, the Kansas City Chiefs star discussed bedroom antics on their brother Jason's podcast, demonstrating their preference for private conversations. And according to Radar Online, Tay-tay isn't best pleased with her beau's attempt at comforting his fans.Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has become the subject of controversy after comments he made on the October episode of his New Heights podcast stirred a lot of controversy. At the center of the discussion, he spoke on intimacy-related issues, with a caller seeking advice from him on how to keep a hot interest for one's mate who seems uninterested.A fan asked about the Kelce brothers' handling of a partner's sudden disinterest in sex during a dry spell, expressing concern about bedroom antics in general. Travis comforted the caller by sharing his own passionate sex life, revealing that he had never experienced an encounter with a partner that wasn't equally passionate. ""I will personally mention that I have no idea what that’s [like],"" Travis laughed and said.""Try role play one night, you know, see if she's up for that,"" the American Football star said. ""Go to Spencer's novelty and sex-toy store and get some f**king sex stuff, man. Get some rose petals, try and be a little romantic. Maybe you just gotta rekindle that flame.” Radar Online reports that Taylor Swift is not satisfied with her beau's attempt to comfort his fans. ""Word is, she was appalled by his comments,"" an insider told the outlet. ""She was already tiring of his potty mouth, and now this.""There's no doubt it's caused major strain in the relationship. It's a terrible look for Taylor, whose brand is built on her being squeaky-clean and empowered. The feeling is that Taylor needs to take a look at this guy and ask herself, is he worth staining your reputation and losing your incredible fans over?”Also Read: Taylor Swift’s thoughtful gift to Travis Kelce’s coach Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce rarely discuss their relationship in interviews, a balance they appreciate in their high-profile lives, but recent comments may challenge this dynamic.","Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has become the subject of controversy after comments he made on the October episode of his New Heights podcast.

Who could replace Rohit Sharma as Team India's captain in Tests?

NEW DELHI: After a month of backand-forth discussions on the ICC Champions Trophy venue, hosts Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday climbed down to agreeing to a hybrid model in which India will play their matches in Dubai in Feb-March.However, TOI understands that the PCB has put across a few demands before the International Cricket Council (ICC) while paying heed to Indian cricket board’s (BCCI) decision to not play India’s matches in Pakistan due to security reasons.Sources said that the PCB has asked for a hybrid-for-hybrid solution to subsequent ICC tournaments to be played in India till 2031.Incidentally, India is supposed to host three men’s ICC tournaments and one women’s ICC World Cup in this period. India will co-host the T20 World Cup with Sri Lanka in 2026 and Bangladesh will be co-hosts for the ODI World Cup in 2031. The ICC Champions Trophy in 2029 will be solely hosted by India. The women’s World Cup is due to be held in 2025.“Cricket should win, that’s most important but with respect for all. We are going to do what’s best for cricket. Whichever formula we go for, it would be on equal terms,” PCB chairmanMohsin Naqvi responded to a query if they have agreed to the hybrid model and thought of boycotting travel to India in future.“My effort is to ensure that there is no one-sided system. It shouldn’t be that we travel to India and they don’t come to our country. The idea is to settle it once and for all on equal terms,” he added.TOI has learnt that PCB has also suggested a bigger share from ICC revenue as a compensation. Currently, BCCI gets 38 per cent of ICC revenue share while PCB gets less than six per cent.However, it is learnt that ICC had offered a compensation value over and above the hosting fees. It is unlikely that the ICC will agree on increasing PCB’s revenue share just on account of agreeing to hybrid model.Other countries’ boards will not agree to cutting their share and it would have to borne by BCCI alone. ICC sources told TOI that BCCI and ICC were firm on their stand to play the Champions Trophy in a hybrid model or PCB would be in danger of losing the hosting rights altogether. BCCI has not committed to any of the demands yet.It is expected that the schedule for the tournament will be worked out in the coming week. BCCI’s incumbent secretary Jay Shah is due to take charge of ICC as its independent chairman from Dec 1.BCCI wanted this matter to be resolved before Shah assumed office at the ICC. With India co-hosting the two men’s World Cups, Pakistan is most likely to play their matches in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The final of the tournaments are set to be played in India. A call on the women’s World Cup and the next Champions Trophy will be taken in due course.",Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) agrees to a hybrid model in which India will play their matches in Dubai in Feb-March.

The bale-out: Farm fire-free in near future? Why Haryana has turned a corner this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/the-bale-out-farm-fire-free-in-near-future-why-haryana-has-turned-a-corner-this-year/articleshow/115859217.cms,"A plan finally working

Easier for Hry than Punjab

The other gap...

... and how to fill it

GURGAON: This time of the year, scorched patches and burnt foliage in farms are a common sight in villages like Pehowa, Shahabad and Bassi in Kurukshetra, which is one of the main paddy-growing districts in the state.""The new machines have made a big difference this time. I didn't need to burn the stubble,"" said Vikas Singh, whose farms spread over 25 acres, pointing to heaps of straw that lay in stacks next to a baler, the machine Singh referred to.In a rush to clear fields before sowing the rabi crop, farmers set paddy straw on fire. Multiplied across districts of Haryana and Punjab, this has over the last decade become the most-discussed pollution problem in India because of the choking impact on Delhi and its neighbours.This year, many who have done this for years didn't because of much greater availability of balers to organise the straw, something they could settle for compared to the alternative of facing cases and penalties, besides the impact of farm smoke on their own health.Evidence of their effectiveness is in the farms of Kurukshetra, which recorded 132 farm fires this season. Three years ago, this number was 538. And in other agricultural districts like Kaithal (194 this year, 1,154 in 2021), Karnal (95/955), Jind (213/911), Fatehabad (130/1,477) and Sirsa (181/548).At 1,315, farm fires recorded in Haryana between Sept 15 and Nov 25 were 42% lower than last year's count (2,285) for the same timeframe, according to satellite data compiled by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI). In 2021, the state had recorded 6,995 farm fires, the worst year in recent times (all farm fire counts are satellite estimates and can be affected by meteorological factors like cloud cover. This year, the skies were largely clear).This year's numbers are not a fluke, nor an aberration. It is, according to farmers and govt officials tasked with preventing farm fires TOI spoke to, a result of pieces of the framework plan to improve stubble management finally falling into place.Balers, whose availability was increased manifold this time with the state govt procuring them and offering them to farmers at 50% subsidy - which encouraged those with contiguous farmland to pool and share one machine (around Rs 7.5 lakh after subsidy) - played a vital role in this.""After understanding farmers' issues, we introduced more machines to help them. It didn't happen overnight. We have given farmers superseeders, which they prefer for in-situ management (of straw). We gave straw balers too. These create bundles of straw that weigh 25-30kg each and can go up to 5 quintals (500kg),"" said Bharat Wahi, junior engineer with the agriculture department . According to govt officials, around 90,000 superseeders and balers have been deployed at farms statewide this time.The success of balers has given agriculture department officials confidence that they now have the framework in place to further reduce farm fires next year and work to a plan when the state becomes stubble burning-free, which no longer looks like an impossible target.This year, a decisive factor that aided stubbled management plans was the weather. With monsoon rain not continuing late, farmers got a bigger window to clear their farms. So, there was no mad rush to get rid of the straw, allowing time for balers to do their job. Besides, compared to Punjab, ground realities make implementing a stubble management plan relatively easier in Haryana. For one, the state has only about one-third the paddy cultivation area as Punjab, of which a substantial chunk is used to grow Basmati.Basmati stubble comprises around 30% of the total paddy straw generated in the state. Since it is not as coarse as other paddy varieties, it can be used as cattle fodder, reducing the state's stubble management load.The farm fire spark came from the burden of in situ management for other farmers, bringing variables like weather and economics into play. In-situ management, which involves mixing straw with soil and letting it decompose till the next crop is grown, takes time and it isn't a luxury every farmer has. After harvesting paddy, some farmers grow potatoes and peas for extra earnings till it is time to sow wheat, the winter crop. Hence, they want the farms clear as soon as possible.This year, by decisively improving in situ management of straw, Haryana has covered a good distance in containing farm fires. But this is still, one can argue, only 50% of the problem solved. The other 50%, which will determine the direction of the farm fire graph in the coming years, will come when the state takes the onus of transporting straw packed by balers to power plants.""Transporting the bales to factories is still a challenge. If the govt can help with this, it will be a complete solution,"" said Singh. Ravinder Singh, a farmer at Umri village, said hiring a truck to transport straw to factories costs Rs 1,000 at least, and getting people to load bales on to the truck took another Rs 800. ""So, we lose money on this. The nearest factories are around 25-30km away. Govt should set up agencies that can take the bales from us to the factories. There is a need for more such units that can use straw,"" Ravinder said.Govt estimates that of 81 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of paddy straw generated in Haryana this season, around 33 LMT could be managed in situ. Around 23 LMT will be used as cattle fodder. The rest, around 25 LMT, requires ex situ management so that it can be directed to industries for use.What has reached industries so far is still very low, underlining the next priority for farm managers. ""So far, 8 LMT of the 25.4 LMT earmarked for ex situ management has been purchased or procured by industries,"" said S Narayana, director general of Haryana's renewable energy department.Owners of small factories that turn paddy straw into pellets, which are then used by power plants to create fuel, said demand is high but getting bales of straw in time is key to their operation. ""In 2019, I was able to generate 100 tonnes of pellets per day. Now, it is 200 tonnes. There is a rise in demand, but I need the bales on time. I have tied up with six agencies that get me raw material, but there is definitely a need for more factories and more industries to solve the stubble burning problem completely,"" said Ravinder Singh Sandhu, whose firm in Shahabad supplies paddy pellets to National Thermal Power Corporation.Another firm, Hind Samachar LTD located in Pehowa, said it consumes 2,200 tonnes of straw to produce biofuel. ""We have tied up with locals who are helping farmers get bales to the factory. We might increase consumption if the process of transportation gets more streamlined,"" said Varun Mishra, who is part of the company's stubble management team.Asked about the gap in stubble available for use and demand by industries, officials said they are working on a ""fix"". ""It is in the pipeline, and we are planning to raise tenders to firms that will be used for transportation. We are providing machinery to farmers at the earliest. We have also prepared a staggered harvesting schedule for paddy,"" said Darshan Singh, technical assistant, agriculture department.Rajnarayan Kaushik, director of the agriculture department, said the state will effectively manage all crop residue. ""We have offered incentives to industries and farmers for ex situ management of stubble. This process involves putting to use crop residues in other industries, such as using it as biomass, and redirecting it to packaging and cardboard units. Doing this becomes an economic incentive to avoid burning stubble as industries purchase it from farmers,"" he said.","In a rush to clear fields before sowing the rabi crop, farmers set paddy straw on fire.

Rapid urban expansion triggering ventilation crisis in Hyderabad: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/rapid-urban-expansion-triggering-ventilation-crisis-in-hyderabad-study/articleshow/115858473.cms,"Slums and other areas in Santoshnagar, Karwan, Rajendranagar, Chandrayanagutta, Moosapet and Qutbullapur are some of the areas with more ventilation issues

‘

Ventilation-sensitive urban planning

need of the hour’

HYDERABAD: A study utilising geographic information systems (GIS) has highlighted alarming disparities in ventilation across Hyderabad due to rapid urban expansion and industrialisation, underscoring an urgent need for ventilation sensitive urban planning.Between 1990 and 2020, Hyderabad’s built-up area surged from 13.7% to 51.8%, while severely ventilated zones surged from 0.7% to 31.6%, the study revealed. Poor ventilation zones were found to coincide with densely populated areas and marginalised communities. The research incorporates the ventilation index, a measure assessing the potential of the atmosphere to disperse pollutants and maintain air flow, which depends on wind speed and the mixing height.Industrial growth, road density and lack of sanitation facilities strongly correlate with ventilation disparities, especially in northwest and eastern wards where wind potential is the lowest, the study said.Slums and other areas in Santoshnagar, Karwan, Rajendranagar, Chandrayanagutta, Moosapet and Qutbullapur are some of the areas with more ventilation issues, followed by Mehidipatnam, Musheerabad and Amberpet. Begumpet, Charminar, and Uppal also face similar challenges.Published in the journal Physics and Chemistry of the Earth under the title “Utilising GIS for Studying Urban Entropy, Population Dynamics, and Ventilation Disparity: A Case Study of Changing Land Use, Land Cover, and Socially Vulnerable Hotspots in Hyderabad, India”, the study examines the connections between ventilation disparities, socio-economic inequalities, and industrial growth.Socially vulnerable hotspots, including slums near industrial zones, were identified. These areas were marked by high concentrations of marginalised populations, such as Scheduled Caste communities, alongside substandard housing and lack of essential services such as toilets.The results of the study stressed that socio-economic and housing disparities directly aggravate ventilation challenges.The research, authored by Sandeep Budde from the University of Alberta , and Sandeep Agrawal and PS Chani from IIT Roorkee, called for ventilation-sensitive urban planning to address these inequities, suggesting the use of local climatic zoning and informed urban design to guide building densities and typologies.They said the study provides a replicable methodology for other industrialised cities such as Mumbai and Delhi to tackle similar challenges.","Between 1990 and 2020, Hyderabad’s built-up area surged from 13.7% to 51.8%.
