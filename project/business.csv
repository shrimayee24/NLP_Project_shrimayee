"Coming soon, curbs on carrying power banks on aircraft",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coming-soon-curbs-on-carrying-power-banks-on-aircraft/articleshow/124752579.cms,"Representative AI image

NEW DELHI: India may soon adopt stricter rules for power banks carriage onboard aircraft following recent instances worldwide, including one in the country, of lithium-ion batteries catching fire. Last Sunday a passenger's power bank had caught fire on a Delhi-Dimapur flight when the aircraft was taxiing at the origin. Now, the Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is “taking up this issue,” said a senior official.The regulator is learnt to be taking technical inputs on the issue and examining the options. While its decision could be known shortly, foreign airlines are increasingly putting restrictions on power banks. These include letting passengers carry only one power bank under 100 Watt Hours onboard but not use the same for charging any personal electronic devices (PED) or charging the power bank using the in-seat power supply system.Some foreign carriers even require the power bank to be kept in the seat pocket or in a bag under the seat in front and not in the overhead bins so that if they catch fire, the same is quickly detected and doused by cabin crew.It will soon be known if Indian carriers are also required to follow any or some of these practices.Dubai-based mega airline Emirates has from Oct 1, 2025, “prohibited” using any kind of power bank on its flights. While it allows a passenger to carry one power bank under 100 Watt Hours but they can neither use it to charge any PED, nor charge the power bank in an aircraft cabin using the aircrafts’ power source. The new regulations also mandates that “all power banks accepted for transport must have capacity rating information available. ”Emirates website says: “There has been a significant growth in customers using power banks in recent years, resulting in an increasing number of lithium battery-related incidents onboard flights across the wider aviation industry. Power banks primarily utilise lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries…. If the battery is overcharged or damaged, it may result in ‘thermal runaway’ (wherein) heat generation within a battery cell exceeds its ability to dissipate heat, leading to a rapid and uncontrollable temperature increase. This can result in dangerous consequences like fire, explosions, and the release of toxic gases.”Most phones and sophisticated lithium battery-powered devices have an internal trickle system which slowly adds current into the battery to prevent overcharging, but many basic power banks may not have this safeguard, increasing the risk.Singapore Airlines from April 1, 2025, does not allow flyers to charge portable power banks via the onboard USB ports, or use power banks to charge their personal devices, throughout the duration of the flight.The concern is real. Last week there was a case of lithium battery fire onboard an Air China flight from China to South Korea. Flight CA139, traveling from Hangzhou to Incheon was forced to divert to Shanghai for this reason. Then last Sunday, an IndiGo plane taxiing at Delhi to take off for Dimapur saw the same thing. Crew extinguished the fire and the aircraft returned to the terminal.In 2016, a particular model of mobile phone was barred from aircraft globally after there were several instances of it catching fire.","Last Sunday a passenger's power bank had caught fire on a Delhi-Dimapur flight.

Protecting Palk Strait’s fragile ecology crucial to India and Lanka: Justice Surya Kant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/protecting-palk-straits-fragile-ecology-crucial-to-india-and-lanka-justice-surya-kant/articleshow/124751702.cms,"Justice Surya Kant (ANI)

NEW DELHI: Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, on Wednesday said a vigorous collaborative effort must be made to protect the fragile yet crucial ecology of Palk Strait that geographically divide India and Sri Lanka and argued that judiciaries of the two countries have given rulings that has sensitized the executive towards this goal.Speaking on the “Indo-Sri Lanka Policy Dialogue: Environmental Sustainability and Regional Cooperation” at Colombo, Justice Kant said, “Judicial pronouncements influence Executive behaviour, compel environmental reporting, and often drive policy reform. The potential for structured judicial dialogue could formalise this exchange and strengthen the normative coherence of environmental law between the two jurisdictions. ”He said the time is ripe for the two judiciaries to champion a model of regional environmental constitutionalism - recognizing that certain imminent environmental rights and duties transcend borders.“Environmental cooperation between India and Sri Lanka is not a matter of charity or diplomacy - it is a matter of survival. The Bay of Bengal does not divide us; it binds us through a shared ecological fate,” he said.Referring to routine confrontation between Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen, Justice Kant said it epitomises a deeper ecological tragedy - competition for an exhausted resource base. “The impact of climate change and, consequently, rising sea levels threatens coastal zones in both Tamil Nadu and Northern Sri Lanka,” he said.Recounting the impact of the 2004 tsunami and recurring cyclones, he said both countries have experienced how environmental disasters transcend political borders. However, there is a lack of an integrated transboundary environmental governance mechanism, which may be a result of multiple factors, including inconsistent data collection, considering that environmental impact assessments rarely take cross-border effects into account, he said.India and Sri Lanka have, for centuries, been closely connected not merely by culture and trade, but by the ecology of the Indian Ocean itself, he said, adding that as environmental degradation accelerates, our shared geography imposes a collective responsibility.“The Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar are biodiversity hotspots, home to coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and endangered species. Yet these regions are under severe stress. Overfishing, destructive trawling practices, and unregulated coastal construction have caused ecosystem collapse in parts of this marine environment,” Justice Kant said.","Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, said a vigorous collaborative effort must be made to protect the fragile yet crucial ecology of Palk Strait.

India rises to ninth spot globally in forest area: FAO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-rises-to-ninth-spot-globally-in-forest-area-fao/articleshow/124750833.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: India has improved its global rank to ninth in terms of forest area as compared to 10th in the previous assessment, and maintained its third position in terms of annual net gain, showed the latest Global Forest Resource Assessment (GFRA) report.Released every five years by UN ’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the report’s 2025 edition noted that though overall deforestation has slowed in all regions globally in the last decade, forest ecosystems worldwide continue to face challenges as the current rate of deforestation at 10.9 million hectares per year is still too high.Fire affected an average of 261 million hectares of land annually, nearly half of which is forested, whereas insects, diseases and severe weather damaged about 41 million hectares of forests, mainly in temperate and boreal regions in 2020, the report released in Bali on Tuesday underlined.Globally, forests cover 4.14 billion hectares which accounts for nearly one-third (32 percent) of the global land area, equivalent to 0.5 hectares per person. Nearly half of the world’s forests are located in the tropics.“The achievement comes on the back of Modi government's planning and policies for protection and enhancement of the forest and massive plantation efforts by state governments,” said Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav while reacting to India’s improved global rank in 2025 compared to its previous position.Yadav on X attributed India’s achievement to the Prime Minister Modi’s call to plant trees under 'Ek Ped Ma ke Naam' (a tree in tribute to mother) campaign and “push for environmental consciousness” which, he said, are building awareness and increasing involvement of communities and individuals for afforestation. “This will ensure a greener tomorrow for generations to come,” the minister posted on Wednesday.GFRA, based on official national data, has put India’s forest cover at 72.7 million hectares in 2025, accounting for roughly 2 percent of the world forest area. According to India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2023, the country’s forest cover stands at 71.5 million hectares.Globally, Russia has the highest forest cover (832.6 million hectares) followed by Brazil (486 million hectares), Canada (368.8 million hectares), the USA (308.8 million hectares), China (227 million hectares), Congo (139 million hectares), Australia (133.5 million hectares), Indonesia (96 million hectares), India (72.7 million hectares) and Peru (67 million hectares). In fact, more than half (54%) of the total world forest area is concentrated in just five countries — Russia, Brazil, Canada, the United States and China.In terms of forest expansion, China recorded the highest annual net gain in forest area between 2015 and 2025 at 1.69 million hectares per year, followed by Russia (9,42,000 hectares), India (1,91,000 hectares), Türkiye (1,18,000 ha), Australia (1,05,000 ha), France (95,900 ha), Indonesia (94,100 ha), South Africa (87,600 ha), Canada (82,500 ha) and Vietnam (72,800 ha).The assessment report shows that Asia is the only region to record an increase in forest area between 1990 and 2025, led by gains in China and India.It shows that 91 countries reported agroforestry of 55.4 million ha in 2025. The majority (39.3 million ha) of this area is in Asia, mostly South and Southeast Asia, with India and Indonesia accounting for almost 100% of the regional total and for 70% of the global total.“FRAs are the most comprehensive and transparent global evaluations of forest resources and their condition, management and uses, covering all the thematic elements of sustainable forest management. The data they produce serve multiple purposes, from informing the global community of the status of forests and their changes, to supporting decisions, policies and investments related to forests and the ecosystem services they provide,” said FAO director-general, QU Dongyu, in the foreword to the report.","India has improved its global rank to ninth in terms of forest area as compared to 10th in the previous assessment.

Water ATMs and fishing for profit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/water-atms-and-fishing-for-profit/articleshow/124750796.cms,"Water sourced from coal mines is potentially valuable for much more than just domestic use. Beyond direct supply, several innovative projects are in development. In 2019, Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL) pioneered a plant producing ‘Coal Neer’ — a bottled drinking water brand — near Nagpur, providing purified water to villagers and creating an income source for women’s self-help groups (SHGs). Similarly, the Atal Community Innovation Centre (ACIC) at IIT-ISM in Dhanbad is working on deploying water ATMs that will treat mine water at multiple levels to provide clean drinking water to the public at a nominal cost.“We have piloted a model for pure drinking water (PARAM JAL) incubated at the ACIC IIT (ISM) Foundation. We’ve already set up a 24X7 coin/UPI water-vending ATM, where discharged mine water is being treated to provide drinking water to people at a nominal cost of Rs 10 for 10 litres. Along with Dhanbad Municipal Corporation (DMC), we are now working to set up these ATMs in five more places under the DMFT scheme,” said Akansha Sinha, CEO of ACIC.The use of mine voids is not limited to potable water. These are also emerging as a major source of livelihood. Studies by the College of Fisheries at Birsa Agricultural University in Ranchi have shown that abandoned opencast pits in Jharkhand can be transformed into fish farms.This is being achieved through targeted interventions — such as adding organic manure and fertilisers — to manage water quality and deployment of innovative aeration systems.Sashikar Mahto (38), secretary of Kuju Fisheries Cooperative Society in Ramgarh’s Kuju region, has emerged as a poster boy for mine-water fishing. Today, he leads a network of close to 70 local youths engaged in fisheries in CCL’s abandoned Ara mine numbers 8 and 13 in Kuju, with the local administration lending a helping hand.“While we began on our own a decade back, the local administration gave it a push through some funding two years ago. Today, a total of 22 (fisheries) cages have been set up that yield 50-60 tonnes of fish annually,” he said.Shambhu Prasad Yadav, deputy director of the state fisheries department, said, “Fish rearing is being done across 28 abandoned coal and stone pits across 12 districts of Jharkhand through 771 cages. Average production of fish from each cage is about three tonnes per annum.”","In 2019, Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL) pioneered a plant producing ‘Coal Neer’ — a bottled drinking water brand.

Poll Do you believe the construction of the Ram Temple has a significant impact on the celebration of Deepavali this year? Yes, it's very impactful No, it doesn’t change much

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday penned a letter to citizens on the occasion of Deepavali , highlighting the festival as a time of energy, enthusiasm, and reflection on the nation’s achievements. In his message, he noted that this is the second Deepavali after the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya and emphasised Lord Shri Ram’s teachings on righteousness and courage in fighting injustice.PM Modi referred to “Operation Sindoor” as a recent example of upholding justice, adding that the festival is particularly special this year as lamps will be lit in many districts, including remote areas, where Naxalism and Maoist terrorism have been eradicated. He praised citizens who have abandoned violence and embraced development, viewing it as a major achievement for the nation.""I extend my heartfelt greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Deepavali, a festival filled with energy and enthusiasm. This is the second Deepavali after the grand construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Lord Shri Ram teaches us to uphold righteousness and also gives us the courage to fight injustice. We have seen a living example of this a few months ago during Operation Sindoor . During Operation Sindoor, Bharat not only upheld righteousness but also avenged injustice,"" he said.""This Deepavali is particularly special because, for the first time, lamps will be lit in many districts across the country, including remote areas. These are the districts where Naxalism and Maoist terrorism have been eradicated from the root. In recent times, we have seen many individuals abandoning the path of violence and joining the mainstream of development, expressing faith in the Constitution of our country.This is a major achievement for the nation,"" he added.Highlighting recent economic reforms, the Prime Minister mentioned the implementation of lower GST rates during the “GST Bachat Utsav” (Savings Festival), which has helped citizens save thousands of crores of rupees. PM Modi also underlined India’s growing global stature, describing the country as a symbol of stability and sensitivity and projecting it to soon become the world’s third-largest economy.As he highlighted India's reforms, achievements and policies, he added, ""In a world going through multiple crises, Bharat has emerged as a symbol of both stability and sensitivity. We are also on track to become the third-largest economy in the world in the near future.""Calling for collective responsibility, PM Modi urged citizens to adopt Swadeshi products, promote “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat”, respect all languages, maintain cleanliness, prioritise health, reduce oil consumption, and embrace Yoga. He drew inspiration from Deepavali’s symbolism, saying, “when one lamp lights another, its light doesn’t diminish, but it grows further,” and encouraged spreading harmony, cooperation, and positivity. ""Let us adopt ""Swadeshi"" (local products) and proudly say: ""This is Swadeshi!"" Let us promote the spirit of ""Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat"". Let us respect all languages. Let us maintain cleanliness. Let us prioritize our health. Let us reduce the use of oil in our food by 10% and embrace Yoga. All these efforts will rapidly move us towards a ""Viksit Bharat"", he said.The Prime Minister also urged citizens to contribute to building a “Viksit” (developed) and “Aatmanirbhar” (self-reliant) India.This comes a day after PM Modi celebrated aboard INS Vikrant with Navy personnel during which he witnessed MiGs in action, singing programs and addressed armed forces.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi penned a letter to citizens on the occasion of Deepavali.

India to Belgian court: Arthur Rd jail has long walking area, fresh air with cross ventilation



NEW DELHI: Behind the cold steel bars, a surprisingly plush interior awaits one of India’s most wanted fugitives. Photographs presented by India to Belgium to secure Mehul Choksi ’s extradition reveal a dwelling place that's more akin to a boutique hotel room than a jail cell. The gleaming bathroom and tiled area are a far cry from the stark, unforgiving ambience one typically associates with prison life.Fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi will be lodged at the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai upon extradition and the cell he will be lodged in has been spruced up to adhere to European standards of prisoner management. The photographs provided by India also offer a glimpse of the prison barrack (number 12), which houses Choksi’s cell. There are two cells with special facilities and Choksi will be kept in one of them post-extradition.“The barrack is protected by a steel structure after clearing the ground level of 20 feet on three sides so as to allow free passage of light and air inside the jail. The wide corridor leads to the cell.Police personnel are deployed round the clock for security and any emergency, the document submitted by the Indian govt states.Regarding the cell where Mehul Choksi will be lodged, the document says: “The cell has sufficient sources of natural light. The cell has one main door, three windows and five upper ventilators which ensure fresh air with cross ventilation.Once the lights are switched on, six hanging tube lights provide sufficient light in the cell. The three ceiling fans are there to maintain enough air circulation. A TV is also provided for news and entertainment.”The Indian prosecutors have also submitted (with images) to the Belgian court handling Choksi’s case that an attached passage from the cell leads to the toilet, which is equipped with all essential amenities. “There is a long walking area for the inmates outside the Barrack where they can take a stroll in the mornings or evenings,” the document adds.The development comes on the heels of the Union home minister urging all states to have at least one prison cell of international standards to deal with fugitives. The Belgian court recently upheld Choksi’s arrest — which happened at the Indian govt’s request — and ordered his extradition. It observed that the documents produced by Choksi to cite poor jail conditions were of Tihar prison and do not apply to his case.The court also observed that there was no “documentary evidence” to prove Choksi was kidnapped in Antigua in May 2021 on the instructions of Indian authorities and dismissed the charge that his extradition was being sought for a political or military offence.Choksi (65), wanted in bank fraud cases to the tune of Rs 13,000 crore, is learnt to be in process of filing an appeal against the extradition order.",Fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi will be lodged at the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai upon extradition.

"Sugary ‘ORS’ a danger, good riddance, say doctors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sugary-ors-a-danger-good-riddance-say-doctors/articleshow/124748416.cms,"Strategies to Reduce Sugar Intake for Better Health

Doctor: No energy or sports drink can replace true ORS



After eight years of a relentless campaign against the term ‘ORS’ (oral rehydration solution) being used for many packaged beverages, often high in sugar, Hyderabad-based paediatrician Dr Sivaranjani Santosh has finally seen a breakthrough. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India issued an advisory last week banning food and beverage companies from using the term in product names, labels or trademarks, even as a prefix or suffix.Many doctors TOI spoke to said cases of parents mistaking flavoured “hydration” or “electrolyte” drinks for ORS are becoming increasingly common.“These drinks contain 10 times more sugar than the amount recommended by World Health Organization and are sold in pharmacies as ORS,” Santosh told TOI. “Instead of rehydrating, it worsens diarrhoea, especially in children, who are far more vulnerable... This is extremely dangerous...” While WHO recommends 13.5gm of sugar per litre in ORS, fake products contain 110g-120g.In India, diarrhoea accounts for around 13% of all deaths in children under five years, making it a leading cause of childhood mortality in the country. Santosh took up the fight after coming across many cases where children ended up in hospital with severe dehydration after having these drinks.“We received a four-year-old child in the emergency — listless, weak, and severely dehydrated.The parents said they had been giving her ‘ORS water’ for two days,” recalled Dr Dhiren Gupta, co-director, paediatric intensive care unit, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi. “But when we checked, it turned out they had been using a sweetened energy drink sold online as an ‘ORS substitute’. The child’s condition worsened instead of improving.”Gupta added that blood tests in such cases often show dangerously low sodium and high sugar levels. “Any solution meant to correct dehydration must have the right balance of salt and sugar,” he said. “We had another one-year-old patient who suffered brain bleeding and seizures after being given a concentrated salt solution. The sodium levels were extremely high. Both extremes — too little or too much salt — can be life-threatening. ”Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, internal medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said, “We frequently admit children with moderate to severe dehydration because caregivers used sweetened or flavoured drinks thinking they were ORS. Correct WHO-ORS, if given early, could have prevented it.” “Glucose helps the body absorb sodium, which retains water. During diarrhoea, both are lost, leading to kidney failure or brain swelling. A properly mixed ORS restores this safely, but a diluted or sugary version can worsen dehydration,” explained Dr Dinesh Yadav, paediatric cardiologist at Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.Doctors stressed that awareness, not fear, is key. “ORS saves lives — but only when made and used correctly,” Yadav said. “Parents must use WHO-approved sachets, mix them exactly as directed, and avoid all flavoured or commercial ‘hydration’ drinks. No energy or sports drink can replace true ORS.” “When parents walk into a pharmacy looking for ORS, they trust the product to save their child’s life. Around eight years ago, many children’s conditions worsened due to this ORS, though fortunately, no deaths were directly linked then. It was infuriating to see profits being prioritised above children’s health. Giving sugar-laden formulas like these could actually kill,” Santosh said.She claimed that the companies initially tried to silence her by offering her speaking roles at their events. “Later, they did not contact me directly, but I did face a significant backlash and threats on social media from anonymous accounts, which made the fight harder.” Though the journey was long and exhausting, Santosh is relieved after the FSSAI order. She spent years raising awareness online, sending complaints to drug and health authorities like CDSCO, FSSAI, and the central health ministry. “I gathered videos, patient testimonies, and evidence from doctors. I went through everything — dejection, anger, hope, exhaustion. Though it should not have taken this long, after seeing the order I was overwhelmed. I told people long back that this would become big but nobody listened.”Meanwhile, after the FSSAI ban, manufacturers moved the Delhi high court, arguing that the order came without prior notice or consultation and affects their existing stock worth about Rs 180 crore. The court granted temporary relief, allowing companies to sell their current stock, but stopped the production of new sugary drinks labelled as ORS.","The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India issued an advisory last week banning food and beverage companies from using the term in product names, labels or trademarks.

Army To Raise First 5 Bhairav Commando Units By Oct 31 For Swift Strikes On China, Pak Fronts

NEW DELHI: From inducting modern sniper rifles, machine guns, carbines, rocket-launchers, loitering munitions, tank-killing missiles and software-defined radios to raising new `Bhairav’ light commando units and `Ashni’ drone platoons, the Army is now progressively transforming its 382 infantry battalions to meet the myriad challenges of tech-driven warfare.“Multiple initiatives, institutional measures and technology transformations are being undertaken. The focus is on lethality, mobility, battlefield transparency, situational awareness, survivability, training and restructuring,” director general of infantry Lt-General Ajay Kumar said on Wednesday.The aim is to equip, upskill and enhance the capability of the humble foot-soldiers, who are often forgotten in the race to acquire big-ticket fighter jets, submarines and howitzers, to “fight as weapon systems”.The infantry is by far the largest arm of the 11.5 lakh Army. Moreover, boots on the ground will always be relevant because victory in conflicts, be it Russia-Ukraine or Israel-Hamas, will continue to be measured in the amount of land or real estate captured, Lt-Gen Kumar said.Towards this end, the Army has inked a wide array of deals for ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) drones, kamikaze drones, loitering munitions for precision strikes, night sights, bullet-proof jackets, ballistic helmets, foliage-penetration radars, light specialist and all-terrain vehicles, among others.The latest is the Rs 2,770 crore contract for 4.2 lakh close-quarter battle carbines, 60% to be manufactured by Bharat Forge and the rest by PLR Systems (Adani Defence-Israel Weapon Industries joint venture). “Deliveries will start in a year and be completed in two years,” Lt-Gen Kumar said.Similarly, with there being a huge deficiency in new-generation man-portable ATGMs, emergency procurements of a limited number of launchers and missiles are being undertaken till a viable indigenous option is available. One such deal is for 12 Javelin launchers and 104 missiles from the US.“The recent graduation to the philosophy of `shoot-to-kill’ (from the earlier shoot-to-wound) has also enabled upgrade of assault rifles and light machine guns from 5.56mm to 7.62mm calibre. Vintage sniper rifles are also being replaced with .338 sniper rifles,” Lt-Gen Kumar said.With drone warfare redefining the nature of conflicts, the infantry is also trial-evaluating nine different types of drones for ISR and `suicide’ missions, in addition to the deals already inked.This is also in tune with ongoing force restructuring under which all 382 infantry battalions (each has 800 soldiers) have now raised “first person view” Ashni drone platoons as part of the “eagle on the arm” concept. “Each platoon of 20-25 specially trained soldiers will have surveillance as well as short and medium-range loitering munitions,” Lt-Gen Kumar said.Parallelly, the infantry has also raised the first five `Bhairav’ light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers, to enhance swift strike capabilities along the borders with Pakistan and China, as was first reported by TOI.“The raising of another four has started. In the next six months, we will have 25 such lean and mean battalions capable of carrying out deep strikes against high-value enemy targets. The aim is to bridge the gap between infantry units and Para-Special Forces,” Lt-Gen Kumar said.The first five units, equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones, have been placed under the 3 Corps (Dimapur), 12 Corps (Jodhpur) 14 Corps (Leh), 15 Corps (Srinagar) and 16 Corps (Nagrota).These Bhairav units are in addition to the Army’s 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions, each of which have 620 soldiers selected after arduous training and are equipped with a wide array of specialized weapons and equipment.","The aim is to equip, upskill and enhance the capability of the humble foot- soldiers.

The latest livestock census paints a grim picture — the state now has just 3,052 donkeys, a sharp fall from 49,289 in 1997, marking a 94% decline in less than three decades.Nine of the 55 districts have reported zero donkeys, signalling near-total disappearance of the animal that once powered rural India’s transport and trade.While there are no specific studies behind disappearance of donkeys yet, Gurgaon-based animal rights activist Naresh Kadyan had urged the Centre to declare donkeys an endangered species, warning that China’s demand for donkey hide is pushing the decline. He blames China’s “ejiao” industry — where hides are boiled to extract gelatin used in traditional tonics, aphrodisiacs, and anti-ageing creams — for pushing the species toward extinction.Official figures show Narmadapuram has the highest number of donkeys (332), followed by Chhatarpur (232), Rewa (226), and Morena (228), while Vidisha, once home to over 6,400 donkeys, now has just 171, and Bhopal only 56. Districts such as Dindori, Niwari, Seoni, Harda, and Umaria recorded no donkeys at all, confirming local extinction.The census reveals broader trends across livestock categories.

"Staggered pan-India SIR likely in a week, 3 months for each phase",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/staggered-pan-india-sir-likely-in-a-week-3-months-for-each-phase/articleshow/124748248.cms,"Timeline for pan-India SIR to be finalised in 2-3 days, say EC sources



NEW DELHI: A staggered pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls will get underway within four-five days, with each phase likely to be spread over three months, on the lines of the one completed in Bihar . The last intensive revision of the roll was undertaken over two decades ago.Sources indicated that the nationwide SIR may be held in phases, with certain states/UTs such as J&K and Ladakh, which will soon be snow-bound, and ones where nearly 75%-80% of the electorate has been mapped by matching current electors with entries in the 2003/2004 rolls published after the last intensive revision, being left out of the initial phase.“They can be taken up later as barely 20%-25% of electors in these states will need to submit documents to prove their eligibility as per Article 326 of the Constitution. The immediate priority will be the five states due for assembly polls next year,” said an EC official.Going by the three-month SIR schedule followed in Bihar, the final roll — to be published after claims and objections to the draft roll are settled — for states/UTs likely to be covered in the initial phase may be out by Jan-end or beginning of Feb.The preparation for the upcoming countrywide SIR — the intent for which was announced by EC in its June 24 notification for the SIR in Bihar — was the key topic of discussion at the two-day conference of chief electoral officers being held by EC on Wednesday and Thursday.The conference’s opening day, presided over by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, saw EC assess the preparedness of all state/UT CEO offices for the nationwide SIR. The meeting is a follow-up of the Sept 10 CEO’s conference, when all CEOs had briefed EC on the last SIR undertaken and the roll published thereafter.Sources said CEOs are upbeat about the upcoming nationwide SIR, with some states already having mapped up to 75% of their electorate based on the roll from the last intensive revision.In Bihar, nearly 80% of the electorate had matched with the 2003 roll. Three months, thus, were more than enough for the exercise, where only the remaining 20% — possibly comprising parents who never cared to enrol as electors or non-citizens — were required to submit documents.The fact that limited claims and objections were made despite a 30-day window and no appeals were filed with district magistrate (the sole appeal made was found incorrect) in the 15-day timeframe after publication of the final roll, stands testimony to the precision with which SIR was carried out,” said an EC official.EC sources, who indicated that the pan-India SIR timeline will be finalised in a day or two followed by its announcement in four to five days, said the list of documents to be accepted as proof of identity, age and citizenship would more or less remain the same as Bihar, though documents unique to a given state/UT may be considered.“In any case, the list of 11 documents is not exhaustive but only indicative,” said an official.Aadhaar card will only be accepted as a proof of identity. An alternative document, as per the list specified by the poll panel, will be needed to prove one’s citizenship and residence, the official added.","A staggered pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls will get underway within four-five days.

Prabakaran contended that the music company had even failed to provide the day-to-day revenue generated by exploiting his works, as directed by the court.Opposing the submissions, senior advocate Vijay Narayan submitted the company had moved a transfer application before the Supreme Court, which had issued notice on the application.Recording the submission, Justice N Senthilkumar observed that since the apex court had admitted the transfer application and ordered notice on the same, it was inappropriate for him to hear the case. To this, Prabakaran submitted that the SC has not issued any interim orders staying the proceedings before the HC.Therefore, there was no impediment for HC to hear the case.On HC’s interim order directing Sony to file a report on the day-to-day revenue earned by exploiting the compositions of the petitioner, Narayan submitted that the report was ready, and they were inclined to file it in a sealed cover to maintain the confidentiality of the revenue details.Opposing this, Prabakaran contended that even SC had not appreciated filing reports in sealed covers in many instances. Considering the objection, the judge decided not to take on record the report filed by Sony and chose to wait for the outcome of the application moved before SC.Insisting that the revenue report must be made available to the petitioner, Prabakaran submitted that the movie ‘Dude’, released on Oct 17, had earned Rs 75 crore so far.Pointing out that the petitioner must file a separate application for his grievances against the movie, the high court adjourned the hearing to Nov 27.","Music composer Ilaiyaraaja is fighting a copyright battle against a batch of music labels. ‘Dude’, starring director-turned-actor Pradeep Ranganathan, used two of his songs in the film without his authorisation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124750134,imgsize-497425,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
Water to earnings: How coal is turning on taps across India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/water-to-earnings-how-coal-is-turning-on-taps-across-india/articleshow/124750746.cms,"Hundreds of abandoned mines have become reservoirs holding water that experts say is safe to use. Communities are now betting on them, not only for domestic supply, but also to drive livelihoods

Coal’s new ‘faucet’

TOI

Safe and sure

Water, water everywhere

Communities and officials grappling with the problem of tapped water supply in coal-belt states are courting an unlikely ally to bring about a change of fortune: abandoned coal mine pits. Hundreds of such pits have turned into reservoirs filled with water, emerging as a simple solution in areas that have only known perennial shortage. Though the idea is not new, the Centre is finally doubling down on it, identifying more than a hundred such pits to ease water woes across six states.The concerted push is the outcome of a recent study — the first of its kind — by the Ranchi-based Central Mine Planning & Design Institute (CMPDI). It said that 437 mine voids across both active and abandoned coal mines have an annual capacity of an estimated 2,760 lakh kilolitres of water — that’s enough to fill about 11,000 Olympic-sized pools. CMPDI followed up the findings by identifying 22 sites across six states for pilot projects. Eight of those sites are in Jharkhand, which is sort of the bellwether for this initiative.It was in Dec 2021 that the sound of running water greeted residents of Pondi panchayat in Jharkhand’s Ramgarh district.But it wasn’t a newly dug well, the common source of water for households and villages across large parts of the country. Sparing Pondi any spadework, quite literally, but endowing it with a ready lifeline was the abandoned ‘Ara mine’ number 8, a relic of Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) lying dormant for years.The Pondi experiment was part of a handful of pilots for using water collected in mines — which is essentially rainwater and also underground seepage — that had been undertaken in coal-bearing areas in the last few years. It is their success that has now prompted the Union coal ministry to scale up efforts. Speaking toduring his visit to Ranchi recently, Union coal minister G Kishan Reddy said utilisation of mine water was one of the priorities of their govt and that they are putting in place a detailed action plan to make it happen.“Unfortunately, mine closures earlier used to rarely take place per prescribed norms. But now we have decided to focus on sustainable closure of mines to reduce environmental woes and create livelihood linkages. We are now targeting as many as 143 mines, where mining activities are over,” he said.“The plan is to use the water accumulated in these mines for various purposes, including employment generation. So far, some nine closures have taken place, but an action plan is being prepared on priority for closures of the remaining ones in next three to four years,” he added.If abandoned coal mines are being pursued to address water scarcity it’s because they’ve been found to be a safe, and scalable, bet. Experts say the water in these mines poses no hazards, while filtration and treatment plants have been put in place to improve its quality. “Unlike Western scenarios, where mine water is acidic, water from most Indian coal mines is suitable for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use with only moderate treatment,” said the CMPDI report. The treated water is even considered viable for bottled-water production. The experience on the ground has certainly been encouraging.The quiet initiation of the project during the pandemic in Pondi has now grown to become a lifeline for 1,600 households across eight villages. People who had to walk miles in search of water can now just turn on their tap. Rural homemakers like Savita Devi (40) of Bongahara village hail the easy access to water at their doorstep. “Now, water from the mine directly reaches my house. I also use it for cooking. This leaves me with time for other work,” she said. Popal Devi (52), the Pondi panchayat mukhiya, said the project would perhaps reverse the trend of migration from the area due to severe water scarcity.Making the water potable involves a multi-step treatment process. A 1.4 million litres per day (MLD) capacity water treatment plant was set up in the village into which the water from the closed mine is lifted daily. It undergoes filtration using limestone, sandpit, and chlorine before being stored in a well and moved to two overhead tanks for daily supply. To ensure the system’s sustainability, the panchayat has appointed two women, known as ‘jal sahiyas’, to inspect the pipelines and collect a monthly water payment of Rs 62 per household.Tarun Paliwal, CMPDI’s public relations officer, said the study benchmarked mine water quality against Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) classifications and BIS:10500 standards. “In a review meeting held on Aug 8 this year, the coal secretary lauded CMPDI and directed coal companies to develop action plans for treating and reusing mine water to enhance local community well-being and water security,” he said.Pondi is not an isolated story. About 100km away in Piparwar, CCL rolled out a similar pilot. “In Bachra and adjoining villages alone, water from the closed mine pit is being supplied to around 3,000 households, besides the CCL’s Piparwar officers’ colony,” said an official of the environment wing of the Piparwar project area.“Across the Piparwar area, we have set up around eight mini water filtration plants from where people can access water. For example, the filtration plant at CCL hospital in Piparwar generates 2,000 MGD water/hour for in-house use,” the official added.Abhay Singh, chief scientist at the Dhanbad-based Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR), said that except for NorthEastern India, their studies, too, have revealed that water from mine pits can easily be put to good use.“In Assam and Meghalaya, water in the mines has heavy metals and has 7-8% acidity vis-a-vis 1-2% in the rest of the country. Scaling up mine water usage in the country can provide answers to challenges of water scarcity,” he said, adding that although a few independent projects are underway across coal-bearing regions in India, there is a need for a consolidated push for a mine-water utilisation mission.According to a statement from Coal India Ltd (CIL), mine water usage for community benefit is not a new concept. In the fiscal year 202425, CIL’s mine discharge was approximately 5,717 lakh kilolitres, with over 45% (around 2,572 LKL) shared for community use. Minister Reddy has told Rajya Sabha that CIL, NLC India Ltd, and Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) are all actively utilising treated mine water. CIL alone is supplying water to 878 villages, benefiting about 11.7 lakh people. NLCIL in Tamil Nadu supplies treated mine water for both power generation and drinking, benefiting 9.6 lakh locals.","Hundreds of abandoned mines have become reservoirs holding water that experts say is safe to use. Communities are now betting on them, not only for domestic supply, but also to drive livelihoods.

NEW DELHI: Even if one FIR is closed, the existence of other FIRs with the same or similar allegations will be valid ground for continuation of ED's investigation under PMLA, Allahabad high court has ruled while dismissing a petition of Sahara group companies, which sought to restrict the ED from probing allegations of money laundering on the grounds that the predicate offence in this case was missing given that the original FIR was closed in 2020. In the Sahara case, the HC took cognisance of ED's submission that 502 FIRs were filed against Sahara group entities in various states.In the Sahara case, the HC took cognisance of ED’s submission that 502 FIRs were filed against Sahara group entities in various states across the country, out of which 315 FIRs were registered for commission of scheduled offences under PMLA. Chargesheets have been filed for 276 FIRs. “Regarding the first submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners that no proceedings can continue under the PMLA after filing of a closure report in FIR No. 142 of 2020, I am in agreement with the view taken by the Delhi high court in Rajinder Singh Chadha v. Union of India,” Justice Subhash Vidyarthi of Allahabad high court said.The judgment of Delhi HC in question stated that “there is no impediment in taking the third FIR on record which related to the same project forming the basis for registration of the first two FIRs, resulting in initiation of the impugned ECIR…” The ECIR is ED’s enforcement case information report, equivalent to a police FIR, for initiating an investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The court, in its Oct 17 judgment, also held that a probe by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) does not in any way restrict the ED from carrying out its own investigations under PMLA, dismissing Sahara’s plea that once an investigation has been entrusted to SFIO under the Companies Act, investigation by any other agency becomes barred.“This submission also cannot be accepted because even after extension of the scope of investigation by SFIO, it does not include investigation against any of the petitioners, namely, Humara India Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Sahara Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Stars Multipurpose Cooperative Society Ltd and Saharayan Universal Multipurpose Society Ltd. Therefore, there is no illegality in continuation of proceedings under PMLA against the petitioners,” the judge said.The court also rejected the contention of Sahara entities that ED cannot investigate the matter since the case falls under the ambit of the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act (BUDS), which overrides IPC – and as BUDS offences are not scheduled offences under PMLA.“Merely because an act makes out commission of an offence under the BUDS Act, it cannot be said that although the act is punishable as an offence under IPC also, the offender cannot be prosecuted for commission of the offence punishable under IPC. Therefore, I find no force in the second submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner,” Justice Subhash Vidyarthi observed.","Even if one FIR is closed, the existence of other FIRs with the same or similar allegations will be valid ground for continuation of ED's investigation under PMLA, Allahabad high court has ruled.

Also, they were asked to pinpoint their specific requirements for protecting Ladakh’s land, culture and language, including under Article 371.“Today’s deliberations were positive in that the Ladakhi outfits agreed to return to the table after five months. All issues were discussed cordially, signalling a restoration of trust following the events of Sept 24.

However, NSA already requires Wangchuk’s detention to be reviewed by an advisory board. As regards other detainees, the probe is on. The outfits demanded a Ladakhi officer for the panel probing the Sept 24 unrest, but were assured that the probe would be impartial under a retired SC judge.Ladakh MP Jan said talks were held Wednesday in a positive atmosphere, with both sides showing willingness to stay engaged. “There was mutual understanding on the need to safeguard Ladakh’s identity and ensure justice and fair representation for its people,” he said.Kargil Democratic Alliance member Sajjad Hussain Kargili said: “Our demand for the past six years has been democracy in Ladakh.

What’s next for her





Canadian entertainer and digital creator Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University, a milestone that highlights her transformation from online sensation to mainstream cultural influencer. The award, bestowed during the university’s Fall Convocation on 14 October 2025, reflects Singh’s impact on pop culture, media representation, and diversity advocacy, signalling the growing significance of digital platforms in shaping global cultural narratives.Singh’s career illustrates a broader trend in global media where social media platforms have become launching pads for internationally recognised cultural figures. Beginning as a teenager posting humorous sketches on YouTube under the moniker ‘Superwoman’, she cultivated a large following through content combining comedy, personal reflection, and commentary on cultural identity. This digital prominence opened doors to mainstream television, literature, and public advocacy.Her recognition also highlights evolving metrics of influence. Universities and institutions increasingly acknowledge contributions beyond traditional academic or professional achievements, valuing social reach, advocacy, and public engagement.Singh’s honorary Doctor of Laws degree is emblematic of this shift, recognising the societal and cultural impact of digital creators in ways that transcend conventional accolades.Globally, Singh’s work resonates beyond entertainment. She has amplified conversations about gender equity, representation of minorities in media, and mental health awareness, reaching audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. Her trajectory offers a lens into how online personalities can shape social norms and public discourse, bridging cultural gaps and challenging stereotypes.On 14 October 2025, York University conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Singh during its Fall Convocation ceremony. The award cited her “contributions to community building and accomplishments in pop culture and entertainment.” Singh, who graduated from York in 2010 with a degree in psychology, described the honour as “immense”, noting the irony of fulfilling her parents’ long-held expectations of having a ‘doctor’ in the family, albeit in an unconventional manner.Singh’s speech to the graduating class underlined her philosophy on failure and growth. She encouraged students to embrace uncertainty and to view setbacks as teaching moments, asserting that “having it all figured out is a false narrative.” Her address also highlighted her experiences as the child of Indian immigrants navigating cultural expectations while forging a career in entertainment, a journey marked by creativity, resilience, and humour.The milestone comes amid Singh’s continued presence in mainstream media. Beyond her YouTube success, she hostedin 2019, becoming the first woman of Indian descent to lead a late-night talk show on a major American network. She has also authored bestselling books blending personal anecdotes with practical advice, further consolidating her influence across multiple platforms.Singh’s recognition signals the increasing legitimacy of digital creators in shaping cultural narratives. In a media ecosystem historically dominated by traditional broadcast networks and print outlets, social media personalities now influence public opinion, social norms, and even policy discussions on inclusivity and diversity.Her work also underscores the importance of representation. By foregrounding South Asian identity, gender equity, and minority experiences, Singh provides a template for how entertainers can leverage visibility to challenge stereotypes and promote social inclusivity. This has implications not only for entertainment but for broader societal attitudes, encouraging younger audiences to pursue unconventional paths while advocating for equity.Economically, figures like Singh exemplify the monetisation potential of digital platforms. Her trajectory highlights how online content can generate significant revenue streams, sponsorships, and brand partnerships, reshaping employment and entrepreneurship in creative industries. The honorary doctorate amplifies her credibility, reinforcing the notion that influence and impact extend beyond formal qualifications.In a wider sense, platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and other streaming networks are indirectly implicated, as Singh’s career reinforces the significance of digital-first pathways in the entertainment ecosystem. Social media companies stand to gain from the visibility and credibility conferred upon creators, while advertisers and sponsors can capitalise on the extended reach of influential figures like Singh.Singh’s trajectory is rooted in the rise of social media as a dominant form of entertainment. Launching her YouTube channel as a teenager, she capitalised on the platform’s global reach, producing content that resonated across demographics. Her channel, Superwoman, addressed universal themes of identity, family dynamics, and humour, building a subscriber base of millions within years.The transition from digital creator to mainstream television host represents a significant milestone in entertainment history, reflecting broader shifts in audience behaviour. Singh’s entry into late-night television in 2019 mirrored an era where streaming platforms and online communities began to rival traditional media in shaping celebrity culture and public discourse.Her literary contributions further illustrate this shift. By authoring bestselling books, Singh transformed personal experiences into a public narrative, extending her influence beyond screen-based content and validating digital creators as authors and thought leaders in contemporary culture.Looking ahead, Singh’s recognition is likely to encourage other digital creators to pursue multi-platform careers, blending online content, traditional media, and advocacy. Institutions may increasingly confer honours upon influencers who achieve societal impact, signalling an expanded understanding of cultural contribution.As digital influence continues to evolve, Singh’s journey exemplifies how a YouTuber can transition from niche online content to mainstream recognition, bridging cultural, generational, and geographical divides in the process.","Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University. The award reflects Singh’s impact on pop culture, media representation, and diversity advocacy. Her career illustrates a trend in global media where social media platforms have become launching pads for internationally recognised cultural figures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124670159,imgsize-40290,width-400,resizemode-4/superwoman-gets-a-dr-prefix-popular-youtuber-lilly-singh-gets-honorary-doctorate-from-alma-mater.jpg"
"US Congress members urge Trump to withdraw the $ 100,000 entry fee for new H-1B visas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-congress-members-urge-trump-to-withdraw-the-100000-entry-fee-for-new-h-1b-visas/articleshow/124737781.cms,".

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders





“America’s innovation economy depends on both strong domestic talent and access to a highly skilled workforce from abroad.” With this opening line, seven US lawmakers — Democrats and Republicans — have written to President Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, urging them to reconsider the administration’s plan to impose a $ 100,000- fee on new H-1B visa petitions.As per the recent guidance update by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), new H-1B petitions, filed for consular processing, where the worker is outside the US will trigger the $100,000 payment requirement This payment is to be made upfront at the time of the H-1B visa application by the sponsoring employer, a refund is available only if the visa application is denied.The letter, sent on Tuesday, warns that the fee will not curb abuse of the H-1B visa system, but will instead shut out start-ups, slow innovation, and push skilled workers — many from India — to competing countries.The letter is signed by Suhas Subramanyam, son to Indian immigrant parents, other members of the US Congress who have joined in signing the letter include Sam T Liccardo, Jay Obernolte, María Elvira Salazar, Don Bacon and Greg Stanton.The lawmakers concede that the H-1B programme needs reform, but point out that the imposition of a $ 100,000 entry fee is too expensive and will have adverse impact. They note that early-stage technology firms and research-driven companies, which depend heavily on foreign-born engineers and scientists, will simply not be able to afford the fee.They caution that while large corporations may absorb the cost, smaller companies will be forced to cancel job offers, move projects abroad or stop hiring foreign workers altogether. According to the letter, the proclamation “will bar rapidly scaling American start-ups from recruiting and retaining critically needed talent”, undermining their growth and “reducing employment of US citizens by those same employers”.The growing support against the fee imposition, is particularly relevant to India, whose nationals receive around 60 per cent of all H-1B visas issued every year. Thousands of Indian students studying in the United States on F-1 and OPT visas transition to H-1B status to begin employment. As per USCIS’s guidance note, any employer filing a fresh H-1B petition for someone outside the US must pay 100,000 dollars upfront. Those already in the country on H-1B, or applying for extensions or amendments, are exempt. The fee also does not apply in case of transition from a F-1 (student visa) to an H-1B, while in the US. However, new graduates who return to India for visa stamping or travel could be caught in the net.The letter draws attention to a larger strategic risk: if the US makes it harder for skilled immigrants to stay, they will return to countries like India, China, Israel or those in Europe and launch companies that directly compete with American firms. It points out that China already produces nearly half of the world’s top artificial intelligence researchers, more than double the number in the US, and is expanding visa options to attract global STEM talent. Canada promises high-skill visas in under two weeks, Germany has signed a labour mobility agreement with India, and China has introduced a new “K” visa for young technology professionals. “Other nations see the opportunity presented by our shift,” the lawmakers write, “and they’re seizing it.”They argue that high-skilled immigration has historically been America’s strength. Nearly half of all US start-ups valued at over a billion dollars — the so-called “unicorns” — were founded by immigrants, and many of today’s biggest technology firms were unable to make profits during their early years and would not have survived if such a fee had existed. The letter cites research showing that start-ups which successfully hire H-1B workers file more patents, attract more funding, and hire more Americans.Instead of the significant entry fee, the lawmakers propose targeted reforms: stricter action against outsourcing firms that replace US workers with lower-paid employees, visa portability to allow H-1B holders to change jobs freely, better enforcement, updated wage and skill classifications, and a more reasonable fee structure. Their appeal is not to scrap reform, but to avoid a policy that they say will harm the very companies and workers the US economy depends on.For India, this debate is more than policy politics in Washington. It affects tens of thousands of engineering graduates, IT professionals, medical researchers and families who aspire to work in the US. It influences decisions by Indian technology companies and start-ups that operate in both Bengaluru and Silicon Valley. If the rule holds, job offers may be withdrawn, visas delayed, and future plans derailed. If it is struck down or modified, the pathway for Indian talent to the United States — already narrowed by backlogs and lottery systems — may remain open, but not unchanged.As the lawmakers write in closing, high-skilled immigrants “play a vital role in strengthening our economy, advancing American competitiveness, and expanding opportunities for US citizens”. They urge the President to work with Congress to modernise the system, not seal it off.Two separate lawsuits have been filed in US district courts, aiming to block the $100,000 fee imposed by Donald J Trump’s proclamation. The outcome of these legal challenges is still awaited.","Seven US lawmakers have written to President Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, urging them to reconsider the administration’s plan to impose a $ 100,000- fee on new H-1B visa petitions.

Jaish-e-Mohammed Launches Online Jihad Course For Women In Pakistan, Targets Mass Recruitment





Days after Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) announced the formation of its first-ever women’s wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, the group has now launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women, according to media reports.The digital course, namely ‘Tufat al-Muminat’ aims to attract as many women as possible to the outfit’s network. The initiative is being led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of JeM chief Masood Azhar Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed in Operation Sindoor on May 7, when armed forces targeted JeM’s headquarters at Markaz Subhanallah in Bahawalpur.Sources said that Masood Azhar’s sisters, Sadiya and Samaira Azhar, will conduct 40-minute online classes daily, beginning November 8, using meeting platforms to teach women about their “duties” from the perspectives of jihad, religion and Islam.Each participant enrolling in the course is reportedly being asked to pay a donation of PKR 500 and fill out an online form.Intelligence sources indicate that the program is part of JeM’s broader effort to rebuild its base and financing network following significant losses in airstrikes during Operation Sindoor earlier this year.The announcement comes weeks after JeM publicly introduced its women’s brigade on October 8, followed by an event titled ‘Dukhtaran-e-Islam’ held in Rawalakot, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, on October 19 to mobilise women supporters.Security officials say JeM’s decision to involve women marks a major shift in its operational strategy.The organisation, along with others such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, had previously avoided using women in active combat roles.Sources suggest that this move is viewed as a potential signal that JeM could begin training female suicide attackers, similar to tactics employed by groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas and LTTE.The development also underscores Pakistan’s continued tolerance of terror infrastructure on its soil. Despite Islamabad’s claims at global platforms of being a victim of terrorism and its assertions of compliance with FATF regulations, JeM and other banned groups reportedly continue to operate and collect donations openly through their network of markaz (centres).In September, Masood Azhar was also reported to have made a public appeal for funds during an address at Markaz Usman O Ali in Bahawalpur.Meanwhile, intelligence inputs suggest that JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen have shifted their bases to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to avoid Indian airstrikes after Operation Sindoor.According to media reports, JeM has additionally launched an online fundraising campaign via EasyPaisa, seeking to raise Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new centres across Pakistan.'","Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) has launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women.

NEW DELHI: India submitted an affidavit to a Belgian court containing detailed architectural drawings and interior photographs of Mumbai’s high-security Arthur Road Jail, where fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi will be lodged following his future extradition in the Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.The affidavit sought to assure the Belgian court of “humane” detention conditions for Choksi, who is an accused in the multi-crore scam, news agency ANI reported.The images, dated June 5 and part of a set of six technical sheets titled “Prison Conditions Barrack 12, Arthur Road Prison, Mumbai”, were prepared by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD).According to the drawings, Barrack No. 12, designated for Choksi, measures approximately 46.5 square metres (around 500 sq. ft.) and includes a main room, passage, wash area, and toilet.The facility features ventilated windows with mosquito netting, grilled doors for security, CCTV surveillance, ceiling fans, and tube lighting. It also includes a wash basin and shower with running water, along with PVC flooring and tiled walls for improved hygiene.Additionally, a mobile jammer has been installed at the beam level, and a CCTV camera is positioned near the ventilator to ensure continuous monitoring.Choksi, who had opposed his extradition citing alleged threats to his life and concerns about prison conditions in India, has been ruled extraditable by the Antwerp Court of Appeal. The ruling paves the way for his return to India to face trial in the PNB fraud case.In its detailed judgment, the court observed that the offences shall be punishable under Indian law by virtue of Sections 120-B read with 201, 409, 420, and 477-A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Sections 7 and 13(2) read with 13(1) (c) and (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, each carrying a sentence of more than one year.","Belgian Court Clears Fugitive Jeweller Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India.

When people think of the Burj Khalifa, they often imagine Dubai’s royal family or government behind its glittering success. But the man who truly owns and built this global icon is Mohamed Alabbar, a self-made Emirati entrepreneur and founder of Emaar Properties. From humble beginnings on Dubai Creek to leading one of the world’s most successful real-estate companies, Alabbar’s journey mirrors Dubai’s own transformation, ambitious, bold, and unstoppable.The journey to building the world’s tallest tower did not begin in a palace, but in a modest home. Mohamed Alabbar, born in 1956, grew up in Dubai's Rashidiya area as the eldest of 12 children; his father was a traditional trading vessel (dhow) captain. This humble background fueled his extraordinary drive and ambition.Alabbar’s formal education took him across the world. He graduated in 1981 from Seattle University in the United States, earning a degree in Business Administration, which laid the foundation for his future empire. Upon returning to the UAE, he quickly rose through the ranks, starting at the Central Bank before becoming the founding director general of Dubai's Department of Economic Development.It was during this time that he forged a crucial, career-defining relationship with Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Ruler of Dubai. Tasked with improving the Emirate’s tourism and global reputation, Alabbar used his close position as a chief economic adviser to help execute the vision of transforming Dubai into a global hub. In 1997, he founded Emaar Properties, the company that would ultimately deliver that vision.In 1997, Alabbar founded Emaar Properties, with backing from Dubai’s leadership and a vision to create world-class urban spaces. The company soon became the crown jewel of Dubai’s real estate revolution, responsible for some of the city’s most famous landmarks:Emaar’s most iconic project, however, is the Burj Khalifa, which officially opened in 2010. Standing 828 meters tall, it remains the world’s tallest building, a global symbol of innovation, ambition, and design excellence.The inspiration behind the Burj Khalifa was more than a desire to build tall — it was about symbolism and ambition. In the early 2000s, as Dubai transitioned from an oil-based economy to tourism and services, Alabbar wanted a landmark that would announce the city’s arrival on the world stage. He envisioned a building that could rival New York, Shanghai, and London — a project that would place Dubai at the center of the global map.Architecturally, the design was inspired by the Hymenocallis flower, native to the Arabian desert, whose geometric symmetry influenced the tower’s Y-shaped base. The structure was engineered by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the same firm behind Chicago’s Willis Tower, combining Islamic design elements with cutting-edge technology. Alabbar described the Burj Khalifa as “a statement of the region’s confidence and its future” — a monument representing Dubai’s openness, multicultural energy, and limitless possibility.In short, the Burj Khalifa was born from an idea of identity: to show what Dubai could achieve through vision, collaboration, and courageDespite popular belief, the Burj Khalifa is not owned by the UAE government or any royal. It is owned by Emaar Properties, the publicly traded company founded and chaired by Mohamed Alabbar. As Emaar’s founder and key shareholder, Alabbar oversaw every stage of the project from design approvals to navigating the 2008 global financial crisis that nearly halted construction.The tower’s name honors Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the late President of the UAE, in recognition of Abu Dhabi’s financial support during the crisis. Alabbar’s influence extends well beyond real estate. He has built a global business portfolio that reflects Dubai’s diversification:Through these ventures, Alabbar continues to strategically modernize Middle Eastern entrepreneurship, combining innovation, digitalization, and sustainable development. Today, the Burj Khalifa stands tall at 828 meters, housing luxury residences, corporate offices, and the world-famous At.mosphere restaurant, a living testament to Alabbar’s remarkable vision.","Mohamed Alabbar is a self-made Emirati entrepreneur and founder of Emaar Properties.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP and former Union finance minister P Chidambaram has claimed that Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw has offered to fund repairs of Bengaluru’s notoriously battered roads.In a post on X, Chidambaram welcomed Shaw’s 'proposal' but cautioned that the city’s infrastructure woes go beyond a shortage of funds.The Biocon chief, however, has denied making any such offer.“The problem with our public works is not the lack of money; it is in the execution,” Chidambaram said in an online post, suggesting a system that could hold private industry accountable for the quality and timely delivery of public projects.Also read: ‘Fabricated news’, says Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw on repairing Bengaluru roads Under Chidambaram’s blueprint, public contractors would still carry out the work, but a supervising company or industrialist—like Shaw—would be responsible for ensuring quality and adhering to deadlines.“Any penalties or cost overruns would fall on the supervising company or industrialist,” he explained, pointing to Bengaluru and Chennai as potential testing grounds for such an experiment.Shaw’s intervention comes amid mounting frustration over Bengaluru’s infrastructure, with roads riddled with potholes and traffic congestion a daily ordeal.On Tuesday, she met Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy CM D K Shivakumar to extend Deepavali greetings, and reportedly assured both leaders of her support for the city’s development.Shivakumar, who oversees Bengaluru’s civic development, told reporters that industry leaders have agreed to “cooperate with the development of Bengaluru” without undermining the system.He added that he plans to visit areas adjacent to the Greater Bengaluru Authority to address disparities in infrastructure and taxation between municipal boundaries.The state government has faced sustained criticism over poor road conditions, chaotic traffic, and inadequate civic management.Shaw’s public calls for action—and now her private offer to help—have reignited debates about whether India’s urban infrastructure can be improved through partnerships between government and industry, or if deeper structural reform is required.As Bengaluru prepares for the festive season, residents continue to navigate a city where potholes, traffic snarls, and crumbling roads remain stubborn reminders of the governance challenge ahead.","Congress MP and former Union finance minister P Chidambaram has claimed that Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw has offered to fund repairs of Bengaluru’s notoriously battered roads.

While India's CPCB showed AQI below 400, international apps like IQAir reported over 2,000.

Delhi’s Air Quality Deteriorates Sharply to ‘Red Zone’ as Diwali Fireworks Trigger Severe Pollution





NEW DELHI: Many Delhi residents were puzzled by the wildly different readings of Delhi's pollution level on Tuesday.While the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reported AQI levels well below 400, international apps like IQAir showed figures crossing 2,000 in several areas.For instance, at 12.30 am on Tuesday, CPCB's data showed an AQI of 272 at Siri Fort, while IQAir reported an astonishing 2,449 for the same location.Experts say both readings are technically correct but they follow different methodologies and scales. ""The Indian AQI, developed in 2015, is calculated using six key parameters — PM2.5, PM10, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. The graded scale — from good to severe+ — ranges from 0 to 500,"" said MP George, former additional director at DPCC. ""Globally, different systems exist — some range from 0–10 or 0–100. IQAir, for instance, uses a US-based model.""The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s AQI, on which IQAir is based, also follows a 0–500 scale but allows values beyond 500, with anything above 301 classified as hazardous. The Indian system, however, caps readings at 500, as health risks are already severe at that level and higher values are seen to be of limited practical use.Another major difference lies in data sources. IQAir's index is largely sensor-based, while CPCB relies on analyser-based reference-grade monitors, considered more accurate and standardised. ""I would trust CPCB's data, as the calibration and reference methods are known. We don't know the exact algorithms IQAir uses,"" Dr George added.Clearing the air: Why global apps showed Delhi’s AQI levels at 2,000+, but CPCB under 400Experts stressed that despite the numerical gap, both platforms were showing the same reality — that Delhi's air quality was very poor during and after Diwali, far exceeding safe limits of both Indian and international standards.","India's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reported AQI levels well below 400.

Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week, marking the latest restructuring at the startup since Mark Zuckerberg's Meta invested $14.3 billion in the company in June. The shuttered team, known internally as the NPO or New Projects Organization, had over a dozen members who focused on generalist tasks such as improving the writing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.Scale AI attributed the cuts to an industry shift toward more technical, expert-level training work, according to Business Insider. As AI chatbots improve, they increasingly require input from humans with specialised skills in fields like medicine, robotics, and finance, rather than generalist contractors.“Scale wound down a small experimental onsite program in Dallas staffed by a contract workforce,” Scale AI spokesperson Natalia Montalvo said.“This reflects an industry shift toward higher skill, expert data work. It only affects a small fraction of our overall workforce and has no impact on customer delivery,” Montalvo was quoted as saying.Scale AI offered the laid-off workers four weeks of severance pay and healthcare coverage through October, according to an email from HireArt, a staffing agency used extensively by Scale AI.The recently terminated workers were also invited to join Scale's gig-work platform, Outlier, where thousands of freelancers help train AI models.“As you navigate this transition, we want to ensure you are aware of alternative opportunities,” the email stated.Montalvo added that Scale AI continues to expand expert-level programmes and that broader groups of contractors continue to work in Dallas.The Dallas layoffs represent the latest in a series of cuts at Scale AI since the Meta investment. xAI has also made similar moves to focus on specialised AI training, recently downsizing its team of generalist AI tutors in September.",Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week.

MacKenzie Scott’s philanthropic ventures





Focus on diversity and equity causes









MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos , has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the SEC filed Tuesday and dated September 30. Many of Scott’s recent philanthropic efforts have focused on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. First reported by Bloomberg, the filing shows that Scott now holds 81.1 million Amazon shares – down 58 million from a year earlier. This reduction occurred despite Amazon shares more than doubling since Scott's 2019 divorce from Bezos.The filing, however, does not specify whether the reduction in Amazon holdings resulted from share sales, donations, or a combination of both, the report said. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, Bezos retains voting authority over Scott's holdings and is required to disclose them annually.With an estimated net worth of $32 billion, Mackenzie Scott obtained most of her wealth following her 2019 divorce from Bezos and has pledged to give away the majority of it. After ending up with approximately 4% of the e-coomerce giant, Scott has given away $19 billion in gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits over the past five years.The median gift size of her thousands of donations since the divorce is roughly $5 million.As a part of Scott’s philanthropic efforts, one of her most recent donations includes a $42 million gift to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit expanding college access for low-income and largely non-white students.According to a report by Fortune, this followed a $70 million gift to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through the nonprofit UNCF. The program, launched in 2021, aims to help HBCUs close a funding gap compared to white or elite institutions and provide long-term financial stability for minority schools.Furthermore, over the years, Scott has donated to diverse causes including an $84 million gift to Girl Scouts, $20 million to Vermont's Champlain Housing Trust, $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, and $275 million to Planned Parenthood. She previously gave UNCF $10 million in the year 2020.","Mackenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion.

Best time to buy gold in the UAE after Diwali price drop: What buyers need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/best-time-to-buy-gold-in-the-uae-after-diwali-price-drop-what-buyers-need-to-know/articleshow/124752384.cms,"Gold Prices Plunge Sharply in UAE After Diwali, Offering Buyers a Breather

Post-festival price drop



Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices

Global market influence



Shoppers seize the opportunity







Dubai: Gold prices in the UAE have experienced a significant correction following recent historic highs, providing welcome relief to buyers after months of record-breaking surges post Diwali 2025. The tumbled rates in the wake of Diwali is creating a buzz among buyers looking to capitalise on lower rates. Here’s a closer look at the market movements and what they mean for investors and shoppers alike.On Wednesday, October 22, 2025, 24-karat gold dipped to Dh484 per gram, while 22-karat gold fell to Dh448, marking their lowest levels in nearly two months. Though prices recovered slightly by evening, climbing back to Dh487 and Dh451 respectively, the decline follows a dramatic Dh30 plunge just days before, when 24-karat gold touched an all-time peak of Dh525.25 per gram.This steep sell-off mirrors global trends as investors shed safe-haven assets amid improving US-China trade relations and a strengthening US dollar. Spot gold prices worldwide declined 1% to $4,055 an ounce, extending the previous day’s 6% rout that was the most significant intraday fall since 2013. Silver also tumbled nearly 9% in tandem.Market analysts interpret the rapid sell-off as a natural correction rather than a market collapse.They note that the prior fear-driven rally has dissipated amid easing geopolitical tensions and stronger US economic data, prompting asset rotation from bullion to equities.The gold market trends as of October 21, 2025, detailing price movements and buyer sentiment post-Diwali celebrations, have found that locally, the price drop has sparked renewed interest among price-sensitive buyers. Jewellery retailers in Dubai and Sharjah report a surge in foot traffic, with customers eager to capitalise on gold’s affordability after weeks of elevated prices.While volatility may persist, experts maintain that gold’s long-term fundamentals remain robust. Inflationary pressures, central bank reserve accumulations and expectations of US rate cuts in 2026 could bolster bullion demand in the medium term.For now, UAE buyers are closely monitoring the market, as the recent correction presents a potential short-lived window to acquire gold before prices stabilise or rise again.","Gold prices in the UAE have experienced a significant correction following recent historic highs.

"Use nature to tackle floods, not concrete: Scientist on Mumbai’s urban resilience",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/midnight-blast-halts-trains-in-assam-track-and-sleepers-destroyed-near-kokrajhar/articleshow/124752647.cms,"Pic of marine ecologist Mat Vanderklift





MUMBAI: In cities like Mumbai which face regular floods on extreme rain days during the monsoon months, marine ecologist Mat Vanderklift, whose research primarily focuses on coastal ecosystems, said that urban resilience could be improved by integrating natural wetlands into flood management.“Instead of channeling all runoff through concrete drains, we can create multifunctional wetlands that store excess water, filter pollutants, and serve as community spaces. These could be open spaces like parks,” he said.“It’s not a quick fix, but economically, the return on investment in mangrove restoration is around ten to one — the benefits far outweigh the costs.” As climate extremes intensify, Vanderklift stressed the need for both mitigation and adaptation. “For low-lying nations and coastal cities, it’s no longer just about preventing change—it’s about surviving it.”An analysis by the BMC on rainfall recordings in the last one decade from 2014-2024 which was done last year flagged this worrying rise in intense rain days in the city. According to it on an average, Mumbai records 16 days a year with rainfall exceeding 100 mm. However, the past three years have shown a noticeable uptick, with 13 such days in the year 2022, 14 in 2023, and a steep rise to 21 days in 2024.This analysis also highlights that between 2014 and 2024, the city experienced 28 high-intensity rain events—defined as receiving between 120 mm and 267 mm of rainfall within a span of just four hours.Beyond their climate benefits Vanderklift said that coastal ecosystems provide crucial protection and livelihood support. Referring to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Vanderklift also director of the IORA Indian Ocean Blue Carbon Hub leads research projects in the Indian Ocean and Australia that seek to provide the science to support development of policies for ""blue carbon"" pointed out how villages shielded by mangroves suffered less damage and loss of life compared to those where mangroves had been cleared. “Natural barriers such as mangroves and coral reefs act as frictional buffers against storm surges and waves,” he said. “They perform better than even cement embankments in many cases.”Further speaking about the differences between land and ocean carbon cycles, Vanderklift explained that decomposition occurs much more slowly underwater because oxygen moves sluggishly through water compared to air. “The carbon that gets locked into plants in these ecosystems tends to stay there, buried in the sediment, rather than being rapidly released,” he said. Moreover, salinity in coastal systems suppresses methane-producing bacteria—making them more climate-friendly than freshwater systems such as rivers and lakes.“These systems are natural climate solutions,” said Vanderklift. “Globally, they could account for about three percent of climate abatement. It’s not enough to solve climate change, but it’s a meaningful contribution, especially for sectors where reducing emissions is hard—like aviation and shipping.”Australia, he added, has begun recognising these benefits through projects that restore degraded coastal wetlands and issue Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) for blue carbon restoration. Similar large-scale mangrove restoration projects exist in Indonesia, Vietnam, and India, though Vanderklift said he hopes to study India’s MISHTI mangrove initiative more closely. MISHTI stands for Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes. It was announced in the Union Budget 2023-24 and formally launched on 5 June 2023 (World Environment Day) by the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC).The scheme is aimed at restoring and conserving mangrove ecosystems (and by implication their associated coastal habitats) across India’s shoreline.He cautioned, however, that ocean-based mitigation cannot compensate for unchecked emissions. “Most of the energy from global warming is already being absorbed by the ocean. It’s buffering us now, but it’s also warming and bleaching coral reefs faster than expected,” he warned.","Marine ecologist Mat Vanderklift said that urban resilience could be improved by integrating natural wetlands into flood management. “Instead of channeling all runoff through concrete drains, we can create multifunctional wetlands that store excess water, filter pollutants, and serve as community spaces,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124752770,imgsize-984445,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/pic-of-marine-ecologist-mat-vanderklift.jpg"
Celebrating 250 years of Lucknow’s legacy: City's soul lives in its mohallas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/celebrating-250-years-of-lucknows-legacy-citys-soul-lives-in-its-mohallas/articleshow/124752190.cms,"Origins in the time of Mughals

Nawabi Lucknow: a planned dream

Tola, Katra & Ganj





To understand Lucknow, don’t head straight for its monuments or museums, instead walk through its ‘mohallas’. These aren’t just neighbourhoods but the soul of Lucknow, stitched together by stories, heritage and ethos of the city.‘Mohallas’ begin quietly, often with an unassuming ‘gali’ (lane) that opens into a world where names aren’t just names but archives where every turn takes you back in time.Lucknow’s early form took shape during Emperor Akbar’s reign in around 1590, when Lucknow became the seat of ‘subedar’. Akbar granted a ‘jagir’ to Shaikh Abdul Rahman, and soon after, Sufi saint Shah Meena Shah settled here. His ‘dargah’ still stands near Nakhas.That early settlement sparked the growth of neighbourhoods like Vajpayee Tola, Rastogi Tola, Katari Tola, and Sondhi Tola — ‘tolas’ being some of the oldest forms of habitation in the city. These early ‘mohallas’ grew around caste, kinship, or craft. They weren’t formally designed; they formed naturally around wells, shrines, temples, and mutual need.Historian Veena Talwar Oldenburg notes Akbar’s fondness for Lucknow.He commissioned several ‘mohallas’ south of Chowk, the central bazaar. Chowk quickly became the heart of commerce and culture.One of the city’s most influential landmarks, Farangi Mahal, has its roots in this period. Originally built by a French horse trader, it was handed over to Mulla Nizamuddin under Aurangzeb.It later became a world-renowned centre of Islamic scholarship. The curriculum developed here — ‘Dars-i-Nizami’ — is still taught in ‘madrassas’ across South Asia.In 1775, when Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula officially moved the Awadh capital from Faizabad to Lucknow, the city was already brimming with culture, poetry, and power. Asaf-ud-Daula and his successors expanded Lucknow imaginatively. Asaf-ud-Daula recreated ‘mohallas’ from Faizabad in his new capital. The later nawabs added more to the list.Saadat Ali Khan founded Saadatganj, Rakabganj, Fatehganj, and Daliganj. Nawab Naseeruddin Haider contributed Ganeshganj, Chandganj, and Hazratganj. These weren’t just names—they were blueprints for a plural society. Under Wajid Ali Shah, the last nawab, ‘mohallas’ became hubs of syncretic culture, with Hindus and Muslims living side by side.Historian Roshan Taqui offers a helpful framework for understanding how Lucknow’s ‘mohallas’ evolved. He classifies them into three broad types –‘tola’, ‘katra/mandi’, and ‘ganj’. Each corresponds to a distinct historical layer. ‘Tolas’ were the earliest form — small, unplanned neighbourhoods often named after their dominant community or occupation. These were Brahmin, Kayastha, or artisan-dominated settlements. Some examples include Vajpayee Tola, Sondhi Tola, Katari Tola, and Rastogi Tola which still exist near Chowk.These ‘tolas’ were the city’s skeletal frame: narrow lanes, local temples or mosques, wells, shrines, and a strong sense of community. They weren’t ‘planned’ but they worked well with shared customs, local leadership, and mutual dependence.The ‘katras’ or ‘mandis’ were market-centred ‘mohallas’ like Mirza Mandi, Mahmood Nagar, Shahganj. A ‘katra’ was typically a walled set of shops; a ‘mandi’ was broader and often wholesale.These ‘mohallas’ grew around caravan routes. Many had ‘serais’, mosques, and wells for travelers and traders. They were urban without being elite. These neighbourhoods were the engine rooms of the city’s economy.The most refined layer came with the nawabs. The term ‘ganj’ — meaning market or treasure — signalled planned urban settlements. These included Hazratganj, Rakabganj, Saadatganj, Ganeshganj, and Chandganj.These ‘mohallas’ were inclusive. Nawabi planning encouraged mixed communities, with Hindus and Muslims living close together. Some were even named after women patrons or courtesans — Kishna Maharajin ka Bagh, Bagh Padain, and Rani Katra.Many ‘mohallas’ weren’t named after rulers or traders but after ordinary professions. These were working-class quarters—specialised, skilled, and indispensable.Bawarchi Tola housed ‘khansamas’ or chefs who refined ‘dum pukht’ cooking and crafted Lucknow’s culinary identity. Many present-day cooks trace their roots to this ‘mohalla’. Mashalchi Tola was home to torchbearers who lit processions and night events before electricity existed. They were part technicians, part performers.Kaharan Tola had the ‘kahars’ who carried ‘dolis’ (palanquins) for commuting to women’s locales, weddings and rituals.Bhandon Tola sheltered ‘bhands’ and folk performers — dancers, storytellers, mimicry artists. Their legacy now survives more in theatre and festivals than daily life.Rassi Batan, located between Aminabad and Maulviganj, gets its name from the traditional craft of rope-making — ‘rassi’ meaning rope, and ‘batan’ meaning twisting. Though the craft has disappeared, the name remains.Quirky NamesVictoria Ganj | Named in the honour of Queen Victoria, it became Tudiyaganj for LucknowitesChor Ghati | Locals say that during the era of nawabs, thieves and robbers lived in this area who looted travellers and carried out heistsKallan Ki Laat | It is an old name still used in Aminabad for a spot once marked by a colonial-era obelisk. The pillar, or ‘laat’, stood over the grave of Colonel John Collins, a British officer who died in 1807. Locals called it ‘Kallan Ki Laat’Andhe Ki Chowki | Some historians believe there was a police post which was under Major Andrew during the colonial period. People changed Andrew to ‘andhe’ (blind), there by calling the locality ‘Andhe Ki Chowki’. Some believe the locality was named after a blind watchman or ascetic who lived in the areaMandis Named After Forgotten TradesSeveral old localities in Lucknow carry names that reveal their past roles as specialised markets or storage zones during the Mughal and Nawabi eras. Chik Mandi in Aminabad was once the hub of wooden chik (blinds) craftsmanship. Bhedi Mandi in Maulviganj, functioned as a major livestock market for sheep and goats. Barood Khana served as an arms and ammunition storage area from the Mughal era through colonial times. Hathi Khana, near Aminabad, was once a stable for royal elephants used in processions and heavy transport. The presence of Astabal area near Charbagh hints at the time when horses were central to transport, military, and ceremonial life.Farangi Mahal: Theology To NationalismOnce a colonial mansion, Farangi Mahal became a seminary that rivalled global centres of Islamic learning. The ‘Dars-i-Nizami’ curriculum from here still influences thousands of madrasas across the subcontinent.","‘Mohallas’ begin quietly, often with an unassuming ‘gali’ (lane) that opens into a world where names aren’t just names but archives where every turn takes you back in time. ‘Tolas’ were the earliest form — small, unplanned neighbourhoods often named after their dominant community or occupation.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

In the heart of Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow unfolds like a majestic tapestry woven with threads of history, flavours, traditions, and untold stories. This enchanting metropolis comes alive through the passionate voices of its influencers and cultural custodians on Instagram , weaving a mesmerizing narrative that captures hearts globally. What’s even more inspiring is that some of these influencers have taken a remarkable leap, leaving behind lucrative careers to share Lucknow's captivating stories with the world, writesIn 2021, 31-year-old Maroof Umar stepped into the digital realm with his Instagram presence, weaving together his passions for graphic design, tourism, and cultural preservation. As a graphic designer, Maroof brings a keen eye for aesthetics to his social media journey, showcasing the lesser-known facets of Lucknow.Maroof noticed that while tourism in Lucknow often spotlighted famous landmarks like Bhool Bhulaiya and Imambara – which admittedly draw crowds – there existed a vast, untapped world beyond these well-trodden paths. He conceived the idea to highlight Lucknow’s hidden gems like Musa Bagh, aiming to create a balance in showcasing the city’s cultural richness. “Hum logon ke yahan tourism selected tha jaise Bhool Bhulaiya, Imambara but they are overcrowded,” Maroof observed, inspiring him to broaden the narrative around Lucknow’s tourism.Maroof’s advocacy extends to promoting artisans who keep traditional crafts alive – crafts like chikankari, zardozi, and chatapati ghararas. He emphasizes revealing not just the art itself, but the skilled hands behind them – the unsung heroes preserving cultural legacies.His Instagram has become a platform celebrating these artisans.Among the captivating narratives showcased on his platform, one of Maroof’s most beloved reels features Aamna Khatoon – a maestro of craftsmanship who has devoted 40 enchanting years to preserving an exquisite legacy, one delicate stitch at a time. Imbibing the revered art of crafting chatapati ghararas from her esteemed khala (aunt), Aamna embodies a lineage of skill gracefully passed down through generations. For her, this intricate craft transcends mere fabric and embroidery; it unveils a poignant tale intricately woven with threads of patience, meticulous precision, and unwavering dedication.Equally mesmerizing is the chronicle of a venerable Zardozi artisan – a humble shagird (apprentice) since childhood, who embarked upon a transformative journey spanning 15 years to fathom the profound depths of this resplendent art. Once embellished entirely with lustrous real silver threads – encompassing the elegant dabka, intricate naqshi, and opulent kalapattu – this timeless craft has gracefully evolved with the epochs, now embracing artificial materials. Yet, amidst this metamorphosis, one enduring essence remains unaltered – the unwavering mehnat (toil) infusing every stitch with soul, as Maroof Umar eloquently shared with TOI.Through his lens, Maroof Umar brings attention to Lucknow’s cultural depth, connecting traditions with contemporary storytelling, making his Instagram a treasure trove of the city’s artistic heritage.In 2018, 23-year-old Rohit Prajapati and 30-year-old Javed Ali embarked on a mission to showcase the essence of Lucknow to the world. With a passion for promoting the city's rich heritage, they created an Instagram page that would soon become a go-to destination for all things Lucknow.Rohit traded in his transport firm job to focus on his love for promoting Lucknow. The decision paid off, as his Instagram page gained traction, and he started posting content that highlighted the city's iconic landmarks, such as Imambara and Clock Tower, as well as its vibrant cultural events, government initiatives, and festive celebrations like Durga Puja and Diwali.Initially, Rohit’s page featured pictures, but as his audience grew, so did his content. He began creating engaging reels that showcased the city’s beauty, and his following skyrocketed. The enthusiasm was palpable: “Jaise Jaise hits aaye, we got a kick (the more hits we got, the more excited we were),” he told TOI.Through his content, Rohit aims to promote the city’s cultural heritage, tourism, and lifestyle. His posts and reels have become a reflection of Lucknow’s rich history, traditions, and values. By sharing his passion with the world, Rohit Prajapati is doing his part in putting Lucknow on the map.

His journey onto Instagram in 2019 has further amplified his mission to showcase the city's multifaceted charm.What distinguishes Himanshu from others, as he eloquently articulates, is his profound connection with Lucknow – a bond forged since birth, as he is born and brought up in the city of Nawabs. Long before the advent of Instagram, Himanshu has been a passionate advocate for Lucknow's heritage through his writings and the evocative medium of dastangoi. A literary accomplishment underscoring his devotion is his authored book, ""Qissa Qissa Lucknowwa"" – a compelling compilation of anecdotes that vividly narrate the diverse tales associated with Lucknow.Through his reels, Himanshu brings to life the myriad facets of Lucknow. He recently posted a reel advocating beyond the city's famed non-vegetarian cuisine, bringing a spotlight on delightful vegetarian delights like meetha karela, sathpaitha, and karael – culinary gems needing their due branding. Himanshu's narratives encompass Muharram customs, reflecting the city's syncretic ethos. Through videos on heritage walks and tales, he unveils Lucknow's storied past and its freedom movement connections.""The richness of local languages also finds a voice in my storytelling. My tales celebrate the city's festive spirit and traditions. Even the famed mangoes of Lucknow find a delightful mention – symbolizing the city's abundance and cultural identifiers,"" said Himanshu, who has done a PhD and his doctoral thesis was on the Naval Kishore Press of Lucknow which was India’s largest printing press of the 19th and 20th century.A 36-year-old cultural enthusiast has been weaving magic on social media, showcasing the city's hidden treasures to the world.

From highlighting vegetarian food options to promoting cultural events, he is on a mission to change the narrative around Lucknow, which is often known for its non-vegetarian cuisine.

My campaigns, such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, aim to promote the value of girl child education and combat societal norms that hinder women’s progress,” she said. Aisha’s dedication to her craft has earned her a reputation as a thoughtful and engaging storyteller.When faced with depression, Aisha finds solace in the thrill of biking. “Growing up watching movies centered around bikes, I developed a craze for the freedom and adrenaline rush that comes with riding. My experiences living in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, before 2006 further fuelled my passion for biking,” she said.By riding a bike while wearing a burkha, Aisha challenges societal norms and stereotypes surrounding Muslim women. Her actions demonstrate that women can pursue their passions and interests without compromising their values or identity. Aisha’s story serves as a testament to the strength and resilience of women who refuse to be bound by societal expectations.As Aisha continues to inspire and empower others through her work, her message remains clear: every woman has the potential to make a difference, regardless of her background or circumstances.In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Saurabh Chandra stumbled upon an idea that would change the way people perceive and interact with Lucknow.

Who is Najah Al Masaeed?





How the Najah Al Masaeed $7 million scam unfolded?

“Justice for Najah” trends across the arab world

Financial scam trends in the MENA region

Jordanian authorities launch investigation





The Arab world was left stunned this week after Emirati-Jordanian poet and television personality Najah Al Masaeed revealed that she had fallen victim to a massive financial scam, losing what she described as a “very large sum” of money. In a tearful video shared across her social media accounts, Najah said she had been deceived by individuals she trusted deeply, describing the ordeal as a calculated act of fraud rather than a spontaneous theft. The revelation ignited a wave of support and outrage across the Middle East, with fans, journalists, and fellow artists calling for justice and stronger protections against organized scams targeting public figures.Born in Al Mafraq, Jordan, in 1977, Najah Al Masaeed became one of the most influential female voices in Arabic poetry. She gained fame for her emotionally charged verses and eloquent performances, earning admiration from the late King Hussein of Jordan, who offered her a scholarship after she recited a poem in his presence.Najah studied Sociology at Mutah University, becoming one of the few women of her generation to pursue higher education.Her boldness and intellect led her to become a prominent media presenter, poet, and cultural figure, later acquiring Emirati nationality in recognition of her artistic contributions.Over the years, she became a symbol of female empowerment in Arab arts, inspiring countless young women to pursue literature and public life without fear.In her emotional confession, Najah disclosed that she had been the victim of a well-planned fraud that cost her a staggering five million Jordanian dinars (approximately USD 7 million). Though she did not name the perpetrators, Najah made it clear that the scam was perpetrated by someone she personally trusted, likely linked to a business or investment venture “It’s not a small amount. I was deceived in a way that broke my heart and faith in people,” she said in a viral video.According to reports from Youm7 and Al-Mashhad, Najah has filed a formal complaint and initiated legal proceedings to recover her stolen funds. The case is currently being investigated by Jordanian authorities. Sources close to the poet indicated that the scheme involved false investment promises and manipulated documents, convincing Najah to transfer large sums over time.The case quickly became a social media storm, with hashtags like #JusticeForNajah, #NajahAlMasaeedScam, and #ArabCelebrityFraud trending across Jordan and the UAE. Prominent Arab influencers and writers publicly voiced support, urging authorities to hold the perpetrators accountable and applauding Najah for her transparency.According to recent reports from regional financial crime authorities and cybersecurity firms, financial scams targeting high-net-worth individuals and public figures in the MENA region have risen by over 25% in the past three years. In 2024 alone, the Jordanian Anti-Fraud Authority reported losses exceeding JD 120 million (approx. USD 170 million) due to investment, digital banking, and trust-based scams, while UAE authorities cited over AED 500 million in reported fraud cases, a significant portion involving celebrities or public personalities. Most scams involved real estate, online investments, and false consultancy schemes, with an average individual loss of JD 250,000–500,000. Najah Al Masaeed’s estimated loss of JD 5 million (USD 7 million) thus places her among the largest publicly reported cases of celebrity-targeted financial fraud in recent years, highlighting both the sophistication of modern scams and the vulnerability even high-profile figures face.According to early reports, the Jordanian Public Security Directorate has begun examining Najah’s complaint, focusing on banking transactions, digital communications, and contractual documents related to the alleged fraud. Legal analysts say the investigation may expand internationally if the suspects or funds are traced outside Jordan.Under Jordanian law, financial deception and breach of trust can carry severe penalties, including prison sentences and asset confiscation. If the suspects are found guilty, the court could order the restitution of Najah’s funds through asset recovery mechanisms. Najah’s lawyer, whose name has not been disclosed publicly, is reportedly working with financial crime experts to trace the missing money and identify all those involved.The Najah Al Masaeed fraud case combines heartbreak, betrayal, and courage in equal measure. It’s not just a story about losing millions, it's about how trust, money, and fame can collide in today’s interconnected global world. Her emotional honesty has made people listen. Her next steps legally and personally could define not only her legacy, but how Arab media and public figures handle financial fraud and increasing accountability in the digital age.","Emirati-Jordanian poet and TV personality Najah Al Masaeed revealed she had fallen victim to a massive financial scam.
