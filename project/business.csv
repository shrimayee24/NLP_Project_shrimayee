Agencies pass the buck after wetland vanishes

PANAJI: Less than two months ago, the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority, chaired by IAS officer Arun Kumar Mishra, brushed aside a report by its three-member committee on ""gross violations"" against the owner of the property on which the nightclub Birch by Romeo Lane stood, a British citizen named Surinder Kumar Khosla, and dropped proceedings against him. Khosla had leased the land to Birch by Romeo Lane.The committee, which included an expert and two members of the coastal authority, said there were ""alleged gross illegal constructions resulting in violations of CRZ notification 2011"" and recommended that it should be deliberated by the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) at its meeting and taken up for ""further discussion"".But without discussing or deliberating, coastal authority turned a blind eye to ""gross violations"" report and dropped proceedings on Oct 9 ""There is no violation of CRZ notification in as much as the structures in question fall beyond CRZ area of the creek/ river,"" the coastal authority said, adding it does not have jurisdiction in areas not declared or notified as CRZ (Coastal Regulatory Zone).After the inspection, the committee had reported that the ""RCC permanent structure is constructed fully into the water body"" and there were neither permissions nor NOCs from authorities concerned for the construction of a concrete structure.The committee found a RCC ground-plus-one structure ""in roughly hexagon shape"", which ""is erected in water body... ground floor is used as kitchen and storeroom area"", and the first floor, with coconut leaf roofing, is used as a restaurant.It was on the first floor that a fire broke out Saturday, killing 25 people, after electric firecrackers hit the ceiling as a belly dancer and her troupe performed.But the coastal authority, chaired by Mishra who is now posted in Delhi, dismissed the report and accepted the argument that ""there is no environmental cause"".The Arpora-Nagoa panchayat had on Oct 31, 1996 issued an NOC to construct a restaurant, staff quarters, compound wall, and later another NOC on Aug 12, 2004 to renovate the restaurant.Despite the committee attaching a Google image and the coastal zone management plan (CZMP) extract, which showed the alleged violations, the coastal authority noted ""that the CZMP for Goa had already been notified. The CZM indicates that the subject matter ground-plus-one RCC structure is outside the CRZ area"".The coastal authority report was the consequence of a complaint by Pradeep Ghadi Amonkar and Sunil Divkar Shetye on Dec 21, 2023, regarding illegal construction of Birch by Romeo Lane.New Delhi: Who is responsible for a wetland near Wazirabad disappearing? The National Green Tribunal is no closer to finding an answer despite the the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Central Pollution Control Board submitting their replies.On July 16, 2025, The Times of India had reported that the wetland had been filled up using inert waste from the Bhalswa landfill. The report highlighted that the Jharoda pond, which supported rich plant and bird life until 2023, had been buried under inert waste allegedly brought from the Bhalswa landfill..Taking suo motu cognizance of the report titled 'Find it if you can. Wetland near Wazirabad vanished under inert waste', the tribunal had issued notice to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the North district magistrate, and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) seeking an explanation on the matter. Only MCD and CPCB have responded so far, with both shifting blame to other agencies.In its submissions MCD said it was the responsibility of the private concessionaire appointed to flatten the Bhalswa landfill to ensure the inert material was disposed of correctly. It also said that the site belongs to DDA.In its reply, MCD said it was not ""dumping any form of waste at any wetland in the Wazirabad and Timarpur areas"". ""The said site, where it has been alleged that waste is being dumped, is owned by Delhi Development Authority,"" it said.The civic body further stated that it was merely following a 2019 order by the tribunal to dispose of 30 lakh MT of legacy waste from the Bhalswa landfill site, while adding that it received a request from DDA to facilitate the supply of bioremediated inert material on May 24, 2023. It added that the agency was neither involved in the process of identification of the site nor in the decision-making process.The DDA order shared by MCD said, ""this office permits to supply inert and C&D material at DDA vacant low-lying area at both sides of the Marginal Bandh at Jharoda Majra, Burari.""CPCB, meanwhile, said it had issued directions in 2021 under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, to all the State Pollution Control Boards and the Pollution Control Committees for the enforcement of provisions of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.""DPCC shall monitor and ensure compliance with the directions issued... DPCC shall also ensure enforcement of provisions of the SWM Rules 2016 by the concerned local authorities in Delhi,"" stated CPCB in a submission dated October 27, made available on Dec 9.","Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority dropped proceedings against nightclub owner.

"EC can't determine voter's citizenship, but surely inquire into it: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-cant-determine-voters-citizenship-but-surely-inquire-into-it-supreme-court/articleshow/125879660.cms,"The Supreme Court clarified that while the Election Commission cannot definitively determine citizenship, it can inquire about it if doubts arise regarding voters. The apex court emphasized that Indian citizenship is a constitutional prerequisite for voting, not merely a matter of residence and age. This ruling supports the EC's stance on verifying voter eligibility.

If it has doubts, EC can probe person's citizenship, says SC

The opposition's stand that EC cannot determine citizenship has been a common thread running through the arguments of a large number of politicians and NGOs represented by advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi, Prashant Bhushan, Shadan Farasat and Md Nizamuddin Pasha.EC has no jurisdiction to engage in determination of citizenship of a voter as that is the task of govt or Foreigners Tribunal. All of them argued that according to Representation of the People Act, if a person has proof of residence and is over 18, and gives a self-declaration that he is a citizen of India, then EC has no power to inquire into citizenship and delete him from the voters' list.On Tuesday, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi responded, saying, ""EC does not claim that it has the power to determine citizenship of a person or declare him as a foreigner. But, if it has doubts about the citizenship of a person registered as a voter or seeking inclusion of name as a voter, it can surely inquire into it.""""The first and foremost pre-condition for inclusion as a voter is that he/she must be a citizen of India. Given the constitutional and statutory powers conferred on EC, can it not undertake an inquisitorial exercise to find out who are doubtful citizens? That is included in the constitutional task of superintendence of elections,"" the bench said, in what marked an endorsement of EC's own stance on the issue.Farasat argued when a statutory procedure was provided for determination of citizenship, EC had no jurisdiction to usurp that process. SC said, ""To argue that a person required only proof of residence and age for inclusion in a voter list without proof of citizenship would be a misnomer. Proof of residence and age are statutory requirements. But citizenship is a constitutional requirement.""""Take a hypothetical example of an illegal migrant residing in India for more than a decade and more than 18 years of age. Will he be counted as a citizen to be included in the voter list? To argue that citizenship is to be presumed when residential and age criteria are met will be wrong ...,"" it said.Farasat said, ""The danger of illegal migrants getting into voters' lists is far less compared to mass exclusion of voters in the name of identifying non-citizens."" SC said, "" Can it be said that by asking for documentary proof, it is attempting to determine citizenship of a person?""",EC has no jurisdiction to engage in determination of citizenship of a voter as that is the task of govt or Foreigners Tribunal.

"Kids as young as 11 dabbling in drugs, shows 10-city survey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kids-as-young-as-11-dabbling-in-drugs-shows-10-city-survey/articleshow/125878454.cms,"A nationwide school survey reveals alarming drug experimentation among Indian children, with initiation as early as 11 and an average age of 12.9. One in seven students has tried psychoactive substances, with opioids and cannabis prevalent. Experts warn of easy access and emotional distress driving this trend, urging early intervention and parental vigilance.

NEW DELHI: A major school survey across 10 Indian cities has revealed that children are experimenting with drugs far earlier than expected, with the average age of initiation just 12.9 years and some starting as young as 11. The findings, published in the National Medical Journal of India this month, show that one in seven school students tried a psychoactive substance at least once.The study surveyed 5,920 students aged around 14.7 years across Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Imphal, Jammu, Dibrugarh and Ranchi. It found 15.1% had used a substance in their lifetime, 10.3% in the past year, and 7.2% in the past month. After tobacco (4%) and alcohol (3.8%), the most commonly used substances were opioids (2.8%), cannabis (2%) and inhalants (1.9%), with most opioid use linked to non-prescribed pharmaceutical pills.The multi-city study was led by Dr Anju Dhawan, chief of National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, AIIMS Delhi, in collaboration with medical colleges in Chandigarh, Dibrugarh, Lucknow, Bengaluru, Srinagar, Imphal, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Ranchi.Substance use rose sharply with age. Students in classes XI-XII were twice as likely to have used substances compared to Class VIII. Boys reported higher tobacco and cannabis use, while girls showed higher inhalant and pharmaceutical opioid use. Over half the students said they would hide drug use if asked, indicating that actual prevalence could be higher.The survey found a clear link between substance use and emotional distress: 31% of past-year users showed high psychological difficulty scores compared with 25% of non-users, with marked differences in conduct issues, hyperactivity and emotional symptoms.Against this backdrop, Dr Achal Bhagat, senior consultant psychiatrist and psychotherapist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, says the early age of initiation is an urgent warning. He notes that easy access and unaddressed emotional distress are driving children toward substances, even as the adolescent brain remains highly vulnerable to lasting harm from inhalants, opioids and cannabis. He points to a worrying rise in substance use among girls, often linked to discreet self-medication, and urges parents to watch for mood shifts, withdrawal, falling grades and secrecy. With only 1% of young users seeking help, he calls for stronger school mental-health support and open family conversations to prevent early experimentation from hardening into addiction.Family and peer influence also played a strong role, with 40% reporting tobacco or alcohol use at home and users far more likely to have peers who consume substances. Researchers say interventions must begin much earlier - ideally before middle school - to delay first use and prevent later addiction.The authors say the findings offer the clearest picture yet of adolescent substance use in India and stress the need for urgent school-based prevention, early identification and structured support before experimentation becomes entrenched.","Survey of 5,920 students across 10 Indian cities reveals alarming trend.

Why India’s New Right To Disconnect Bill Could Transform Work Culture, Protect Millions From Burnout

Key provisions of the bill

Global pioneers in disconnection rights

France leads with early legislation

Portugal enforces strict boundaries

Italy adapts to flexible work

Australia joins the movement

US lacks legal protections amid rising proposals

India's parliament has seen the introduction of a new bill that grants employees the power to ignore work communications outside official hours. The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life. Employees gain the legal right to switch off from calls, emails, and messages without fear of repercussions from employers.Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule introduced this private member's bill in the Lok Sabha. As a non-ministerial proposal, it focuses on creating an Employees' Welfare Authority to oversee implementation and address violations.The legislation mandates that companies establish clear policies on after-hours contact. Workers can decline responses to non-emergency communications, promoting healthier work-life balance. The proposed authority would investigate complaints, impose fines on non-compliant firms, and educate both sides on rights and responsibilities. Supriya Sule's bill applies to private sector employees, ensuring they disconnect without disciplinary action.Several nations adopted similar measures years before India's proposal.These laws emerged amid rising concerns over burnout and digital overload in modern workplaces. Governments recognised the need to protect workers from incessant demands.France became a trailblazer in 2017 by enacting the Right to Disconnect as part of the El Khomri Labour Law, requiring companies—especially larger ones—to negotiate with unions to ensure employees are not pressured to be online after hours, helping combat digital burnout and protect work-life balance. The law requires firms with over 50 employees to negotiate agreements on out-of-hours communications. Workers disconnect from devices, and employers respect rest periods. This stemmed from labour code reforms addressing 35-hour workweeks and overtime boundaries.Portugal introduced robust protections in 2021 (Law no. 83/2021). Employers face bans on contacting staff outside shifts, with fines up to €9,690 for violations. The law covers remote workers, mandating compensation for home office expenses. It prohibits monitoring tools that invade privacy during off-hours.Italy embedded the right in 2017 smart working laws (Law 81/2017). Companies must outline disconnection periods in contracts for remote employees. Unions negotiate terms, ensuring no penalties for unavailability. This applies to public and private sectors, focusing on work-life harmony.Australia implemented its version in 2024. Employees ignore unreasonable after-hours contacts, with tribunals resolving disputes. Small businesses get exemptions initially, but larger firms comply fully. The law builds on fair work acts, shielding staff from overreach.The United States trails far behind, with no federal, state, or local right to disconnect laws enacted as of December 2025. California led the charge in February 2024 with Assembly Bill 2751, mandating policies for ignoring employer communications during non-working hours, defined by job descriptions or agreements. The measure stalled in committee amid pushback from businesses citing global operations and flexibility needs, though it could resurface. New Jersey followed with a similar 2024 bill for firms with 10-plus staff, but it too faltered. Earlier attempts in New York City and Washington met defeat, leaving workers reliant on voluntary policies.This void amplifies US work culture's intensity. Over 80% of employees report job-related stress, with more than half saying it spills into home life, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Salaried roles often exceed 40 hours without overtime pay, fostering a ""hustle"" mentality where unplugging invites guilt. Tech firms like Google offer perks such as flexible schedules and mental health days, but these vary widely, and many sectors demand round-the-clock responsiveness.","The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life.

IndiGo flight cut doubled to 10%; airline may operate even lesser flights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indigo-flight-cut-doubled-to-10-airline-may-operate-even-lesser-flights/articleshow/125871645.cms,"Photo: X/@RamMNK

As IndiGo Spirals Into Crisis, PM Modi Stresses Rules Must Ease Citizens’ Lives, Not Burden Them

NEW DELHI: There will be a lot less domestic flights this winter as an under fire aviation ministry Tuesday evening decided to slash IndiGo’s schedule by 10% — doubling it from the 5% cut ordered earlier that day. The airline operated over 2,200 daily flights and this cut translates into about 216 less flights. But in reality IndiGo may actually operate an even lesser number of flights at about 1,800-1,900 — meaning about 500 daily cancelations — to keep operations stabilised, say sources.“The ministry considers it necessary to curtail the overall IndiGo routes, which will help in stabilising the airline’s operations and lead to reduced cancellations. A curtailment of 10% has been ordered. While abiding with it, Indigo will continue to cover all its destinations as before,” Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said on X Tuesday evening.IndiGo “CEO Pieter Elbers was summoned to the ministry (Tuesday) to provide an update…. last week, many passengers faced severe inconvenience due to IndiGo’s internal mismanagement of crew rosters, flight schedules and inadequate communication….inquiry and necessary actions are underway,” Naidu added.Earlier in the day, the DGCA’s 5% cut order had stated the airline has “not demonstrated an ability to operate” the its previously approved winter schedule of 15,014 weekly departures “efficiently”. The airline was directed to reduce operations “across sectors, especially on high-demand, high-frequency flights, and to avoid single-flight operations on a sector by IndiGo.”The airline has to submit a revised schedule by 5 pm on Wednesday. IndiGo’s summer schedule was for operating 14,158 weekly domestic flights which was increased 6% in the winter schedule starting Oct 26. This translated into the airline having an approval to operate 64,346 domestic flights in Nov. “As per operational data submitted by IndiGo, it (actually operated) 59,438 flights during Nov 2025, with 951 flight cancellations recorded during the month,” the DGCA notice issued to the airline about flight cuts on Monday night says.The regulator had increased IndiGo’s winter flights based on an estimated higher aircraft availability at 403 against 351 this summer. “However, it has been observed that the airline could operate only 339 aircraft in Oct 2025 and 344 aircraft in Nov 2025… IndiGo increased its departures by 9.66% in comparison to winter schedule 2024 and by 6% in relation to summer schedule 2025. However, the airline has not demonstrated an ability to operate these schedules efficiently,” the DGCA notice says.The problem essentially happened as the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) that increased pilot requirement came into effect from Nov 1. On the one hand IndiGo did not gear up for that and on the other, its daily flights increased 6%. So November saw modest cancellations but the mismatch snowballed into a major crisis in the first week of Dec with hundreds of flights being cancelled daily.Air India and AI Express, on the other hand, saw their weekly domestic schedule being reduced by 0.8% and 6%, respectively from summer to winter schedule. India's second biggest airline group saw its weekly summer domestic flights 7,685 reduce to overall by 3% to 7,448 in winter. Akasa also saw its weekly winter domestic schedule reduce by 5.7% from 1,089 to 1,027. SpiceJet, which is ramping up operations, saw an increase of over 26% with the number increasing from 1,240 to 1,568.Now questions are being asked of aviation authorities why did they permit IndiGo more flights without checking its crew availability under the new FDTL requirement.On its part, IndiGo has attributed the disruption to a “compounding effect of multiple factors which coincided in lesser or greater measure” in an “unfortunate and unforeseeable confluence.” These are: Minor technical glitches; schedule changes linked to the start of the winter season; adverse weather conditions increased congestion in the aviation system, andiImplementation of and operation under the updated crew rostering rules (FDTL phase II) that came into force on Nov 1, 2025.","The airline operated over 2,200 daily flights and this cut translates into about 216 less flights. But in reality IndiGo may actually operate an even lesser number of flights at about 1,800-1,900.

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday posed three questions and 4 demands while accusing the Bharatiya Janta Party and Election Commission of hatching a conspiracy to steal the mandate in the elections.In his address during the electoral reform debate in Lok Sabha, the Congress leader claimed that ""everything in India that exists today has emerged from the vote, and the RSS is trying to capture that.”“Today, the Election Commission of India is colluding with those in power to shape the election,” Rahul said.He asked three questions from the Centre to support his claim.""I want to ask three questions which will make it very clear that the BJP is directing and using the Election Commission to damage India's democracy,"" Rahul said.During the address, Rahul also came up with demands, warning that the Congress will change the law retroactively.""They (the election commissioners) are under impression that this law will allow them to get away but that is not the case as we will change the law and do it retroactively,"" the former Congress president said.He also asserted that India is not just the biggest democracy but the greatest democracy.During the address, Rahul said that there is ""institutional capture"" of the EC that directly ""controls the election system of our country"".""I have given proof of how EC is colluding with those in power to shape elections,"" Rahul Gandhi said.Accusing the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of capturing the institutions of the nation, Rahul Gandhi said: ""The project of the RSS was to capture the institutional framework of the country... Vice-chancellor after vice-chancellor is placed not on merit, not on capability, not on scientific temper, but on the fact that he belongs to a particular organisation.""He futher said: ""Second capture, which helps in destroying democracy. The capture of the intelligence agencies. The capture of the CBI, of the ED, of the Income Tax Department. And the systematic placement of bureaucrats who favour their ideology and attack the opposition and anybody who chooses to oppose the RSS.""Meanwhile, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey attacked the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha and accused the past Congress governments of ""tearing the Constitution apart.""""'Aaye the Hari bhajan ko, lekin oṭhan lage kapaas, Khoda pahad nikli chuhiya'. This is the same Congress that stood on the pyres of martyrs, the Congress that divided India. And today, after Rahul Gandhi’s statements, I could see them trembling and confused. They were suddenly talking about the Constitution. I have brought with me the entire debate from 1976—how Congress tore the Constitution apart, they have no answer to this,"" Nishikant Dubey said.""Congress has tarnished the Constitution of India; Indira Gandhi won Raebareli by ‘vote chori’ (vote theft).

'No Link To Bengal': Amit Shah's Fiery Speech on Vande Mataram, Blames Nehru, Indira of Sabotage

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday was seen having a meal with his parliament colleagues in the Parliament canteen.Shah was joined by Union MoS Nityanand Rai, Union minsiter Kiren Rijiju and BJP MP Anil Baluni.In the clip, the leaders could be seen having Indian cuisine over some seemingly light-hearted discussion.Earlier in the day, initiating the debate in Rajya Sabha, Amit Shah said the division of ' Vande Mataram ' song for ""politics of appeasement"" led to partition of India.He slammed Opposition for linking the debate on 150 years of the national song with the upcoming West Bengal elections.Shah said Vande Mataram was the ""mantra"" that awakened India's cultural nationalism, and remains as relevant today as it was during the freedom struggle.He stressed that the song will remain relevant in the days to come as well, in taking the country towards Viksit Bharat.Shah also attacked Congress for questioning the need for a debate on Vande Mataram, and accused first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru of ""dividing"" the poem and limiting it to two stanzas.""Yesterday some MPs in the Lok Sabha questioned what is the need to discuss Vande Mataram. The need for discussion...wasas relevant when the song was written, during the freedom movement, today, and will be as relevant in 2047 when the Viksit Bharat would be achieved,"" Shah said.""Some people are saying Vande Mataram is being discussed because elections are coming in West Bengal... They are trying to reduce the importance of Vande Mataram by linking it with Bengal elections,"" he said.The home minister urged members to take the spirit of the message of Vande Mataram to the youth of the nation.He said the song was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in Bengal, but it spread across the nation, and became the chant for India's freedom struggle.The home minister said the song was written years after India tolerated ""Islamic attacks"", and the British tried to impose a new culture on the country.","Union home minister Amit Shah was seen having a meal with his parliament colleagues in the Parliament canteen.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said there's no bigger anti-national act than ""vote chori"" which harms the fabric of the nation.During the debate in the Lower House on the Special Intensive Revision, Rahul Gandhi, reiterating his claim of ""rigged"" elections, asserted the Election Commission of India (ECI) is ""colluding"" with the BJP to conduct polls across the nation.""The biggest anti-national act you can do is vote 'chori'; when you destroy the vote, you destroy the idea of India. Those across the aisle are doing an anti-national act by committing vote 'chori',"" Rahul Gandhi said, targeting the BJP-led ruling NDA.""I want to ask three questions which will make it very clear that the BJP is directing and using the Election Commission to damage India's democracy. The first question, why is it that the CJI was removed from the selection panel of the Election Commissioner?... Why is he not in that room? I sit in that room. It is so-called a democratic decision. On one side, PM Modi and HM Amit Shah. On the other side, the leader of the opposition. I have no voice in that room. What they decide is what happens. So the first question, why is the Prime Minister and Amit Shah so keen on choosing exactly who the election commissioner is going to be?"" asked Rahul Gandhi.He said there is ""institutional capture"" of the EC that directly ""controls the election system of our country"".""I have given proof of how EC is colluding with those in power to shape elections,"" Rahul Gandhi said.Accusing the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of capturing the institutions of the nation, Rahul Gandhi said: ""The project of the RSS was to capture the institutional framework of the country... Vice-chancellor after vice-chancellor is placed not on merit, not on capability, not on scientific temper, but on the fact that he belongs to a particular organisation.""He futher said: ""Second capture, which helps in destroying democracy. The capture of the intelligence agencies. The capture of the CBI, of the ED, of the Income Tax Department. And the systematic placement of bureaucrats who favour their ideology and attack the opposition and anybody who chooses to oppose the RSS.""","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said there's no bigger anti-national act than ""vote chori"" Gandhi said the Election Commission of India (ECI) is ""colluding"" with the BJP to conduct polls across the nation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125868488,imgsize-39256,width-400,resizemode-4/gandhi-in-ls.jpg"

'Nonchalant, Lackadaisical Attitude': Ex-AirAsia CFO Breaks Down Indigo Fiasco

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday expressed concern over the chaos caused by IndiGo 's widespread flight cancellations across major airports in the country, saying ""rules and laws are in order to correct the system and not to harass the people.""Speaking to reporters after the NDA Parliamentary Party meeting, the Union parliamentary and minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said, ""during the NDA parliamentary meeting the Prime Minister told NDA MPs that people should not be troubled and face inconvenience.""""Rules and laws are good but in order to correct the system it is not right to harass people,"" he added.Rijiju further said that PM Modi urged MPs to focus on reforms that make life easier for citizens and ensure people do not face unnecessary hardship from the government.The prime minister's remarks come amid IndiGo’s operational crisis that led to the cancellation of over 1200 flights across major airports, leaving thousands of passengers stranded nationwide.The crisis comes from the rollout of revised Flight Duty Time Limit (FDTL) norms, which mandate longer weekly rest for pilots, stricter night-duty limits and fewer night landings.Airlines, including IndiGo and Air India, had initially opposed the rules, but they were implemented in phases in July and November following Delhi High Court directions.IndiGo has now secured temporary relaxations in the second phase of the norms until February 10.According to the civil aviation ministry, between November 21 and December 7, a total of 9,55,591 PNRs were cancelled and refunded, amounting to Rs 827 crore in refunds. Of the 9,000 delayed bags, around 4,500 have been delivered, while the rest are expected to be returned within 36 hours.Rijiju further asserted that the PM also used the NDA meeting to urge MPs to prioritise reforms and connect with the youth. ""All NDA leaders congratulated PM Modi for the NDA's victory in the Bihar elections. PM Modi guided all the NDA MPs to work for their respective constituencies. The PM emphasised undertaking reforms across all sectors to ease the public's lives and ensure they face no problems,"" he said.""The PM said that laws should help people. He also urged the MPs to connect with the youth. I express my gratitude to the PM for this guidance. It was a very good meeting of the NDA parliamentary party,"" he added.The Union minister further stated that the government intends to counter the Opposition's claims during Lok Sabha discussions on election reforms today.""Today, Lok Sabha will discuss election reform. Opposition will speak. The government will also clear the delusion that has been created. The government will clarify the wrong narrative being set regarding people's trust and their participation in election processes,"" he said.",PM Narendra Modi expressed concern over the chaos caused by IndiGo's widespread flight cancellations across major airports in the country.

Centre pushes PPP medical colleges nationwide; 11 projects get nod under new funding model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-pushes-ppp-medical-colleges-nationwide-11-projects-get-nod-under-new-funding-model/articleshow/125825350.cms,"Representative image (ANI Photo)

NEW DELHI: India’s push to expand medical education into underserved districts has entered a new phase, with the Centre revealing in the Lok Sabha that 11 new medical colleges have received in-principle approval under a Public–Private Partnership ( PPP ) model. These colleges will come up by upgrading district hospitals — a shift in strategy aimed at accelerating MBBS seat creation without waiting for full government-backed infrastructure.The projects cleared so far are spread across Jharkhand (Giridih, Dhanbad, Jamtara, Khunti), Arunachal Pradesh (Namsai) and Uttar Pradesh (Baghpat, Mainpuri, Hathras, Kasganj, Mahoba, Hamirpur).The government explained that the model will rely on Viability Gap Funding (VGF) — a financial support mechanism designed to make socially important but commercially unviable projects feasible for private partners. Under the scheme, the Centre may fund up to 30% of the project cost, with states allowed to match this amount. For pilot projects, support can go up to 40% of the cost, plus 25% of operations-and-maintenance expenses for the first five years.In return, States must allow full and free access to district hospital facilities for the attached medical colleges and must provide land on concessional terms — conditions aimed at ensuring that medical education does not dilute public-hospital services.The Lok Sabha reply also stressed that faculty norms, curriculum rules, equipment standards and staffing requirements will remain under the National Medical Commission’s Minimum Standard Requirement (MSR) Regulations, ensuring that PPP colleges follow the same quality benchmarks as government medical colleges.Alongside the PPP push, the government also confirmed that the existing Centrally Sponsored Scheme for upgrading district hospitals into government medical colleges has already sanctioned all 157 planned institutions, including 14 in Madhya Pradesh and two in Maharashtra.While the PPP model is still at an early stage, the approval of 11 projects signals the Centre’s intent to create a parallel pathway for strengthening medical infrastructure, especially in districts that have historically lacked teaching hospitals.The next challenge lies in execution — from faculty recruitment to readiness of hospital facilities — but policymakers say the new structure opens a crucial opportunity to expand medical education faster, in areas that need it most.",India’s push to expand medical education into underserved districts has entered a new phase. 11 new medical colleges have received in-principle approval under a Public–Private Partnership ( PPP ) model.

Partition result of dividing Vande Mataram: Amit Shah

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah asserted Tuesday that had Congress not ""divided"" Vande Mataram , India would not have been partitioned as its concession to the Muslim League over the song in 1937 started the politics of appeasement, which finally led to the country's division.Initiating the discussion in Rajya Sabha on Vande Mataram's 150th anniversary, Shah articulated a muscular concept of cultural nationalism, a founding tenet of BJP and the larger Sangh Parivar, and said Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's composition affirmed the ancient civilisational glory and tradition of worshipping the motherland that suffered from Islamic invasions and British rule.Shah slammed the opposition for belittling Vande Mataram by statements that the discussion was a way to divert attention from pressing issues and gain traction ahead of elections in Bengal.Home minister Amit Shah said it was fitting to pay respect to a song that had stirred patriots for generations and those thinking otherwise needed to revisit their understanding.""For us, India has not just been a geographical entity. We believe it to be a cultural space and treat it as our mother. Lord Ram and Adi Sankara believed in this, and this was what Bankim babu espoused in Vande Mataram,"" Shah said in an apparent refutation of critics of the song's evocation of Goddesses Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati as marked idolatry and their refusal to sing it.""We do not fear discussing issues. We do not boycott Parliament. If Parliament is not boycotted and allowed to function, then discussion on all issues will take place. We don't have anything to hide,"" he said, noting that when the song completed its 100th anniversary, the country was in the grip of Emergency. Those singing Vande Mataram were jailed, he said.""Look at the situation of Congress, which used to start its sessions with Vande Mataram. But when the debate started in Lok Sabha, both members of the Gandhi family were missing. The opposition to Vande Mataram is in the blood of Congress leadership, from Jawaharlal Nehru to the present-day Congress brass,"" Shah said in a pointed criticism of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.Shah accused many opposition leaders of not according respect to Vande Mataram and submitted a list to the Rajya Sabha chairman after Congress MP Jairam Ramesh asked him to back his claim. A BJP member will never do this, he added. He said it was only after a proposal by BJP MP Ram Naik that Vande Mataram started being sung in Parliament.Shah said the song became the chant of the freedom struggle despite British attempts to ban it. ""Even though the (British) govt tried to ban it, and people were beaten and jailed for chanting Vande Mataram, it touched people's hearts and spread from Kashmir to Kanyakumari,"" he said, recalling Aurobindo who called it the ""mantra"" of India's awakening.Targeting Congress and Nehru, Shah said the song was divided on its 50th anniversary in 1937. ""That is where appeasement politics started. Many like me believe if Vande Mataram was not divided into two for appeasement politics, India would also not have been partitioned,"" he added.","Home Minister Amit Shah said Congress's decision to divide Vande Mataram in 1937, as a concession to the Muslim League, initiated appeasement politics that ultimately led to India's partition.

'Will Set An Example': IndiGo Faces Heat As Aviation Minister Promises Tough Action In Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: Uncertainty shrouds holiday plans of lakhs of domestic flyers this winter. India's biggest airline, IndiGo, will cut anywhere between 200 and 400 flights daily for the foreseeable future.Which means, don't be surprised if the flight you booked to Goa and back this Yuletide are cancelled.

Ever since IndiGo crisis happened, our aircraft occupancies have gone through the roof. Also for a short term no one can add capacity just like that. If govt says they are uncomfortable with a single airline having 60% plus domestic market share and are capping the same, we can increase capacity. Otherwise, who will add capacity and be faced with a growing giant,"" said a top executive of another Indian carrier. Govt may permit short term wet leases - something IndiGo has availed off - but finding aircraft at such short notice is not easy, said airline executives.The situation has left holidayers nervous. Multiple people said they have bookings on IndiGo this winter. ""Aviation ministry is in full damage-control mode for themselves. But the uncertainty they have left us with is not funny.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Tuesday asked Election Commission to respond to a PIL questioning its decision to exempt Assam voters from giving documentary proof along with enumeration forms during SIR - which was mandatory in other states - even though the northeastern state has a large population of illegal Bangladeshi migrants.Appearing for petitioner Mrinal K Choudhury, senior advocate Vijay Hansaria told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that EC, in its Nov 17 notification, had said Assam's electoral rolls were being revised without requirement of any documents or enumeration forms, contrary to the procedure adopted for the pan-India special intensive revision of rolls.SC said it would seek EC's response on why such an exception was made for Assam and what the circumstances requiring such exemptions were. It asked the poll panel to file its response by Dec 16, the next date of hearing.The petitioner said, ""EC in an arbitrary manner directed that electoral roll for Assam will be revised only by way of Special Revision and not by way of SIR even though there is no difference in the ground realities between Assam and 12 other states where SIR is being conducted.""On another PIL seeking interim inclusion of people from minority communities, who were persecuted in neighbouring countries and entered India under Citizenship (Amendment) Act, on the voters' list of West Bengal, the bench said the question of right to vote would arise only after they were accorded citizenship.Senior advocate Karuna Nundy said the applications had been pending for a long time and if they were not decided expeditiously, these people, estimated to be 50,000, would lose out on voting in the Bengal assembly elections. The bench said it would not be legal to grant any interim right to vote.

Donald Trump's rice tariffs threat unlikely to have severe impact on exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/donald-trumps-rice-tariffs-threat-unlikely-to-have-severe-impact-on-exports/articleshow/125877171.cms,"Why Trump Accuses India Of Dumping Rice And What A New Tariff Shock Could Mean For Trade Relations

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's latest threat to impose fresh tariffs on rice is unlikely to have a severe impact on Indian exports.""India exported $392 million worth of rice to the US in FY2025, just 3% of its global rice exports, and already faces tariffs of about 53% in the US market; 86% of these shipments are premium basmati. New duties would scarcely dent Indian exporters, who have strong markets elsewhere, but would make rice costlier for American households,"" said trade research body GTRI.A bulk of the 6 million tonne exported to the US may be headed to kitchens of Indian-origin Americans or those on visas. The only substitute for basmati rice can be from Pakistan but the quantities are much lower. Overall, a bulk of India's rice exports consists of non-basmati rice.Trump's latest threat comes amid a team from the US visiting India with talks on the much-delayed trade deal scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday. While the agenda for the latest discussions were not immediately known, the visit was a surprise as govt officials had earlier said most issues had been sorted out and last-mile talks were expected. News about the US delegation's trip came ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to India.While Trump has taken unilateral measures on trade since returning to office, India's rice exports are not seen as ""dumping"" as claimed by the US president, who is not seen as someone who always sticks to facts. Given volumes, neither are rice exports causing harm to domestic market, nor are they subsidised. As a result, it is seen as a pressure tactic amid talks for a bilateral deal.India and the US had launched negotiations for a trade deal in Feb and hoped to close talks by Sept-Oct. But with govt refusing to agree to Trump's demand for reducing levies on food and GM crops, the US hit back with 25% reciprocal tariffs and another 25% secondary tariffs, citing India's purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment. In the first phase, which govt is hoping can be clinched by the month-end, India expects the secondary tariffs to be lifted while also seeking concessions on reciprocal tariffs.Trump, in the same event, also threatened high tariff on agriculture imports from Canada and other countries.","US President Donald Trump's latest threat to impose fresh tariffs on rice is unlikely to have a severe impact on Indian exports.

This engagement follows President Putin's visit and precedes the India-EU summit. Discussions will focus on trade, technology, and sustainable development, building on existing partnerships. Germany's support for Ukraine and shared concerns over the Indo-Pacific will also be key topics.

Russian President Putin Praises India’s Unity in Diversity, Calls It A Blueprint For Big Nations

NEW DELHI: After hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin, India is stepping up its engagement with Europe that has rallied behind Ukraine amidst US-led efforts to end the war. Ahead of the India-EU summit scheduled for January 27, India will host German Chancellor Friedrich Merz for his first visit to the country after assuming office.Merz is expected to visit India in the third week of January for a summit with PM Narendra Modi. The visit will be an important opportunity for the leaders to review progress and build upon the momentum in the relationship across areas like trade, technology, innovation, migration and mobility, green and sustainable development, along with defence and security.The leaders had earlier met on the margins of the G7 summit in Canada where they agreed to diversify the strategic partnership and Modi thanked the chancellor for backing India’s actions in the fight against terrorism. He had also then invited Merz to visit India.Germany is also an important partner for India in maintaining a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific, as Berlin sees China's increasingly aggressive behavior in the Indo-Pacific as a cause of concern for both countries. Merz’s visit will of course be observed closely for the messaging by both leaders on the Russia-Ukraine war.As Europe’s leading economic power, Germany has been relentless in its support for Ukraine, in the form of both military and non-military aid.Merz was quoted as saying this week, after discussions with other European leaders over the US-led peace plan, that European support for Ukraine will remain strong “because we all know that the destiny of this country is the destiny of Europe.” Germany, however, has avoided hectoring India on the latter’s ties with Russia even though it believes Indo-Pacific security is closely linked to security in Europe.With the India-EU summit set to take place next month, and important outcomes like a free trade agreement and defence and security partnership being worked upon, the Europeans had been worried that the outcomes of the Modi-Putin could create misunderstandings between the 2 sides. It was reassuring for them eventually that the focus during Putin’s visit, as the Indian side repeatedly stressed, was mostly on economic cooperation.On the bilateral front, India and Germany 2 countries held the latest round of negotiations on development cooperation, reaffirming their strong and future-oriented partnership under the Green and Sustainable Development Partnership (GSDP). According to a statement by the German embassy, Germany announced new commitments amounting to almost EUR 1.3 billion, primarily in the form of concessional loans, across the key areas of climate and energy, sustainable urban development, green urban mobility, and sustainable management of natural resources.“In addition, bilateral cooperation in the skills development sector, in particular, renewable energy will be strengthened. These commitments underline Germany’s long-term partnership with India in advancing ambitious climate action, low-carbon growth, and inclusive development,” it said.","German Chancellor Friedrich Merz set to visit New Delhi soon. This engagement follows President Putin's visit and precedes the India-EU summit. Discussions will focus on trade, technology, and sustainable development. Germany's support for Ukraine and shared concerns over the Indo-Pacific will also be key topics.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125877113,imgsize-512773,width-400,resizemode-4/125877113.jpg"

CAFE 3 showdown: Carmakers clash as Maruti–Toyota push for new 'mini-car' category for availing emissions leniency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cafe-3-showdown-carmakers-clash-as-marutitoyota-push-for-new-mini-car-category-for-availing-emissions-leniency/articleshow/125875077.cms,"NEW DELHI: It’s a straight fight between the Japanese power duo of Maruti Suzuki-Toyota who are pitted against the might of the rest of the car industry over the soon-to-be-announced CAFE 3 emission norms.A large section of India’s car industry huddled in a meeting with Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday, sans Maruti, Toyota Kirloskar, and French Renault, as they “complained” about the aggressive charge spearheaded by the Japanese companies to push for creation of an all-new mini car category that will have vehicles under the weight of 909 kgs.The hush-hush meeting with Gadkari, late on Monday evening, was attended by a bevy of Indian and multinational carmakers that included local heavyweights Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, apart from the Korean siblings Hyundai and Kia, as well as JSW MG Motor.Ahead of the announcement of a final regulation on the new CAFE3 emission norms that will lay the roadmap for industry emissions from April 2027, the companies are “worried” that creation of a new light-weight mini segment — where 95% of vehicles are from the Maruti stable — will lead to having “architecturally unsafe cars” on the Indian roads while also disrupting their investment and new products plans, sources in the know told TOI.“This will be an aberration and will lead to creation of a completely unsafe car category as none of the existing vehicles in this so-called light-weight category have received adequate safety ratings by global agencies. Also, what is the logic of giving an easier emission target to this special category which unfairly benefits only one particular company,” the company representatives said in the meeting with Gadkari.Questions sent to Maruti Suzuki did not elicit a response.The joint representation of the companies said that any change in India’s vehicle classification rules, especially based on weight, will only end up disturbing their product and investment plans. “Our investment plans will be disrupted if the govt creates a new mini category on the lines of weight of a vehicle against the currently well-defined vehicle class of small cars,” the companies told the Minister.Currently, the lowest rung in car classification is made of “small cars” which are vehicles that are under 4 meters in length and have petrol engines below 1200cc and diesel under 1500cc. “This is the classification which is also used for GST purposes, and we are building our investments and plans based on this. What is the need for creating an all-new ‘random’ light-weight category of 909 kgs and below which doesn’t exist anywhere else across the world. ”The Minister told the companies to submit a representation on the matter even as the players have approached other ministries, including the Ministry of Heavy Industries, as well as the Ministry of Power.",A large section of India’s car industry huddled in a meeting with Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday.

Rising combined wealth and how their earnings continue to expand each year

Properties, assets and lifestyle choices that continue drawing attention

The growing interest around John Cena and Shay Shariatzadeh’s financial journey has intensified in 2025 as new reports highlight their rising net worth, expanding properties, and steadily increasing earnings, creating wider curiosity about how their individual careers continue shaping their shared financial path. Together, their lifestyle reflects a balance between high earnings, stable investments, and carefully chosen luxury, allowing them to maintain comfort without relying on constant public display or extravagant change. Let’s take a look at where the power couple stands today.Fresh evaluations for 2025 suggest that John Cena holds a personal net worth close to $80 million, supported by his long wrestling career, expanding Hollywood roles and multiple commercial partnerships that continue generating consistent income for him across different categories of the entertainment industry.Shay Shariatzadeh contributes an estimated $2 million, which comes from her engineering work, strategic career moves, and selective investments that reflect a steady approach rather than a public lifestyle focused on expensive displays or high-profile spending choices.Together, their combined worth reaches nearly $82 million, showing how their financial paths complement one another through two very different professional worlds that still manage to work in harmony.Cena’s earnings remain anchored by an annual WWE salary reportedly around $8.5 million, supported by bonuses linked to special appearances and merchandise sales that continue performing strongly across global markets due to his long-standing popularity.John Cena’s well-known Florida property, purchased many years ago for roughly $525,000, has grown significantly in value and now sits near $4 million, featuring spacious interiors, multiple recreational spaces and design upgrades that reflect his preference for calm surroundings rather than extravagant display.The home includes an indoor pool, outdoor pool, cigar room, extended garage, and a guest area, allowing him a private retreat while balancing entertainment commitments and travel schedules across Hollywood and wrestling venues. Cena also owns a residence in San Diego valued within the high-end category, although he maintains a low-key approach toward detailing the property publicly, which matches the couple’s gradually shifting preference for privacy.Shay Shariatzadeh, while less public about real estate, aligns her lifestyle with practical investments and career growth, showing a contrast to Cena’s entertainment-driven earnings but still contributing meaningfully to their shared financial foundation through consistent professional progress.Also Read: John Cena to still be affiliated with WWE after retirement?

Tirumala dupatta scam: Those ‘silk’ may just be plain polyester; TTD flags decade-long fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/tirumala-dupatta-scam-those-silk-dupattas-may-just-be-plain-polyester-ttd-flags-decade-long-fraud/articleshow/125879889.cms,"TIRUPATI: As if the laddu controversy and the Parakamani case were not enough, the trust running the famed Tirumala temple has now alleged that it was duped of crores of rupees by a firm that sold silk dupattas to it over the past decade. Instead of pure mulberry silk, the firm allegedly sold to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) 100% polyester dupattas from 2015 to 2025.The board has referred the 'dupatta scam' case to the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB), asking it to identify those behind the alleged fraud. A copy of the TTD board resolution, which explicitly describes the details of the alleged scam is with TOI.TTD presents silk dupattas to donors and other devotees during the Vedasirvachanam at the Ranganayakula Mandapam during the VIP break darshan slot inside the Tirumala temple. Donors and those who purchaw VIP break darshan tickets are felicitated by priests here. The authorities procure large quantities of the dupattas worth several crores from time to time.The alleged scam unfolded when the TTD, headed by chairman BR Naidu, directed its vigilance and security wing to examine if the dupattas met tender specifications. The norms state that the dupattas must be woven entirely from pure mulberry silk using 20/22 denier yarn in both warp and weft, with a resultant minimum count of 31.5 denier.Each piece must display 'Om Namo Venkatesaya' in Sanskrit on one side and in Telugu on the other, alongside symbols of Sanku, Chakra, and Namam. Size, weight, and border design are also specifically defined.Based on the findings of the vigilance wing, it has become clear that the tenderer defrauded the temple trust by supplying cheaper polyester material. The trust board passed a resolution to request the director general of the ACB to carry out a detailed investigation and initiate criminal action against everyone involved in the scam,” BR Naidu stated.Vigilance officials collected samples from fresh stocks at the warehouse in Tirupati and another from approved stocks at the Vaibhavotsava Mandapam (a venue where spiritual events takes place) in Tirumala. These dupattas were supplied by a single firm, VRS Export of Nagari, which has been providing various categories of cloth to TTD for years. The samples were sent for scientific analysis to the Central Silk Board (CSB) laboratories in Bengaluru and Dharmavaram town.TTD board resolution backed by the Vigilance reports showed that the test results exposed a clear violation, as both laboratories confirmed that the material was polyester. Vigilance officers noted that the mandatory silk hologram was missing in all samples. The enquiry further revealed that TTD had already awarded a contract to the same firm for another 15,000 dupattas at around Rs 1,389 per piece. The firm and its sister concerns together supplied cloth worth nearly Rs 54.95 crore between 2015 and 2025.",The board has referred the 'dupatta scam' case to the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) The firm allegedly sold to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) 100% polyester dupattas from 2015 to 2025.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125879976,imgsize-1333797,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/trust-unearths-new-scam.jpg"

MUMBAI: More than 2.6 lakh passengers were directly affected at Mumbai airport last week as IndiGo's operations went into sustained disruption, with 905 cancellations and 1,475 delays of over 30 minutes recorded between Dec 1 and 8, according to the ministry of civil aviation.""IndiGo now informs passengers about potential cancellations at least six hours before the scheduled departure time,"" said Madhu Sudan Shankar, joint secretary, ministry of civil aviation, speaking to the media at Mumbai airport.A week after the turbulence left lakhs of IndiGo passengers stranded in airports across India, the ministry of civil aviation ordered senior officers to inspect 10 major airports, including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune, Guwahati, Goa and Thiruvananthapuram. Early on Tuesday, the officials landed at these airports to carry out surprise audits.IndiGo had 3,171 scheduled movements or flights planned from Mumbai during the eight-day period but managed to operate only 2,266 flights, with the sharpest deterioration seen on Dec 4 and 5, said the ministry. The cancellations escalated from 14 on Dec 1 to 295 on Dec 5 before easing through the weekend. Delay figures also remained elevated, peaking at 281 on Dec 3.Aviation officials said the operational strain created a cascading impact across terminals as flight disruptions piled up through the week. Around 780 check-in bags belonging to passengers of cancelled flights were pending delivery; the official said 90% of these will be delivered by Wednesday to passengers' addresses.Passenger impact was substantial. A total of 40,789 travellers were hit by cancellations and 2,66,567 by delayed departures from Mumbai, the data showed.

William Karlsson’s NHL salary foundation and career growth

Emily Ferguson’s transition from television to media entrepreneurship

A growing shared fortune

One of the biggest pro sports and media power couples is William Karlsson and Emily Ferguson. Karlsson amassed his fortune over a long and fruitful NHL career, and Ferguson gathered all the fame from reality television into a durable and profitable digital empire. As a whole, the total wealth comes from player contracts, sponsorship contracts, and long-term brand partnerships. Working together exemplifies the way athletic stardom and media entrepreneurship help to mutually reinforce and broaden financial horizons.Their financial success continues to grow, fueled by Karlsson’s secure NHL earnings and Ferguson’s established influencer profile. With both maintaining strong visibility, the couple’s net worth reflects a dynamic and diversified income portfolio.The main source of Karlsson's fortune comes from his long-running NHL career that became stronger after the season in which Karlsson was alone at the top with the Vegas Golden Knights. He was rewarded with a league-wide recognition for his 43-goal campaign and shortly afterwards, he signed an eight-year, US$47.2 million contract, with a yearly average of almost US$5.9 million. This deal gives him financial security through the end of the 2026–27 season, which, together with his current income, represents the basis of his long-term earnings.Karlsson not only gets his base salary but also postseason compensation, performance bonuses, and probably endorsement deals arising from being a championship-quality player. Winning the 2023 Stanley Cup with the Golden Knights only enhanced Taylor's marketability, indirectly benefiting his long-term financial value. Given that you know he is going to be consistent on the ice, he is likely going to be earning big paychecks for the rest of his contract.Ferguson cultivated her own successful career after appearing on major reality television franchises, using that initial visibility to establish a strong social media following. Her platform now supports brand partnerships, lifestyle collaborations, sponsored content, and ongoing influencer marketing opportunities. While precise income figures are not publicly released, influencer revenue at her scale commonly produces substantial annual earnings.Balancing motherhood with a steady online presence, she continues to maintain audience engagement, which fuels recurring partnership deals. Her role in the public eye complements Karlsson’s athletic profile, creating a combined brand appeal that enhances opportunities for both.The streams of income through Karlsson and Ferguson, when combined, present a very stable and growing financial picture. The NHL contract exceeds US $47 million, while influencer revenue earns them a significant supplemental income bucket, bringing the couple's net worth comfortably into the multimillions. In the meantime, the couple will remain well-placed for added household benefit with Karlsson's career still taking its course along with Ferguson's media job on the rise, arguably, over the coming years.Also Read: Phillip Danault trade rumors: Elliotte Friedman weighs in on LA Kings center amid slow NHL season","William Karlsson and Emily Ferguson are one of the biggest pro sports and media power couples.

Goa Nightclub Owners: 'Gold medallist engineer' Rise & rise of Luthra brothers eclipsed by Goa nightclub tragedy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/rise-rise-of-luthra-brothers-eclipsed-by-tragedy/articleshow/125842730.cms,"Also See:

NEW DELHI: Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra would fondly recount their journey, which began about a decade ago, from Delhi's Hudson Lane with Mama's Buoi — a casual, youthful space that found steady popularity among college-goers.But it was Romeo Lane that changed everything for the brothers. Initially a modest success in Delhi's Civil Lines, the brand transformed dramatically when it opened in Goa's Vagator during the post-Covid tourism revival.Flaunting sweeping sea views, Vagator's Romeo Lane quickly became a magnet for travellers. Loud, unapologetic Bollywood nights, fire performers lighting up the cliffs, dance acts and an open-air setting made it the place to party at. Romeo Lane stood out for its scale, spectacle and Indian flavour in an increasingly competitive Goa nightlife ecosystem.Word spread in industry circles that a Romeo Lane outlet anywhere could draw massive footfall. Soon, Saurabh, who describes himself as a ‘gold medallist engineer', was the most sought-after restaurateur. Every new mall — from Indore, Nagpur, Agra to Dehradun — wanted a Romeo Lane as its anchor nightlife destination.Developers were willing to cover construction costs and offer the most favourable rental deals to house the brand. Franchisees, eager to cash in, reportedly paid hefty fees for the brand name and agreed to monthly royalties. The contracts were strict. Only approved vendors could be used for construction and interiors.As Romeo Lane expanded at breakneck speed, the brothers launched Birch by Romeo Lane to cater to places where the original couldn't open due to territorial restrictions. They also added Caha to their portfolio. The group has over 25 operational outlets across India and one in Dubai, with nearly 25 more reportedly in the pipeline. Few hospitality brands in India had grown this quickly.The Luthra family is defined by a tight-knit business partnership between the brothers and a shared history in Delhi. At the heart of the family is their father, Vijay Luthra, who is paralysed, a family friend said. The brothers have shares in or are linked to several restaurants and pubs in the capital, sources said.For about 15 years, the family maintained their residential base at Mukherjee Nagar's Outram Lines — a foundation that preceded the brothers' venture into the high-profile hospitality sector. Their corporate headquarters are now in Model Town.Gaurav, also an engineer, is described as the more calculative and calmer partner, handling accounts and operations for their enterprise, GS Foods Studio Pvt Ltd. Saurabh is reportedly the more aggressive and creative force as well as the face of the Romeo Lane brand.But the speedy growth came with cracks. While some franchisees thrived, others barely met promised sales, and a few slipped into losses. Several investors complained they had not met either of the brothers for months, despite assurances of operational support. Many said they were left to fend for themselves after paying hefty franchise fees. Investors chased consultants, but to no avail.Restaurateurs observing the situation from a distance say while the brothers built a powerful and aspirational brand, the rush to expand cost them the focus needed for day-to-day oversight.Then came the tragedy in Goa's Arpora — one which has shaken the brand, the industry and the state's tourism season. Local panchayat authorities flagged numerous violations at what the brothers branded as ‘India's first island bar'. Voices in the industry ask why these concerns were never raised while the outlet was running since March 2024. Nothing in Goa, they say, operates without the consent of the panchayats. Others wonder why everyone is speaking up only after the tragedy has struck.The consensus among the restaurateurs and vendors is clear: The Luthra brothers must come forward, surrender and extend every possible support to the families of the deceased. While Saurabh has posted his apology on his social media account, the industry says the brothers must do so in person and explain how they were operating an outlet that had nearly no safety clearances and clarify who allowed a kitchen to be housed in the basement.Some franchise partners said that they might drop the Romeo Lane name altogether and run the outlets themselves.The brand known for spawning one vibrant party place after another in quick succession now stares at an uncertain future.",Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra launched Romeo Lane in Delhi's Civil Lines.

Where Metaverse budget cuts may go

Wall Street says: We are with you on this

Meta reportedly delays MR glasses

The day Facebook changed its name to Meta





Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to have finally realised that one of the company's biggest bets—Metaverse—is not working (or not working as expected). It is also the technology that the company changed its very name after. In 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus changed its name to Meta. Now according to a report from Bloomberg, Meta is likely to slash its Reality Labs budget, shaving off as much as 30%. The proposed metaverse cuts are reportedly part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound in Hawaii last month.For those unaware, Metaverse unit works on virtual reality headsets and a VR-based social network, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community.Analysts see the move reflecting the overall lack of interest in products like Meta’s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware—both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse vision has posted more than $70 billion in losses over the past four years. Little doubt then that Facebook parent's shares rose 4% as the move eased some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars. ""Smart move, just late,"" told Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber to Bloomberg. He added, ""This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought years ago. ""So, what may really be troubling Metaverse? No one can really pinpoint. But as a report in Fortune says, for many people, the problem is that the value proposition is unclear; Metaverse simply doesn’t yet deliver a must-have reason to ditch their smartphones or laptops.Reality Labs is made up of a Metaverse unit and a wearables unit. Within the Metaverse unit, executives are reportedly considering making cuts to VR jobs. As the report says, cuts in resources that high are most likely to include layoffs as early as January.The report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta has committed as much as $72 billion in capital spending this year. The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, with Zuckerberg said to be personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp with million-dollar pay packages. In fact, Meta's big hiring is said to have triggered a talent war in the Silicon Valley.Last month, Meta Platforms said that it will invest $600 billion in the US infrastructure and jobs over the next three years, including artificial intelligence data centers. Meta has doubled down on AI, with a target of achieving superintelligence. Zuckerberg said Meta is building compute because ""it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load capacity so we're prepared for the most optimistic cases,"" on the company's recent earnings call. Meta has forecast ""notably larger"" capital expenses next year thanks to investments in artificial intelligence, including aggressively building data centers to power its AI push.Incidentally, earlier this week, Zuckerberg announced that Alan Dye, a longtime designer at Apple, is joining Meta to lead a new creative studio inside the Reality Labs division that would focus on design, fashion and technology. Dye will report to Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, who leads Reality Labs. “We’re entering a new era where A.I. glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post to Threads. “With this new studio, we’re focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.”Wall Street sent a clear signal to Meta Platforms that it wants the company to reduce spending on Reality Labs. Wall Street is sending a clear signal to Meta Platforms that it wants the company to reduce spending on Reality Labs. Meta Platforms shares jumped 3.4% on reports that the company was cutting Metaverse spending in favor of AI and smart glasses.Meta has reportedly delayed the launch of its Mixed Reality Glasses (MR Glasses) from the second half of 2026 to the first half of 2027. According to a report in Business Insider, Meta executives announced the delay after meetings with CEO Mark Zuckerberg is said to have told the team to take more time to make the business sustainable and deliver higher quality experiences. The company’s Metaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns reportedly told team that the delay is “going to give us a lot more breathing room to get the details right. ”Facebook already sells VR headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says GAIN act will hurt America 'most'





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again shared a word of caution of America. Recently, Huang cautioned that America’s slow place of infrastructure development cloud hinder the ability of the country to keep up in the global race for the dominance of artificial intelligence. As reported by Fortune, speaking at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, Huang talked about the contrast in the speed of construction in the US with that of China. “If you want to build a data center here in the United States from breaking ground to standing up an AI supercomputer is probably about three years,” he said. “They can build a hospital in a weekend.”Along with the slow pace of US, Huang also stressed on the fact that while US is still ‘generations ahead’ of China in the AI chip technology an semiconductor manufacturing, but this complacency could prove to be dangerous for the US in the long run. “Anybody who thinks China can’t manufacture is missing a big idea,” he warned.Huang also expressed optimism about the future of Nvidia and pointed out that US President Donald Trump’s initiatives to restore reshore manufacturing jobs and spur AI investments.Recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang shared his thoughts on the GAIN act. Nvidia has secured a major lobbying victory after US lawmakers excluded the controversial GAIN AI Act from the annual defense policy bill, following intense pressure from CEO Jensen Huang who warned the legislation would harm American competitiveness more than help it.The Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence (GAIN AI) Act would have required chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD to prioritize US customers over buyers in China and other adversary nations when selling advanced AI processors. The measure was expected to be included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) set for release this week, but sources confirmed it has been left out of the current draft.Huang met with President Donald Trump and key lawmakers on Wednesday to argue against the proposal. Speaking outside the Capitol, he called lawmakers' decision ""wise"" and claimed the GAIN AI Act would be ""even more detrimental to the United States than the AI Diffusion Act.""","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again shared a word of caution of America.

Jamie Dimon the CEO of America’s biggest banks JPMorgan and Chase has now warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation. This in turn is creating risks not only for the continent but also for the United States. As reported by Bloomberg, speaking at the Reagan National Defence Forum, Dimon said, “Europe has a real problem. They do some wonderful things on their safety nets. But they’ve driven business out, they’ve driven investment out, they’ve driven innovation out. It’s kind of coming back.”Along with this, Dimon has also cautioned that a fragmented Europe is one of the biggest challenges faced by the world. Earlier this year, in his annual shareholders letter, Dimon noted that Europe has “serious issues to fix.” While praising the creation of the euro and Europe’s pursuit of peace, Dimon warned that reduced military efforts and difficulties in reaching consensus within the European Union threaten the continent’s stability.“If they fragment, then you can say that America first will not be around anymore. It will hurt us more than anybody else because they are a major ally in every single way, including common values, which are really important,” he said, urging Washington to adopt a long-term strategy to strengthen Europe.“A weak Europe is bad for us.”The comments made by Dimon clings with recent announcement made by JPMorgan to funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next decade — $500 billion more than previously planned.The initiative will mainly focus on supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence and resilience and also frontier and strategic technologies.Along with this, JPMorgan will also invest up to $10 billion of its own capital to enable combines expand and innovate in strategic manufacturing.Separately, Dimon commended President Trump’s efforts to cut government bureaucracy. “There is no question that this administration is trying to bring an axe to some of the bureaucracy that held back America. That is a good thing and we can do it and still keep the world safe, for safe food and safe banks and all the stuff like that,” he said.","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation.

However, that optimism has moderated ahead of the Fed meeting amid speculation of a “hawkish cut,” which could reduce the likelihood of a fourth consecutive rate reduction. Tuesday’s data showed an unexpected rise in job openings, tempering expectations for multiple cuts next year.Markets now anticipate two reductions over the next 12 months, down from three.In New York, both the S&P 500 and Dow ended the day lower, setting the tone for Asian markets.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Higher growth and corporate earnings are achievable in the quarters ahead. The fiscal and monetary stimulus provided this year have started producing results.The excessively low inflation rate, which impacted nominal GDP growth, also will start rising in the coming quarters. This is significant since corporate earnings growth will be influenced more by nominal GDP growth rather than by real GDP growth.

America's affordability woes: Trump claims prices came down 'tremendously'; hits back at Democrat's 'con job',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/americas-affordability-woes-trump-claims-prices-came-down-tremendously-hits-back-at-democrats-con-job/articleshow/125880351.cms,"Low confidence in Trump



'A plus plus plus' economy ?



US President Donald Trump addressed America's affordability concerns at a campaign rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday, saying that the prices have come down ""tremendously. "" He moved to reassure Americans frustrated by high living costs and dismissed Democrat's criticism over inflation as a “hoax”. The event was a shift from his usual arguments about affordability, away from White House briefings and social media posts, into a more energetic campaign setting.Trump asserted that consumer prices are falling sharply. “Prices are coming down tremendously from the highest prices in the history of our country.” His remarks followed earlier claims made at the White House a day earlier, when he insisted, “We’re bringing prices way down,” and argued that Democrats had created the affordability crisis while he was “fixing it”.The push comes at a difficult moment for Trump. Surveys in recent weeks show a drop in public confidence in his handling of the economy, even as the White House says it expects inflation to ease next year.And although he has promised to bring prices down quickly, only 33% of American adults approve of his economic management, according to a November survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Following lacklustre Republican performances in last month’s off-cycle elections, administration officials have been trying to convince voters that the current cost pressures are unrelated to Trump’s policies.But price levels have remained stubborn, rising again after Trump introduced his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Businesses had warned that the sweeping import taxes could lead to higher consumer prices and reduced hiring, even as inflation had begun calming after hitting a 40-year peak in 2022. Trump has instead repeatedly blamed his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for the problem.His appearance in Monroe County, a region that backed Biden in 2020 but swung to Trump in 2024, was closely watched for signs of how voters view his claims. The county, anchored by the tourism-driven Pocono Mountains and increasingly attractive to people priced out of New York City, is set to play a key role in next year’s fight for control of the US House.The rally was held indoors, a change from the larger venues Trump used last year. It also placed him squarely inside the district represented by Republican Rob Bresnahan, who won his 2024 House race by only about 1.5 percentage points and is now a key Democratic target. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti is among those vying to challenge him.Trump has continued to boast about economic performance even as many Americans struggle with rising costs. On a Politico podcast, he rated the economy “A-plus”, later amplifying that to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus”. He has pointed to relaxed auto fuel efficiency standards and agreements aimed at lowering list prices for prescription drugs as evidence that he is easing pressures on consumers. He has also argued that significant cuts to the Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate would lower mortgage and auto-loan costs, despite concerns from critics that such moves could worsen inflation.National indicators show a mixed picture: the stock market has climbed this year, and economic growth appeared solid in the third quarter. Yet many households say the cost of housing, groceries, electricity, education and other essentials continues to erode their incomes. The administration maintains that inflation will subside next year, partly due to investment in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.Trump has repeatedly argued that concerns about affordability are being exaggerated for political effect. Speaking in the Oval Office earlier, he said “affordability is the greatest con job” by Democrats, insisting that his own past actions show he is the one genuinely addressing the issue.","US President Donald Trump addressed America's affordability concerns at a campaign rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania.

H-1B candidates started receiving emails from the consulate about their appointments being canceled and rescheduled in the last two days. The US embassy in India Tuesday issued a statement confirming the same and urging the candidates to not show up at the consulate on their earlier designated dates as they won't be admitted.The Donald Trump administration is starting social media vetting of all H-1B applicants and their spouses fron December 15. While this will e applciable to H-1Bs from any country, the impact has been massive in India as Indian consulates process hundreds of requests every day and now the number has to be reduced because of the additional work of social media vetting.The officials are now supposed to check all social media profiles of the candidates before proceeding further.""As of December 15, the Department of State will conduct an online presence review for all H-1B applicants and their dependents, in addition to the students and exchange visitors already subject to this review.Due to operational constraints related to processing these visas and to ensure that no applicants issued a visa pose a threat to US national security of public safety, the US Consulate in Hyderabad must reduce the number of applicants each day. The Consulate will not be able to see you on your original appointment date. Please do not show up at the Consulate. We look forward to assisting you on your new appointment date,"" the email that US Consulate in Hyderabad sent out read.""It appears that 12/15 was rescheduled to March, 12/16 and 12/17 were rescheduled to April, and 12/18 has been rescheduled to May 2025,"" Ellen Freeman said.""H1B workers will lose their jobs now that they are stuck in India. We have to plead with employers to let them either work from India or take prolonged leave of absence for as many as 5 months. In this economic environment and with the deliverables pressure, many employers will not be able to wait. People left their apartment leases, utility bills, car payments in the U.S. The prolonged delay in these visa cancelations will have a devastating effect on our communities and economy. There are human stories behind each visa cancelation and its harsh impact on our colleagues, clients, friends, relatives,"" Freeman added.""Visa stamping feels like a maze of pitfalls right now. Now, appointments are getting canceled without warning and pushed out by months. There is no predictability in this process, and it is creating real challenges for businesses and employees who need to travel,"" another immigration attorney Emily Neumann said.","The State Department pushed hundreds of H-1B visa appointments in India to 2026 without any warning.
