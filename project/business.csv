"Punjab mopped up Rs 2 crore in farm fire penalties, Haryana Rs 21 lakh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab-mopped-up-rs-2-crore-in-farm-fire-penalties-haryana-rs-21-lakh/articleshow/116027163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Punjab and Haryana govts have, so far, this year imposed a cumulative penalty of over Rs 2.1 crore and Rs 21 lakh, respectively, on farmers for stubble burning and collected more than 50% of these amounts from violators.Sharing the data in Rajya Sabha on Thursday, the environment ministry in response to a Parliament question informed the House that Punjab reported 10,909 fire incidents this year as on November 30 whereas Haryana reported 1,406 such cases during the period, and the authorities have inspected nearly all the fields before imposing environmental compensation (penalty) in 5,525 and 638 cases, respectively.The ministry had last month doubled the penalty for burning paddy straw by farmers.Under the new rules, the farmers having farmland of less than two acres will have to pay a penalty of Rs 5,000 per incidence if they are found to be indulged in stubble burning. On the other hand, those having two acres or more but less than five acres of land will have to pay Rs 10,000 per incidence whereas those having more than five acres of land will have to pay Rs 30,000 per incidence.Though the state governments had imposed penalty in higher number of cases in the past in commensurate with reporting of quite a high number of stubble burning episodes in both Punjab and Haryana, the reported decline in the farm fires numbers this year could be a result of gradual strengthening of both in-situ and ex-situ management of paddy straw through various measures.Past data shows that the Punjab government had collected Rs 3.1 crore, Rs 2.8 crore and Rs 1.7 crore from 12,106 cases; 10,244 cases and 6,695 cases in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The state had reported 83,002; 71,304 and 49,922 incidents of farm fires in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.Similarly, the Haryana government had also collected a much higher amount as penalty from a higher number of cases in the past. The state had reported 4,202 incidents of stubble burning in 2020 and collected Rs 86 lakh as penalty from 464 cases.","Punjab reported 10,909 fire incidents this year as on November 30.

'Jatha' of 101 farmers to march towards Delhi today: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jatha-of-101-farmers-to-march-towards-delhi-today-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/116025672.cms,"(PTI photo)

Here's all you need to know about farmer's march to national capital:



Farmers under the banners of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (non-political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha have announced a foot march to the national capital.

""The 'jatha' of 101 farmers will march towards Delhi (on Friday). What the government will do is for them to decide. We will begin our march towards Delhi at 1 pm from the Shambhu border,"" said farmer leader Pandher.

Police have set up multi-layer barricading at the Ambala-Delhi border and deployed central paramilitary forces. Senior officers are monitoring the situation, with heightened vigilance reported since Thursday.

The farmers’ march coincides with the 297th day of their broader protest against the government. Meanwhile, an indefinite hunger strike by farmers at the Khanauri border has entered its 11th day.

Earlier on Thursday, 34 farmers were detained in Noida while attempting to reach Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal from point zero, without permission.

The Noida police confirmed that the detained farmers were taken into custody and sent to jail.

This is the second such march planned this week. On Monday, farmers from Uttar Pradesh attempted to march toward Parliament but were stopped at the Noida border, causing significant traffic disruptions.

What are the key demands of the farmers marching to Delhi?



NEW DELHI: Security has been heightened along the Ambala-Delhi border as farmer prepare to march to national capital on Friday. The march, led by a 'jatha' of 101 farmers is scheduled to begin at 1pm from the Shambhu Border.The Ambala district administration has invoked prohibitory orders under 'Section 163' of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), prohibiting any unlawful assembly of five or more people and banning processions by foot, vehicles, or other means. These restrictions will remain in effect until further notice.According to deputy commissioner’s orders, any public gathering or movement must have prior approval, prompting the administration to urge farmers to reconsider their march.Also read: Noida-to-Delhi feels pain of ‘farm fire’ Also read: Noida police arrests 34 farmers from Zero Point The farmers are pressing for a legal guarantee of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops among other demands.Their list of demands also includes a freeze on electricity tariff hikes, justice for the victims of the 2021 Lakhimpur Kheri violence , and additional reforms to improve the livelihoods of farmers and laborers.Meanwhile, farmers in Noida and Greater Noida have highlighted their distinct grievances tied to land acquisition. Since the initial acquisitions in 1997 for industrial development, they have sought 10% of abadi plots or equivalent compensation for their lands.","Police have set up multi-layer barricading at the Ambala-Delhi border and deployed central paramilitary forces.

Study ties C-section deliveries to income,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/study-ties-c-section-deliveries-to-income/articleshow/116025729.cms,"Only 6% of women belonging to the lowest wealth quintile, or the poorest, underwent C-section in public hospitals, the study shows

NEW DELHI: More women from high-income quintiles are undergoing delivery through caesarean section (Csection), even in govt hospitals, according to a new study.A wealth quintile is a statistical value that divides a population into five equally sized groups based on wealth, with each quintile representing 20% of the population.Only about 6% women belonging to lowest wealth quintile, or the poorest, underwent C-section delivery in public hospitals across India. The rest went for normal delivery, according to the study published in Lancet Regional Health-Southeast Asia, which is based on a cross-sectional analysis of C-section delivery rate data published in National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) report.The percentage of women undergoing C-section delivery at public hospitals in the poorer, middle, richer and the richest categories stood at 11%, 18%, 21% and 25%, of total births in the respective wealth quintile, it stated. A C-section delivery is a surgical technique that involves making an incision in the belly to deliver one or more infants. When medically justified, the procedure can be lifesaving. However, when not strictly necessary, it can cause adverse health outcomes, lead to unnecessary expenditure, and place a strain on scarce public health resources.Dr Anita Gadgil, co-corresponding authors of the study, told TOI that one of the major reasons for lower rate of Csection delivery among the poor even in public health facilities, where the procedure is carried out free of cost, could be lack of awareness.“Also, sometimes the poorer women aren’t able to reach higher centres in time where C-section delivery is available, or they don’t have money and wherewithal to reach there. These people are often also least aware of govt schemes to provide financial support in such cases,” Dr Gadgil said.The study stated that while southern states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have high C-section delivery rates (up to 60%), states with a predominantly poor quintile population like Bihar, Assam and Chhattisgarh have lower C-section rates.Dr Gadgil, who works at George Institute for Global Health, said low rates indi cate that women requiring the procedure may not have adequate access, resulting in maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity. On the other hand, high rates are suggestive of overuse without medical necessity, which is associated with higher rates of adverse outcomes and misallocation of resources, she added.A study carried out by researchers from IIT-Madras recently revealed that prevalence of C-sections across India increased from 17% to 21.5% from 2016 to 2021. In the private sector, these numbers stand at 43% (2016) and 50% (2021), meaning that nearly one in two deliveries in the private sector is a C-section.Researchers found better-educated women living in urban areas were more likely to deliver by C-section, suggesting that greater autonomy and better access to healthcare facilities play a role in increase in prevalence of C-sections.","Only about 6% women belonging to lowest wealth quintile, or the poorest, underwent C-section delivery in public hospitals across India.

'Maha' drama over role reversal: How ex-CM Eknath Shinde played hardball before taking oath as deputy to Devendra Fadnavis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maha-drama-over-role-reversal-how-ex-cm-eknath-shinde-played-hardball-before-taking-oath-as-deputy-to-devendra-fadnavis/articleshow/116012057.cms,"(From left) Deputy CM Eknath Shinde, CM Devendra Fadnavis and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar

NEW DELHI: The Mahayuti 2.0 government is finally in office with BJP's Devendra Fadnavis back as Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde and NCP chief Ajit Pawar as deputy chief ministers. The Mahayuti trio took oath at a glittering ceremony in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This marked the end of a 12-day-long political drama that gripped the state despite a sweeping mandate to the ruling coalition.With 230 seats in 288-member Maharashtra assembly, Mahayuti's return to power should have been smooth. But that was not to be. The run up to government formation after results were out on November 23 saw intense drama and hectic lobbying after outgoing chief minister Eknath Shinde insisted on a second term as the leader of the coalition.Soon after the numbers were out, the Shiv Sena launched an orchestrated campaign demanding a second term for Shinde as Mahayuti chief minister. This despite the fact that Sena had won only 57 seats, which was less than half of BJP's record tally of 132.Sena leaders put up posters, tweaked PM Modi's slogan ""Ek hain to safe hain"" to say ""Ek(nath) hain to safe hain"" and also cited the Bihar model of power sharing where Nitish Kumar is the chief minister despite being a junior partner to the BJP - to push Shinde's candidature for the top job.However, nothing worked as BJP, with just 13 seats short of a majority, was firm on leading the government this time around. In 2022, Shinde was given the top post by the BJP after he rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray to split the Shiv Sena and pave the way for the return of the NDA government in the state.After four days, Shinde relented by hinting that he was ready to give up his claim for the top post and would abide by the decision of Prime Minister Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah on Mahayuti's CM-pick. Shinde claimed that his two-and-a-half-year tenure was historic and the work done was equivalent to 10 years of governance.The three Mahayuti leaders then met Amit Shah and BJP chief JP Nadda in the national capital to discuss the power-sharing formula. It was after this meeting that Shinde once again went incommunicado.He made a sudden trip to his native village leading to the cancellation of scheduled meeting in Mumbai. Shiv Sena leaders offered different versions of his sudden village visit adding to the suspense. Some said he was unwell, while others claimed that he had gone there to take a big decision.After two days of village stay, Shinde returned to Mumbai and announced a new date for the meeting of Mahayuti leaders. However, this meeting also had to be cancelled as Shinde this time went to his house in Thane citing ill-health.With Shinde refusing to budge, the BJP unilaterally announced the date of the oath-taking ceremony, putting pressure on Shinde. It appointed central observers and fixed the date for the meeting of legislature party to formally elect Devendra Fadnavis for the post of chief minister.Left with no option, Shinde finally returned from Thane after a brief stopover at a hospital for medical tests. Subsequently, Fadnavis visited Shinde's official residence to discuss the modalities of the new government.However, the drama was far from over. While Shinde accepted Fadnavis as the leader of the Mahayuti, he did not clear the air about his future role.When the three leaders went to meet governor CP Radhakrishnan, Fadnavis revealed that Shinde was still not decided about joining the government as deputy chief minister. It was only a couple of hours before the swearing-in ceremony that Shinde finally put an end to this suspense as he announced that he would be taking oath as deputy chief minister.Shinde is now in the government as a deputy of Fadnavis. But is the power-sharing crisis over? Well, we do not know as the portfolio division is still not official and Shiv Sena leaders have openly demanded home ministry for Eknath Shinde.",Mahayuti 2.0 government is finally in office with Devendra Fadnavis back as Maharashtra chief minister. Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde and NCP chief Ajit Pawar are deputy chief ministers.

Bangladesh 'urgently' recalls Kolkata and Agartala mission heads amid rising tension with India: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-urgently-recalls-kolkata-and-agartala-mission-heads-amid-rising-tension-with-india-report/articleshow/116017689.cms,"ANI photo

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh has urgently recalled the mission heads of Agartala and Kolkata high commissions to Dhaka, a move that would further deepen the ongoing tension between the interim-Yunus government and New Delhi.The acting deputy high commissioner of Bangladesh in Kolkata, Shikdar Md Ashrafur Rahman, and the assistant high commissioner in Tripura, Arifur Rahman, were instructed to return to Dhaka on an urgent basis last Tuesday, reported Prothom Alo citing sources.While the mission head of Kolkata turned to Dhaka, his Tripura mission colleague will soon leave for Bangladesh.This comes a day after demonstrators allegedly broke into the Bangladesh assistant high commission in Agartala to protest atrocities against minorities in the neighbouring country.The high commission breach comes after an Agartala-Kolkata bus travelling via Dhaka on Saturday reportedly faced an attack in the Brahmanbaria district of Bangladesh after being involved in an accident on Vishwa Road.The breach came amid escalating tensions between India and Bangladesh, exacerbated by rising attacks on Hindus and their places of worship in Bangladesh following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina earlier this year.The political instability in Bangladesh has coincided with a series of mob attacks, intensifying concerns for the safety of the Hindu minority community. The tension rose further after the arrest of prominent Iskcon priest Chinmoy Krishna Das , a vocal advocate for minority rights.Das was detained at Dhaka airport in October on charges of allegedly disrespecting the Bangladeshi flag during a rally. The specifics of the allegations remain vague, and Das has been denied bail.",Bangladesh has urgently recalled the mission heads of Agartala and Kolkata high commissions to Dhaka.

'No justification for such actions': Jama Masjid Shahi Imam condemns injustices against Hindus in Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justification-for-such-actions-jama-masjid-shahi-imam-condemns-injustices-against-hindus-in-bangladesh/articleshow/115941926.cms,"Syed Ahmed Bukhari (Picture credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. He urged Muhammad Yunus , the head of Bangladesh 's interim government, to take immediate action against these injustices.In a letter, Bukhari stressed the close ties between India and Bangladesh. “Since the establishment of Bangladesh, our national leadership, media, civil society, and influential circles have maintained close relations with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajid, and their party, the Awami League. In diplomacy, regional matters, international affairs, and issues concerning the Muslim world, Bangladesh has always stood by us as a close ally,” he said, according to an ANI report.Bukhari expressed concern over the unrest following Sheikh Hasina's departure to India, which has affected both Muslim and non-Muslim supporters of the Awami League. He specifically condemned the violence targeting the Hindu minority.“Until now, this remained an internal matter of Bangladesh. However, the ongoing injustices, assaults, and unilateral actions against the Hindu minority are condemnable and must stop immediately. There is no justification for such actions. The government must always acknowledge the role we have played in their establishment and development process, as well as our unparalleled history of supporting and caring for millions of refugees. We were the first to stand by them during every natural disaster,” he wrote.Bukhari also referred to the UN's declaration on minority rights, calling on Yunus to intervene. “As a credible neighbour, a close ally of Bangladesh, and a custodian of shared cultural heritage, I expect the current head of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate, to take immediate steps to address the injustices against the Hindu minority. He should ensure that his international reputation remains untarnished. As a Muslim-majority country, Islam and Islamic jurisprudence inherently leave no room for any form of prejudice or injustice against minorities in Bangladesh,” Bukhari added.Over the weekend, more than 60 monks were reportedly stopped from entering India at the Benapole land port in Bangladesh, according to an ANI report citing an ISKCON Kolkata spokesperson. Additionally, a Bangladesh court has set January 2, 2025, as the hearing date for Hindu spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das , who was arrested on sedition charges. Das is currently in custody in Bangladesh.","Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh.

The Chief Secretary assured the court that the remaining Rs 6,000 would be disbursed by the following day.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih questioned why the full compensation had not been paid, despite clear instructions from the top court.""Why?

The court had also noted that none of the NCR states—Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh—had complied with its earlier directions regarding compensation to construction workers.The bench had also expressed dissatisfaction with the enforcement of GRAP-4 measures , highlighting that the ban on truck entry and construction activities was not being effectively carried out.","The court also expressed discontent over the delayed compensation for construction workers.

'Exempt us from deploying CAT II/III planes at Bangalore & Kolkata': Akasa to DGCA; else warns of 'disruptions',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/exempt-us-from-deploying-cat-ii/iii-planes-at-bangalore-kolkata-akasa-to-dgca-else-warns-of-disruptions/articleshow/115980819.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid its pilot training troubles, Akasa has sought regulatory exemption from deploying aircraft equipped to take off and land (CAT II/III) in low visibility conditions along with pilots trained to do so at Bengaluru and Kolkata for flights to operate from 9 pm to early morning. The almost 2.5-year-old airline has warned of “significant disruptions” at these airports and causing hardship to passengers.Following the early onset of fog this unusually warm winter, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) had last month made it mandatory for airlines to deploy aircraft with CATII/III landing and low visibility take off (LVTO) systems along with pilots trained on the same on night to morning flights at airports like Delhi, Amritsar, Jaipur, Lucknow, Bengaluru and Kolkata. Akasa, which has over 840 pilots for its current fleet of 26 Boeing 737 MAX planes, has been facing pilot training issues and sources say the required number of trained pilots are not available with them for CAT III landings at their Bangalore base.The airline is already under scanner when DGCA has red-flagged this in the recent past. The regulator had recently issued Akasa a show cause for alleged training lapses, including wrong minima certification of a simulator on which some pilots were trained to operate in low visibility. So, while the airline has the required number of low visibility operation compliant planes and crew to cover north India operations, doing so in Kolkata and Bengaluru is proving to be challenging this winter.While Akasa did not comment on this issue, airline sources said: “CAT (II/III) trainings as required by the regulator are typically achieved in a phased manner, as an airline progresses in its operations from inception. Akasa has been working closely with the DGCA and aims to train the requisite number of CAT3 compliant pilots in a timely manner as mandated by the regulator. Akasa has ensured it protects all fog-prone destinations along the northern region of its network.”“In public interest and keeping in mind the safety and security of passengers, DGCA has correctly extended this mandate nationwide. As there is a variance in topography of southern and northern states, Bengaluru will be impacted differently than Delhi, and this is the area in which Akasa will now work to enhance its capabilities and ensure it flies within regulations while providing a reliable and efficient experience to its customers,” Akasa sources said.The “traditional” fog window is Dec 10 to Feb 10 but this year while temperatures are yet to dip, low visibility made its debut early Nov itself. The DGCA then preponed its fog window and asked airlines to deploy aircraft II/III-compliant aircraft with pilots trained to land in low visibility at many airports.",Akasa has sought regulatory exemption from deploying aircraft equipped to take off and land (CAT II/III) in low visibility conditions.

"After 18 days of severe curbs, SC allows lifting of Grap-4",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-18-days-of-severe-curbs-sc-allows-lifting-of-grap-4/articleshow/116025269.cms,"Pollution

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday allowed easing of stringent anti-pollution curbs under Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) Stage 4 in NCR, and replacing these with Grap-2 measures. However, it said Grap-3 should be imposed immediately if AQI goes above 350 and Grap-4 should kick in if it crosses 400.Grap-4 was imposed in NCR on Nov 18 when airpollution reached ‘severe plus’ levels with AQI above 450. During the last 18 days, AQI had been improving but the court had turned down repeated requests to relax curbs and had said it would do so only when there was a steady downward trend in pollution levels.Noting that AQI had continuously improved in the last few days, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih allowed the plea of Commission for Air Quality Management ( CAQM ) for relaxation.Appearing for CAQM, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati told the SC bench that pollution had come down and that restrictions imposed under Grap-4 were devastating for many people.Allowing the plea, the court left it for CAQM to decide whether some measures of GRAP-III could continue alongside GRAP-II curbs.“Up to Nov 30, AQI levels were consistently above 300 and it is only during the last four days that the levels have come down below 300. It is true that at some stage the court will have to leave it to the commission to decide the applicability of stages under GRAP. Considering the data before us, we do not think it will be appropriate at this stage to allow the commission to go below Stage II. So, we permit the commission to go to Stage II for the present. It will be appropriate if the commission considers incorporating certain additional measures which are part of Stage III. While we permit the commission to do so, we must record here that if the commission finds that the AQI goes above 350, as a precautionary measure, Stage III measures will have to be immediately implemented. If AQI crosses 400 on a given day, Stage IV measures will have to be reintroduced,” the bench said.The NCR witnessed 18 days of Grap-IVrestrictions during which construction work was banned and entry of goods trucks was also not allowed. Educational institutions were shut for a few days with only online classes being conducted. Later, SC allowed schools and colleges to operate in hybrid mode, with physical classes being supplemented with online lessons “wherever possible and required”.GRAP-II curbs are aimed to prevent further degradation of air quality and include a series of measures targeting pollution from various sources. Under it, there will be restrictions on the use of coal and firewood as well as diesel generator sets in NCR.Mechanical sweeping and water sprinkling on identified roads will be carried out on a daily basis, and dust control measures will be enforced at construction and demolition sites. Traffic personnel have to be deployed at congestion points, vehicle parking fees could be increased to discourage private transport and additional bus and Metro services will be started.","Grap-4 was imposed in NCR on Nov 18 when airpollution reached ‘severe plus’ levels with AQI above 450.

NEW DELHI: Using its omnibus power under Article 142 of the Constitution, Supreme Court on Thursday annulled the marriage between a non-Dalit woman and a Dalit man, and ordered the husband to get Scheduled Caste certificates for their minor children, who have been with their mother for the last six years.The rationale behind this order from Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan, while granting divorce to Juhi Poria nee Jawalkar and Pradip Poria, was that though a non-Dalit woman cannot acquire membership of a Scheduled Caste community through marriage, her children born to a Scheduled Caste man would be entitled to the SC tag.The SC has reiterated this principle in many judgments and had ruled in 2018, ""There cannot be any dispute that caste is determined by birth and caste cannot be changed by marriage with a person from Scheduled Caste (community). Merely because her husband belongs to a Scheduled Caste community, she could not be issued a Scheduled Caste certificate.""In the present case, the children - an 11-year-old son and a six-year-old daughter - have been residing with the non-Dalit woman at her parent's home in Raipur for the last six years, the period of the couple's estrangement. With the SC granting divorce, the children will continue to be groomed in a non-Dalit household and yet would be considered Scheduled Castes for the purpose of admissions to govt educational institutions and employment.The Justice Kant-led bench asked the husband to move the authorities concerned and get SC certificates for the two children within six months. It said he would bear all expenses of their education till post-graduation, including admission and tuition fees as well as boarding and lodging expenses.This is in addition to Rs 42 lakh paid by the man to the woman as a one-time settlement towards lifelong maintenance of the woman and the children. The man would also give a plot of land owned by him in Raipur to the woman.Interestingly, the bench also gave effect to a clause in the settlement between the estranged couple mandating the husband to buy her a two-wheeler for personal use by Aug 31 next year. The bench also quashed the cross-FIRs and cases lodged by the parties against each other.The SC directed the woman to facilitate periodic meetings of the children with their father, allow them to be taken on vacation by him and build a good relationship between them.","The children will be groomed in a non-Dalit household and yet would be considered SCs for admissions to educational institutions and employment.

VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh crime investigation department (CID) has issued a lookout circular (LOC) against YSRCP MP Vijayasai Reddy , his son-in-law and Aurobindo Pharma non-executive director Penaka Sarathchandra Reddy , and Vikrant Reddy , son of MP Y V Subba Reddy. The LOC was issued to prevent them from leaving the country in the case registered on Tuesday under various sections of BNS for extortion, cheating, forgery, and other offences.The CID case concerns forced acquisition of shares valued at Rs 3,600 crore in Kakinada Seaports Limited and Kakinada SEZ from Karnati Venkateswara Rao (KV Rao) during the previous YSRCP govt. The investigation centres on accusations that they coerced Rao into transferring the majority shareholding to Aurobindo Pharma by threatening him.The FIR registered by CID implicates Vijayasai for allegedly orchestrating a complex scheme to seize control of valuable assets. The complaint, lodged by KV Rao - a Hyderabad-based businessman - accuses Vijayasai and his associates of manipulating audits, forging reports, and leveraging political power to coerce him into selling his shares in KSPL and KSEZ at significantly undervalued prices.Rao alleged that the ""systematic pressure through fabricated audits"" were endorsed by then AP CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. KSPL, which operates Kakinada Port under a concession agreement with the AP govt, was subjected to special audits 2019 onwards. Rao claimed these audits - conducted by PKF Sridhar & Santhanam LLP and KROLL India - fabricated findings of revenue suppression amounting to Rs 965.65 crore between 2014 and 2019.Rao alleged that in May 2020, he was approached by Vikrant and Sarathchandra, who demanded that he sell his 41.12% stake in KSPL and 48.74% stake in KSEZ, and threatened with criminal cases, arrests, and damage to his other businesses if he refused. Rao claimed he was forced to sell his KSPL shares, worth an estimated Rs 2,500 crore, for just Rs 494 crore. His family's shares in KSEZ, valued at Rs 1,109 crore, were ""acquired"" for just Rs 12 crore. Rao alleged the actions were carried out under the directives of Jagan.Meanwhile, Vikrant, the main accused in the case, moved the HC seeking anticipatory bail. In his petition, Vikrant argued that he has nothing to do with the alleged offence and has been ""unjustly implicated"" in the FIR with an ""ulterior motive"" as he is the son of an MP and relative of a former CM. The allegations levelled against him and other accused are based on a ""fabricated and exaggerated narrative"", he said in his plea.","Andhra Pradesh crime investigation department (CID) has issued a lookout circular (LOC) against YSRCP MP Vijayasai Reddy, his son-in-law and Aurobindo Pharma non-executive director.

NEW DELHI: Students from any stream in Class 12 can now pursue an UG programme of their choice, and UG students can join any PG discipline, provided they clear a national- or university-level entrance exam, such as CUET, according to a draft of new UGC regulations aiming to bring sweeping reforms in India's higher education.UGC also proposes to offer biannual admissions, flexibility in minimum credit requirements to obtain a degree, and interdisciplinary learning opportunities through an option of pursuing two programmes simultaneously.The draft UGC regulations released Thursday for feedback and suggestions will be applicable to central, state, private and deemed universities. The regulations aim at dismantling “traditional disciplinary rigidities” by allowing students to choose programmes outside their prior streams, provided they meet the entrance exam requirements.“Irrespective of the disciplines taken by a student in level 4/Class XII schooling, a student is eligible for admission in any discipline of UG programme, if the student qualifies national-level or university-level entrance examination in the discipline of UG programme,” according to the regulations.UGC chairperson M Jagadesh Kumar said, “The draft UGC regulations, 2024, aim at transforming higher education by promoting flexibility, inclusivity, and adaptability. By removing rigid disciplinary boundaries, students can now explore diverse learning opportunities, ensuring India’s education system evolves to global standards.” The latest framework also encourages mobility between vocational and general education, andrecognition of prior learning — whereby students’ professional experiences can translate into academic credits. Under these regulations, higher education institutions (HEIs) are authorised to conduct admissions twice a year — during July/Aug, and Jan/Feb.The draft further introduces options for multiple entry and exit points, allowing students to transition between academic levels with interim certifications such as diplomas or degrees, depending on their earned credits. Minimum 50% of total credits must be earned in the student’s chosen core subject to obtain a degree, while the remaining can be accumulated through multidisciplinary or skill-based courses.The reforms also redefine attendance norms, allowing HEIs to tailor minimum requirements based on the programme structure, in alignment with National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The focus on continuous formative assessment and flexibility in curriculum content reflects a commitment to fostering holistic and multidisciplinary education, UGC said.The regulations also have provisions for three or four year duration for UG degrees, with optional extensions under the extended degree programme or acceleration via accelerated degree programme. For PG, a two-year programme is standard, though graduates from four-year UG courses may qualify for a one-year Master’s programme. The regulations advocate for integration of skilling, internships, and apprenticeships into UG and PG curricula.","Draft of new UGC regulations aiming to bring sweeping reforms in India's higher education.

Maharashtra CM swearing-in: Multistarrer premiere in Mumbai for Mahayuti-2,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/multistarrer-premiere-in-mumbai-for-mahayuti-2/articleshow/116020519.cms,"PM Modi greets Eknath Shinde after he takes oath as deputy CM as CM Devendra Fadnavis, second deputy CM Ajit Pawar and governor C P Radhakrishnan look on

MUMBAI: Americans are world champions at this - glamming up 'sarkari' events, including, or especially, inauguration. We call it swearing-in here. And that's usually a staid affair. Looking at beaming netas and hearing the oath of office repeated dozens of times aren't exactly riveting stuff. Even when mantris of a new Big G (aka GOI) are sworn in, and even though big names can be spotted, it doesn't quite register on the glam Richter scale.True, the odd state government swearing-in has had small showbiz or socialite presence. The Bachchans were once spotted in Lucknow. But those were still very much sarkari events. All that changed in Mumbai. You have to swear on whatever it is you swear on, you haven't seen a swearing-in like this in India. Even before starting work, 'Fadnavis sarkar' has already set the bar high. You name them, they were there. Mukesh? Yup. Beta and bahu, Anant and Radhika? Ditto. Kumar and daughter Ananya? Sure. Noel Tata? You can Trust him. Deepak Parekh? A man for all seasons.Plus, several other Mumbai Inc hotshots. Bollywood? SRK, Salman, Madhuri, Ranbir and Ranveer, Sanju…and more. Sachin Tendulkar was present. What hiked the glam quotient was not just A+ listers – but that they were all schmoozing- …handshakes, smiles and a few bro hugs.When you get stars from biz, showbusiness and sports to mingle and they seem to have a good time, that’s when an event stops being uninteresting for the uninvited. We like to watch the rich and famous rub shoulders. American politicians always knew this. Mumbai showed our politicians are now catching on. Why, though? Why was the swearing-in so glam-heavy?So much so it moved out of Raj Bhawan to the iconic Azad Maidan. And TV cameras were conflicted whether to focus on the governor, who swears in mantris and is rarely centrestage, or swing back to front rows of audience. For an answer, look at numbers. So, BJP wanted to send a message. The who’s who of Mumbai society was the glam part of it. The other part was rajneeti — you would have never seen a state-level swearing-in with so many Union cabinet heavyweights — Shah, Rajnath, Gadkari, Shivraj, Nirmala, Piyush, Scindia — and so many CMs in attendance. NDA CMs from Goa and Gujarat to Assam, and UP and Uttarakhand to Odisha and Andhra were there. The political signal was loud and clear. But it was the glam glow that stole the show.",Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as Maharashtra's new chief minister. The swearing-in took place at the iconic Azad Maidan in Mumbai.

"Din in Parliament as BJP, opposition spar over Soros-Cong nexus charge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/din-in-parliament-as-bjp-opposition-spar-over-soros-cong-nexus-charge/articleshow/116020296.cms,"Parliament session

NEW DELHI: Billionaire hedge fund operator George Soros, who was a major donor to Kamala Harris's US presidential campaign, was at the centre of noisy exchanges between BJP and Congress on Thursday, with the former alleging that the 94-year-old was acting in collusion with the opposition in India to undermine the Modi government.Citing the claims made by French media outlet Mediapart and others, BJP said in both Houses that Soros, through his proxies like Open Society Foundations, Human Rights Watch, and Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), has consistently been timing volleys of allegations to coincide with Parliament sessions in India which are then used by Congress and its functionaries to disrupt proceedings.Congress members in both Houses protested against BJP's attack which saw the saffron party levelling its allegation outside Parliament as well. ""Agents of Adani have been given only one task - to defame and abuse those who expose their mega corruption. We do not tolerate the objectionable words used against LOP Rahul Gandhi, Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi and the Congress party by Adani Agent Nishikant Dubey on the floor of the House,"" AICC general secretary K C Venugopal posted on X.BJP found its ammunition in disclosures by a group of foreign media outlets - French investigative online newspaper Mediapart, German broadcaster NDR, Drop Site News of the US and others - that OCCRP was created by the US Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), which provides almost half of its funding and vets its employees. The report said that Soros's Open Society Foundations was another important funder of OCCRP, which has been associated with investigative projects like on Israeli spyware Pegasus and allegations of stock manipulation by Adani Group which were used by the opposition to attack the Modi government.The report also said Drew Sullivan, head of OCCRP, was an airspace engineer by training who had worked on a US spy satellite project enjoying ‘top secret security clearance’. It also said US army officer David Hodgkinson, who made the creation of OCCRP possible, was deployed by the US in 25 countries. He later held senior positions in the state department and the White House while continuing as an army reservist.Citing the report, BJP member Nishikant Dubey alleged that Soros had used OCCRP to derail India’s development under PM Modi’s leadership, with Congress being a willing accessory. He said OCCRP’s allegations, including about the doubtful efficacy of India-made Covid vaccines, were synchronised with Parliament sessions and were seized upon by the opposition to disrupt proceedings.Congress members were up on their feet protesting against Dubey as he tried to put questions to Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi. Similar scenes were witnessed in Rajya Sabha, with BJP’s Sudhanshu Trivedi referring to disclosures about OCCRP and their timing to demand a discussion and a probe. “It is not just a coincidence,” he said.Speaking on ‘Concerns over Suspicious and Conspicuous Attacks on National Interest from Abroad’ during zero hour, Trivedi cited instances in the past three years when issues concerning India were raised by international entities just before or during Parliament sessions. Referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s claim about a foreign attempt to influence Lok Sabha elections, Trivedi said there were attempts to obstruct India’s rise as a “strategic, economic and diplomatic power”. His reference to the recent indictment of Adani group by a US court also coinciding with the winter session had Congress members on their feet who said Trivedi was seeking to defend the corporate house.Amid the uproar, RS Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar said, “We cannot allow the largest democracy to be made dysfunctional by ‘deep state’. This House should be united in neutralising any trend or initiative that is dangerous to our sovereignty.”BJP extended its offensive beyond Parliament, with party spokesperson Sambit Patra launching a vicious attack on Rahul Gandhi. Patra said leader of opposition had attacked Covaxin based on an OCCRP report about cancellation of a Brazilian contract for the vaccine developed in India. “I have no hesitation in saying he (Rahul) is a traitor of the highest order,” he said. Referring to the Mediapart report, Patra said OCCRP had over 50 media partners across several continents and depended massively on Soros and “deep state” agencies in the US to fund its work. The Mediaprt report cited New York Times, Washington Post, Guardian, Der Spiegel, Suddeutsche Zeitung and Le Monde as among OCCRP’s media partners. “If they are getting 70% of their resources from one source, then they cannot be neutral,” Patra said.Mediapart said OCCRP was required to respect the US Foreign Assistance Act which concerns aid disbursed abroad and stipulates funding must be “aligned with and advance US foreign policy and economic interests”. “It does advance American foreign policy when you have good investigative reporters around the world. That’s why they gave us the grant in the first place,” Sullivan told Mediapart even as he insisted that “there was never an attempt to influence anything that we were doing”.",BJP alleges that George Soros is working with the opposition in India to undermine the Modi government.

NEW DELHI: India made a strong case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), on Thursday, highlighting the importance of equitable global action on climate change.India argued that countries with negligible historical emissions should not be expected to shoulder an equal burden in mitigating climate change. “It is unjust to expect countries with negligible historical emissions to bear equal burden in mitigating climate change,” it stated in its submission to the ICJ.Luther M Rangreji, joint secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), presented India's position, stating, “Climate finance by developed nations is inadequate to meet developing countries' needs in adapting to, mitigating climate change.”India further criticised developed countries for their role in the climate crisis. During a hearing on countries’ legal obligations regarding climate change, India argued that developed nations bear greater responsibility due to their historical exploitation of resources. ""If the contribution to degradation is unequal, the responsibility must also be unequal,"" said Rangreji.India also highlighted the disproportionate impact of climate change on developing nations, despite their lower contribution to the problem. Rangreji pointed out that developed countries possess the technology and finances to address the crisis. ""Countries which have reaped development benefits from exploiting fossil fuels demand developing countries to not utilise the national energy resources available to them,"" also Rangreji saidFurther condemning the unfulfilled climate-finance pledges from developed countries, India claimed that the $100 billion promised in 2009 and increased adaptation funding have not materialised, deeming the new climate finance package agreed upon at COP29 insufficient to meet the needs of developing countries.While reaffirming its commitment to the Paris Agreement, India emphasised the limits of burdening its citizens, particularly while pursuing sustainable development goals for a large population.The ICJ hearing, prompted by Pacific island nations and Vanuatu, involves over 98 countries presenting their views. The court's advisory opinion, though not legally binding, is expected to hold significant weight in the global fight against climate change.","India argued that countries with negligible historical emissions should not be expected to shoulder an equal burden in mitigating climate change.

Tayvoodoo In Action? What Taylor Swift’s New Spotify Win Could Mean For Travis Kelce and the NFL



Spotify 2024 Wrapped - Taylor Swift Global Top Artist of the Year

The Spotify Wrapped 2024 is here, and is it any wonder that Taylor Swift has ranked as the No. 1 most-streamed artist globally in 2024 on Spotify, for the second year in a row? With over 26.6 billion streams, Swift’s latest album, The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology, also became the most-streamed album worldwide. The album broke some major records with over 300 million streams on its first day and 1 billion in its first week!“That’s right, it’s Taylor Swift!” Sulinna Ong, Spotify’s Global Head of Editorial, announced in a virtual press briefing. “With more than 26.6 billion streams globally this year, Taylor is our Global Top Artist for the second year in a row.”There’s no doubt that 2024 has been a milestone year for Taylor; besides the record-breaking sales of her music, her Eras Tour also became the highest-grossing concert tour of all time, as per a Pollstar data. The data also says that the tour is the first ever to gross $1 billion. On the personal front too, 2024 has been kind to Taylor as she has managed to cement her romance with Kansas City Chief’s Travis Kelce.In fact, just a day after Thanksgiving, Taylor, donning an ""87"" necklace in honor of Travis' number, joined Travis's mom Donna Kelce at the Kansas City Chiefs' game against the Las Vegas Raiders on November 29. Taylor’s dad Scott Swift also joined the happy gathering. It’s safe to say things are moving fast for the Swift-Kelce romance and fans have come up with several theories on Taylor’s influence on Travis Kelce and NFL.Fans have coined the term ‘Tayvoodoo’ to describe the Grammy winner’s influence on Travis’s games. Travis and Jason Kelce referred to the phenomenon on December 4, during the episode of their “New Heights” podcast. “Rookie of the Year, there’s so many good ones. Angels in the Outfield. I’d love to f—-ing feel what it’s like,” Travis referred to the 1994 film, which follows an underdog basketball team.Jason said, “I feel like you guys [the Kansas City Chiefs] are the Angels in the Outfield. There’s some unknown like …”“Here you go with this f–ing Tayvoodoo s–t again,” Travis said. “This dude is such a d–khead.” The tight end has had a slow season this year; Kelce has only managed 569 yards through 11 games, and his touchdown count is stuck at just two, which is unusual for someone like Kelce who is known for his consistency. However, Taylor’s influence has introduced millions of fans to the world of the NFL, which has also helped Travis’s profile, despite an underwhelming year. The Chiefs vs. Jets game featuring Taylor in the stands hit 27 million viewers—the highest number of non-Super Bowl Sunday viewers.It’s important to remember that the NFL is a league that thrives on ratings, advertisements and commercial popularity. Whether Taylor’s cheering for him in the stands or the couple is spotted her shows, Taylor’s star power has definitely helped the NFL player and his league. Earlier this year, he signed a two-year extension worth $34 million. His jersey sales reportedly spiked by 400% after the couple started dating. The league clearly approves of Taylor’s influence on Travis’ popularity, which doesn’t just draw in more crowd but also translates to commercial gains for the league.The NFL enjoyed a record-breaking holiday period, the Chiefs-Raiders Thanksgiving showdown saw a significant jump in viewership compared to last year's Miami Dolphins-New York Jets game. As per some reports, the ‘Swift bump’ has led to a 20 per cent increase in sponsorships for the NFL and viewership has increased by 53 per cent among teenage female viewers.Now that Taylor is Spotify’s most streamed artist, chances are influence will also translate into enhanced global popularity for the NFL. By catering to the Swifties, the NFL is tapping into a new market, exploring avenues for growth through pop culture intersections. Collaborations or promotions that include Taylor’s music could create unique experiences for fans.Following Taylor’s Spotify win, ror the first time, Spotify is adding a Wrapped badge to Taylor Swift’s Spotify profile. Moreover, Spotify is launching an Easter egg experience for Swifties as listeners can now see custom mini-animations tailored to the eras of Taylor’s discography on the app’s play button, while listening to her songs. Moreover, following a new partnership with Snapchat, Swifties can now go for 2024 Wrapped bracelets featuring a Global Top Artist Badge charm through an AR lens in the Snapchat app.Also read: What Taylor Swift’s Spotify Wrapped 2024 Win Means for the NFL and Travis Kelce","Taylor Swift has ranked as the No. 1 most-streamed artist globally in 2024 on Spotify, for the second year in a row.

NEW DELHI: Residents in Delhi experienced some relief on Thursday as the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) improved to the ‘moderate’ category following weeks of severe pollution. The AQI was recorded at 161 as of 8am according to the Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ).Despite the improvement, a thin layer of smog covered the city as winter set in, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reporting a minimum temperature of 9°C, accompanied by mist in the air.The AQI varied across different areas of Delhi, with Anand Vihar at 178, Chandni Chowk at 194, and ITO at 130, all falling under the 'moderate' category. However, areas like RK Puram (204), Mundka (222), and Shadipur (249) recorded 'poor' air quality.An AQI between 101-200 is categorized as 'moderate,' 201-300 as 'poor,' and 301-400 as 'very poor.' The city had been grappling with 'severe' and 'very poor' air quality post-Diwali, leading to breathing difficulties and health complaints among residents.To tackle the worsening pollution, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-IV measures were enforced, including a ban on BS-IV diesel-operated medium and heavy goods vehicles, except for essential services.As the winter chill sets in, Delhi’s minimum temperature dropped to 9°C on Thursday, signaling the onset of colder weather.

AEW's Meteoric Rise and the Veteran Influence

ALSO READ:

All Elite Wrestling (AEW) has rapidly grown its presence within the professional wrestling world. Launched in 2019 by Tony Khan , AEW occupies a new space within wrestling via coherent storytelling and truly diverse talent. One such factor contributing to AEW's success has been the recent inclusivity of veteran talents like Adam Copeland (aka Edge) and Christian Cage . These seasoned warriors have bestowed years of experience and star power upon the company, taking the product to the next level. However, somewhat recently, the two had an admirable outlook on the growth of the company and rose to discuss their working experiences under Khan.During an interview with FOX , Cage and Copeland shared their experience on their journey so far.Cage said, ""I think people also forget the fact that we’re a company that’s still in its infancy. The company has only been around for five years. So, yes, there’s still going to be growing pains. The company has grown tremendously in that time — probably faster than any wrestling promotion in history. We’re putting how many thousands of people at Wembley Stadium two years in a row. It’s unheard of how fast this company has grown. But people should take into account that there’s still things to iron out when you’re that young of a company, and we have a very young roster also.""Cage, in particular, has been instrumental in guiding younger talent and helping to shape the company's direction. He has often spoken about the challenges and opportunities that come with being part of a new wrestling promotion. However, as per FOX, Copeland said, “It just seems like people forget a little bit of history. Like, I was with WWE through some pretty lean years. It happens. It’s a cyclical business, and every business has the growing pains.”""I think if you look at any company in their fifth year of existence, I think we’re doing pretty damn good. There’s different tastes. It’s different flavors. I’ve never understood the anger toward another company, and that goes both ways. I don’t really get that, personally. If you don’t like it, you don’t like it. OK.He further noted, ""No wrestling promoter’s conventional. I’ve yet to meet one that is conventional. The chances are if you’re promoting wrestling, you think differently. And you’re probably wired differently. When I think about the people I’ve worked for, they all have their different processes. Tony has so much going for him and so many different companies and businesses, but his bandwidth just seems to be never-ending.”""I always tell him it’s Tony time because there’s no way I could keep those hours. He just seems to be like the Eveready bunny. He just keeps going, and it’s infectious, too. I remember when I brought my girls to the first show, and he came running up, and he knew their names. And he said, ‘I’m so excited to have you here,’ and then he took off. And they were like, ‘Dad, who’s that?’ I was like, ‘That’s my boss.’ And they were like, ‘Whoa, he’s so nice and really exciting and cool.’ And I was like, ‘OK, right, he is.’""Tony Khan's approach to AEW makes him ever unique, blending fun and accomplishment for AEW. Being wealthy and having a deep love for wrestling, this year has seen him assemble a list that is impressive and talented, backed up with top-class production values. AEW is set to pull the curtains on 2024 with a bang, as the promotion gears up for its final PPV event of the year, World’s End.",All Elite Wrestling (AEW) has rapidly grown its presence within the professional wrestling world.

"Airbus cuts over 2,000 jobs amidst competition from Elon Musk's Starlink",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/airbus-cuts-over-2000-jobs-amidst-competition-from-elon-musks-starlink/articleshow/116002827.cms,"Germany will shoulder the primary burden of workforce reductions with 689 positions.

Airbus job cuts : Airbus has announced approximately 2,000 job cuts in its Defence and Space division, representing 5% of its second-largest unit. The company faces challenges from American competition in satellites, though the job cuts were less extensive than initially indicated by the company.European satellite manufacturers, traditionally specialising in sophisticated geostationary spacecraft, have struggled against the emergence of cost-effective small satellites in low Earth orbit, particularly due to the rapid expansion of "" Elon Musk 's Starlink constellation"".The Space Systems business will bear the majority of the 2,043 position cuts, with 1,128 roles affected following significant satellite-related losses. The European aerospace organisation confirmed there would be no forced redundancies.Germany will shoulder the primary burden of workforce reductions with 689 positions, whilst France faces 540 cuts, Britain 477, Spain 303, and other peripheral nations 34, according to a Reuters report.The establishment of Airbus by these four nations over five decades ago makes the distribution of workforce reductions a delicate political matter.France hosts Airbus's main headquarters and primary jetliner production, whilst Germany oversees defence and space operations. Spain manages military transport aircraft assembly, and Britain specialises in satellite payloads and communications systems.Airbus, which manufactures satellites, transporters and holds significant stakes in European missile, fighter and space-launch initiatives, issued a statement after Reuters disclosed the job cuts during union briefings regarding an efficiency assessment.Following October's announcement of potential cuts of up to 2,500 positions (7% of workforce) due to €1.5 billion in satellite-related writedowns, particularly affecting OneSat, Airbus has now detailed specific reductions: 250 positions in Air Power, 47 in Connected Intelligence, and 618 posts at divisional headquarters.These reductions are distinct from "" Project Bromo "", a proposed merger of Airbus, Thales and Leonardo's satellite operations to enhance competitiveness against Starlink. Both initiatives reflect efforts to strengthen Europe's space sector against mounting competition.The implementation of these job cuts, scheduled for completion by mid-2026, primarily targets administrative and management positions rather than operational roles, focusing on reducing overhead and fixed expenses.The governments of the founding nations, including France and Germany each holding 11% ownership, have received briefings about these reductions, which form part of the Proton reorganisation initiative.The proposed staff reductions constitute roughly 5% of the division's workforce, according to Airbus. This percentage suggests a slight increase in divisional staff numbers this year, as the cuts represent 6% of the reported workforce at end-2023.France's Thales, which maintains two collaborative ventures with Italy's Leonardo in satellites and services, is currently discussing plans with unions regarding 1,300 space-related position reductions.","Airbus has announced approximately 2,000 job cuts in its Defence and Space division, representing 5% of its second-largest unit.

""It would be profoundly un-American to use political power to harm competitors and give an advantage to your own business interests.""

""I’m not that worried about it,""

Elon Musk has sued OpenAI and its close ally Microsoft

Why Sam Altman says he is not worried

""I don’t think Elon would do it,"" Altman said, emphasizing that the public would not tolerate any misuse of political power for business gain.

ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed confidence that Tesla CEO Elon Musk would not use his influence with President-elect Donald Trump to undermine business rivals, calling such actions ""profoundly un-American."" Speaking at the New York Times DealBook conference, on November 4, Altman addressed concerns surrounding Musk's new role as head of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in Trump administration. There are worries in some quarters that Musk might leverage the position to benefit his own companies.Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been quite open about his 'dislike' for OpenAI CEO Altman.He added that, despite Musk’s polarizing persona, using political power for personal gain would go against values Musk holds dear.Altman said.Musk, who co-founded OpenAI before departing from the organization, is currently suing OpenAI and Microsoft. Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI accuses the organization of abandoning its founding commitment to serve the public good. He has also sought a federal court order to block OpenAI's transition to a more profit-driven model.Musk claims that they have strayed from the nonprofit mission originally envisioned for the company. Musk has also launched xAI, which, according to the Wall Street Journal, is now valued at $50 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable startups.Altman called the ongoing legal dispute with Musk ""tremendously sad,"" reflecting on a time when he viewed Musk as a ""mega hero.""Musk, who has become a close ally of Trump, was heavily involved in the 2016 presidential campaign, spending over $100 million to support Trump's bid and attending rallies. He has remained a prominent figure in the Trump administration’s transition, reportedly even joining a call when Google CEO Sundar Pichai congratulated Trump on his election victory.Musk's businesses, including SpaceX and Tesla, maintain significant ties with both U.S. and foreign governments. His potential new role has sparked concerns about conflicts of interest. Despite these concerns, Altman expressed that he isn't overly worried about Musk's influence within the incoming administration.",Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been quite open about his 'dislike' for OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.
