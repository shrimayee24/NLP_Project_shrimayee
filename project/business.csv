Karnataka high court: Hospital name change can’t be grounds to deny reimbursement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-hosp-name-change-cant-be-grounds-to-deny-reimbursement/articleshow/123890799.cms,"Representative image

BENGALURU: Karnataka HC’s Dharwad bench slammed state government for using bureaucratic red tape to deny medical reimbursement, ruling that an associate professor’s claim of nearly Rs 14 lakh could not be rejected simply because a hospital changed its name.Justice Suraj Govindaraj called the denial “arbitrary and legally unsustainable” after authorities refused to reimburse Shivanandappa Doddagoudar, associate professor at a government first-grade college in Haveri’s Ranebennur. His treatment at Kasturba Medical College Hospital, Manipal, was rejected on grounds that the institution later updated its name to Kasturba Hospital, Manipal.Doddagoudar said the hospital was on govt’s approved list under Karnataka Government Servants (Medical Attendance) Rules, 1963. The hospital formally sought a name correction in March 2021. Despite the request, officials failed to update the recognised list and rejected reimbursement claims.The state higher education department and Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust had contended that only hospitals listed under their exact names could qualify and any deviation was unacceptable.Justice Govindaraj disagreed, saying the hospital had already been vetted and approved: “Mere change of nomenclature did not alter the hospital’s identity or services.” The court has directed higher education department to reconsider the reimbursement claim within six weeks.",Karnataka HC’s Dharwad bench slammed state government for using bureaucratic red tape to deny medical reimbursement.

Earlier, the Ahmednagar district was renamed as Ahilyanagar district, PTI reported.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , who had pursued the matter, thanked Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw for granting the approval.Chief inmister Devendra Fadnavis and deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde were also involved in the efforts, a statement from Pawar’s office said.Last month, Pawar had written to Vaishnaw urging that the station be renamed to align with the city’s new name.“This long-pending demand has now been fulfilled. The renaming holds special significance as we are celebrating the 300th birth anniversary year of Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar,” Pawar said.Several organisations and citizens had been demanding that the railway station’s name be changed after the city was renamed Ahilyanagar.Pawar also said efforts are underway to rename Aurangabad railway station as Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar railway station.Earlier, a similar thing was done by Karnataka government but that didn't go well with Fadnavis. The Congress government in Karnataka moved to rename Shivajinagar metro rail station in Bengaluru after St Mary.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah recently said his government would consider renaming Bengaluru's Shivajinagar metro station after St Mary following a request made during the annual feast at St Mary's Basilica.

"Monsoon starts an early withdrawal from Rajasthan, marking its retreat from the country",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monsoon-starts-an-early-withdrawal-from-rajasthan/articleshow/123889382.cms,"NEW DELHI: The southwest (summer) monsoon started withdrawing from some parts of west Rajasthan on Sunday against the normal date of Sept 17, the IMD said. It marked the beginning of this year’s monsoon retreat from the country. Normally, the withdrawal process ends on Oct 15 - a few days ahead of the onset of winter monsoon in Peninsular India.It’s the earliest withdrawal of monsoon since 2015, when the retreat began on Sept 4, under the old regime where the normal date of beginning of the withdrawal used to be Sept 1 based on records during 1901-1940.It's also the earliest withdrawal since 2020 under the new regime when the normal date was revised as Sept 17 based on data during 1971-2019. Under the new regime, monsoon onset over Kerala remains the same (June 1). There is also no change in the final withdrawal date over south India (Oct 15). The normal withdrawal date for Delhi is Sept 25.Announcing the beginning of the retreat of summer monsoon on Sunday, the IMD also predicted that the conditions are favourable for its withdrawal from some more parts of Rajasthan and some parts of Punjab and Gujarat during the next 2-3 days.Meanwhile, heavy to very heavy rainfall is predicted by the Met department over northeastern states and Maharashtra for the next three days.Normally, monsoon covers the entire India in 38 days (June 1-July 8). This year, it covered the entire country in 37 days after making an early onset on May 24 and covering the whole India by June 29.Though early onset/withdrawal or coverage has nothing to do with the overall status of the monsoon, it certainly guides farming activities, and water and hydro-power management during the rainy season.Early onset of monsoon helped farmers begin early sowing of kharif (summer sown) crops this year. The early withdrawal by just three days will, however, not impact the acreage as the sowing operation has already completed in most parts of the country. Even all key reservoirs have enough water to sustain the Rabi (winter sown) crops during Oct-March cycle.IMD has predicted an 'above normal' monsoon this year and it's already reflected in over 7% more than normal cumulative (June 1 - Sept 14) rainfall in the country so far with northwest India recording nearly 32% more than normal rainfall during the period, leading to multiple disasters including flooding and crop damage in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir.Except east & northeast India that faced a cumulative rainfall deficit of nearly 20%, the rest of the country received surplus rainfall with the central India getting 10.5% more than normal rainfall and south peninsular India getting 7.5% more than normal rainfall during the monsoon season.Good rainfall this year in most parts of the country helped increase the total acreage (1105 lakh hectares) which is more than last year (1078 lakh hectares) and also more than the normal acreage (1096 lakh hectares) for Kharif crops.","The southwest (summer) monsoon started withdrawing from some parts of west Rajasthan on Sunday against the normal date of Sept 17.

Amnesty scheme aims to improve compliance

NEW DELHI: In a move that could bring relief to lakhs of vehicle owners, the Delhi govt is likely to launch a one-time amnesty scheme, offering 50-70% waiver on outstanding traffic challans. Expected to roll out in the coming months, the scheme aims to reduce the massive backlog of unpaid challans and ease the burden on the judicial system.Officials indicated violators may be given a 2-3-month window to pay the reduced fines.A transport department official said the proposal was discussed at a high-level meeting. ""This will be a one-time relaxation for two-, three-, and four-wheeler owners. People should treat it as an opportunity to clear dues because stricter penalties, such as registration cancellation, could follow,"" the official said.The idea is to clear long-pending challans without the fear of hefty penalties, reduce court caseloads, and improve compliance,"" another senior official said.The scheme will apply to both traffic and transport challans. While the transport department issues challans for violations like expired pollution clearance certificates (PUCC), wrong-side driving, and overloading, traffic police handle offences including helmetless riding, red-light jumping, and speeding.Only non-serious violations will be covered un-der the amnesty. Drunk driving, unauthorised driving, and driving without a valid licence, and other serious offences will not be covered in the scheme.E-challans are considered a better mechanism to deal with violators because they are presented with photographic proof captured by cameras. Traffic policemen or transport department enforcement teams often use an app to record violations, which they capture on their phone. A text notice informs the violator on his registered phone about the infraction and the fine can be paid online on the website.Still, many violators delay payments, waiting for Lok Adalat sessions where fines are often reduced. The absence of interest or penalties on delayed payments also discourages timely compliance. Infrastructure issues - faulty signals, poor signage, and confusing road layouts - further contribute to disputes and non-payment.Currently, minor (compoundable) challans can be settled on the spot, while serious (non-compoundable) ones go through virtual or district courts, adding to the legal backlog. ""If this scheme doesn't see proper response, the department may take stricter measures like cancelling registrations,"" an official warned.""Under Union road transport ministry rules, the transport department has even the authority to disallow those with multiple pending challans from accessing online transactions related to their vehicles by putting it in 'not to be transacted' category on the Vahan portal,"" the official said.","The scheme aims to reduce the massive backlog of unpaid challans and ease the burden on the judicial system.

In spring, clocks are moved forward to extend evening daylight, while in autumn, clocks are set back to give more light in the mornings.Under current federal rules set by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, DST begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November. Next year, clocks will move forward again on Sunday, March 8, 2026.Most US states follow DST, but not all. Hawaii and most of Arizona do not observe the change, citing limited benefit due to their climates.

Understanding solar eclipses – Types and what to expect

Total solar eclipse



The Moon completely covers the Sun.

Observers in a narrow zone experience brief daylight darkness.

Spectacular but rare. Partial solar eclipse



Only part of the Sun is covered by the Moon.

Creates a crescent or “bitten” appearance of the Sun.

This is the type occurring on September 21, 2025. Annular solar eclipse



The Moon is farther from Earth and doesn’t fully cover the Sun.

A ring of sunlight remains visible, forming the “ring of fire” effect.





In an extraordinary celestial turn, September 2025 is bookended by two eclipses, a lunar eclipse on the 7th and a solar eclipse just 15 days later. While the Moon recently turned a vivid red in a dramatic lunar display, the sky will offer another rare phenomenon: a partial solar eclipse on September 21, timed just before the equinox. However, this spectacle won’t be visible everywhere, and the UAE is among the regions that will miss it.The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21. Unlike a total eclipse, this will be a partial solar eclipse, where the Moon covers only part of the Sun, creating a crescent-shaped sliver of sunlight. Even as a partial eclipse, it provides a rare chance to observe the Sun’s changing face.This event holds additional significance because it closely precedes the September equinox, which falls on September 22, 2025. The equinox is one of two moments in the year when the Sun is directly above the Earth’s equator, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths across the globe. Because of this timing, the eclipse is also being called an ""equinox eclipse"", adding to its astronomical and symbolic intrigue.The event also carries cultural and astrological meaning. This year's Pitru Paksha — a fortnight in the Hindu calendar dedicated to ancestral remembrance and rituals — uniquely begins with a lunar eclipse and ends with this solar eclipse, a rare alignment astrologers consider especially potent.This celestial pairing not only marks an important astronomical event but also deepens the spiritual significance of Pitru Paksha for many observers.Also Read: Saudi National Day 2025 The September 21 partial solar eclipse will be visible only in specific parts of the Southern Hemisphere, offering clear views to skywatchers in select regions.Skywatchers in visible regions must use proper solar filters or eclipse glasses to view the partial eclipse safely.Unlike the lunar eclipse on September 7, which had wide visibility across many countries, this solar eclipse will not be visible in the UAE or most parts of the Northern Hemisphere.Countries that will not witness any part of the eclipse include:This means millions of skywatchers across Asia and the Americas will miss the event entirely — a sharp contrast to the global excitement generated by the earlier lunar eclipse.A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, partially or fully blocking sunlight in specific areas on Earth. These alignments don’t happen frequently in the same place due to the precise positioning required.There are three main types of solar eclipses:Although this particular eclipse is not a total one, its timing, rarity, and symbolic links to the equinox and Pitru Paksha make it a notable event in the 2025 celestial calendar.This will be the last solar eclipse of 2025, concluding a year that featured two solar eclipses","The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21. Unlike a total eclipse, this will be a partial solar eclipse, where the Moon covers only part of the Sun. This event holds additional significance because it closely precedes the September equinox, which falls on September 22, 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123822909,imgsize-774733,width-400,resizemode-4/solar-eclipse.jpg"
ITR filing FY 2025-26: Has deadline for Income Tax Returns filing been extended beyond September 15? Income Tax Department clarifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-2025-has-the-deadline-been-pushed-beyond-september-15-what-income-tax-dept-said/articleshow/123891607.cms,"Representative image

ITR Filing Deadline Extended: Why It Happened And What To Do Now? | Income Tax Return | Explained





The Income Tax department on Sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) had been extended beyond September 15, clarifying that the due date remains unchanged.In a post on X, the department said: “A fake news is in circulation stating that the due of filing ITRs (originally due on 31.07.2025, and extended to 15.09.2025) has been further extended to 30.09.2025. The due date for filing ITRs remains 15.09.2025.”The clarification came amid a wave of unverified messages circulating online.The I-T department has urged taxpayers to rely only on updates from its verified handle @IncomeTaxIndia and avoid being misled by false claims. It further noted that its helpdesk is working “on a 24x7 basis” to support taxpayers with ITR filing, tax payment and other related services through calls, live chats, WebEx sessions and X.Over six crore ITRs had already been filed for the Assessment Year 2025-26 as of Saturday.The department thanked taxpayers and professionals for their efforts, while reminding those yet to file to do so before the September 15 deadline to avoid last-minute delays, penalties and interest.The filing window had originally closed on July 31 but was extended to September 15 due to revisions introduced in ITR forms earlier this year.These “structural and content revisions” were rolled out in April–May, requiring changes to filing utilities and back-end systems, which prompted the extension.While this relaxation covered individuals, HUFs and non-audit entities, officials have underlined that a further extension is “unlikely.”Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, though this attracts late fees under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act — Rs 1,000 for income up to Rs 5 lakh and Rs 5,000 for income above that threshold.Delays also trigger interest liabilities under Sections 234A, 234B and 234C. Moreover, belated filers are shifted to the new tax regime by default and lose the ability to carry forward certain business or capital losses.ITR submissions have been steadily rising in recent years. For AY 2024-25, a record 7.28 crore returns were filed by July 31, 2024, up from 6.77 crore the previous year, marking a 7.5% annual increase.With Monday marking the final day, the department has reiterated its appeal: file early, comply on time, and avoid penalties.",The Income Tax department on Sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) had been extended beyond September 15.

Riyadh Season 2025-26 is poised to become the most ambitious and expansive cultural festival Saudi Arabia has ever hosted. Opening this October and continuing through the winter months into early 2026, the sixth edition of the season promises a meticulously curated lineup of mega-events, from the world’s largest comedy festival and elite tennis tournaments to major music festivals, boxing showdowns, and the Kingdom’s first-ever WrestleMania announcement. Rooted in Saudi Vision 2030, the season combines global talent, regional artistry, immersive entertainment zones, and record-breaking spectacles, reaffirming Riyadh’s rise as a global hub for culture, sport, and celebration.Since its inception in 2019 as part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, Riyadh Season has rapidly transformed from a domestic entertainment initiative into a globally recognised cultural phenomenon. The aim was clear: diversify the economy, promote tourism, and position Riyadh as a vibrant, forward-looking city.In just six years, Riyadh Season has become a global spectacle. The 2024 edition attracted 20 million visitors with 14 themed zones, 11 sports championships including UFC Fight Night, and a dozen of festivals. In 2025, highlights include the debut Six Kings Slam tennis event, Riyadh Comedy Festival, MDLBEAST Soundstorm, WWE Royal Rumble, and a strong focus on Arabic cultural performances.HE Turki Alalshikh, Chairman of the General Entertainment Authority (GEA), has reiterated that Riyadh Season 2025-26 will place special focus on Arab talent, with a particular emphasis on Saudi, Khaleeji, and Syrian music and theatre. Local creativity and storytelling will share the stage with international icons, making for a culturally inclusive program.Riyadh’s major event hubs for the 2025 season will once again include Boulevard City, Al Suwaidi Park, Boulevard World, and the Kingdom Arena, each hosting a diverse range of concerts, sports, and cultural activities. Returning permanent attractions like The Groves, an elegant European-style district known for luxury dining and retail, will continue to offer visitors an upscale experience. Connecting these vibrant zones is the innovative cable car system, providing easy access and stunning views while linking key areas to enhance visitor flow and convenience throughout the festival.From October through early 2026, Riyadh will once again become a global hub for entertainment, sport, and cultural engagement. At the centre of this effort is HE Turki Alalshikh, Chairman of the General Entertainment Authority (GEA), who has confirmed that Riyadh Season 2025-26 will place a renewed emphasis on Arabic content, with a particular focus on Syrian theatrical performances and musical concerts, alongside shows from the Gulf region and local Saudi talent.Cultural productions will be supported under the supervision of the GEA, and venues such as Boulevard City and Al Suwaidi Park are expected to attract significant footfall due to their expanded programming. Alongside these traditional elements, Riyadh Season 2025 will introduce major new collaborations and entertainment firsts.One of the most talked-about developments for Riyadh Season 2025-26 is the new partnership with MrBeast, the global YouTube sensation. This marks his first-ever collaboration in Saudi Arabia, promising exclusive content and immersive fan experiences tailored specifically for the festival.The campaign is still underway, with more global events, celebrity appearances, and concert lineups expected to be announced soon, keeping anticipation high among fans worldwide.Among the major confirmed events are:Set across Boulevard City and ANB Arena, this inaugural event is being touted as the biggest comedy festival in the world. It will host 50 of the world’s top comedians, with confirmed appearances by Aziz Ansari, Pete Davidson Russell Peters , Tom Segura, and Dave Chappelle. The festival will merge global comedy cultures with local hospitality, creating a space where humour becomes a cross-cultural dialogue.Returning after a spectacular debut in 2024, the Six Kings Slam will again feature six of the ATP’s top-ranked players in a high-stakes, knockout-format tournament. The confirmed lineup includes Novak Djokovic , Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev, Jack Draper, and Taylor Fritz, all listed as per the PIF ATP Ranking. The winner will take home an eye-watering $6 million, reinforcing the event’s status as one of the most lucrative and prestigious exhibition tournaments outside of the official Grand Slams.Hosted at the King Saud University Indoor Arena, the WTA Finals return to Riyadh following successful previous runs. This edition will once again bring together the top eight singles players and top eight doubles teams on the women’s circuit. World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, despite missing out on a Wimbledon title earlier this year, has already secured her spot — making this her fifth consecutive appearance at the prestigious year-end event.MDLBEAST will once again orchestrate one of the region’s most electrifying music festivals. Soundstorm 25 will take place over three days in December and is expected to build on the immense success of last year’s edition, which featured global acts like Eminem, ASAP Rocky, Linkin Park, Argy, and Armin Van Buuren, alongside top regional talent including Bayou, Dish Dash, and Narkbeat. This year, organisers have promised an even more powerful lineup, bolstered by cutting-edge production and a continuously expanding music scene in the Kingdom.In a historic first, the WWE Royal Rumble’s 39th edition will be held in Riyadh — the first time the event is being hosted outside the United States. Scheduled to take place at the Kingdom Arena, it will feature both men’s and women’s Royal Rumble matches, with the winners earning the coveted opportunity to compete at WrestleMania.This builds on the growing relationship between WWE and Saudi Arabia, and on September 12, 2025, WWE® and TKO Group Holdings officially announced that WrestleMania 43 will also be hosted in Riyadh in 2027, making Saudi Arabia the first country outside North America to host the flagship wrestling event.One of Riyadh Season’s defining strengths is its immersive and diverse entertainment zones, which transform Riyadh’s urban landscape into a vast festival ground. Last season featured 14 major zones, with Boulevard City and Boulevard World serving as the primary hubs of activity. These key venues are seamlessly connected by an innovative cable car system, allowing visitors to easily explore a wide range of experiences across the city. Alongside these flagship zones, there are many other specialized venues, such as Al Suwaidi Park, Kingdom Arena, ANB Arena, The Groves, and Winter Wonderland, each offering unique entertainment, cultural showcases, and family-friendly attractions that together create a rich, multi-dimensional festival atmosphere.Boulevard City is a dynamic entertainment district offering an exciting mix of shopping, restaurants, and live concerts. It features year-round performances and vibrant social spaces, making it the lively core of Riyadh Season where culture, leisure, and music seamlessly blend.Boulevard World hosts globally themed pavilions showcasing traditional crafts, performances, and cultural exhibits from participating countries.

"Packed trains, stretched metro: Bengaluru's Yellow Line strains city’s older routes; commuters face peak-hour crunch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/yellow-line-surge-strains-bengaluru-metros-older-routes/articleshow/123886855.cms,"Since its launch a few weeks ago, the Yellow Line has pushed daily ridership across the Namma Metro network past the 10-lakh mark





BENGALURU: The launch of the Yellow Line a month ago has significantly increased ridership across Namma Metro's network, putting considerable strain on the Purple and Green lines during peak hours. Commuters are left crammed into trains as security personnel rush to push passengers inside to ensure the doors close on time.Despite the rising demand, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL) cannot deploy additional trains on the 77km Purple and Green line networks, which currently operate 57 trains. The root cause is the shared supply chain: both sets of lines depend on rolling stock from the same China-based manufacturer, CRRC.In Dec 2019, BMRCL signed an agreement with CRRC Nanjing for 126 standard-gauge Metro cars for the Purple and Green lines and 90 cars for Yellow Line. However, because of a combination of factors, including manufacturing and shipping delays, deliveries have been slow.So far, only four trainsets have been received for the Yellow Line — one prototype from CRRC in China and three through its partner Titagarh Rail Systems.The 19km Yellow Line was launched with just three trainsets operating at 25-minute intervals. The fourth train was inducted on Sept 10, improving frequency to 19 minutes.A senior BMRCL official said: ""Though frequency has improved, waiting times remain high. We are optimally using the available fleet. The line needs at least eight trainsets to run at a 10-minute frequency while also allowing for maintenance. Our focus is on inducting more Yellow Line trains and pushing the supplier accordingly. Delays from the sixth trainset onwards are due to shipping delays from China.""The official added that once Yellow Line reaches eight trainsets, efforts will shift to supplying new trains for the Green and Purple lines. A prototype train for the Purple Line was received in Jan and is currently undergoing tests during non-revenue hours. BMRCL aims to submit the required documentation within a month to seek clearance from the Research Designs and Standards Organisation.At present, 55 trains operate during peak hours on the Purple and Green lines, with two others kept on standby. Daily, there are 185 trips on Purple Line and 163 on Green Line.Commuters feel the strain. ""After Yellow Line opened, trains are packed during peak hours. By the time the train reaches Yeshwantpur, it's already full. From Majestic to RV Road, there's hardly any space left to stand,"" said Yogeesh R, a regular user.Since its launch, the Yellow Line has pushed daily ridership across the network past the 10 lakh mark, underscoring the urgent need for additional trains.","The launch of the Yellow Line a month ago has significantly increased ridership across Namma Metro's network.

On weekends, rows of cars slow down next to the Yamuna Expressway's fence, and families step to waving ""salesmen"" standing on the other side.Cross the barrier, walk down a muddy slope and you are welcomed into a ""township project"". It's the hottest property right now, they tell you. Boundary walls, brick demarcations, neatly planted hedges, wide bitumen, partially built roads and fluttering flags give the impression.""Aadhe ghantey mein airport (the airport is just half an hour away),"" say the dealers. That's the easiest sales pitch, of course. Anyone who has come from the Delhi, Noida side has seen the hull of Noida International Airport's terminal to the left and a shiny new cloverleaf that will, in a few months' time, serve as its main approach.So, yes. The airport is indeed close by. ""Good location, no doubt,"" murmurs a prospective buyer. That's the first step towards getting conned by this elaborate charade put up by delinquent dealers and land sharks who have, since the airport's construction began, been luring hundreds of people through ads on Instagram and YouTube and forwards on WhatsApp, to buy plots near the airport. Plots that are not theirs to sell.Multiple such networks operate, their modus operandi similar. Salespersons contact buyers, arrange car pickups to the spot, which from Noida is nearly 80 km, and take them to manicured 'show plots'. With fake maps, buyers are assured that this is private land, beyond Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority's (YEIDA) notified area. Please pay a token amount to book this plot, they say. ""You see, sir, there is high interest. No guarantees that you will get this.""In reality, these 'projects' all fall within Khair tehsil of Aligarh district and are part of 92 notified villages earmarked for development under Master Plan 2031, Phase 2. The distance from Delhi to Khair is over 100 km and from Noida is around 80 km. Residential property prices, according to agents, range from Rs 16,000 to Rs 18,000 per gaj ((square yard), while commercial property prices range from Rs 18,000 to Rs 24,000 per gaj.The fraud begins just after crossing the Jewar toll plaza when you enter Khair tehsil. At Simrauthi village, a project called Sri Tulsi Vatika was carved out on over 200 bighas of land.A visit to the site by TOI has revealed scores of families scouting the township.Aryan, a salesman, greets visitors warmly. ""The Noida airport is just 24km from here. Film City and other mega projects are also coming up. This is the right time to invest,"" he said, pointing at a half-finished service lane he insists will soon connect directly to the expressway.Plots, he explains, start from 50 gaj (yards) and go up to 200 gaj, with larger sizes available on ""custom request.""Asked if the prices are negotiable, his response is immediate: ""Why not? Once you select the plot, we can sit across the table.""Documents shown by Aryan carry the name of Dheeraj Kumar, allegedly the landowner. On 40% payment, the buyer can build a boundary wall, he assured.On the next 20%, possession and registry will follow. The remaining 40% can be cleared in instalments over a year. There is no bank loan facility, but flexible ""in-house finance"" is offered.When confronted with reports about illegal colonies, Aryan dismissed them. ""Our project is completely safe. You can check legality of the land on the govt's Bhulekh website. There are many projects where the same plot is sold to multiple buyers. We are not like that,"" he said, shifting blame on rivals. He even shared land documents on WhatsApp, claiming the land was cleared for non-agricultural purposes.Just a few kilometres away, there's another township named Shri Hari Vatika in Dewaka. A request for a brochure was never fulfilled.Instead, the brochure they flaunted claimed to deal in residential, industrial and institutional properties in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway area, but failed to mention any specific property.Their salesmen told people that the project is next to Taj International School, which is just a dilapidated building. A query about a 150 gaj plot was enough for the salesman to offer an already demarcated plot next to the entry gate of the township.Interestingly, in all these townships, the land seems to expand endlessly. Developers say the project will cover 200 bighas, but its scope will increase as more farmland is cleared after harvest. They also claim they can arrange the registry and mutation papers as well. Any proof about YEIDA's action against illegal colonies, which was widely reported in newspapers, is deflected.Be it Ghanghauli village's ""Ganga City project"" or any other townships, their websites display vague layouts and stock images, with no mention of actual ownership or developer details. Also, such projects - spread over hundreds of bighas - carry no Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Rera) registration. Representatives of developers, however, claim that their land is freehold and located next to the village, so they do not require YEIDA's permission. They further argue that, being outside Rera's jurisdiction, registration under the Act is not mandatory.YEIDA's jurisdiction spans six districts - GB Nagar, Bulandshahr, Hathras, Aligarh, Mathura and Agra.With development projects such as the airport, Film City, Logistic Park and Heritage City, land prices surged dramatically, making the region a prime area for land grabbing and unauthorised real estate activities.The menace is not hidden from YEIDA. Over the past three years, the Authority carried out around 25 major anti-encroachment operations, reclaiming land valued at nearly Rs 2,500 crore from illegal possession.A senior YEIDA official stressed the need for public awareness. ""People are lured by the dream of owning property near the airport. But they must remember, if it is not allotted or approved by YEIDA, it is illegal, no matter how real it looks on the ground. Don't fall for weekend site visits and free cab rides. Verify before you buy,"" he said.YEIDA officials admit the scale of illegal plotting ballooned in recent years. YEIDA CEO RK Singh said he wrote to the DGP to fill sanctioned police posts within the authority. ""We will intensify our drive in the coming days, especially during weekends,"" he told TOI.Against the sanctioned 17 cops, only two are posted. Sensitive zones near Jewar, Vrindavan and Tappal remain under regular watch. Yet, the sheer spread of fraudulent societies makes enforcement a daunting task.In May, over 27 ha of encroached land valued at more than Rs 400 crore was reclaimed in Aligarh's Simrauthi, Hetalpur and Tappal villages.The Authority issued notices to over 300 developers in areas such as Tappal in Aligarh, Jewar and Jahangirpur in Gautam Budh Nagar and parts of Mathura.YEIDA has initiated legal proceedings against those involved in unauthorised construction. In Aligarh, FIRs were filed against 57 people for their roles in illegal projects.To strengthen enforcement, a retired DSP-rank officer and ex-Army officer have been roped in to protect YEIDA-owned land from illegal colonisers and land mafias.In July, authorities in Aligarh seized over 40,000 sqm of land valued at Rs 61 crore from three members of an organised land mafia based in Noida. The land in Goraula village was allegedly acquired through forgery and deception by Ajit Kumar Raman, Shravan Kumar and Praveen Kumar Patel.Operating under a fake real estate company named GSM, the trio is accused of conning farmers and investors using fabricated documents and false promises of land appreciation. Every weekend, they staged sales events near Yamuna Expressway, luring buyers with lunch and the promise of legitimacy.Last month, Aligarh police seized property worth over Rs 33 crore in Tappal. Police teams confiscated 15,200 sqm of land belonging to realtors Mohammad Sharib Tasneem and Saad Rahman.The duo created a facade of legitimacy using fake maps and forged approvals. Along with associates, they floated a fake company, EMES Construction LLP, and siphoned off nearly Rs 1.5 crore from another firm, 21st Century Company, into accounts of relatives and associates. They illegally purchased and sold plots in Nagla Mewa village, Tappal, without YEIDA approval.The state govt approved ambitious development plans under YEIDA Master Plan 2041 and the Tappal-Bajna Urban Centre. Smart villages, industrial hubs and infrastructural corridors are planned to transform the region.","""Township projects"" are selling plots near the Noida International Airport. The plots are not theirs to sell, but are being sold by delinquent dealers and land sharks.

Snake problem





Tata Electronics semiconductor manufacturing is encountering an unexpected challenge in the forests of Assam. As Tata Electronics constructs its new chip assembly facility, it is not only about ensuring meeting technical complexities of microchip production but also with the region’s wildlife, particularly Elephants and Snakes.According to a report in the Economic Times, the company is building a massive “Elephant-Proof” wall around its upcoming outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) plant in the Morigaon district. The project, which is one of the most significant under the Rs 76,000-crore India Semiconductor Mission, is receiving proactive support from the Assam state government to address these unique logistical challenges.The need for an elephant-proof wall is not just about preventing damage to equipment. Experts told Economic Times that the concern lies in the ground vibrations caused by the elephants' heavy tread. In the world of semiconductor manufacturing, where dimensions are measured in nanometers, even a minor vibration can be catastrophic.“Ground vibrations can cause misalignments in precision equipment, leading to inaccurate measurements, distorted patterns, operational failures and ultimately faulty chips,” the report states.A semiconductor industry veteran told the publication that while vibrations are not a major concern for all OSAT plants, they pose a significant threat to ""fine-pitch assembly,"" a process requiring extremely high precision. “If the vibration shifts it even by half a micron, every pin will get shifted by half a micron, the alignment will go and Tata Electronics may lose yield,” the veteran said.In addition to the elephant problem, the plant is also dealing with an abundance of Snakes. The company has hired a team of rescuers who work full-time to capture and safely relocate the reptiles. ""These people have been there for the last three months and since then have rescued many snakes,"" a source told the newspaper.The state government is taking an active role in supporting the project. According to a state official quoted, the wall is being built ""not just for the elephants but for their security as well.” The official noted that the chief minister, industry department, and chief secretary are personally overseeing the project, ensuring the Tata Group receives full support.The new chip assembly plant, which involves an investment of Rs 27,000 crore, is attracting high-profile attention, with Elon Musk’s Tesla reportedly being a key prospective customer.Experts say that industries such as semiconductor manufacturing require strict vibration control as instruments and processes demand high stability and accuracy to function correctly. Proper foundation design and structural engineering are among the initial defences against vibration.",Tata Electronics is building a 'Elephant-Proof' wall around its upcoming semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) plant in the Morigaon district of Assam.

The 8-day winning streak of Nifty has the potential to continue supported by fundamental and technical factors. Fundamentally, earnings are set to improve moderately from Q3 FY26 onwards and accelerate in FY27 with earnings growth above 15%. Technical support to the rally can come from covering of the shorts which continue to be significant. ”“Investors should focus on sectors which have the potential to lead earnings growth.Automobiles, white goods, healthcare, cement and hotels will be the beneficiaries of earnings revival. Capital goods, telecom, consumer discretionary like jewellery and digital stocks too are on strong wicket. However, investors should avoid chasing overvalued stocks, particularly in the small cap segment.""US markets achieved their strongest weekly performance in five weeks on Friday.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"China slowdown deepens: Factory output, retail sales miss forecasts; property slump, weak demand fuel stimulus calls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-slowdown-deepens-factory-output-retail-sales-miss-forecasts-property-slump-weak-demand-fuel-stimulus-calls/articleshow/123890790.cms,"AI image

Consumer spending weakens further



Government cautions on risks ahead



Property slump deepens



Beijing pushes stimulus measures



Exports lose momentum



Investment activity falters







China’s economy lost further steam in August, with factory output and retail sales both underperforming expectations, raising pressure on Beijing to roll out fresh stimulus as weak consumption and a property slump weigh on growth.According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), industrial output rose 5.2 per cent year-on-year in August, slowing from July’s 5.7 per cent increase. The figure fell short of forecasts of 5.7 per cent in a Reuters poll and was the weakest pace since the same month last year.Manufacturing activity was hit by extreme summer weather, with China experiencing its hottest season since 1961 compounded by the longest rainy season for the same period, as per Reuters.Retail sales, a key measure of consumer demand, expanded 3.4 per cent in August, down from July’s 3.7 per cent and below expectations of 3.9 per cent. The reading marked the slowest growth since November, highlighting households’ caution as property wealth shrinks and the job market remains subdued.Households have tightened spending amid shrinking real estate wealth, while business confidence has faltered and the labour market weakened.The NBS said the economy was “generally stable” in August but admitted that “many unstable and uncertain factors in the external environment” remained. “The economy is confronted with multiple risks and challenges,” spokesperson Fu Linghui cautioned, according to the South China Morning Post.He added that policymakers must “fully implement macro policies” and focus on stabilising jobs, businesses, markets and expectations.Official data also showed that the overall urban unemployment rate edged up to 5.3 per cent in August, compared with 5.2 per cent in July.The property downturn continued to be a major drag. Official data showed new home prices slipped 0.3 per cent month-on-month in August and 2.5 per cent from a year earlier.Property investment between January and August dropped 12.9 per cent compared with the same period last year, extending a 12 per cent fall in the first seven months, the SCMP reported. New home sales by floor area were also down 4.7 per cent in the first eight months of 2025.With household wealth eroded and consumer confidence low, Beijing has been trying to stimulate spending.A year-long subsidy plan was unveiled last month to cover interest on personal consumer loans, while a trade-in programme for home appliances has boosted sales, though some provinces have already suspended parts of the scheme due to funding shortages, according to the SCMP.Externally, exports also lost momentum. Goods shipments recorded the slowest growth in six months in August, with exports to the United States plunging more than 33 per cent despite the current tariff truce, the SCMP reported.Producers on both sides of the Pacific are watching to see if the two largest economies can navigate a path beyond the truce.Investment activity weakened further, with fixed-asset investment rising only 0.5 per cent in the first eight months of 2025, down from 1.6 per cent in January to July, and well below expectations of a 1.4 per cent increase, Reuters reported.Zheng Shanjie, head of China’s state planner, pledged last week that Beijing would make “full use of fiscal and monetary policies” to help meet its annual growth goal of around 5 per cent. He also promised to fast-track new financial tools in the second half of the year.","Industrial output rose 5.2 per cent year-on-year in August, slowing from July’s 5.7 per cent.

Market watch: Asian stocks steady ahead of Fed decision; oil holds firm after Ukraine strikes Russian refineries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-watch-asian-stocks-steady-ahead-of-fed-decision-oil-holds-firm-after-ukraine-strikes-russian-refineries/articleshow/123891227.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AFP)





Asian equities were mixed on Monday as investors braced for an expected interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve later this week, while oil prices held steady after Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian refineries raised concerns about supply disruptions.Markets have rallied in recent weeks on signs of cooling US inflation and softer jobs data, which give the Fed space to resume its rate-cutting cycle.According to news agency Reuters, traders are fully pricing in a 25-basis-point reduction, taking the funds rate to 4.0–4.25 per cent, though a small chance of a larger 50-point move remains. Futures also suggest as much as 125 basis points of easing could follow over the coming months.Attention will be on the Fed’s updated projections and comments from Chair Jerome Powell, with investors looking for signals on the pace of further reductions. “After cutting policy rates 25bp, Chair Powell is likely to guide toward a series of further rate cuts,” said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief US economist at Citi, cited by Reuters.US President Donald Trump has continued pressing the central bank, saying on Sunday that “I think you have a big cut.It’s perfect for cutting.”In Asia, trading was subdued with Japan shut for a holiday. Hong Kong and Singapore edged higher, while Shanghai slipped after data showed weaker-than-expected growth in retail sales and factory output.South Korea hit another record after the government dropped plans to raise capital gains tax on investors, AFP reported.Losses were seen in Sydney, Taipei, Manila and Wellington, with Australian lender ANZ sliding after agreeing to pay a record A$240 million fine over misconduct.Meanwhile, crude oil prices were little changed in early trade after climbing more than 1 per cent last week. Brent crude added 0.4 per cent to $67.28 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate rose 0.5 per cent to $63.01, according to AFP.Reuters reported that markets remain cautious after Ukrainian drones hit major Russian energy sites, including the Primorsk terminal, which handles about one million barrels per day and the Kirishi refinery, one of Russia’s largest processing plants. JPMorgan analysts said the attacks “suggest a growing willingness to disrupt international oil markets, which has the potential to add upside pressure on oil prices. ”Geopolitics also loomed large as Washington and Beijing resumed trade talks in Madrid. The discussions, led by US treasury secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, will cover tariffs and disputes over Chinese apps.At the same time, Trump reiterated his call for Europe to match US sanctions on Russian energy, warning, “I don’t want them to buy oil.”","Markets have rallied in recent weeks on signs of cooling US inflation and softer jobs data.

US workers fired over remarks on Kirk find free speech has limits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-workers-fired-over-remarks-on-kirk-find-free-speech-has-limits/articleshow/123887434.cms,"Charlie Kirk’s Eerie Last Message Before ‘Assassin’ Tyler Shot Him | ‘Dismantle Left In U.S.'





NEW YORK: In the days following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous workers have been fired for their comments on his death, among them MSNBC political analyst Matthew Dowd.It's far from the first time workers have lost their jobs over things they say publicly - including in social media posts. In the US, laws can vary across states, but overall, there's very little legal protections for employees who are punished for speech made both in and out of private workplaces.""Most people think they have a right to free speech...but that doesn't necessarily apply in the workplace,"" said Vanessa Matsis-McCready, associate general counsel and vice president of HR Services for Engage PEO. ""Most employees in the private sector do not have any protections for that type of speech at work.""Add to that the prevalence of social media, which has made it increasingly common to track employees' conduct outside of work and to dox people, or publish information about them online with the intent of harming or harassing them.Protections for workers vary from one state to the next. For example, in New York, if an employee is participating in a weekend political protest, but not associating themselves with the organisation that employs them, their employer cannot fire them for that activity when they return to work.But if that same employee is at a company event on a weekend and talks about their political viewpoints in a way that makes others feel unsafe or the target of discrimination or harassment, then they could face consequences at work, Matsis-McCready said.Most of the US defaults to ""at-will"" employment law - which essentially means employers can choose to hire and fire as they see fit. ""The First Amendment does not apply in private workplaces to protect employees' speech,"" said Andrew Kragie, an attorney who specialises in employment and labour law. ""It does protect employers' right to make decisions about employees, based on employees' speech.""","In the days following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous workers have been fired for their comments on his death.

Pakistan funding reconstruction of LeT HQ destroyed in Op Sindoor; what intel says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/aid-meant-for-relief-diverted-pakistan-funding-reconstruction-of-let-hq-destroyed-in-op-sindoor-what-intel-says/articleshow/123878923.cms,"Intel Reveals Pak Using Aid To Rebuild LeT HQ Hit In Op Sindoor, Experts Say ‘Time To Strike Again’

Poll Do you believe the reconstruction of LeT's Markaz Taiba is a threat to regional security? Yes, it poses a significant threat. No, it will not impact security.

How India destroyed LeT HQ



Why its reconstruction is a matter of concern?







Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba, which was destroyed in precision airstrikes during Operation Sindoor on May 7. According to ANI, citing an agency dossier, LeT has launched fundraising campaigns under the pretext of flood relief to support the redevelopment project.Moreover, Islamabad has already allocated PKR 4 crore, though the group estimates costs at over PKR 15 crore. The dossier stated that its army and ISI remain involved in sustaining and reviving LeT.Senior commanders Maulana Abu Zar and Yunus Shah Bukhari are overseeing the project, due by February 2026, mirroring past cases where LeT diverted humanitarian aid, including most of the 2005 earthquake relief, to militant infrastructure.This comes amidst Pakistan's continuous assertions on global platforms that it was combating terrorism.The Indian Air Force (IAF), earlier this year, showcased the extensive damage caused to LeT Muridke headquarters during Operation Sindoor, highlighting the precision and reach of the strikes.Muridke, home to LeT’s Markaz Taiba, was identified as a critical target. The strikes hit senior leadership residential areas and office buildings where commanders convened for planning and operations.The IAF showed videos captured directly from the weapons, pointing out the level of devastation within the complex.The airstrikes reportedly killed around a dozen high-value terrorists, including Yusuf Azhar, the IC-814 hijacker, Abu Jundal (also known as Mudassar), the Muridke chief of LeT, and the son of the planner of the 2016 Nagrota attack. The operation, conducted in retaliation for the Pahalgam killings, reinforced India’s ability to carry out precise, high-impact missions inside enemy territory.The ongoing reconstruction of LeT Markaz Taiba headquarters has raised serious concerns regarding regional security, given the facility’s central role in training and radicalizing terrorists. Established in 2000, the complex serves as both a residence for senior commanders and a training ground where recruits are instructed in intelligence gathering, arms handling, and other operational skills. Analysts warn that reviving the facility could strengthen LeT’s operational capabilities and enable the recruitment of new militants.Markaz Taiba functions as the “alma mater” of LeT, providing courses that combine physical and arms training with ideological indoctrination. The center attracts recruits from within Pakistan and abroad, using religious and radicalization programs to cultivate loyalty and operational skills among future militants. Its facilities, including a mosque and guest house financed by Osama bin Laden, underscore the longstanding support the organization has received from international terror networks.The scale of the operation at Markaz Taiba further amplifies the threat. The facility reportedly trains around 1,000 students annually, preparing them for operational roles within LeT. Past evidence has shown that graduates of this center have gone on to participate in high-profile attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, highlighting the direct link between the facility and acts of cross-border terrorism targeting India.LeT’s historical connection with Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus adds another layer of concern. Senior commanders at the facility, including those who oversaw training for the 26/11 perpetrators, have operated under the guidance of the ISI.","Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert





Train operations on five rail sections in Punjab have been suspended due to damage caused to railway tracks and infrastructure by ongoing floods and heavy rains in the province, Dawn reported.According to an internal report compiled by the Pakistan Railways (PR) and cited by Dawn, the Narowal-Sialkot section has remained closed since August 27 after floodwater breached a portion of the track. The report said a Girder Span of bridge No 7 near Aik Nullah was also misaligned, allowing floodwater to maintain a high level and overtop the track. Repair works are underway and operations are expected to resume by September 12.The PR report further noted that the Chak Jhumra-Shaheenabad (Sargodha) section was closed for rail traffic on August 29 when an ""exceptionally high flood damaged bridge No 132 & 134 near Chiniot."" Efforts are ongoing to repair or reconstruct the bridge to restore train operations, it added, according to Dawn.Similarly, the Wazirabad-Sialkot section was closed on September 3 after floodwater overtopped the track between Wazirabad-Sodhra Kopra.The Jhang-Shaheenabad section has also been shut since August 28 after flooding breached an area near the Rivaz Railway Bridge over the river Chanab. ""The floodwater is still passing through the breached section, as the train traffic remains suspended,"" the report stated.Dawn further reported that the Khanewal-Shorkot section was closed on September 3 due to high flood levels at Abdul Hakim Bridge No 27 and breaches between Abdul Hakim and Darkana stations. Temporary disruptions were also recorded at Shahdra-Faisalabad, Lahore-Badami Bagh, Uggoki-Sialkot, Port Qasim-Bin Qasim, Kotri-Dadu, Tando Adam-Hyderabad, and Peshawar Saddar-Cant sections due to flooding, embankment cuts, mudslides, and fallen trees, the PR document noted.Meanwhile, the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) also reported widespread damage to its infrastructure. ""As many as 73,724 consumers suffered power disruptions, and of them, 13,073 are still without electricity,"" Lesco Chief Executive Officer Ramzan Butt said in a statement, as quoted by Dawn. He added, ""The floods have affected our infrastructure. But our teams worked day and night to restore power supply to the flood-affected areas. Still, 17 per cent of the total 73,724 consumers are affected.""Dawn reported that Lesco's jurisdiction covers Lahore, Kasur, Nankana, Okara and Sheikhupura, where 67 11kV feeders were affected, of which 55 have been re-energised.

Kathmandu’s scrap dealers see business boom in protest aftermath,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/kathmandus-scrap-dealers-see-biz-boom-in-protest-aftermath/articleshow/123890320.cms,"Junk debris in aftermath of the protest (file - agencies)





As Nepal picks up its pieces following the violent protests that left many of the country's iconic buildings as well as hundreds of govt offices and homes badly damaged, an unusual economy is stirring amidst the rubble. Scrap dealers in Kathmandu are bracing for a windfall, as heaps of building material, metal and junk is cleared from vandalised govt complexes, burnt-down car showrooms, and ransacked supermarkets.""The junk largely comprises charred cars, damaged furniture and other metal scrap from torched public buildings,"" an official of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City administration said. ""It will eventually be auctioned to scrap dealers through tenders once cleanup is complete,"" he added.Among the areas that were ravaged in the Sept 8-9 'Gen Z' protests that led to downfall of the KP Sharma Oli government were the historic Singha Durbar, the Supreme Court, office of the attorney general, and the parliament building in Kathmandu. Besides, scores of govt offices in around 250 municipalities were damaged due to vandalism and arson, a spokesperson at the ministry of federal affairs and general administration was quoted as saying by The Kathmandu Post.Biratnagar’s four-storey municipal building was reduced to rubble, while two ward offices were burned. Birgunj saw three of its seven buildings rendered unusable, and 95 per cent of municipal properties destroyed, the newspaper reported.“What happened to the properties was very unfortunate. They should not have been damaged. But then somebody has to now take care of disposal of the mess. Scrap dealers will do that,” said Paban Tamling, a local scrap merchant. He added that business could triple or even quadruple.“Before the protest, the annual business of scrap dealing in Kathmandu was around 2 crore Nepalese rupees. But now, after the vandalism and arson, it would easily cross over 5 crore,” Tamling added.Deepak Jaiswal, who runs the recycling firm 'Thalo Kawadi', echoed the sentiment. “We are waiting for officials to finish assessing the damage and then float tenders. The number of bidders this time will surely increase, as many will try to jump into the business. It sounds odd after such tragic events, but it’s the harsh truth—someone’s loss is another’s business.”","Scrap dealers in Kathmandu are bracing for a windfall as heaps of building material, metal and junk is cleared from vandalised govt complexes, burnt-down car showrooms, and ransacked supermarkets.

KATHMANDU: Fearful of a setback to the tourism industry, one of Nepal's economic mainstays, after the recent protests that roiled the country, citizens on social media platforms have appealed to tourists to visit Nepal and said that it is ""completely safe for travellers, with the nation now slowly gathering itself"".Across its cities and business hubs, youth trooped into their social media accounts on Saturday to say that the agitation was ""purely against the govt, without any intention of hurting tourists"".

Pope Leo has criticized the 'widening gulf' between executive and worker salaries, pointing to Tesla’s $1 trillion compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk “CEOs that 60 years ago might have been making four to six times more than what the workers are receiving … [are making] 600 times more now,” the pontiff said in his first media interview, released Sunday.He also referenced reports suggesting Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire. “If that is the only thing that has value anymore, then we’re in big trouble,” he warned.The remarks came a day after Nova Sky Stories, a drone company led by Musk’s brother Kimbal Musk, staged a show over the Vatican using 3,000 drones to form images from the Sistine Chapel and even the face of Pope Leo's predecessor, Pope Francis, AP reported.The interview, conducted this summer by Vatican correspondent Elise Ann Allen for her forthcoming biography of Pope Leo, was published in excerpts by Allen’s Catholic outlet Crux and Peru’s daily El Comercio.Leo, who in May became the first American pope, also voiced concern over the state of global diplomacy, arguing that the United Nations has “lost its ability to bring people together on multilateral issues.”The late Pope Francis had elevated Leo to a senior Vatican post in 2023, signalling him as a likely successor.Still, Leo admitted he had not been fully prepared for the papacy. “There’s still a huge learning curve ahead of me,” he said, adding that while he had found his footing as a pastor, the challenge lay in serving as a global leader.The pontiff is expected to make his first foreign trip later this year with a visit to Lebanon, seen as an opportunity to address the region’s challenges, including the plight of Christian communities. He has repeatedly called for dialogue and peace in the Middle East, with particular focus on the war in Gaza.","Pope Leo has criticized the 'widening gulf' between executive and worker salaries.

France Cities On Fire: Macron ‘Pays Huge Price’ With New PM; 200,000 Ravage Streets, 300 Nabbed

Key findings about TikTok’s risks

Reactions and criticism

Government response and future plans





A French parliamentary commission has called for a ban on social media usage for children under 15 and proposed a nighttime “digital curfew” from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. for teenagers aged 15 to 18. The recommendation follows a six-month inquiry into TikTok’s effects on minors, revealing that the platform exposes children to toxic, addictive, and potentially harmful content. Prompted by lawsuits from affected families and a rise in youth mental health issues and violent incidents, the report warns that social media algorithms can exacerbate stress, anxiety, and sleep problems, raising urgent concerns about children’s safety online.The investigation was prompted after seven families sued TikTok in late 2024, claiming the platform exposed their children to harmful content that contributed to self-harm and suicides. French authorities, including President Emmanuel Macron, also pointed to social media as a factor in rising youth aggression and psychological distress. Over six months, the parliamentary commission collected testimonies from affected families, child psychologists, social media executives, and influencers.TikTok was specifically criticized as “a production line of distress” due to its algorithms, which can trap teens in cycles of addictive and harmful content.The report concluded that TikTok’s moderation measures are insufficient and often bypassed easily by minors. The platform was found to negatively affect mental health, sleep patterns, and self-esteem among teenagers. Arthur Delaporte, chair of the commission, recommended investigating whether TikTok may have endangered users’ lives, under French law. In response, TikTok rejected the findings, calling them misleading and asserting that it has extensive safety programs to protect young users.While the recommendations have political support, critics raised concerns about enforceability, privacy, and potential workarounds by young users. Digital rights groups noted that strict age verification and digital curfews could be hard to implement effectively. There is also ongoing debate over whether platforms, device manufacturers, or regulators should enforce these restrictions. Despite these concerns, the urgency of protecting children’s mental health keeps the issue at the forefront of public and legislative attention.President Macron supports the social media ban for under-15s and encourages European-wide regulatory action, warning that France may act independently if necessary. Policymakers are also exploring stricter transparency, parental controls, and accountability measures for social media platforms. These steps aim to mitigate the risks of online exposure and protect minors from harmful content. The coming months will determine whether France’s bold measures spark a wider shift in how Europe regulates children’s digital lives.","A French parliamentary commission has called for a ban on social media usage for children under 15.

Who is Diella? Albania appoints world’s first AI minister; public tenders to be ‘100% corruption free’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-diella-albania-appoints-worlds-first-ai-minister-public-tenders-to-be-100-corruption-free/articleshow/123852634.cms,"



Albania has made global headlines by becoming the first country to appoint an AI-powered minister. The minister, Diella, is designed to fight corruption and bring transparency to public spending.The announcement was made by Prime Minister Edi Rama, who revealed that Diella will oversee all public tenders involving private contractors on government projects.The name Diella, which means “sun” in Albanian, is a “member of the Cabinet who is not present physically but has been created virtually from artificial intelligence,” Rama told AP.Initially launched in January 2025 as a voice assistant on the e-Albania platform, Diella was created to guide citizens through government services. Since then, it has processed more than 36,000 digital documents and delivered close to 1,000 services to citizens.Now elevated to the role of minister, Diella becomes the world’s first AI minister responsible for managing decisions related to government contracts. Rama said that every public tender under Diella’s watch will be “100% corruption-free,” with full transparency on the allocation of funds.The move comes against the backdrop of Albania’s long-standing struggle with corruption.Public tenders in the Balkan nation of 2.8 million people have frequently been plagued by scandals, with international networks allegedly using the country to launder profits from drug and arms trafficking. Reports have often suggested that corruption reached the highest levels of government.By turning to an AI system, the Albanian government hopes to eliminate human bias, prevent quid pro quo arrangements, and reduce the risk of manipulation in state contracts.The appointment is also being viewed in the context of Albania’s ambition to join the European Union by 2030, for which, cracking down on corruption is a vital condition. Experts say that the introduction of Diella could strengthen Albania’s credibility with EU leaders, given that misuse of public funds has long hindered progress in membership talks.While the initiative is seen as groundbreaking, the government has yet to specify whether human oversight will accompany Diella’s decisions. Analysts warn that even advanced AI systems can be open to manipulation if not safeguarded adequately.","Albania has appointed an AI-powered minister to fight corruption.

In Saudi Arabia, the Iqama is more than just a residency permit — it is the central document that governs the life and work of every foreign national living in the Kingdom. From legal status to access to essential services, the Iqama plays a pivotal role in the everyday life of expatriates. This guide breaks down everything about the Iqama, from its purpose and benefits to the detailed process of obtaining and renewing it, including a breakdown of the associated costs.The Iqama is an official residency permit issued by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Interior to foreign nationals who live and work in the country. While a person can initially enter the Kingdom on a work visa, they are unable to legally access most services until the Iqama is issued.Once granted, the Iqama acts as proof of legal residency and work authorization. It is essential for accessing basic services and conducting day-to-day transactions in the Kingdom.Though the physical Iqama card is issued for five years, its legal validity depends on annual renewal, closely tied to the employment contract and the sponsoring company. If the sponsoring company ceases operations, the Iqama becomes invalid.In such a case, the expatriate must either find a new sponsor or leave the country.The Iqama issuance process is structured and primarily handled by the employer or business owner acting as the sponsor.
