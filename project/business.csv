Terror targets neutralised

Strikes deep within Pakistan territory



Terrorists and their backers the same: New paradigm

Jamming Pakistan’s air defence grid

Defence infrastructure impact

Damage to Pakistan’s military

Joint warfare capability

NEW DELHI: The Indian military reported on Sunday that it inflicted significant damage on Pakistan's military forces during a three-day confrontation, including downing fighter jets with advanced technology and striking military installations near Islamabad.Director general of military operations Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai stated that 35-40 Pakistani military personnel were killed in the combat operations.""Pakistan will have to pay a very heavy price if it resorts to any more misadventure,"" said Lt Gen Ghai, adding that India had achieved its desired objectives.The damage inflicted included the destruction of Pakistani fighter jets equipped with latest technologies and strikes on key military facilities near Pakistan's capital. India executed a significant military operation within Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in response to civilian casualties. The operation accomplished numerous strategic objectives.India successfully destroyed nine crucial terror facilities across Pakistan and PoK, targeting installations of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen. These were identified as essential training and operational centres.India demonstrated a significant shift in its military strategy by showing readiness to conduct strikes deep within Pakistan's territory, including sensitive areas like Punjab province and Bahawalpur, moving beyond the traditional engagement limited to PoK.India's strikes reached hundreds of kilometers inside Pakistan, including areas like Bahawalpur that even the United States had not targeted with drone operations. The operations extended to Punjab province, which is considered a strategic military stronghold of Pakistan.Through these actions, India has established that it can reach any location within Pakistan, making it clear that neither the Line of Control nor Pakistan's internal territories are exempt from potential strikes.The new approach targets both terrorists and their supporters, marking a departure from previous policies that treated them separately. The operation established a clear stance against terrorism, implementing a doctrine of calibrated deterrence. It eliminated the traditional separation between terrorist organisations and their supporters.It also undermined the long-standing assumption that certain influential rogue elements within the Pakistani state could orchestrate terrorist activities with impunity.Indian forces conducted successful strikes using Rafale jets equipped with SCALP missiles and HAMMER bombs, effectively bypassing or jamming Pakistan's air defence systems during a precise 23-minute operation.The rapid operation revealed vulnerabilities in Pakistan's air defence infrastructure, as Indian forces were able to penetrate their systems without any reported losses.The mission's success demonstrated India's technological and strategic capabilities in executing precise military operations.India has demonstrated significant advances in modern air defence capabilities through its integrated defense systems and successful penetration of Chinese-made systems used by Pakistan.The Akashteer Air Defence System emerged as a particularly successful component, having neutralized hundreds of Pakistani drones and missiles. Its proven performance positioned it as a potential export option in the global defense market.The strikes affected 11 Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan, Rafiqui, Murid, Sukkur, Sialkot, Pasrur, Chunian, Sargodha, Skaru, Bholari and Jacobabad, significantly impacting their air force infrastructure. This led to destruction of 20% infrastructure of Pakistan’s airforce. India bombed Pakistan’s Bholari Air Base killing over 50 people including Pakistan’s squadron leader Usman Yousuf, 4 airmen among others as well as destroying Pakistan’s fighter jets.The Army, Navy, and Air Force came together to execute coordinated strikes, prooving India’s growing joint warfare capability.The operation showcased India's tri-service coordination and precision targeting capabilities, avoiding civilian casualties while achieving military objectives.",The Indian military reported on Sunday that it inflicted significant damage on Pakistan's military forces during a three-day confrontation.

"Doctor practices while suspended, Punjab Medical Council complains to cops but revokes suspension",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doctor-practices-while-suspended-punjab-medical-council-complains-to-cops-but-revokes-suspension/articleshow/121092921.cms,"Representative image

The Punjab Medical Council (PMC) restored the licence of a surgeon who continued to practice while under suspension. This, despite having urged the police to act against the doctor on the grounds that doing so was illegal. Yet, the National Medical Commission refuses to take up the patient's complaint against this decision of the PMC.The PMC declined to reveal if the suspended surgeon fulfilled the conditions its ethics committee had recommended for him to be allowed to resume practice - a root cause analysis of the death of two patients who he operated on, and a certificate showing that he had got himself trained in laparoscopic hysterectomy .TOI asked PMC why its Dec 2024 order restoring the licence of Dr Praveen Devgan cited the high court order of Nov 20, 2024 when the court had not ordered restoration of licence. In response, it produced yet another council order dated April 25, 2025, which claimed that the decision to restore the licence was taken in the general body meeting on Sept 25, 2024 after receiving an application from Dr Devgan at the end of the six-month suspension period. PMC was mum on Dr Devgan continuing to practice during the period of suspension.""The case filed by Dr Devgan in July 2024 against his suspension was still pending on Sept 25. How did PMC take a decision to restore his licence before the court had decided the case?"" asked the complainant, Gokul Aneja, who has alleged medical negligence in the death of his wife Sunita Aneja. She was diagnosed with multiple fibroids and underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy by Dr Parveen Devgan on Oct 1, 2018.Dr Devgan's petition in HC was ""disposed of as withdrawn"" on Nov 20 last year because he had moved an application seeking to withdraw the petition. The court had neither stayed his suspension nor examined its merits.In PMC's general body meeting held on July 21, 2023 ""all the council members unanimously decided that Dr Parveen Devgan failed to demonstrate due skill and care towards patients"". PMC's final order on Dec 21, 2023, suspended his registration for six months and debarred him from practice. The order cited the ethics committee' recommendations. These included that he be restrained from performing any laproscopic procedure in his own hospital or in any other hospital till he submitted a root cause analysis of the deaths, done by a higher institute like PGI Chandigarh doing and imparting training in laparoscopic hysterectomy, and that he get trained in laparoscopic hysterectomy from a recognised institute and submit the certificate to PMC. The committee stated that Dr Devgan should be initially restrained for a minimum of six months that could be extended further till he complied with the two conditions of root cause analysis and certificate of training.When Dr Devgan applied to Fortis Hospital, Noida for training in laparoscopic hysterectomy along with other procedures in laparoscopy, the hospital informed him that he could not be trained in laparoscopic gynae procedures ""as by NMC guidelines you do not possess required qualification of post-graduation in Obs & Gynae"". ""It is unethical and unlawful for a general surgeon to do gynaecological training or procedures as he/she does not have the required qualification to do so,"" stated the hospital letter in May 2024.On receiving information that Dr Devgan was practicing despite suspension of licence, civil surgeon of Amritsar inspected the hospital on April 5, 2024, and found that he was performing operations. She informed the PMC and the police in Amritsar. The PMC urged the commissioner of police in Amritsar to take action as practising while his licence was suspended was illegal, and against the Punjab Medical Registration Act and the National Commission Act.","Punjab Medical Council (PMC) restored the licence of a surgeon who continued to practice while under suspension.

In conversation with TOI ’s Manash Gohain , Union education minister

defended

’s late but landmark endorsement of a

caste census

, calling it a ‘historic correction’ rather than a political U-turn. Rejecting Congress’s claim of a moral victory, he branded Rahul Gandhi’s celebration as ‘the peak of arrogance and bankruptcy of imagination’

Why did the PM suddenly back a caste census after years of silence - was it a strategic move or a reaction to Congress gaining

OBC

traction?

Doesn't the timing of caste census show BJP is anxious about Bihar, especially after Nitish Kumar's successful state-level survey?

Was the caste census timed to deflect attention from Pahalgam terror attack & national security lapses?

Isn't this a political U-turn to counter Congress-led INDIA bloc's growing OBC appeal ahead of 2025 state polls?

This is not sudden.BJP has always had a philosophical commitment to social harmony, social justice and affirmative action. From Jan Sangh era to Atalji and Advaniji's leadership during Mandal Commission, to today's govt under Modiji - our stance has been consistent. When VP Singh's National Front govt implemented Mandal Commission in the 1990s, BJP supported it unequivocally, standing by the principle of social justice. The PM himself belongs to an OBC community. This isn't a political response to Congress, it's a continuation of a long-standing vision.Let me remind you, in 2024 itself, the home minister said caste enumeration would be considered at the right time. That time is now. We are not reacting to Congress; we are fulfilling a national commitment. Unlike Congress, which used reservations opportunistically, we have converted our ideology into sustained policy action.That survey was part of NDA when we were in it, and we consider it an achievement. But there's a fundamental difference - that was a survey, this will be a census. A census is a constitutionally empowered exercise. Rahul Gandhi and the Congress seem unable to grasp that distinction. Our decision is not driven by electoral anxiety but by institutional process.We are creating a national framework for social justice. If anything, this reinforces BJP's seriousness about structural reforms, rather than merely responding to regional pressures.That's a completely separate issue. The Indian Army has full operational freedom, and the PM has made that clear. Security matters are being handled with utmost seriousness. Linking this with the caste census is not just disrespectful - it reveals how hollow the opposition's arguments are. We are not using social justice as a distraction. For us, it is a conviction, not a convenience.That accusation is laughable. Those who suppressed Kaka Kalelkar Commission, shelved Mandal Commission - Congress under Nehru, Indira, and Rajiv - they now want to claim credit? Rahul Gandhi should reflect on the hypocrisy of patting himself on the back for something his own party obstructed for decades. His celebration is not a moral victory; it is, frankly, the peak of arrogance and bankruptcy of imagination. This isn't a U-turn. This is BJP institutionalising what others only politicised.As education minister from a backward community, do you believe today's education system reflects caste realities - or is updated data from a census essential?n To make informed and equitable policy today, we need credible data. Social equality is a fundamental right - and that includes access to education. The caste census will provide a much-needed empirical base to understand educational disparities. You cannot address inequality without first recognising its extent. This is not just about data; it's about dignity.",Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan says caste census is not a political U-turn.

NEW DELHI: Deep precision airstrikes with BrahMos supersonic missiles and other standoff weapons on several crucial airbases in Pakistan early Saturday proved to be decisive in the escalating hostilities between the two nations, causing the US to step in and push for a truce.India agreed as it had achieved its three main objectives — political, military and psychological — according to govt sources.The major hit on the Nur Khan-Chaklala airbase at Rawalpindi, which caused some damage to the infrastructure there, was particularly significant since it is located close to HQ of Pakistan’s Strategic Plans Division, which handles its nuclear arsenal, and is barely 10km from Islamabad.Also read: Response to Pahalgam terror attack marks new normal in India-Pakistan ties Pakistan’s nuclear warheads, estimated to be around 170 like India, would be spread around the country in secret locations.

NEW DELHI: Amid Indo-Pak tensions, Isro chairman V Narayanan on Sunday said 10 satellites are continuously working round-the-clock for the strategic purpose to ensure the safety and security of citizens of the country.Addressing the 5th convocation ceremony of Central Agricultural University (CAU) at Agartala, the Isro chief said, “If we want to ensure the safety of our country, we have to serve through our satellites.We have to monitor our 7,000 km seashore areas. Without satellite and drone technology, we can’t achieve many things.”As of now, Isro has launched a total of 127 Indian satellites, including those from private operators and academic institutions. Of these, 22 are in low earth orbit (LEO) and 29 are in geo-synchronous earth orbit, owned by the central govt. India has around a dozen spy or surveillance satellites. They include Cartosat and RISAT series, as well as EMISAT and MicroSat series, which are designed for specific surveillance tasks.Just days ago, Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) chairman Pawan Kumar Goenka had said at Global Space Exploration Conference 2025 that India would put in orbit a constellation of 52 satellites over the next five years to step up space-based surveillance capabilities.“We have fairly strong capabilities already. It is just that it needs constant enhancement,” Goenka said. He said the plan is intended at increasing surveillance capabilities of the defence sector. “So far, this was primarily done by Isro. We will bring in the private sector as we move forward,” he said. The new satellites will help Indian Army, Navy and Air Force track enemy movements, monitor borders and improve real-time coordination during military operations.Narayanan’s statement has come at a time when Isro is scheduled to launch another surveillance satellite, EOS-09 (RISAT-1B) radar imaging satellite, into a sun-synchronous orbit on May 18 that will boost India’s surveillance powers along its sensitive borders.Saying that advanced satellite technologies are required for the common man's development, Narayanan predicted that before India celebrates 100 years of its independence, the country would be a master in every field, the country would be an outstanding contributor to the world.Isro and its several satellites are operational for the development of northeastern states and the execution of many projects in the region, he added. He urged students that after taking degrees, their responsibility is to give something to society.","Isro chairman V Narayanan on Sunday said 10 satellites are working round-the- clock for the strategic purpose to ensure the safety and security of citizens of the country.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh Sunday lauded armed forces for avenging the Pahalgam massacre , stressing Operation Sindoor success had conveyed a message to terrorists. “Reverberations of action could be felt in Rawalpindi.”Displaying great valour and might, Indian armed forces have given an effective response. We not only targeted military installations but the reverberations of the action could be felt also in Rawalpindi where the Pakistan army is headquartered,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said in what appeared to be a reference to IAF’s successful strikes deep inside Pakistan Punjab.He said that coming after the surgical strikes in Uri and the airstrike on Balakot post-Pulwama, the multiple strikes as part of Operation Sindoor represented the Modi govt's zero-tolerance stance towards terrorism.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that it is new India which will not flinch from carrying out effective attacks on terrorism on both sides of the border,” he added.Significantly, Singh's remarks, the first by a senior minister after India acceded to Pakistan's plea to pause hostilities, came in his virtual address at the inauguration of a production facility of BrahMos missiles which were part of the arsenal IAF effectively used against Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.Singh said Operation Sindoor was not just a military operation but also symbolised the country's political, social and strategic willpower under the Modi government. “We have shown that no space across the border is going to be safe from our counter-terror operations,” he added.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh lauded armed forces for avenging the Pahalgam massacre. “Reverberations of action could be felt in Rawalpindi,” he said in what appeared to be a reference to IAF’s successful strikes deep inside Pakistan Punjab.

Bill Gates plans to spend his entire fortune over the next 20 years



Microsoft founder and billionaire Bill Gates recently accused Tesla CEO Elon Musk of ‘killing world’s poorest children’. In an interview to Financial Times, Microsoft founder critised Elon Musk for killing the poor children by sharing down the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ). Gates also highlighted that Elon Musk’s decision to cut down foreign aid funding could lead to increase in the cases of measles, HIV, and polio and more.“The picture of the world’s richest man killing the world’s poorest children is not a pretty one,” Gates told the Financial Times.In February 2025, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) effectively shut down USAID, calling it “a criminal organisation” and stating it was “time for it to die”. Gates argued that the abrupt cuts have left life-saving food and medicines expiring in warehouses, depriving vulnerable communities of essential aid.In the interview, Bill Gates also alleged that Elon Musk has cancelled grants to hospital in Gaza Province Mozambique, which prevented transmission of HIV. “I’d love for him to go in and meet the children that have now been infected with HIV because he cut that money,” said Gates.Bill Gates also announced his plans to spend nearly all his money in the next 20 years as the Gates Foundation will close in 2045. Gates mentioned that the foundation will allocate $200 billion towards global health, development and education. “We’ll have a lot more money because we’re spending down over the 20 years, as opposed to making an effort to be a perpetual foundation,” said Gates.“The foundation will continue to spend the bulk of its budget, which will rise to about $10bn a year, on global health, with vaccines, maternal and child health continuing to be a focus.

NEW DELHI: In response to heightened cross-border tensions between India and Pakistan, sporting events were suspended across India on Friday.Following Pakistan's coordinated drone and missile attacks along India's western border on Thursday night, India's air defence systems, including the S-400, successfully intercepted the threats, minimising damage.These strikes were reportedly in response to India's ""Operation Sindoor"", which targeted terrorist facilities in Pakistan after a terrorist incident in Pahalgam claimed 26 tourist lives on April 22.The BCCI suspended IPL for one week on Friday afternoon due to the escalating situation.""The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to suspend the remainder of the ongoing IPL 2025 with immediate effect for one week.

Apple plans to add AI Search in Safari browser; Senior VP Eddy Cue points to 3 Google rivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-plans-to-add-ai-search-in-safari-browser-senior-vp-eddy-cue-points-to-3-google-rivals/articleshow/120993178.cms,"Apple in discussions with OpenAI, Perplexity and others

Apple is planning to add AI-powered search options in the Safari browser . According to a Bloomberg report, Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue said during his testimony with the US Justice Department that the company is “actively looking at” reshaping Safari. During the testimony, he revealed that searches on Safari dipped for the first time last month.“That has never happened in 22 years,” he said, adding this is due to people using AI. Cue said he believes that AI tools like OpenAI , Perplexity AI and Anthropic’s Claude AI, will eventually replace search engines like Google Chrome, further adding that Apple will bring these options to Safari in the future.“We will add them to the list — they probably won’t be the default,” he said.Currently, Google is the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser for which the company pays around $20 billion a year to keep. Analysts estimate this accounts for about 36% of the search advertising revenue Google earns through Safari.Cue said that Apple is in discussions with AI search providers like OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic to add their AI tools as an option to Safari.“Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices,” he said. “I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.”Apple currently integrates OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its Siri digital assistant and plans to add Google’s AI tool Gemini later this year. Cue said the company also considered other AI options, including Anthropic, Perplexity, China-based DeepSeek, and Grok from Elon Musk’s xAI.He added that the deal with OpenAI gives Apple the flexibility to bring in other AI providers to its operating system, including Apple’s own AI models.Google-parent company Alphabet’s shares dipped about 8% on Wednesday (May 7), wiping out $160 billion from the company’s market capitalisation following Eddy Cue’s testimony.","Apple is planning to add AI-powered search options in the Safari browser.

Jensen Huang's warning to US leaders: ‘Get American AI out in front’ or risk losing China AI market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jensen-huangs-warning-to-us-leaders-get-american-ai-out-in-front-or-risk-losing-china-ai-market/articleshow/120992439.cms,"Jensen Huang's warning to US leaders

""tremendous loss,""

Nvidia targets $50 billion in China's AI boom – why it can't afford to miss out

Impact of US export restrictions on Nvidia

Broader economic implications for the US

China’s rapid AI advancements and competitive threats

Financial performance and market outlook

The path forward: Balancing growth and national security

“The world is right now hungry, anxious to engage AI,”

“Let us get the American AI out in front of everybody right now.”

Nvidia , the world’s leading producer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and a dominant force in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, is facing a critical challenge as US-China trade tensions continue to escalate. CEO Jensen Huang recently emphasized the significance of the Chinese AI market , which he estimates could reach $50 billion in the next two to three years.Speaking at ServiceNow’s Knowledge 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Huang described the potential loss of access to this market as ahighlighting the broader economic impact on US jobs, revenue, and technological leadership. This concern comes amid tighter US export restrictions that have significantly affected Nvidia’s business prospects in China, one of its largest international markets.China has long been a vital market for Nvidia, not only as a major consumer of its advanced AI chips but also as a hub for cutting-edge AI research and development. Nvidia’s GPUs, known for their unmatched parallel processing capabilities, are essential for training and deploying sophisticated AI models, making them indispensable for industries ranging from autonomous vehicles to cloud computing.Huang noted in his interview that China’s AI market could grow to $50 billion within the next two to three years, presenting a massive revenue opportunity. Given that Nvidia’s GPUs have become the backbone of the global AI industry, securing a share of this rapidly expanding market is critical for the company’s long-term growth.However, Nvidia’s ability to access this lucrative market has been increasingly constrained by US export controls aimed at limiting China’s technological advancements. Last month, the Trump administration further tightened these restrictions, requiring special licenses for Nvidia to ship its H20 chips to China. These chips, part of the Hopper architecture, were specifically designed to comply with earlier export regulations but are now caught in the latest wave of trade restrictions.As a result, Nvidia announced a staggering $5.5 billion quarterly charge, reflecting the financial blow of losing a critical revenue stream. This move marks one of the most significant financial impacts on the company since it became a trillion-dollar tech giant, raising concerns about the sustainability of its rapid growth.Huang highlighted the broader economic consequences of these export restrictions, emphasizing the potential loss of US jobs and tax revenue. During the interview, he argued that maintaining access to the Chinese market is not just about Nvidia’s bottom line but also about the long-term competitiveness of the US tech sector.“We just have to stay agile,” Huang said, stressing the importance of balancing national security concerns with the need for economic growth and technological leadership. He added that the ongoing restrictions could force Chinese companies to develop domestic alternatives, potentially reducing US influence in the global AI industry over the long term.Huang’s comments come amid growing concerns about China’s rapid progress in AI technology. At a separate tech conference in Washington, D.C., in April, Huang warned that China is “not behind” in AI and described Huawei as “one of the most formidable technology companies in the world.”This assessment aligns with recent reports indicating that Chinese firms like Huawei and DeepSeek have made significant strides in developing their own AI chips, potentially challenging Nvidia’s dominance in this critical sector. Huang’s remarks underscore the competitive pressure Nvidia faces as it navigates a complex geopolitical landscape.Despite these challenges, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the global AI market. The company’s market capitalization has approached $3 trillion, making it one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. However, its stock has experienced significant volatility in recent months, with shares down about 15% so far this year after nearly tripling in 2023.Nvidia is set to report its next quarterly earnings on May 28, with analysts expecting a 65% year-over-year revenue increase to $43.1 billion, according to data from LSEG. This projected growth reflects the ongoing demand for AI hardware, even as the company grapples with geopolitical uncertainties and supply chain challenges.Huang’s recent comments highlight the delicate balance Nvidia must strike as it seeks to maintain its leadership in the AI industry while navigating complex geopolitical challenges. As US policymakers weigh the risks and benefits of restricting high-tech exports to China, companies like Nvidia face tough decisions about how to adapt to an increasingly fragmented global market.Huang said during his Las Vegas appearance.With AI becoming a critical driver of economic growth and technological innovation, the stakes for Nvidia and the broader US tech sector have never been higher.","N Nvidia is the world’s leading producer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and a dominant force in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.

X has received executive orders from the Indian government requiring X to block over 8,000 accounts in India, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment of the company’s local employees. The orders include demands to block access in India to accounts belonging to international news organizations and prominent X users.

Poll Do you think blocking accounts is an effective way to enforce local laws? No, it stifles communication Yes, it can deter illegal activity

In most cases, the Indian government has not specified which posts from an account have violated India's local laws. For a significant number of accounts, we did not receive any evidence or justification to block the accounts.

To comply with the orders, we will withhold the specified accounts in India alone. We have begun that process. However, we disagree with the Indian government’s demands. Blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship of existing and future content, and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech.

This is not an easy decision, however keeping the platform accessible in India is vital to Indians’ ability to access information.

We believe that making these executive orders public is essential for transparency – lack of disclosure discourages accountability and can contribute to arbitrary decision making. However, due to legal restrictions, we are unable to publish the executive orders at this time.

X is exploring all possible legal avenues available to the company. Unlike users located in India, X is restricted by Indian law in its ability to bring legal challenges against these executive orders. However, we encourage all users who are impacted by these blocking orders to seek appropriate relief from the courts.

MUMBAI: In a significant development in the alleged Rs 1.01 crore Apple iPhone 16 procurement fraud , Sanjay Pradhan, a commission agent from a mobile store, was arrested, and Ibrahim Ansari, the store manager of the Powai outlet, was denied bail.The MRA Marg police arrested Sanjay Pradhan (61) on Friday, who had been evading arrest since the police filed an FIR last month, even after the Sessions Court rejected his anticipatory bail.According to the complaint, Merchant was approached in mid-2024 by Shahabaj Ali Shaikh with an offer to procure Apple iPhone 16 units at Rs 68,000 each from a source within ‘MAPLE’, a reputed Apple retailer.Enticed by the pricing, Merchant agreed to purchase 150 units.Merchant, Director of Advanced Trends India Private Limited, states that Maple stores allegedly requested an advance payment of Rs 1.01 crore for a bulk order of iPhones via a Pro Forma Invoice issued on Maple letterhead and signed under Ansari’s authority.The amount was transferred to the store's bank account. However, the goods were allegedly never delivered to the complainant.Investigations indicate that iPhone units worth Rs 91 lakh were diverted to third parties, including Alka Enterprises, without fulfilling the order.Another suspect, Deven Lalji Devda, an associate of Sanjay Pradhan, is already in custody. Sanjay Pradhan, acting as the commission agent for Maple/iPlanet, allegedly coordinated with Ibrahim Ansari to divert the goods under false pretences.Pradhan was arrested after absconding following the denial of his anticipatory bail.On the same day, Ibrahim Ansari’s bail was rejected by the Magistrate’s Court. His bail was opposed on grounds of active concealment, criminal breach of trust, and deliberate misrepresentation, supported by documentary evidence pointing to internal collusion and misuse of company systems. Emails and transaction records show that despite multiple written follow-ups, the complainant allegedly received no response, while CPL proceeded to divert goods to unrelated parties. A bank account involved has since been frozen, with nearly Rs 90 lakh still intact.","The MRA Marg police arrested Sanjay Pradhan (61) on Friday, who had been evading arrest since the police filed an FIR last month.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"

Have you found yourself dabbling with the idea of spending your next vacation at White Lotus, a luxury resort famous for its obnoxious guests and regular murders? Welcome to the world of "" set-jetting ,"" in which settings of popular movies and TVs shows like ""The White Lotus"" become pilgrimage sites for fans.The White Lotus resorts are, of course, fictional. But the properties where the HBO series films are real. And after seasons 1 and 2, set in Maui and Sicily, travellers flocked to those properties, and both reported a tenfold rise in bookings, said Marc Speichert, executive V-P and chief commercial officer of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. The company was not able to share booking numbers for its resort in Thailand, where the latest season was set.The term set-jetting - a play on ""jet set"" - appears to date to a 2007 New York Post article describing the allure of trips inspired by films like ""The Queen"" (Brocket Hall, near London) and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (the Segovia region of Spain).The concept goes back to at least the 1960s, said Daniel L Spears, an associate professor of hospitality and tourism, who has studied the trend. After the 1965 blockbuster ""The Sound of Music"", tourism to Austria surged, particularly to Mirabell Garden in Salzburg, setting for the song ""Do-Re-Mi"".Set-jetting picked up steam in the early 2000s, when ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise began to draw large numbers of Shire- and Rivendell-obsessed tourists to New Zealand, and ""Game of Thrones"" did the same for Iceland and Croatia. Since then, the options have exploded.One of the biggest players in the field, the luxury travel company Black Tomato, offers an array of set-jetting vacations, including adventures that'll make you feel you're in a ""Yellowstone"" episode, with horseback riding and a fireside dinner with cowboys. If you fancy a tuxedo and a stiff (and shaken) martini, its menu of James Bond-themed trips is vast, including a training session with a stunt coordinator from the five latest 007 films. Black Tomato's clients typically pay $10,000 to $20,000 per person for a 10-day trip, said a company official. It's a long way mentally from the once-idyllic Coco Palms Resort of ""Blue Hawaii"" to the unsettling plot lines of ""The White Lotus"". Why are so many people travelling to places that are not exactly the stuff of ukulele solos and flower leis? It might be the immersive nature of streaming establishes a deep bond with the characters and the place, giving fans a ""sense of nostalgia,"" Spears said. ""There's a dark turn, but there's also emotional connection.""","""Set-jetting"" is a phenomenon in which travellers choose vacation destinations based on TV series and films.

Donald Trump announces plan to cut prescription drug prices by 30% to 80%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-announces-plan-to-cut-prescription-drug-prices-by-30-to-80/articleshow/121092102.cms,"(File photo)





US President Donald Trump has pledged to slash prescription drug and pharmaceutical prices in the United States by as much as 80 percent through a new executive order, reviving a key issue from his first term in office. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he would sign the order on Monday morning, promising Americans immediate relief from high medication costs.“For many years the World has wondered why Prescription Drugs and Pharmaceuticals in the United States States of America were so much higher in price than they were in any other nation,” Trump wrote. “Sometimes being five to ten times more expensive than the same drug, manufactured in the exact same laboratory or plant, by the same company???”Trump said the new policy would introduce a “MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY,” tying the cost of drugs sold in the US to the lowest price paid by any other country for the same drug.“Our Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,” he added.The US president accused pharmaceutical companies of exploiting Americans by citing research and development costs to justify inflated prices. “Campaign Contributions can do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party,” he wrote. “We are going to do the right thing, something that the Democrats have fought for many years.”Trump said the policy would not only lead to reductions in US drug prices of between 30 and 80 percent but would also force prices to rise in other countries to match, calling it a matter of fairness. “They will rise throughout the World in order to equalize and, for the first time in many years, bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA!” he wrote.If implemented, the executive order would primarily affect drugs administered in doctors’ offices and covered under Medicare Part B — such as cancer treatments and other injectable medications. These are some of the most expensive drugs Medicare covers, and costs for them reached $33 billion in 2021.Trump first introduced a similar plan during his first term, but it was blocked in court and never took effect. At the time, the pharmaceutical industry lobbied hard against it, arguing that pegging US prices to foreign rates would undermine innovation and give foreign governments control over US drug costs.Despite the previous failure, Trump insisted that this time would be different, promising that the move would “save TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.” The proposal is expected to face strong pushback once again from drug manufacturers.","US President Donald Trump has pledged to slash prescription drug and pharmaceutical prices in the United States by as much as 80 percent.

What is 'flying palace' that Qatar will gift to President Trump?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-flying-palace-that-qatar-will-gift-to-president-trump/articleshow/121086266.cms,"Trump will accept Boeing 747-8 from the Qatar royal family, reports said.

Is it legal for Trump to accept a plane from a country?





During his visit to the Middle East, President Donald Trump would receive the most expensive gift ever extended to the United States from a foreign government -- from the royal family of Qatar. It is a super luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet that President Trump will use as his new Air Force One.ABC News reported that the gift is expected to be announced next week when Trump visits Qatar on his first foreign trip of his second term. A Qatari official said that it is not a gift to Trump, individually. But it is more of a government-to-government transaction.Trump and his aides toured the plane earlier this year at the airport in Palm Beach and Trump boasted about the luxurious features of the plane; he was so impressed.Trump has become frustrated that Boeing is not readying his new plane and at one point entrusted Elon Musk with the task of expediting the delivery of a new plane.The plane is called the flying palace because of its plush interiors. It has plush, well-designed bathrooms, private bedrooms and a grand staircase. The aircraft flew around the members of the Qatari royal family and was then put in the service of the Turkish government.Now the plane will be transferred to the United States Air Force, which will modify the 13-year-old aircraft to meet US military specifications required for a presidential plane. Aviation company L3Harris has been commissioned to overhaul the plane. The plane is expected to be ready by this year.When Trump's second term ends, the plane is expected to be transferred to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation.Senator Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and vocal Trump critic, wrote on X, ""[it] seems pretty clear that a $400 million 'air palace' from a foreign emir qualifies.

What's happening in US airspace?







At least 80 flights were cancelled and around 40 were delayed at Newark Liberty International Airport on Sunday morning amid a back-to-back aviation crisis in Newark. The FAA said in a statement that a telecommunications issue at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C facility, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark, caused the agency to issue a ground stop for 45 minutes.Operations have returned to normal now but this was the third time that air traffic got affected in Newark.On Friday morning, radar screens at the airport went black for about 90 seconds, according to the FAA. During the outage, which unfolded about 3:55 a.m., air traffic controllers could be heard telling a FedEx plane that their screens went dark and then asking the aircraft to tell their company to put pressure on to get the problem fixed.The outages come when the US airspace witnessed some of the most tragic crashes this year. Transport secretary Sean Duffy on Saturdat said he is concerned about the whole airspace of the United States as FAA is using old equipment.""I'm concerned about the whole airspace,"" Duffy said during an interview with NBC News' Meet the Press. ""The equipment that we use—much of it we can't buy parts for new. We have to go on eBay and buy parts if one part goes down.""""You're dealing with really old equipment. We're dealing with copper wires, not high-speed fiber,"" he said.Duffy said Sunday “it is” safe to fly out of Newark airport , adding that flights will be scaled back at the airport in the interim while the issue is fixed.He didn’t say exactly how long delays and cancellations will last, but said, “In the next several weeks, we’re going to have this reduced capacity at Newark. I’m convening a meeting of all the airlines that serve Newark, get them to agree on how they’re going to reduce the capacity. So you book, you fly.”“We are building a new line that goes directly from Newark to the Philly Tracon, which controls the New York airspace,” Duffy said, adding he believes that will be complete by the end of the summer.","At least 80 flights were cancelled and around 40 were delayed at Newark Liberty International Airport on Sunday morning.

180-degree turn in a day: What happened?



Wild accusations surface against Kash Patel







Indian-origin director of the FBI, Kash Patel , who came on the radar for his misuse of FBI jets for personal use, recently showed his independence as he complained that the administration allocated too small a budget for the FBI. Testifying before a House panel on Wednesday, Patel said the FBI needed more than what has been proposed in the budget plan.The White House budget, recently submitted to Congress, would cut FBI funding by around 5 per cent. Patel told members of the House that he would need $1 billion more than what the White House proposed.“In order to achieve the mission of the FBI, if we continue on the current trajectory outlined, we will have to not only eliminate 1,100 vacancies currently at the FBI, I’ll have to fire 1,300 more,” Patel said.A day later, Patel backtracked his comments and said he would make the mission work on whatever budget has been promised to him. “My view is that we will make and agree with this budget as it stands and make it work for the operational necessity of the FBI,” Patel told members of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee Thursday.“As the head of the FBI, I was simply asking for more funds because I can do more with more money,” he explained his earlier demand but did not explain why he did not stick to that.In recent days, wild allegations against Patel are doing the rounds, starting with former FBI official Frank Figliuzzi claiming that Kash Patel is spotted more at nightclubs than in the office. Another report citing FBI insiders claimed that Kash Patel reduced the number of meetings and seems not interested in his work. He spends more time in sporting events, works from home, uses FBI jets to visit girlfriend -- and the allegations go on. FBI spokesperson Ben Williamson, however, dismissed these claims and said Patel comes to office every day and his work speaks for itself. The sporting events he attended were mostly for his close friends and as far as the allegations of flying on FBI jets are concerned, the FBI director is only supposed to take FBI jets for flying for security reasons.","Indian-origin director of the FBI, Kash Patel, recently showed his independence as he complained that the administration allocated too small a budget for the FBI.

5.7 magnitude earthquake strikes Tibet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/5-7-magnitude-earthquake-strikes-tibet/articleshow/121092396.cms,"Representative Image





A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Tibet in the early hours of Monday, according to National Center for Seismology (NCS). The tremor was recorded at a depth of just 10km.The NCS posted the seismic details on X, stating the quake occurred at 2:41am IST, with coordinates at latitude 29.02°N and longitude 87.48°E. Just days earlier, on May 8, the region experienced a smaller 3.7 magnitude quake at a similar depth.Experts warn that shallow earthquakes often have more severe effects, as energy is released closer to the surface, leading to stronger ground shaking and a higher potential for destruction.The Tibetan Plateau lies along a major fault line where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide, making the area highly prone to seismic activity.These tectonic shifts continue to shape the Himalayas.Speaking to *Al Jazeera*, geophysicist Marianne Karplus said that while earthquakes cannot be predicted, scientific research and investment in resilient infrastructure are essential to minimise risk and improve safety in vulnerable regions.","A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Tibet in the early hours of Monday.

Poll Should the Bank of England adopt a more proactive approach to monetary policy? Yes, absolutely No, they should be cautious





LONDON: The Bank of England is widely expected to look past near-term inflationary pressures in the British economy and opt to cut interest rates on Thursday as a result of the potential shock to growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.Most economists believe it's a near-certainty that the nine-member monetary policy committee will sanction a quarter-point reduction in the bank's main interest rate, to 4.25%. The decision is to be announced at 12:02 p.m., two minutes later than usual as a result of the two-minute silence for Victory in Europe Day. There's some speculation that some members may opt for an even bigger half-point cut.Economists are going to be particularly interested in the bank's accompanying economic forecasts as they will be the first since US President Donald Trump made his tariff announcement in early April.Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to UK goods entering the United States, the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain.""With US trade policy presenting a new demand shock, there have been early signs that the MPC is willing to adopt a more proactive approach to loosening policy,"" said Edward Allenby, UK economist at Oxford Economics.The forecasts, particularly those regarding growth and inflation, will provide a steer as to whether a more proactive approach is likely. Since it started cutting interest rates in August 2024 from the 16-year high of 5.25%, the MPC has been consistent in lowering borrowing costs every three months.The imposition of US tariffs on British goods, and the potential for a wider global trade war, has the potential to weigh on growth as well as oil prices, which would consequently depress price pressures by lowering demand.Though UK inflation stands at 2.6% and could well hit double the bank's target rate of 2% in coming months as a result of a raft of price increases in April, such as domestic energy and water bills, economists think rate-setters will opt for a cut, given the anticipated slowdown.Unlike the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, which last month cut interest rates too, the US Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday as its policymakers wait to see how Trump's tariffs affect the US economy before making any moves.Inflation rates around the world are way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from the near zero rates during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then began to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed energy costs higher.As inflation rates have declined from multidecade highs, central banks, including the Fed, have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic.","Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates on Thursday.

What lies ahead for the new German government?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/what-lies-ahead-for-the-new-german-government/articleshow/121076843.cms,"New Chancellor Friedrich Merz faces a plethora of challenges (Image: AP)

More border controls and refusals:

Germany has no federal budget:

Too many pensioners, too few skilled workers:

Merz faces foreign policy challenges:





What do the previous centre-left coalition government of Social Democrats (SPD), environmentalist Greens and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) and the new alliance of the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU), Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), and the SPD have in common? Apart from the fact that both of them took around 10 weeks to form a coalition agreement, not much. At least, that's what the conservative parties maintain.""The change in direction that many of the population want is set down on paper,"" said CSU leader Markus Söder at the signing of the coalition agreement in early May. ""Strengthening the economy, limiting illegal migration, putting Germany back in order, and giving it new momentum."" And he added, this must now be done ""at top speed.""Among the Social Democrats, however, there is little inclination to fundamentally change everything that they had put in place over the past three and a half years in power.They are resisting overly drastic cuts, especially in social policy.The chancellery is now back in the hands of the CDU. Its leader, Friedrich Merz , has become the head of government, while SPD leader Lars Klingbeil is his vice chancellor and finance minister. In total, there are 17 ministries. The CDU and SPD each lead seven, the CSU three. What is striking is that the CDU has mainly sent lawyers into the race, while the SPD has appointed far more women than men.The CDU/CSU and SPD are an alliance of convenience, forged because the results of the February 23 election yielded no other way to form a majority that did not include the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). However, Chancellor Merz has emphasized that the two parties had grown closer during the coalition negotiations.""Over time, we found ourselves working more and more closely, in an increasingly collegial and trusting manner. I am very confident that we will succeed in governing our country with strength, foresight, and trust,"" he said.The CDU/CSU and SPD see it as their responsibility to prevent the AfD from growing in strength. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said on public broadcaster ARD that this primarily means dealing with the issues that have ""made the AfD big,"" adding that there is ""work to be done."" The AfD must be ""governed away.""Germany will now turn some asylum-seekers away at its borders, Dobrindt said on May 7. He added that exceptions would be made for ""vulnerable groups,"" including pregnant women and children.Several thousand additional officers are to be deployed to monitor the borders, in addition to the roughly 11,000 federal police officers already on the ground. Increased air surveillance aims to make it easier to identify smugglers and to be able to react more quickly to changes in their routes.Several of Germany's 16 federal states support the plans. These include Brandenburg, Saxony and Bavaria, which have borders with Poland, the Czech Republic and Austria respectively. However, there was immediate criticism from the neighboring countries. ""We are not going to close the borders, but we are going to control the borders more strictly and this stronger control of the borders will also lead to a higher number of rejections,"" said Dobrindt.But he also sought to allay concerns. ""We will gradually increase this higher number of rejections and the stronger controls at the borders,"" he added. ""We will ensure that, step by step, more police forces are deployed at the borders and can also carry out these pushbacks.""In terms of domestic policy, Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil has had to get to work immediately. It's his job to present a federal budget as quickly as possible for the current year. The previous government fell apart trying to achieve just this back in November. Even a draft for the 2026 budget is already overdue.The CDU/CSU and SPD have made governing a little easier for themselves with a €500 billion ($567) special fund for investments. Now, as Klingbeil put it, ""the biggest modernization in decades"" is being launched. ""For schools, for the railways, for security, for fast internet, for climate protection, for energy, for mobility, for additional housing.""Nevertheless, the government will still have to make hefty cuts. The additional debt may only be used for investment and not for social spending. But this is precisely what continues to grow due to the demographic shift in Germany.Germans are getting older and living longer. A reform of the pension system is urgently needed, but the SPD has insisted on keeping pensions stable. Currently, every fourth euro from the federal budget is paid into the pension funds as a subsidy. The older the population gets, the greater the costs for care and health insurance. Here, too, Klingbeil will have to consider how costs can be reduced.A lot will depend on how the German economy develops, especially when it comes to financing social spending. And the outlook is bleak, with the country in its third year of recession. Klingbeil has stressed that strengthening the economy is the highest priority.""Prosperity has to be earned, and that is why this coalition agreement is a clear sign that we want to strengthen industry, attract future industries to Germany, and that we are committed to Made in Germany.""The new government also faces enormous challenges in foreign policy. Following US President Donald Trump 's policy shift and in view of the threat from Russia, Germany must redefine its role in Europe and the world.This is what Merz, a seasoned European politician and transatlanticist, wants to take on as his central task. ""Large parts of Europe, the European Union in particular, are waiting for us to once again make a powerful contribution to the success of the European project,"" he said. The new chancellor plans to set up a National Security Council in the chancellery to bundle foreign policy and security policy decisions going forward.","The CDU/CSU and SPD are an alliance of convenience, forged because the results of the February 23 election yielded no other way to form a majority that did not include the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) The CDU has mainly sent lawyers into the race, while the SPD has appointed far more women than men.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121076987,imgsize-868841,width-400,resizemode-4/121076987.jpg"
