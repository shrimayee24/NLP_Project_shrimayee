NEW DELHI: With India gearing up to submit its updated climate action pledge ahead of the UN climate summit (COP30) next month, the Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Saturday headed to Brazil for a pre-COP meeting, scheduled on Oct 13-14in Brasilia, to put forward the country’s expectation from the main annual conference next month.Besides pitching for Global South’s demand for more predictable climate finance, he is likely to flag the need for adaptation strategies and the functioning of the global carbon market.India has time and again raised that the financial support of $300 billion annually to the Global South (developing countries) by 2035 is insufficient and stressed that developed countries have the moral responsibility to support developing countries for implementation of their climate action pledges. Yadav is expected to flag it at the pre-COP meeting as well.At last year’s UN climate summit (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, developed countries had agreed to mobilise merely $300 billion annually by 2035, far short of the $1.3-trillion target set by developing countries.On his way back, Yadav will attend the G20 working group ministerial meeting on climate and environmental sustainability on Oct 16-17 in Cape Town, South Africa, where he is expected to set the tone for COP30 which is to be held in Belem, Brazil from Nov 10 to 21.""India is expected to submit its national adaptation plan and updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) - climate action plan for 2035 - to the UN climate body ahead of COP30,"" said an official.India's first national adaptation plan will be a blueprint for the country's approach to integrate adaptation into national development plans and policies across economic sectors. It has been framed to build resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate-related risks across various sectors/regions such as agriculture, water resources, the Himalayan region, coastal regions, health, disaster management etc.The NDC will, on the other hand, specify the country's greenhouse gas emission reduction target and a goal on enhanced footprints of electricity from non-fossil fuel resources by 2035.

Every instance of failure to act in financial matters not white-collar crime: Ex-CJI Sanjiv Khanna,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-instance-of-failure-to-act-in-financial-matters-not-white-collar-crime-ex-cji-sanjiv-khanna/articleshow/124493570.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former chief justice of India Sanjiv Khanna said on Saturday that every instance of failure to act in matters that have financial implications cannot be termed a white-collar crime.He said this while speaking at the ""National Conference on White Collar Crime"", organised by the Terapanth Professional Forum.""White-collar crime is a cliche which we hear every day in, day out, but very few of us really understand what is a white-collar crime. This expression was coined in 1939 by a sociologist, who described it as a non-violent offence committed by individuals of position and responsibility,"" Justice Khanna said.He said these crimes are committed by people in positions of trust, authority or respectability, usually for personal or organisational gain, and these are generally non-violent and economic in nature.""Yes, white-collar crimes can also lead to violence and they are then classified as red-collar crimes. Now, it will be wrong to say that every act of failure to act that has financial implications is a white-collar crime.To me, financial or monetary wrongs can be divided into three categories,"" the former CJI said.He said the first category includes crimes motivated by greed or advantage, such as fraud, embezzlement, insider trading, cyber crime, money laundering, intentional tax evasion, bribery and corruption.""The second category of wrongdoings is unintentional, largely due to a lack of awareness or knowledge. It is without malicious or bad mental intent. The third category of financial crimes are technical or procedural wrongs, like not taking prior permission, filing errors, compliance oversight, which happens due to a misunderstanding of law or lack of awareness,"" Justice Khanna said.He said a difficulty arises when the legislature equates the first category of white-collar crimes with other categories, or a disproportionate punishment is prescribed with penalties or even a sentence of imprisonment, notwithstanding that the lapse is involuntary or without the intent to gain financially or cause harm, but on account of lack of awareness or confusion.""This morning, I read in the papers that there is active discussion going on to reduce the number of offences under the Income Tax Act. While these moves are right, at the same time, white-collar crimes, especially cyber crimes, are increasing. The only way to deal with it is public awareness and knowledge that you can be subjected to a white-collar crime,"" Justice Khanna said.The former CJI said nothing prevents an individual from approaching police in case of falling prey to white-collar crimes.Posing a question for lawyers, he said, ""How many of you have ever written to the government that your client, who is briefing you, has indulged in money laundering? I do not think anybody would have done it. All of us have been brought up to understand that there is a professional privilege.""I am looking forward to the day when a taxpayer approaches his accountant, chartered accountant, lawyer with the question, 'please tell me what is the right amount of tax I have to pay', and not with the question, 'please tell me how I can reduce or evade taxes'. The day that happens, a lot of things will change.""Justice Khanna said people are afraid to go to law-enforcement agencies in case of being victims of white-collar crimes because going to such government authorities is a ""Herculean task"" and ""a source of harassment"".""And that fear factor, invariably, is used by cyber criminals to digitally arrest you or swindle you. There has to be a change in the mindset of the ordinary people when they deal with this situation. You should be able to have the courage to go to law-enforcement agencies and not fear.""You should not feel that if I go to a law-enforcement agency, I will be harassed more, I would rather pay up the amount demanded,"" the former CJI said.","Former chief justice of India Sanjiv Khanna said every failure to act in matters that have financial implications cannot be termed a white-collar crime.

Donald Trump’s New Envoy To India Sergio Gor Arrives In Delhi With Big Agenda On Trade And Security

NEW DELHI: The underlying priority of India’s trade negotiations is to secure fair and balanced agreements in the best interest of the nation and the people, a top PMO official said on Saturday, asserting that the economy continues to demonstrate remarkable dynamism and resilience amid global uncertainty.Delivering the Kale memorial lecture at the Punebased Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, principal secretary-2 to PM Modi Shaktikanta Das said the global economy is going through a phase of unprecedented uncertainty and fundamental reset.“A rules-based trading framework that promoted globalisation and free trade for over eight decades is under challenge. Established rules are being increasingly questioned while new norms are yet to be firmly established,” said the former RBI governor. He said the pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia conflict have accelerated the move toward self-reliance.“This transformation is also evident in the growing influence of regional trade agreements (RTAs), which reflect a shift towards more fragmented yet practical trade alliances,” said Das, adding that India is a signatory to 14 free trade agreements (FTAs) and six preferential trade agreements (PTAs), with the UK, Australia and the UAE being the recent additions among FTAs.He said that at present, India is in free trade agreement negotiations with the US, the EU, Peru, Oman, New Zealand, among several others.Das said that amid the uncertain global environment, India continues to demonstrate remarkable dynamism and resilience.“Guided by a decade of structural reforms and strategic global positioning under the vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, the nation has successfully weathered multiple global headwinds,” said Das who has helped navigate several economic headwinds in the past during his stint at RBI and the finance ministry.“India’s robust domestic demand, together with prudent macroeconomic and financial sector policies, has enabled the country to withstand many external shocks. India is now poised to contribute about one-fifth of the world’s GDP growth.”The former RBI governor said India continues to record impressive growth, as several favourable factors, such as a younger demography and greater reliance on domestic demand, provide the strength to withstand the negative spillovers from global turbulence. Das also said India’s average economic growth during 2014-15 to 202425 was 7.1% (excluding the Covid-19 years of 2020-21 and 2021-22) and in the last three years (2022-23 to 2024-25), GDP growth averaged 7.8%.",Shaktikanta Das said the global economy is going through a phase of unprecedented uncertainty and fundamental reset.

PM Modi's BIG OUTREACH To India's Farmers, Launches Agri Schemes Worth ₹35,000 Crore Before Diwali

NEW DELHI: With the campaign for Bihar elections gathering pace, PM Modi on Saturday launched two mega central schemes with a total outlay of Rs 35,440 crore to transform 100 low-performing agri-districts and increase production of pulses to reduce imports, urging farmers to focus on both selfreliance and exports.Addressing a gathering of farmers and farm policymakers at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, he said, “On one hand, we will have to be self-sufficient, while on the other hand, we will have to produce for the global market...We have to focus on those crops which can dominate the world agri market. These two schemes – PM Dhan Dhaanya Krishi Yojana (with an outlay of Rs 24,000 crore for 100 lowperforming districts) and Mission for self-sufficiency in pulses (with an outlay of Rs 11,440 crore) – will play vital roles in this journey. He further emphasised farmers’ vital contribution in making the country self-reliant in food production and calling upon them to lead the way in building a developed India.On the occasion, he also virtually inaugurated 1,054 completed projects valued at over Rs 5,450 crore and laid foundation stones for an additional 50 projects, worth around Rs 815 crore, relating to agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, and food processing sectors.Both the newly launched centralschemeswill be implemented from the upcoming rabi (winter sowing) season, extending till 2030-31. Under the PM Dhan Dhaanya Yojana for 100 low-productivity districts, farm output will be enhanced through various interventions, including a focus on higher irrigation coverage and crop diversification.Among the 100 identified districts, Uttar Pradesh accounts for the highest number (12). It is followed by Maharashtra (9); Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan (8); Bihar (7); Gujarat, Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and West Bengal (4); Assam, Kerala and Chhattisgarh (3); and Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and UT of J&K (2).These districts have been identified based on three factors: low productivity, moderate crop intensity and belowaverage access to credit. Thirty-six different schemes of 11 departments will be converged to implement the programme. “We have often heard the phrase ‘36 ka aankda’; a way of saying that two parties are completely at odds with each other. But as a government, we challenge such perceptions and reverse them,” PM Modi said, underlining that the govt has brought together 36 schemes under PM DhanDhaanya Krishi Yojana to develop the identified districts.","PM Modi launched two mega central schemes with a total outlay of Rs 35,440 crore to transform 100 low-performing agri-districts.

Threats faced by girls now extend into the digital world, says

CJI

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice B R Gavai on Saturday said despite constitutional guarantees, many girls continue to be tragically denied their fundamental rights and even basic necessities for survival and face harmful practices like female genital mutilation (FGM). Interestingly, a PIL challenging the validity of FGM, practised among certain Muslims, is pending before a ninejudge SC bench, which is also seized of the challenge to alleged discriminatory practices against women at Sabarimala, Agiyari of Parsi communities and mosques.A a national consultation on ‘Safeguarding the girl child: towards a safer and enabling environment for her in India’ organised by juvenile justice committee headed by Justice B V Nagarathna, CJI B R Gavai said, “This vulnerability exposes them (girls) to disproportionately high risks of sexual abuse, exploitation, & harmful practices such as FGM, malnutrition, sex-selective abortions, trafficking, and child marriage against their will. ” He said advancement in technology, though empowering, has given rise to new vulnerabilities for the female child.“Threats faced by young girls are no longer confined to physical spaces, they extend into the digital world. From online harassment, cyberbullying, and digital stalking to misuse of personal data and deep fake imagery, the challenges have evolved in both scale and sophistication,” the CJI said. Calling upon institutions, policy makers & enforcement authorities to realise realities of presentera challenges, he said technology must serve as a tool for liberation rather than exploitation.“Safeguarding the girl child today means securing her future in classrooms, workplaces, and on every screen she encounters,” he said. Justice Nagarathna said, “A young girl in India can be said to be a truly equal citizen only when she can freely aspire to do anything that her male counterpart does and receive the same quality of support and resources to do so, facing no barriers specific.”","Despite constitutional guarantees, many girls continue to be tragically denied their fundamental rights, says Chief Justice B R Gavai.

NEW DELHI: Notorious fugitive gangster Rashid Cablewala, who has been linked to several murders in Delhi, was detained in Azerbaijan on arriving from Istanbul, sources confirmed, with Indian intelligence agencies now gearing up to bring him back, reports Rajshekhar Jha.It is unclear whether he was imprisoned there or kept under surveillance post-bond. Cablewala, who is on the ‘most wanted’ list, was detained by immigration authorities at Baku’s Heydar Aliyev International Airport due to “anomalies in his travel documents”, a relative said. A senior cop confirmed the developments and said they would share details of his criminal history and dossier through appropriate channels.Cablewala is a close associate of jailed gangster Hashim Baba and was handling operations for the gang. He is also linked to the Lawrence Bishnoi syndicate. His name emerged in the killing of businessman Nadir Shah in Greater Kailash-I in Sept last year. He was then accused of a double murder in east Delhi on th e night of Diwali in Oct 2024. When his name croopped up again, in the killing of businessman Sunil Jain in east Delhi’s Krishna Nagar last Dec, Cablewala became one of Delhi Police ’s most sought-after fugitives.Speaking with TOI from an undisclosed location in December 2024, Cablewala claimed that Jain’s murder was “retribution” for the twin murders reported from the same area in Oct but denied his involvement. Cablewala told TOI that Sachin alias Golu was one of the assailants who had accepted payment from two parties to kill another individual. “Jain was not the target. The target was this man named Virat and he will be eliminated. ..,” he had revealed.Sources said Sachin was still on the run and may have fled abroad too.Authorities said Hashim Baba and Cablewala shared an extensive history. They initially gained notoriety when they, along with their former associate Nasir, eliminated Akil Mama during a funeral in 2013. Following Nasir’s imprisonment, Hashim Baba and Cablewala assumed control of the gang. They eventually separated and established their individual operations.A history-sheeter linked to multiple homicide cases, Cablewala carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh before his arrest in 2018. At the time, he was apprehended while attempting to escape to Saudi Arabia. He established a garments enterprise in Riyadh and was expanding into Thailand. This, investigators said, was to launder illicit proceeds. In 2019, he was charged under MCOCA by the crime branch. In 2020, he was apprehended again by the special cell. He escaped using a forged passport in early 2022.","Rashid Cablewala was detained by immigration authorities at Baku’s Heydar Aliyev International Airport due to “anomalies in his travel documents”, a relative said.

Denial of justice

, says lawyer on repeated recusals

DEHRADUN: In what is being termed an unprecedented series of recusals, another judge has decided to withdraw from a case involving Uttarakhand-cadre Indian Forest Service officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi. Justice Alok Verma of the Uttarakhand high court became the 16th judge to recuse from Chaturvedi’s case, and the second one within a fortnight. Verma’s recusal order, dated Oct 8, simply stated, “List before another bench,” without assigning any reason continuing a pattern seen in previous recusals in Chaturvedi’s matters.Sanjiv Chaturvedi’s counsel, Sudershan Goel, termed the repeated recusals “a denial of justice” and an infringement of his client’s constitutional right. “Judges usually recuse themselves when they have previously represented a party, share a familial relation, or have a financial association. Any other or non-reasoned recusal amounts to impropriety and betrayal of the constitutional oath of office,” he said.Verma’s withdrawal comes 12 days after Justice Ravindra Maithani of Uttarakhand HC similarly recused himself from hearing one of Chaturvedi’s cases. The present matter involves a contempt petition filed by Chaturvedi against CAT members and the registry for alleged wilful disobedience of a stay order.Advocate Goel said this sets a record in the judicial history of the country, as never before have so many judges recused from hearing cases of a particular person.","Justice Alok Verma of the Uttarakhand high court became the 16th judge to recuse from Sanjiv Chaturvedi’s case, and the second one within a fortnight.

Jaishankar-Muttaqi Meet Marks Strategic Shift in India-Afghan Ties, Pak Faces Pressure: Experts

Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi backed trade through the Chabahar port route and called for opening the India-Pakistan Attari-Wagah border for trade with India. At a press conference in the Afghanistan embassy, following his meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Muttaqi also announced that the Taliban will appoint diplomats in India.Pakistan does not allow India to export to Afghanistan via the land route, and the Indian government has used the Chabahar port in Iran for trade and commerce with Afghanistan. The US, however, last month revoked the 2018 sanctions waiver that allowed India to develop the port and access Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan.Muttaqi said trade is meant to benefit people and should not be mixed with politics. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all 3 countries,’’ said Muttaqi, addressing a press conference at the Afghanistan embassy for which no woman journalist was invited. He also announced the formation of a trade committee to remove obstacles in commercial ties with India.Muttaqi also reiterated Afghanistan’s position that it won’t allow the US to take control of the Bagram airbase, even as it remains open to diplomatic ties with Washington. Indian government sources later confirmed India had agreed to work with the Taliban to have their diplomats stationed here but added India’s position on formal recognition will remain broadly aligned with that of the international community.Muttaqi addressed the media with a small flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), Taliban’s name for the country, placed on the table. He told reporters the embassy building, which still flies the flag of the erstwhile Islamic Republic, belonged to the IEA. “The appointment of diplomats will be a step towards normalisation and further improvement of ties,” said Muttaqi. The appointment will not be at the ambassador level, in the absence of formal recognition by India. The diplomats appointed by the Taliban will be allowed to work from the embassy.Asked about women’s rights, a sticking point in the Taliban’s ties with the international community, Muttaqi said all countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected. He was also non-committal on whether girls or women would be allowed to travel to India for studies.""In the recent earthquake in Afghanistan, India was the first responder. Afghanistan looks at India as a close friend. Afghanistan wants relations based on mutual respect, trade and people-to-people relations. We are ready to create a consultative mechanism of understanding, which helps towards strengthening our relations,” said Muttaqi.The issue of women rights has been flagged by Indian authorities from several multilateral forums. India believes Taliban must work towards the formation of a truly inclusive government and preservation of women, children and minorities.Muttaqi also said he and Jaishankar discussed security concerns in detail. “The IEA has proven in the last four years that the territory of Afghanistan will not be used against others. And it remains committed to that policy that the territory of Afghanistan is not used to threaten others,” said Muttaqi.","Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi called for opening the India- Pakistan Attari-Wagah border for trade with India.

Clear messaging to Pakistan



Strategic recalibration: Delhi steps in



Economics, connectivity and regional stakes



Security calculus: Terrorism and recognition



Presence restored, recognition withheld



Regional balancing act



Strategic hedging, not endorsement



NEW DELHI: In a diplomatic manoeuvre that could reshape regional equations, India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s high-profile visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan — the first of its kind that came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Kabul and Islamabad.During the meetings, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that India’s engagement “contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” while announcing a fresh round of development projects across Afghan provinces. The upgrade of India’s technical mission to a full-fledged embassy signals a significant deepening of diplomatic ties without extending formal recognition to the Taliban regime.Later the same day, Muttaqi held a press briefing in New Delhi, sharply condemning Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, calling it a “provocative act” and a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty. “Such issues cannot be resolved by strength.Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he said, stressing the widening rift between Kabul and Islamabad.India had shut its Kabul embassy in August 2021 after the Taliban’s return to power, maintaining only a skeletal presence through a technical team since June 2022 to oversee humanitarian aid. The embassy upgrade marks the deepest level of engagement between India and the Taliban since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government. This move stops short of formal recognition but signals a decisive shift in India’s Afghanistan strategy.The timing of the announcement was significant. It came just hours after Afghanistan’s defence ministry accused Pakistan of bombing civilian areas in Paktika near the Durand Line. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the ministry said in a post on social media. Calling it “an unprecedented, violent, and provocative act”, Kabul warned that defending its territory is its right.From Indian soil, Muttaqi chose to respond sharply. “I think it’s a wrong step by the Pakistan government. Such issues cannot be resolved by strength. Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he told reporters in Delhi. “Some attacks happened in border areas, and we condemn them. We have opened doors for dialogue and diplomacy.”The unusually strong language stressed the widening rift between the Taliban and Pakistan, their uneasy patron for decades. Relations have deteriorated over Islamabad’s military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters allegedly sheltering in Afghanistan. In March 2024, Pakistani airstrikes in Khost and Paktika killed several civilians, triggering warnings from Kabul of “consequences”. This fracture, analysts say, has created a new strategic opening for India.India has historically had a fraught relationship with the Taliban. During the 1990s, New Delhi backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance while Islamabad openly supported the Taliban regime. After 2001, India became one of Afghanistan’s largest regional donors, pledging over USD 3 billion for development projects. But the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 disrupted India’s presence and leverage in the country. New Delhi maintained limited contact, focusing on humanitarian assistance and regional coordination with Iran and Central Asian partners.Now, with Pakistan–Taliban ties fraying, India is recalibrating. By reopening its embassy, hosting Muttaqi, and accepting Taliban-appointed diplomats (though not at the ambassadorial level), India is signalling a willingness to engage without granting formal recognition. Strategic analysts describe this as “hedging” — positioning itself to gain influence should Pakistan’s grip weaken further, while safeguarding its own security concerns.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says this evolving situation presents India with a rare diplomatic opening.“The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly offers an opportunity for India can be a stabilising factor even in the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. India’s presence matters a lot to Afghanistan because it will provide some kind of legitimacy to the Taliban government, even though India is unlikely to recognise the regime as such,” he says.The engagement carried clear economic undertones as well. Muttaqi invited Indian companies to invest in Afghanistan’s mining sector and called for the opening of the Attari–Wagah border for direct India–Afghanistan trade. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all three countries,” he said.Currently, India trades with Afghanistan primarily via Iran’s Chabahar port due to Pakistan’s denial of overland access. But the route faces uncertainty after the United States revoked India’s sanctions waiver for Chabahar in September 2024, complicating transit. While Chabahar remains a strategic hedge, its operational limitations make direct India–Afghanistan connectivity via Pakistan attractive in theory — though politically fraught.India also announced a new slate of development projects: a Thalassemia Centre and 30-bed hospital in Bagrami district, oncology and trauma centres in Kabul, maternity clinics across Paktika, Khost and Paktia, and donations of ambulances, medical equipment and vaccines. These announcements draw on India’s legacy of over 500 development projects across all 34 Afghan provinces, including the Parliament building and the Salma Dam.Security remains at the core of India’s engagement. Without naming Pakistan, both sides “unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries” in their joint statement. Jaishankar said, “We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” Muttaqi, meanwhile, pledged that Afghanistan “won’t allow any group to use the country against others”, identifying Daesh (ISIS) as the main regional threat.For India, the key is ensuring Afghan soil is not used for anti-India activities — a core concern since the IC-814 hijacking in 1999. Prof. Kumar explains this strategic bottom line:“What can happen, and what India is probably thinking, is that the land of Afghanistan may not be used for terrorist activities against India. That would be a huge achievement from the Indian perspective,” he says.India has so far avoided pressing the Taliban hard on human rights. Muttaqi remained vague when asked about women’s rights, saying, “All countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected.” While India has consistently raised rights issues at multilateral forums, officials have avoided making them a precondition for engagement.Perhaps the most consequential element of India’s strategy is its decision to reopen its embassy in Kabul without formally recognising the Taliban regime — a nuanced diplomatic line that gives New Delhi both flexibility and leverage. By restoring a physical diplomatic presence, India can deepen engagement on the ground and signal its relevance in Afghanistan’s evolving power dynamics, without extending official legitimacy to a government that remains internationally unrecognised and controversial for its human rights record.This approach reflects a clear distinction between establishing an embassy and granting diplomatic recognition. India has previously maintained similar diplomatic arrangements, such as with Palestine, where the presence of an embassy does not automatically translate into full diplomatic recognition of a government. In the Afghan context, this allows India to engage pragmatically while aligning its policy with the broader stance of the United Nations, the European Union and Western countries, most of which have opted for functional engagement without recognition.By doing so, New Delhi positions itself strategically. It can build channels of communication, potentially shape outcomes on critical security and connectivity issues, and apply pressure on regional actors like Pakistan and China, both of which are wary of India expanding its influence in Afghanistan. At the same time, India avoids prematurely endorsing a regime whose policies on women’s rights and governance remain at odds with international norms.India’s outreach is also informed by broader regional considerations. Russia and China have already established working relationships with the Taliban. Western governments are engaged in dialogue on counterterrorism and aid. New Delhi, analysts say, does not want to be the outlier.As Prof. Kumar notes, “Since Russia is talking, China is already there, and American and Western governments are also talking, India should not be left out. We may have ideological differences with the Taliban regime, but since other countries are talking to the Taliban in different forms, we should also try to moderate our policy and engage on several issues.”This balancing act is not without challenges. The Taliban regime remains ideologically rigid, especially on women’s rights and governance. Connectivity through Chabahar faces geopolitical headwinds. And there is no guarantee that the Taliban will limit anti-India groups indefinitely. Yet, by opening formal diplomatic channels, India aims to secure a seat at the table rather than watch from the sidelines as others shape Afghanistan’s future.Muttaqi’s visit to Delhi, marked by strong rhetoric against Pakistan, overtures for trade, and assurances on terrorism, reflects Kabul’s attempt to diversify its diplomatic bets. For India, the outreach is less about endorsing the Taliban regime and more about strategic positioning: insulating itself against security risks, reasserting influence in a region long dominated by Pakistan, and adapting to a shifting geopolitical landscape.New Delhi’s approach remains cautious but deliberate. It is engaging the Taliban to pursue its security and strategic objectives, without abandoning its normative concerns or rushing into recognition. In the complex triangle of India–Afghanistan–Pakistan, this marks the beginning of a new phase — one where India is no longer merely reacting to developments in Kabul, but actively shaping them.","India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124482977,imgsize-36624,width-400,resizemode-4/amir-khan-muttaqi-foreign-minister-of-the-islamic-emirate-of-afghanistan-talibanexternal-affairs-minister-s-jaishankar-general-asim-munir-chief-of-army-staff-pakistan-army.jpg"

R-Power CFO held by ED after questioning on fake bank guarantee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/r-power-cfo-held-by-ed-after-questioning-on-fake-bank-guarantee/articleshow/124490286.cms,"Anil Ambani

RPL, its top execs accused of alleged diversion of funds



NEW DELHI: The ED late on Friday arrested Reliance Power’s chief financial officer Ashok Pal after questioning him at its headquarters here in a case of fake bank guarantee. He was produced before a court here on Saturday and remanded in two days of ED custody. Pal, the CFO of Reliance Power Limited (RPL), an Anil Ambani Reliance group company, has been taken into custody in an ongoing money laundering probe related to banking fraud against Ambani and his group entities. “The degree of fraud can be gauged from the fact that Reliance Power group submitted a bank guarantee from FirstRand Bank, Manila, Philippines. The fact is that there exists no branch of FirstRand Bank in the Philippines,” sources said.Fake and spoofed domains of commercial banks, such as sbi.17313@s-bi.co.in a look alike of SBI email was created by inserting a hyphen to commit the fraud, an official said. Similar emails of other PSU banks have also been used by the accused. Reliance Power Limited (RPL) is a listed company where public holds more than 75% shares. The company and its top executives are accused of alleged diversion of funds. “Board resolution empowered CFO Ashok Pal and others to finalise, approve, sign and execute all documents for Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) BESS tender, and to use RPL’s financial capability for the bid,” the agency sources said.In a statement, RPL said, “The company & its subsidiaries acted bonafidely and are a victim of fraud, forgery and cheating conspiracy. We also wish to clarify on media reports that Anil D Ambani is not on Board of Reliance Power Limited for more than 3.5 years and is not concerned with this matter in any manner.”On Aug 1, ED had conducted searches at three premises in Bhubaneswar and one at Kolkata after its investigators found alleged evidence of Rs 68 crore fake bank guarantee provided to SECI on behalf of Reliance NU BESS Ltd/Maharashtra Energy Generation Ltd. The fake bank guarantee was generated by a shell entity registered at Bhubaneswar, allegedly linked to Anil Ambani group. Spoofed email accounts were created to make them look genuine, sources said. Besides the allegedly forged bank guarantee, Anil Ambani’s Reliance group is also being probed for alleged fake bills for commission. The agency sources alleged that Pal “played crucial role in submitting a bogus bank guarantee of over Rs 68 crore to SECI, with an intention to cheat the PSU”. The probe has revealed that Pal was instrumental in selecting Biswal Tradelink Pvt Ltd to provide fake bank guarantee. Director of BTPL Partha Sarathi Biswal was arrested earlier and is currently in judicial custody. ED also found alleged diversion of money through fake transport invoices of several crores of rupees.",The ED late on Friday arrested Reliance Power’s chief financial officer Ashok Pal.

Sergio Gor Calls Meeting With PM Modi 'Incredible', Says ‘Trump Considers Him Great Friend’

Key takeaways



The two leaders discussed the importance of critical minerals, Gor said.

Bilateral issues, including defence, trade and technology were also discussed, he said.

Gor noted that the United States“values its relationship with India” and emphasised that his visit underscored Washington’s commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation.

He also gifted a portrait to PM Modi with Trump's signature on it saying: ""Mr Prime Minister, you are great.""

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday met US Ambassador-designate Sergio Gor in New Delhi, marking the first high-level interaction between the two since Gor’s Senate confirmation as the next American envoy to India.The meeting comes amid ongoing trade tensions and hopes for renewed momentum in the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Sergio Gor said, “I had an incredible meeting with Prime Minister Modi. We discussed bilateral issues, including defence, trade and technology. We also discussed the importance of critical minerals.”He added, “President Trump considers Prime Minister Modi a great and personal friend. In fact, just before I left for New Delhi, they had an incredible phone call. And that is something that will continue over the weeks and months ahead.”PM Modi wrote on X, “Glad to receive Mr. Sergio Gor, Ambassador-designate of the US to India. I’m confident that his tenure will further strengthen the India–US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.”Earlier in the day, he also held discussions with external affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary Vikram Misri.“We had a great series of meetings,” Gor said, adding that both sides exchanged views on expanding defence ties and economic collaboration.EAM Jaishankar described his meeting with Gor as “productive,” saying on X, “Discussed the India-US relationship and its global significance. Wish him the best for his new responsibility.”Gor, accompanied by US deputy secretary for management and resources Michael J Rigas, is currently on a six-day visit to India.The trip comes amid ongoing strains in India-US relations following Washington’s decision to impose 50 per cent tariffs on Indian exports — including 25 per cent additional duties on crude oil purchases from Russia.Despite these challenges, the recent phone call between PM Modi and Trump, and Gor’s outreach in New Delhi, are being seen as signs of optimism in resetting trade negotiations.Earlier, during his Senate confirmation hearing, Gor had highlighted the “deep friendship” between Trump and PM Modi, calling it a “unique strength” in advancing bilateral relations.He said, “India is a strategic partner whose trajectory will shape the region and beyond.”Gor’s formal presentation of credentials is expected to take place at a later date, according to the US embassy.","Sergio Gor calls Meeting With PM Modi 'Incredible', Says ‘Trump Considers Him Great Friend’ The two leaders discussed the importance of critical minerals, Gor said.

Sergio Gor Calls Meeting With PM Modi 'Incredible', Says ‘Trump Considers Him Great Friend’

In a rare gesture, amidst ongoing efforts to repair the India-US relationship, PM Narendra Modi Saturday received US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor who delivered a message to him from President Donald Trump in the form of a framed photograph of their White House press conference earlier this year signed by the president as, “Mr. Prime Minister, you are great!”.Modi later said in a post on X he was glad to meet Gor. “I’m confident that his tenure will further strengthen the India–US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership,” said Modi, who spoke to Trump for the second time in less than a month on Thursday. Gor responded by saying it was an honour to meet Modi, who is considered a “great and personal” friend by Trump, and the relationship with India will only strengthen over the months ahead.Gor’s engagements on Saturday - including with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Vikram Misri - have raised hopes of an early conclusion of the trade talks as well as a summit level meeting. A diplomatic source said positive outcomes are in the works.Gor also said that in his “incredible” meeting with Modi, both sides discussed bilateral issues, including defence, trade, and technology.In the middle of a fresh US-China row over rare earths and critical minerals, he also discussed the importance of critical minerals and the “importance of that to both of our nations”.“The U.S. values its relationship with India, and under the strong leadership of President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Modi, I'm optimistic about the days ahead for both of our nations,” said Gor, adding he arrived from Washington in the morning and hit the ground running.It’s rare for the PM to meet an ambassador before the person has assumed office and the development suggests both sides might be within striking distance of a trade deal that could act as an antidote to the dramatic downturn in ties since May this year, if not earlier. The contentious negotiations for the agreement have threatened to undermine other aspects of the relationship. Modi had congratulated Trump on Thursday for the success of his Gaza peace plan, while also endorsing what he described as good progress in the negotiations and said the leaders agreed to being in close touch in the coming weeks.Whether or not that translates into a meeting on the margins of the Asean and East Asia summits in Malaysia later this month remains to be seen. Both leaders are expected to participate, but neither has officially confirmed it yet. Both sides seem keen on a bilateral meeting this year. The possibility of a Quad summit in the next few months is also not ruled out.The ambassador’s appointment has been confirmed by the Senate but he’s currently in India only for a 6-day trip, apparently to familiarise himself with his new responsibility. He will take charge at a later date. After his meeting with Gor, Jaishankar said in a post on X later that he discussed the India-US relationship and its global significance and wished him the best for his new responsibility.Gor is travelling to India, accompanied by deputy secretary for management and resources Michael J Rigas. In his engagements, there was focus on expediting the trade negotiations and building upon the several major initiatives announced during Modi’s visit to Washington in February to further strengthen the relationship. That Trump chose to remind him about the meeting then in the form of the photograph is being viewed positively by India, even as the US shows no sign of lifting the additional 25 percent tariff on India for its oil purchase from Russia.","Sergio Gor presented an autographed photo of PM Modi and Trump.

Sresan Pharma Owner G Ranganathan Arrested In Chennai Over Coldrif Cough Syrup Deaths

DEG test now must for finished products

SIT: Cough syrup case exposes deep systemic failures

BHOPAL: The MP SIT probing the Coldrif tragedy that claimed the lives of 20 kids from Chhindwara and three from other districts is examining the entire supply chain of the cough syrup — from procurement of raw materials to distribution of the contaminated drug — aiming to fix accountability at every stage.Investigators confirmed that Ranganathan Govindan, owner of TN-based Sresan Pharmaceuticals, had procured banned industrial-grade diethylene glycol for manufacturing Coldrif. The SIT is now trying to determine how long the chemical had been in use and whether other individuals or suppliers were complicit in the process.Ranganathan initially feigned ignorance about the cause of contamination, claiming he had delegated production responsibilities to subordinates.Drugs Controller General of India Friday made it mandatory for all raw materials and finished pharmaceutical products to be tested for diethylene glycol (DEG) and ethylene glycol (EG). Testing was earlier required only on raw materials, leaving a gap for toxic solvents to enter the manufacturing process.Ranganathan Govindan, owner of TNbased Sresan Pharmaceuticals, initially said he had no direct knowledge of how the industrial chemical entered the formulation.However, after sustained interrogation, Ranganathan reportedly confessed.“He has identified the person in charge of quality control, who will be detained soon. But this does not absolve Ranganathan of responsibility — he was the signatory authority and owner of the unit,” said a senior officer privy to the probe. The 12-member SIT, led by additional superintendent of police Anjana Tiwari, includes senior police officials and drug control officers. The team has divided its work among sub-groups — one focusing on the manufacturing trail in Tamil Nadu, another on the distribution and retail network in MP, and a third on forensic and toxicological analysis.“We are also looking into the factory’s production system — whether it was automated or semi-automated — besides examining if there was any sabotage angle,” an officer said, adding the technical team is reviewing machinery logs and batch production records to detect irregularities in the blending and testing process. Officials said more arrests are likely as the SIT expands its investigation to include the quality control team, raw material suppliers, and logistics handlers.Tamil Nadu authorities have already sealed Sresan Pharmaceuticals’ manufacturing unit in Sunguvarchatram, Kanchipuram district, after laboratory tests confirmed 48.6% DEG content in the syrup. “This case has exposed deep systemic failures — not just negligence, but a collapse of safety and compliance mechanisms. The probe will continue until every link in the chain is held accountable,” an Special Investigation Team member said. Meanwhile, three children remain in critical condition at hospitals in Nagpur. Teams of doctors and Madhya Pradesh health officials are monitoring their condition round the clock.","MP SIT probing the Coldrif tragedy that claimed the lives of 20 kids from Chhindwara and three from other districts.

Deadly Cough Syrup Case: WHO Points To Regulatory Gap In India

BHOPAL: After the death of 23 children in Madhya Pradesh, including 20 from Chhindwara, following the consumption of Coldrif, a cough syrup laced with the killer chemical diethylene glycol (DEG), Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) Friday made it mandatory to test for both DEG and ethylene glycol (EG) in all raw materials and finished pharmaceutical products.Earlier, such testing was required only for raw materials, leaving a crucial gap that allowed toxic solvents to enter finished syrups undetected. DCGI, which heads Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), is responsible for approving, regulating, and monitoring the quality of medicines in India. Moved by the disaster, Madhya Pradesh Food and Drugs Administration (MPFDA) wrote to DCGI Thursday, urging it to include DEG and EG testing in the “general monograph of the Indian Pharmacopoeia” (IP) — the national rulebook that sets quality standards and test methods for medicines sold in India.Within a few hours of receiving the MPFDA letter, DCGI notified the amendment and directed Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission (IPC) — the autonomous scientific body under Union ministry of health and family welfare responsible for setting and updating India’s official drug standards — to take immediate action. IPC Friday issued ‘Amendment List-09’ to IP 2022, officially introducing DEG and EG testing as a mandatory requirement for all oral liquid formulations.It also issued a circular across India, informing all state drug controllers, CDSCO zonal offices, members of the scientific body of IPC, directors of drug testing laboratories, and major industry associations, including IDMA, OPPI, BDMA, FOPE, FSSAI, and SmallScale Industry Associations, to enforce the new testing standards without delay.The order, signed by IPC secretary-cum-scientific director Dr V Kalaiselvan, directs that the amount of DEG and EG shall not exceed 0.10% and must be determined by gas chromatography. TOI is in possession of the MPFDA’s letter to DCGI and the IPC circular. “This closes a critical regulatory loophole exposed by repeated syrup-linked deaths,” an official said, calling it a decisive step toward restoring public trust in India’s drug safety system.","Earlier, such testing was required only for raw materials, leaving a crucial gap that allowed toxic solvents to enter finished syrups undetected. 23 children in Madhya Pradesh, including 20 from Chhindwara, died following the consumption of Coldrif, a cough syrup laced with the killer chemical diethylene glycol (DEG)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124492391,imgsize-1084588,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-34.jpg"

The solution is to think regionally but act locally. ""Praising the Northeast's natural beauty, biodiversity and cultural richness, Justice Kant said, ""It remains the cultural heartbeat of India. Yet, stark vulnerabilities persist, as development indicators reveal troubling disparities.""","Justice Surya Kant, who will take over as CJI next month, on Saturday said that while eastern and north-eastern India are rich in diversity and potential.

NEW DELHI: In a surprise move, Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced that it will contest all 243 seats in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, positioning itself as an alternative to both the ruling NDA and the opposition Mahagathbandhan. The decision has added an interesting variable as strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj also debuts this time in what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Party leaders said AAP aims to introduce its ""Delhi-Punjab model"" of governance in Bihar, focusing on education, healthcare and anti-corruption measures. The leadership believes widespread public frustration with unemployment, migration and poor infrastructure has created space for a new brand of issue-based politics in the state.""We have an approved model of growth and governance. The work done by the Aam Aadmi Party is being discussed across the country. People hailing from the Purvanchal region had contributed immensely to our victory in Delhi,"" AAP's state in-charge Ajesh Yadav said while announcing the decision.""Our national convener Arvind Kejriwal asked if they can help us form a government in Delhi, then why not in Bihar?"" he added.AAP’s move comes at a time when the opposition bloc - RJD, Congress, and Left parties - is struggling to finalise a seat-sharing formula ahead of the polls. The AAP, which earlier announced its decision to part ways from INDIA bloc in July, shortly after Delhi election debacle, has again chosen to chart an independent course in Bihar.Kejriwal's move is being widely seen as a response to the rise of Prashant Kishor, who has visited almost every corner of Bihar with an aim of grassroot expansion in the last couple of years. Prashant Kishor is promising an alternative to the traditional contest between the BJP-JD(U) and RJD-Congress that heavily depends on caste politics.AAP MP Sanjay Singh explained this: ""We have already delivered on the ground, but Prashant Kishore is making promises only. Making promises and actually implementing them on the ground are two very different things,"" Singh said.Interestingly, Prashant Kishor, as a strategist, played a pivotal role in AAP's success, especially in Delhi. His I-PAC collaborated closely with AAP charting out campaign strategies that helped AAP win massive once again in 2020.The timing of this bet also seems to be perfect for Kejriwal, and Prashant Kishor, as with nearly two decades of Nitish Kumar-led governance, political fatigue seems to have set in among voters, creating what some see as an opportune moment for a third front. It's a formula that once worked for Kejriwal in Delhi where AAP dethroned Congress mired in corruption and anti-incumbency.The same story was repeated in Punjab where AAP defeated the two traditional parties of Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal that had ruled the state for seven decades. AAP was seen as a party offering a fresh, corruption-free alternative, building on its reputation for delivering welfare policies and good governance in Delhi.In Bihar, Kishor has been attempting a similar style of politics, and now Kejriwal’s party has entered the fray, vying for the same space. But will Kejriwal's party succeed in making inroads in a state like Bihar or will it just vanish in thin air? We will not have to wait long to know, as the state votes in two phases on November 6 and 11. The decision will be known on November 14 when the election result is announced.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced that it will contest all 243 seats in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections.

Poll Should there be stricter laws addressing illegal power usage and constructions? Yes, definitely No, current laws are sufficient





BAREILLY: The district administration in Bareilly has reopened a decades-old loan default case and served a recovery notice to cleric Maulana Tauqeer Raza, head of Ittehad-e-Millat Council, who was arrested following violence that broke out near Islamia grounds in Bareilly on September 26.Officials said on Thursday that Raza had taken a fertiliser and seed loan of Rs 5,560 in 1990 from Rasoolpur Kutti Sadhan Cooperative Society, which he never repaid. The case had remained dormant since 1997, when a bank audit marked the dues as unpaid. Although the then government announced a loan waiver for farmers in 1996, Raza's account was reportedly not included in the relief.Hari Babu Bharti, general manager of Budaun District Cooperative Bank, said the amount remained unpaid for over three decades despite multiple reminders. ""The cleric never repaid the amount. Several notices have been served to him on multiple occasions,"" he said, adding that the loan file was inactive for years and has now been revived as part of recent departmental scrutiny.Officials said a team has been sent to Raza's residence in Bareilly to serve the recovery notice. With interest accrued over the years, the total dues now stand at Rs 28,386, and an additional 1% interest is also being considered.If the payment is not made within the stipulated time, the administration may initiate proceedings to attach Raza's property to recover the amount.The recovery notice is part of a wider crackdown on alleged financial and administrative irregularities linked to Raza's network. After his recent arrest, officials began reviewing pending cases and violations tied to his name. Authorities also flagged unauthorised power usage and illegal constructions connected to his premises. Subsequent action included demolition drives and fresh notices across multiple departments.The September 26 violence occurred during a protest connected to the ‘I love Muhammad' campaign, which led to clashes in parts of the city. Police later named Raza as one of the key accused in the FIR and sent him to 14-day judicial custody. Since the violence, authorities have intensified action against Raza and his close aides. Police have registered multiple cases related to incitement, unlawful assembly, and damage to public property. The district administration has also carried out demolition drives against structures linked to his associates, sealed several premises over alleged illegal power connections, and launched inquiries into benami assets and funding sources tied to his organisations.Officials said the revival of the old loan case is in line with recent efforts to address pending liabilities and enforce compliance. Administrative sources added that similar dormant files linked to other individuals named in recent FIRs may also be reviewed.","Maulana Tauqeer Raza, head of Ittehad-e-Millat Council, was arrested following violence that broke out near Islamia grounds in Bareilly on September 26.

Finland, consistently ranked as the world’s happiest country in the World Happiness Report, draws global talent with its exceptional quality of life, strong social welfare system, and breathtaking natural scenery. For Indian citizens, securing permanent residency (PR) in this Nordic nation grants full rights to live and work, opportunities for family reunification, and a pathway to citizenship. Recent 2025 immigration reforms have streamlined the process for skilled professionals from outside the EU, making Finland an attractive destination amid labour shortages in fields such as IT, healthcare, and engineering.Finland’s permanent residency offers non-EU nationals — including Indians — the right to live and work in the country indefinitely, along with access to essential public services such as healthcare and education. It also provides the freedom to travel freely within the Schengen Area. Unlike temporary residence permits, permanent residency does not expire, though the residence card itself must be renewed every five years within the specified timeframe. However, this status should not be confused with Finnish citizenship, which comes with stricter requirements — including proof of language proficiency and a longer period of continuous residence, typically eight years.The 2025 immigration updates focus primarily on The 2025 immigration updates focus primarily on work visas and family reunification, rather than directly on permanent residency. Under the new rules, family sponsors must have lived in the country for a minimum of two years, and spouses are required to be at least 21 years old. At the same time, work permits have been simplified for specialists, with fast-track processing available for high-salary positions, which now require a monthly gross income of EUR 1,600 (around INR 1.65 lakh).To qualify, you must have continuously lived in Finland for four years under a Type A (continuous) residence permit, beginning either from your arrival in the country or from when the permit was issued. Time spent on Type B (temporary) permits for short-term work does not count toward this period. Additionally, you must have been physically present in Finland for at least two of these four years, with all absences for holidays or work abroad properly documented.Your temporary permit’s underlying reason, such as employment or family connections, must still be valid to apply for Permanent Residence (PR). PR is not available to students or individuals on job-seeker permits. Before applying for PR, you must first switch to a Type A work or family-based permit.Although permanent residency doesn’t directly mandate these, obtaining the initial Type A permit typically requires financial and professional stability. For employment-based applications, candidates must either earn at least EUR 40,000 annually (around INR 41.3 lakh) or hold a recognised master’s/postgraduate degree with a minimum of two years of relevant experience. Alternatively, demonstrating C1-level proficiency in Finnish or Swedish along with three years of work experience can also strengthen eligibility.Applicants must provide a clean criminal record (police clearance from India), valid health insurance, and proof of accommodation. They should have no outstanding debts or dependence on social welfare. Any criminal history may negatively impact the approval process.Indians typically start with a temporary residence permit application from India, then apply for PR after four years while in Finland. Processing can take a long time so be flexible with your plans.Secure a job offer, university admission, or family tie. Apply online via Enter Finland or at VFS Global centres in India. Submit biometrics and documents like passport, job contract, salary proof, apostilled certificates, and police clearance.Live in Finland on your Type A permit, extending as required.Gather passport, photos, proof of residence, income/salary slips, educational certificates, trip logs (absences), and family details if applicable.Apply in Finland before your current permit expires. Use Enter Finland with Finnish ID for faster processing.Prove identity at a Migri service point Check status via Migri's Processing Time Checker. If approved, collect your biometric PR card.Rejections (e.g., due to incomplete docs) can be appealed within 30 days for a fee of approximately EUR 260. .For unemployed permit holders, a three-month grace period applies to find new work.Here are some benefits and considerations for Indians: Indians have the perks of indefinite stay, family sponsorship, Schengen travel, free education/healthcare, and a path to citizenship after eight years (with language tests). However there are some challenges that come with this. Some of the challenges are cold climate, language barriers (Finnish/Swedish), high living costs overall, which require proper preparation and adaptability for a smooth transition to life in Finland, ensuring long-term comfort and success.Also See: Sweden becomes the first country to be prescribed by doctors: Inside “The Swedish Prescription” campaign","Finland’s permanent residency offers non-EU nationals — including Indians — the right to live and work in the country indefinitely.

Poll Should entertainment content be cautious about portraying real-life figures? Yes, to respect reputations No, creative freedom is priority





NEW DELHI: Former Mumbai NCB Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede on Saturday said that his legal action against Netflix and Shah Rukh Khan’s Red Chillies Entertainment is entirely personal.""My personal belief is that this has nothing to do with my job or my profession. In my personal capacity, I've approached the Delhi high court . I wouldn't like to comment on the court proceedings or the issues involved, because the matter has been sub judice. This is a matter of self-respect, personal dignity, and personal honour,"" he told news agency ANI.""Whatever satire or parody you create, do it with your own people. Today, the issue of drug abuse has become a major issue for our nation, and by highlighting such things, you're insulting not just one person, but those who have worked with me, and others who fight against drug abuse,"" Wankhede said further.""My family has nothing to do with my profession. They have nothing to do with my cases, my profession but why are they feeling the brunt of these kinds of things? Hate messages are coming from Pakistan, UAE, and Bangladesh. I will not accept that because of me, they are facing the brunt of it. We have regularly informed the police about the threats that my sister and my wife keep getting,"" he added.Wankhede approached the Delhi high court over the Netflix series The Ba***ds of Bollywood, which he claims has maligned his reputation.Earlier this week, the Delhi high court issued summons to Red Chillies Entertainment, Netflix, and other respondents in connection with the defamation suit.The court directed them to file replies within seven days and asked Wankhede to provide copies of the petition. The matter is listed for hearing on 30 October.Wankhede’s petition names Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd, owned by actor Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan, along with Netflix and others. He has sought a permanent and mandatory injunction, a declaration, and Rs 2 crore in damages, which he says should be donated to Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital for the treatment of cancer patients.In the petition, Wankhede argued, “This series disseminates a misleading and negative portrayal of anti-drug enforcement agencies, thereby eroding public confidence in law enforcement institutions.”He further claimed that the series was “deliberately conceptualised and executed with the intent to malign Sameer Wankhede's reputation in a colourable and prejudicial manner,” even as cases involving him and Aryan Khan remain pending before the Bombay high court and the NDPS Special Court in Mumbai.The suit also objects to a scene where a character makes an obscene gesture after reciting Satyamev Jayate, calling it a “grave and sensitive violation” of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971.Wankhede contends that the show also breaches provisions of the Information Technology Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita by attempting to “outrage national sentiment through the use of obscene and offensive material.”He has urged the court to restrain the streaming and distribution of the series and to declare its content defamatory, arguing that it undermines faith in institutions responsible for enforcing drug laws.Addressing about the legal action, Wankhede said further, “I have faith in our judiciary, our constitution and the system of our country. I am a loyal soldier of the government of India. There are numerous checks and balances in our system, and there is a proper rule book, the Constitution, according to which we work. One person does not make the decisions here.""""Everything has been done according to the rules and regulations. It is not about any publicity; it is about dignity. The kind of hate messages I have been getting, no self-respecting man will remain silent on it. I will fight this legal battle to whatever extent possible. I have presented all the messages in front of the Delhi High Court,"" he said further.On speculations about entering politics, he added, “What can I comment on this. Currently, I am in an IRS office, and I am busy with my work. In future, I don't have knowledge of anything beyond my work. I am just doing my duty.

Zoho’s homegrown messaging app Arattai recently gained immense popularity. Rival to WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal the app surged to the top spot in India’s app stores. The app has now received attention from Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra . Recently, Mahindra took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to reveal that he has downloaded the Arattai app, prompting a response from Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu. Launched in 2021, Arattai—meaning “chat” in Tamil—was initially seen as a niche side project. But in the wake of AI anxieties, spyware scandals, and scrutiny of Big Tech, its pitch as a “spyware-free, made-in-India messenger” has struck a chord with users. The app’s rise was fueled by endorsements from government officials, including Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who urged Indians to adopt indigenous platforms under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.Mahindra Group chairman and industrialist Anand Mahindra recently gave a public shoutout to Zoho’s messaging app Arattai.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success. Bezos said ‘Go work at McDonald’s.’ As reported by Fortune, in a recent interview, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. “I always advise young people: Go work at McDonald’s,” Bezos said. “You learn responsibility. You learn how to show up. You learn how to deal with people. You learn how to hustle.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure. These are the traits that many Gen Z entrepreneurs may overlook in their rush to build startups.The comments by Bezos come at a time when debate is growing over the value of traditional work experience versus the allure of instant digital success.

Big AI bets under scrutiny







JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently gave a clear warning about the disruption power of artificial intelligence. Dimon believes that job losses are inevitable, but so is the opportunity to retain and deploy workers into new roles. As reported by Business Insider, In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Dimon said that the bank has invested about $2 billion as an annual investment in AI and is already making $2 billion in direct benefits. This includes the headcount reductions and operational savings. “We know about $2 billion of actual cost saves,” he said. “It’s the tip of the iceberg.”Dimon also talked about layoffs and he did not shy away from the workforce implications. “People shouldn’t put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs,” he said. “AI will enhance some aspects of work, but also eliminate some jobs.” However, Dimon also stressed on the fact that JPMorgan is focused on retaining and redeploying employees whose roles are impacted by automation. “We’ll have more jobs, but there’ll probably be less jobs in certain functions,” Dimon added. “You’re better off being way ahead of the curve,” Dimon added.Dimon also revealed that JPMorgan has been integrating AI since 2012. He said that AI now touches every part of the bank starting from rest and fraud detection to marketing and customer service. The bank also used AI for idea generation. he bank’s proprietary large language model, trained on internal data, is used by 150,000 employees weekly. “It’s quite productive,” Dimon noted. “Our managers and leaders have to do it. ”Dimon’s remakes come at a time when skepticism is growing about the massive corporate spending spree on AI. Meta is planning to spend around $600 billion on AI infrastructure by 2028. On the other hand, OpenAI and Oracle have announced a $500 billion data center project dubbed Stargate.A recent Goldman Sachs report warned that many firms investing billions in AI have yet to see measurable returns. “AI technology is exceptionally expensive,” said Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs. “Even basic summarization tasks often yield illegible and nonsensical results.”","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon believes that job losses are inevitable, but so is the opportunity to retain and deploy workers into new roles.

Mira Murati, former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer is backing a new artificial intelligence (AI) venture launched by one of her former colleagues, Angela Jiang. According to a Business Insider report, Jiang – an early OpenAI product manager has started a startup called Worktrace AI. The publication claims to have reviewed documents which reveal that Worktrace AI was in talks this summer to raise $10 million in seed funding at a $50 million valuation.Jiang, who joined OpenAI as its third product manager, played a key role in developing the GPT models that powered ChatGPT’s viral success in late 2022. She later worked on OpenAI’s policy team before leaving in December 2024.Worktrace AI joins a growing list of startups founded by OpenAI alumni — including Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab, Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence, and William Fedus’s Periodic Labs — that have quickly attracted billion-dollar valuations before releasing a commercial product.Mira Murati’s involvement in Worktrace AI follows her own major project, Thinking Machines Lab, which raised $2 billion in seed funding earlier this year and reached a valuation of $12 billion. Her growing role as a backer of emerging AI companies signals her influence in shaping the next generation of artificial intelligence research and enterprise solutions.Like Murati’s venture, Worktrace AI is focused on bringing advanced automation to large enterprises.According to its website, the company helps businesses “find and automate repetitive tasks by observing employees.”Worktrace AI has attracted funding from several prominent OpenAI figures, including Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT; Jason Kwon, OpenAI’s chief strategy officer; and Joanne Jang, who helped define ChatGPT’s behavior, according to a job listing. The company is also backed by the OpenAI Startup Fund, along with venture capital firms 8VC and Conviction.Despite having an active website and LinkedIn profile, the company has not made any public announcements about its launch.","Mira Murati, former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer is backing a new artificial intelligence (AI) venture launched by one of her former colleagues.

Poll Do you agree with the ICC's decision to suspend USA Cricket? Yes, it was necessary No, it's too harsh

USA Cricket has termed its suspension by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as one of the toughest moments in its history, acknowledging the uncertainty and disappointment it has caused within the cricket community in the United States.The ICC had last month imposed an immediate suspension on USA Cricket following a detailed review of its operations and consultations with multiple stakeholders over the past year.The decision was based on what the ICC described as “repeated and continued breaches” of membership obligations under its constitution.In a statement, USA Cricket said, “The recent suspension of USA Cricket by the International Cricket Council has been one of the most difficult moments in our history. It has caused uncertainty and disappointment for players, members, volunteers, and supporters. Yet this moment must not be mistaken for dysfunction. It is the result of difficult but necessary decisions taken to protect the game, the organisation, and the future of cricket in the United States. ”The ICC board, while enforcing the suspension, confirmed that the United States’ national teams would still be allowed to participate in ICC events, including preparations for cricket’s inclusion in the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games.USA Cricket had earlier been placed “on notice” during the ICC’s 2024 Annual General Meeting for failing to meet membership compliance requirements. The board was given 12 months to address those concerns and to conduct “free and fair elections” along with implementing wider governance reforms. However, progress was deemed insufficient by the ICC, leading to the current suspension.Following the move, the management of USA’s national teams will now be overseen temporarily by the ICC and its appointed representatives to ensure players continue to receive support and that Olympic preparations are not disrupted.An ICC Normalisation Committee has been tasked with setting out the steps for reinstating USA Cricket’s membership. These will include “demonstrable and specific changes” to its governance structure, operations, and overall management, with the committee monitoring progress until compliance is achieved.",USA cricket has released an official statement on its website.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Curriculum and career focus

Which path should you take?

Business Administration and Finance are two of the most popular degrees for students aiming at high-demand careers. While both can lead to rewarding roles, they differ significantly in focus, skill development, and career paths. Business Administration is broader, emphasising management and operational leadership, while Finance is more specialised, concentrating on quantitative skills and money management. Understanding these differences can help students choose a degree aligned with their interests and long-term goals.A degree in Business Administration equips students to manage resources, teams, and operations in a variety of organisations, from startups and hospitals to multinational corporations. The curriculum covers accounting, marketing, human resources, operations, organisational behaviour, strategy, and business law. Many programs offer opportunities for internships, case studies, and hands-on projects that simulate real-world challenges.Graduates can pursue diverse careers. Human resources managers handle recruitment, workplace policies, and employee development. Procurement officers oversee supplier negotiations, budgeting, and compliance.Business consultants advise companies on operations, marketing, and strategy. Other roles include sales managers, marketing strategists, operations managers, general managers, business analysts, and project managers.The degree develops essential skills such as leadership, strategic thinking, communication, negotiation, teamwork, and organisational efficiency. Its versatility allows graduates to move across industries and take on leadership or management roles with relative ease.A Finance degree takes a deeper, more specialised approach. It prepares students to manage, grow, and safeguard financial assets for individuals and organisations. The coursework typically includes economics, accounting, financial reporting, international finance, econometrics, statistics, business law, and finance technology. Specialisations include corporate finance, investment banking, wealth management, financial analysis, and real estate finance.Finance graduates can become financial analysts, commercial bankers, CFOs, financial planners, investor relations specialists, credit analysts, portfolio managers, or real estate finance managers. Their work revolves around analysing investments, forecasting financial trends, managing capital, and ensuring organisational financial health.The degree hones skills in data analysis, quantitative modelling, statistical analysis, financial reporting, problem-solving, and strategic planning. It is ideal for students with strong numerical aptitude who enjoy detailed, analytical work in financial contexts.Both Business Administration and Finance degrees open doors to high-demand roles worldwide, but the scope and compensation differ depending on specialisation and region. Finance professionals often command premium salaries, especially in major financial hubs such as London, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai. Entry-level finance roles in Europe and Asia frequently meet or exceed local averages, and positions in investment banking, asset management, or risk analysis can rival US salary benchmarks as professionals gain experience.Business administration graduates also enjoy globally competitive salaries. Multinational companies across consulting, FMCG, healthcare, and technology sectors offer compensation similar to US levels, particularly for roles in project management, operations, and strategic planning. Management and administrative positions remain in strong demand, and graduates can build careers in leadership roles across industries.In emerging markets across the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East , multinational firms and large local corporations recruit both business and finance graduates for roles in financial leadership, strategic management, and project oversight. While salaries may start lower than in the US or Western Europe, compensation rises steadily as professionals gain experience, reflecting the globalising nature of these economies.Demand for both degrees continues to grow worldwide. Globalisation, digital transformation, and increasingly complex regulatory environments drive the need for skilled professionals in business and finance. This ensures strong job creation and upward mobility for graduates who develop relevant expertise. While US benchmarks often set the standard, multinational companies and international markets provide ample opportunities for comparable growth, making these degrees highly valuable for students seeking global careers.Business Administration offers breadth. It emphasises management, policy, and interdisciplinary exposure, with less emphasis on math. Finance is more specialised and quantitative, with early focus on financial modelling, econometrics, and strategic analysis.In terms of career flexibility, Business Administration degrees are highly versatile, allowing graduates to move across industries or take on general management roles. Finance degrees, while more specialised, prepare students for high-paying roles within financial services, banking, and investment sectors.Business Administration is ideal for those seeking broad exposure, flexibility, and leadership opportunities. Finance suits students with strong analytical skills who are interested in specialised financial roles and higher earning potential. Both degrees offer growth and stability, but the right choice depends on whether you prefer a wide-ranging managerial career or a focused, quantitative finance path.","Business Administration is broader, emphasising management and operational leadership.

'Democracy Under Siege': Ex-US Official Slams Trump's 'Enemy Within' Barb, Crackdown On Dissent

Who is Letitia James?







New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, said that she is a ""fearless"" person.Calling the charges of bank fraud ""baseless,"" James referred to a civil fraud lawsuit she successfully filed against President Donald Trump and his company for alleged fraudulent business practices, which resulted in a fine of approximately $465 million being overturned by an appeals court in August.The statement also mentioned the resignation of US Attorney Erik Siebert, who departed his position after President Trump criticised him for not bringing charges against James and former FBI Director James Comey. Comey was indicted last month following the appointment of US Attorney Lindsey Halligan, Axios reported.James said, ""This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system. He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State Attorney General."" She continued, ""These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost. The president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties.Regarding Siebert, James said, ""His decision to fire a United States Attorney who refused to bring charges against me—and replace them with someone who is blindly loyal not to the law, but to the president—is antithetical to the bedrock principles of our country."" She added, ""This is the time for leaders on both sides of the aisle to speak out against this blatant perversion of our system of justice.""The Attorney General concluded, ""I stand strongly behind my office's litigation against the Trump Organization. We conducted a two-year investigation based on the facts and evidence—not politics. Judges have upheld the trial court's finding that Donald Trump, his company, and his two sons are liable for fraud.""""I am a proud woman of faith, and I know that faith and fear cannot share the same space. And so today I am not fearful, I am fearless, and as my faith teaches me, no weapon formed against me shall prosper. We will fight these baseless charges aggressively, and my office will continue to fiercely protect New Yorkers and their rights. And I will continue to do my job.""In response, Halligan stated, ""No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust. The facts and the law in this case are clear.""Letitia “Tish” James is the 67th Attorney General for the state of New York. Elected in 2018, she became the first woman of colour to hold statewide office in New York and the first woman to be elected Attorney General. James brings decades of experience and a strong record of achievements to her role as a powerful and effective attorney.Prior to her current position, she was the public advocate for the City of New York. Elected in 2013, she became the first woman of colour to hold citywide office. During her tenure, her office passed more legislation than all previous public advocates combined, including a groundbreaking law that banned questions about salary history from the employment process to address the pervasive gender wage gap.Before serving as public advocate, James represented the 35th Council District in Brooklyn in the New York City Council for ten years. As a council member, she passed the Safe Housing Act, legislation that required landlords to improve living conditions for tenants in New York City’s worst buildings.Prior to her election to the City Council, James was head of the Brooklyn Regional Office of the New York State Attorney General’s Office. James began her career as a public defender at the Legal Aid Society. A proud Brooklynite, she is a graduate of Lehman College and Howard University School of Law.","New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution.

Have you hugged your job today?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/have-you-hugged-your-job-today/articleshow/124493105.cms,"Workers, who were quitting at high rates a few years ago, are now ""job hugging"" -- or, as one consulting firm put it, ""holding on to their jobs for dear life."" (Cristina Spanò/The New York Times) -- FOR EDITORIAL USE ONLY WITH NYT STORY SLUGGED JOB HUGGING BY LORA KELLEY FOR OCT. 10, 2025. ALL OTHER USE PROHIBITED. --.





Hugging conjures friendship, intimacy, support. But lately, it has cropped up in a less warm and fuzzy context: to refer to people clinging anxiously to their jobs in a murky market.Workers are quitting at much lower rates than they were a few years ago, and are instead ""job hugging."" In August, consulting firm Korn Ferry used the term in an article to describe the way workers have been ""holding on to their jobs for dear life."" A spokesperson wrote in an email that the firm might have coined the phrase but that he couldn't say for sure. Since then, it has popped up in several news articles and even on ""The Daily Show. ""The term is striking a nerve partly because it represents a sharp reversal from the ""great resignation"" period of 2021 and 2022, when tens of millions of Americans quit their jobs. At the time, the labor market was hot, after a steep decline in employment at the start of the pandemic.But the market has again cooled significantly. Employers added a measly 22,000 jobs in August, according to the latest federal data. In June, the US economy lost 13,000 jobs, its first dip since December 2020, according to revised data.Hiring is down in many industries. Unemployment, though low overall, is hitting recent college graduates hard.The job market is filled with distressing signals and uncertainty. Tariffs are hobbling companies. Immigration raids are decimating the workforces of some industries and igniting fear in communities. Artificial intelligence is spooking everyone (though Yale researchers found that so far, few workers have been displaced by AI). Quits reflect workers' confidence -- and at the moment, they do not seem particularly confident.""Unless you have a better option, quitting a job in risky times is a huge gamble,"" Nick Bloom, an economist at Stanford, said in an email.When they can't quit, employees may end up feeling stuck in place, which can stunt their career development, said Peter Cappelli, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. The situation can also hurt their financial health because job hoppers tend to get higher raises.For the most part, workers leave jobs once they have secured a better opportunity. ""Almost nobody quits and then pouts and goes home and then thinks, 'Gee, what am I going to do next?'"" Cappelli said. But when workers don't leave, other people can't fill those roles, stalling movement in the job market.Though worker turnover is expensive for employers, having a team of stressed employees who don't want to be there isn't ideal, either. ""Churn"" is a bad word among bosses, but some amount of it can be healthy.On paper, this job market is more ""normal"" than the overheated one of the early 2020s. Still, many of the dynamics today -- the Trump administration's immigration offensive, the hyped-up AI market, the psychic scars of the early pandemic shutdowns and the years of scarce labor that followed -- make for an uneasy time.Stressed-out workers may find comfort in embracing a loved one amid the uncertainty. A job, for all the stability it provides, cannot hug you back.","Workers are quitting at much lower rates than they were a few years ago.

The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s high-profile visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan — the first of its kind that came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Kabul and Islamabad.During the meetings, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that India’s engagement “contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” while announcing a fresh round of development projects across Afghan provinces. The upgrade of India’s technical mission to a full-fledged embassy signals a significant deepening of diplomatic ties without extending formal recognition to the Taliban regime.Later the same day, Muttaqi held a press briefing in New Delhi, sharply condemning Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, calling it a “provocative act” and a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty. “Such issues cannot be resolved by strength.Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he said, stressing the widening rift between Kabul and Islamabad.India had shut its Kabul embassy in August 2021 after the Taliban’s return to power, maintaining only a skeletal presence through a technical team since June 2022 to oversee humanitarian aid. The embassy upgrade marks the deepest level of engagement between India and the Taliban since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government. This move stops short of formal recognition but signals a decisive shift in India’s Afghanistan strategy.The timing of the announcement was significant. It came just hours after Afghanistan’s defence ministry accused Pakistan of bombing civilian areas in Paktika near the Durand Line. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the ministry said in a post on social media. Calling it “an unprecedented, violent, and provocative act”, Kabul warned that defending its territory is its right.From Indian soil, Muttaqi chose to respond sharply. “I think it’s a wrong step by the Pakistan government. Such issues cannot be resolved by strength. Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he told reporters in Delhi. “Some attacks happened in border areas, and we condemn them. We have opened doors for dialogue and diplomacy.”The unusually strong language stressed the widening rift between the Taliban and Pakistan, their uneasy patron for decades. Relations have deteriorated over Islamabad’s military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters allegedly sheltering in Afghanistan. In March 2024, Pakistani airstrikes in Khost and Paktika killed several civilians, triggering warnings from Kabul of “consequences”. This fracture, analysts say, has created a new strategic opening for India.India has historically had a fraught relationship with the Taliban. During the 1990s, New Delhi backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance while Islamabad openly supported the Taliban regime. After 2001, India became one of Afghanistan’s largest regional donors, pledging over USD 3 billion for development projects. But the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 disrupted India’s presence and leverage in the country. New Delhi maintained limited contact, focusing on humanitarian assistance and regional coordination with Iran and Central Asian partners.Now, with Pakistan–Taliban ties fraying, India is recalibrating. By reopening its embassy, hosting Muttaqi, and accepting Taliban-appointed diplomats (though not at the ambassadorial level), India is signalling a willingness to engage without granting formal recognition. Strategic analysts describe this as “hedging” — positioning itself to gain influence should Pakistan’s grip weaken further, while safeguarding its own security concerns.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says this evolving situation presents India with a rare diplomatic opening.“The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly offers an opportunity for India can be a stabilising factor even in the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. India’s presence matters a lot to Afghanistan because it will provide some kind of legitimacy to the Taliban government, even though India is unlikely to recognise the regime as such,” he says.The engagement carried clear economic undertones as well. Muttaqi invited Indian companies to invest in Afghanistan’s mining sector and called for the opening of the Attari–Wagah border for direct India–Afghanistan trade. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all three countries,” he said.Currently, India trades with Afghanistan primarily via Iran’s Chabahar port due to Pakistan’s denial of overland access. But the route faces uncertainty after the United States revoked India’s sanctions waiver for Chabahar in September 2024, complicating transit. While Chabahar remains a strategic hedge, its operational limitations make direct India–Afghanistan connectivity via Pakistan attractive in theory — though politically fraught.India also announced a new slate of development projects: a Thalassemia Centre and 30-bed hospital in Bagrami district, oncology and trauma centres in Kabul, maternity clinics across Paktika, Khost and Paktia, and donations of ambulances, medical equipment and vaccines. These announcements draw on India’s legacy of over 500 development projects across all 34 Afghan provinces, including the Parliament building and the Salma Dam.Security remains at the core of India’s engagement. Without naming Pakistan, both sides “unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries” in their joint statement. Jaishankar said, “We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” Muttaqi, meanwhile, pledged that Afghanistan “won’t allow any group to use the country against others”, identifying Daesh (ISIS) as the main regional threat.For India, the key is ensuring Afghan soil is not used for anti-India activities — a core concern since the IC-814 hijacking in 1999. Prof. Kumar explains this strategic bottom line:“What can happen, and what India is probably thinking, is that the land of Afghanistan may not be used for terrorist activities against India. That would be a huge achievement from the Indian perspective,” he says.India has so far avoided pressing the Taliban hard on human rights. Muttaqi remained vague when asked about women’s rights, saying, “All countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected.” While India has consistently raised rights issues at multilateral forums, officials have avoided making them a precondition for engagement.Perhaps the most consequential element of India’s strategy is its decision to reopen its embassy in Kabul without formally recognising the Taliban regime — a nuanced diplomatic line that gives New Delhi both flexibility and leverage. By restoring a physical diplomatic presence, India can deepen engagement on the ground and signal its relevance in Afghanistan’s evolving power dynamics, without extending official legitimacy to a government that remains internationally unrecognised and controversial for its human rights record.This approach reflects a clear distinction between establishing an embassy and granting diplomatic recognition. India has previously maintained similar diplomatic arrangements, such as with Palestine, where the presence of an embassy does not automatically translate into full diplomatic recognition of a government. In the Afghan context, this allows India to engage pragmatically while aligning its policy with the broader stance of the United Nations, the European Union and Western countries, most of which have opted for functional engagement without recognition.By doing so, New Delhi positions itself strategically. It can build channels of communication, potentially shape outcomes on critical security and connectivity issues, and apply pressure on regional actors like Pakistan and China, both of which are wary of India expanding its influence in Afghanistan. At the same time, India avoids prematurely endorsing a regime whose policies on women’s rights and governance remain at odds with international norms.India’s outreach is also informed by broader regional considerations. Russia and China have already established working relationships with the Taliban. Western governments are engaged in dialogue on counterterrorism and aid. New Delhi, analysts say, does not want to be the outlier.As Prof. Kumar notes, “Since Russia is talking, China is already there, and American and Western governments are also talking, India should not be left out. We may have ideological differences with the Taliban regime, but since other countries are talking to the Taliban in different forms, we should also try to moderate our policy and engage on several issues.”This balancing act is not without challenges. The Taliban regime remains ideologically rigid, especially on women’s rights and governance. Connectivity through Chabahar faces geopolitical headwinds. And there is no guarantee that the Taliban will limit anti-India groups indefinitely. Yet, by opening formal diplomatic channels, India aims to secure a seat at the table rather than watch from the sidelines as others shape Afghanistan’s future.Muttaqi’s visit to Delhi, marked by strong rhetoric against Pakistan, overtures for trade, and assurances on terrorism, reflects Kabul’s attempt to diversify its diplomatic bets. For India, the outreach is less about endorsing the Taliban regime and more about strategic positioning: insulating itself against security risks, reasserting influence in a region long dominated by Pakistan, and adapting to a shifting geopolitical landscape.New Delhi’s approach remains cautious but deliberate. It is engaging the Taliban to pursue its security and strategic objectives, without abandoning its normative concerns or rushing into recognition. In the complex triangle of India–Afghanistan–Pakistan, this marks the beginning of a new phase — one where India is no longer merely reacting to developments in Kabul, but actively shaping them.","India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy.
