16 judges recused from this whistleblower’s suits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/16-judges-recused-from-this-whistleblowers-suits/articleshow/124652793.cms,"Sanjiv Chaturvedi

Magsaysay winner Sanjiv Chaturvedi’s petitions are piling up at courts across the country. The whistleblower has fought cases alone, and even found Presidential support. So why are his battles being stalled?

.

In a judicial system where recusals are rare and typically explained, 16 judges — across district courts, high courts and even Supreme Court — recused themselves from hearing one man’s cases, most without offering a reason. That man is Sanjiv Chaturvedi, a 2002-batch Indian Forest Service officer known not for fiery speeches or media attention but corruption reports so meticulously documented that they have prompted Presidential interventions. After nearly a decade of legal drift and avoidance, the chief justice of Uttarakhand high court has now, finally, agreed to hear all his pending cases himself.Chaturvedi walks into courtrooms alone. Sometimes, he argues his own cases, quietly quoting from case law. He avoids press interviews. He has no legal entourage. And yet, the names in his vigilance reports include senior bureaucrats, ministers, and institutional heads. What he lacks in theatre, he makes up for in records. But courtroom after courtroom has turned him away — not with judgment, but with absence.An electrical engineer from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology in Prayagraj, Chaturvedi became a public name not by choice, but by consequence.In Haryana, where he was first posted, he flagged illegal tree-felling, sand mining, and wildlife poaching — operations that, according to his findings, were protected by elements within the state’s bureaucracy and political leadership. He was transferred 12 times in five years. In 2007, he was suspended — an action later reversed by Presidential order in 2008.The Haryana govt filed a departmental chargesheet against him, accusing him of procedural lapses — charges he maintained were retaliatory. His complaint to the Centre led to the formation of a two-member inquiry committee. The panel reviewed the case and named then chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and senior officials, holding them responsible for corruption, abuse of power, and targeted harassment of the officer. The committee concluded that the disciplinary charges were “baseless”, and recommended their annulment. It also advised that “action be considered against those who initiated them in bad faith”.In Jan 2011, the President accepted the committee’s recommendation and quashed the chargesheet. In Feb that year, the Haryana governor implemented the Presidential order, reversing Chaturvedi’s suspension and validating his actions. But in 2014, the same Congress-led Haryana govt filed a case seeking to quash both the inquiry report and the Presidential order — omitting the fact that its own governor had already implemented it. Chaturvedi filed his reply in 2016, which was taken on record by judge P B Bajanthri. In Feb 2018, the same judge fined him Rs 50,000, citing delay. A three-judge SC bench, led by the chief justice, waived the fine at first hearing. When Chaturvedi requested transfer of the matter to SC under Article 139A, citing similarity with other pending cases, SC left the issue to Punjab and Haryana high court.By then, Chaturvedi had been posted as chief vigilance officer at AIIMS, Delhi. Between 2012 and 2014, he initiated over 200 corruption inquiries — ranging from purchase scams to appointment irregularities. Among those named was Vineet Chawdhary, a 1982-batch Himachal Pradesh cadre IAS officer and former deputy director (admin) at AIIMS, who was later appointed chief secretary by the BJP govt in Himachal Pradesh.As CVO, Chaturvedi was authorised to report on the vigilance status of deputed officers. In Aug 2014, he sent a confidential letter to Himachal’s chief secretary about pending CBI and departmental cases against Chawdhary, based on investigations conducted under his watch. In 2016, Chawdhary filed a criminal defamation complaint. A trial court issued summons in 2018.Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code protects govt servants from prosecution for official acts without sanction. Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code exempts official communication from defamation. Both provisions have been repeatedly upheld by SC and HC. However, when Chaturvedi approached Himachal Pradesh high court, chief justice Sanjay Karol refused to quash the proceedings. SC later observed that HC had failed to consider Chaturvedi’s submissions — but instead of halting the trial, it remanded the matter back to the same bench. The same HC had granted protection under section 197 CrPC in other cases, including to a top IPS officer.Citing threats to his life, Chaturvedi had requested a cadre transfer, which was approved in Aug 2015. Of course, new challenges awaited. In 2016, the Union health ministry gave him a ‘zero’ appraisal for the financial year 2015-16. He filed a writ in Uttarakhand HC. Then chief justice K M Joseph refused to admit the petition, citing a 1997 SC ruling (L Chandrakumar), which required service matters to be routed through tribunals. However, records show that Joseph had previously entertained — and soon after resumed hearing — similar petitions, including by IFS officers under investigation.Chaturvedi then approached the Central Administrative Tribunal, which stayed the appraisal report in Sept 2017. The stay remains in place as the central govt has not responded.Meanwhile, a new pattern emerged: judges began recusing themselves. Sixteen in total, across SC, HC and district courts. Some stepped aside after reading case files, others during initial hearings. Most gave no reason. Chaturvedi had no legal remedy to challenge this trend.“Recusals are meant to protect judicial impartiality. But here, they’ve become a wall,” said SC advocate Pramod Choudhary. Chaturvedi’s counsel Sudershan Goel cited SC rulings in R C Chandel (2012) and a 2019 verdict, both underscoring that judges are bound to decide cases based solely on facts and applicable law. “There is no precedent for this many recusals,” Goel said. “It amounts to a constitutional breakdown of judicial accountability. ”Though courts have often turned him away, national institutions have recognised Chaturvedi’s work. He has delivered lectures on preventive vigilance at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy and Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration. He donated his entire Magsaysay award money to the Prime Minister’s Fund, gave Rs 2.5 lakh from an arbitration case to Pulwama victims, and redirected court costs in his favour to the PM’s National Relief Fund.He was 40 when he received the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2015, making him one of the youngest Indian civil servants to win the honour — Kiran Bedi and T N Seshan were older. The citation praised his “exemplary integrity, courage and tenacity” in exposing corruption. His legal ability has also been recognised. A chief justice of Uttarakhand HC remarked that Chaturvedi argued “better than most counsel”.Now posted in Uttarakhand, he has shifted focus to conservation. He has led efforts to develop India’s first moss garden, forest healing centre, and pollinator park. In Corbett, he stopped unauthorised VIP safaris and fake tourism portals. In 2024, he submitted a 500-page report on an illegal tree-felling scam in Pithoragarh, recommending a CBI and ED probe.The cases he filed years ago continue to move slowly through the system. Judges still step aside. And he still walks in, alone, quoting law from memory, steadfast in his faith that truth will eventually triumph and he will be able to declare Satyameva Jayate.","Sanjiv Chaturvedi is a 2002-batch Indian Forest Service officer.

Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train Project Reaches Key Milestone with Ghansoli Tunnel Completion

New Delhi: Finding that a temple as well as commercial and residential properties were demolished for widening a road in Ahmedabad, the Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a plea against partial demolition of 400-year-old Mancha Masjid, saying the municipality is serving a public purpose.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi refused to accede to persistence of the counsel representing Mansa Masjid Trust for protecting the prayer hall of the mosque as Ahmedabad municipal corporation through Astha Mehta said the civic body had categorically stated before the HC that only a vacant piece of land and portion of a platform of the mosque will be affected by the road-widening project to ease traffic congestion.Mehta said the main structure of the mosque would not be affected at all and drew the court’s attention to the demolition of a temple and residents voluntarily giving up their properties to enable the civic body to widen the road in the larger public interest.The bench said it is not a case of infringement of right to religion under Article 25. “The wakf board may be entitled to compensation for utilising the mosque land only if the board could prove that the land belonged to wakf.You may be entitled for bigger land to build a mosque for namaz. But the HC is right in finding that the civic body had scrupulously followed the provisions of Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporation Act while proceeding to take a portion of mosque land for road widening. ”When the counsel for the mosque insisted for a court order to protect the prayer hall, the bench said, “No such action is contemplated. A temple has been dismantled, and they did not claim any compensation. We are saying you will be entitled for compensation under GPMC Act if the wakf board could prove it is a wakf property.” State govt had told the HC widening of the road in Saraspur was crucial for easing congestion and boosting urban development along the stretch connecting Kalupur railway station and Ahmedabad Metro.",The Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a plea against partial demolition of 400-year-old Mancha Masjid.

Gold and silver price prediction today:MCX Gold prices are currently trading around the ₹1,27,000 mark, reflecting strong bullish momentum. On the international front, COMEX gold is comfortably holding above the $4,000 level, further reinforcing the positive trend. This price behaviour indicates that gold is consistently forming higher lows, which is a classic sign of strength in technical analysis. The ability to protect previous support levels suggests that buyers are active at lower levels, absorbing selling pressure and preparing for potential upside moves.From a short-term trading perspective, gold prices have the potential to move towards the ₹1,30,000 level if the current momentum continues. Traders can consider accumulating positions near the ₹1,26,000 support zone, where buying interest has previously emerged. A strong support base is seen at ₹1,23,500, and any dip toward this level may offer a good risk-reward entry for bullish positions.Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary concerns, and a weak global economic outlook, gold remains a preferred safe-haven asset.These factors are likely to keep demand strong and prices buoyant in the near term. As long as prices sustain above the key support levels, the outlook for gold remains optimistic with further upside potential.MCX Silver has shown significant strength and has outperformed MCX Gold in recent sessions, currently trading around ₹1,60,000 levels. This rally reflects robust bullish sentiment driven by a combination of industrial demand, investment interest, and a positive technical setup. Silver's strong price action suggests that market participants are confident in its upside potential, especially as it continues to make higher highs and higher lows, a clear sign of an ongoing uptrend.Compared to gold, silver tends to exhibit more volatility, which can offer attractive trading opportunities. Any corrective move or dip toward the ₹1,57,000 level can be seen as a buying opportunity, supported by strong demand and momentum. On the upside, prices have the potential to move toward ₹1,63,000 in the near term. Traders should maintain a stop-loss at ₹1,54,000 to manage risk effectively in case of unexpected price reversals.Silver's dual role as both a precious and industrial metal makes it a favored asset in times of economic uncertainty, as well as during periods of industrial recovery. With favorable fundamentals and technical strength, silver remains well-positioned for further gains, and buying on dips strategy could prove rewarding in the current market environment.","Both gold and silver prices are exhibiting strong bullish momentum.

Tata Motors demerger: What does it mean for investors & why did the share price drop 40%?

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



EPFO subscribers take note! The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","EPFO has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

Belgian Court Clears Fugitive Jeweller Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India

New Delhi: A Belgian court on Friday upheld the arrest of fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi by Belgian police on India's request and approved his extradition to face trial in Rs 13,000 crore bank fraud case. This significant development comes after Choksi's arrest in Antwerp in April this year.Choksi, uncle of another high-profile fugitive Nirav Modi who is in jail in UK, can appeal the order in a higher court in the next 15 days. However, officials in India expressed satisfaction over the development saying that Belgian court's order marked an important step towards his return to India. Declared a flight risk, Choksi was denied bail and has been lodged in an Antwerp prison. With his arrest upheld, he is likely to stay in prison until the Belgian judiciary decides India's case for him being sent back.Earlier in Aug, at least two Belgian courts rejected Choksi’s bail plea after the Indian law enforcement argued that Choksi was a habitual absconder and was likely to flee to another country if granted bail. The CBI gave Belgian prosecutors with details of of his involvement in economic offences in India and his escape from US and Antigua in the past besides the two open warrants against him.The last extradition hearing took place in Sept.According to a filing by the Indian govt, Choksi will be lodged at Arthur Road jail in Mumbai upon extradition which adheres to the European standards of prisoner management. He will be provided all facilities, including clean drinking water and adequate food besides access to newspapers and TV and medical treatment of his choice.The Global Operations Centre of CBI is monitoring the developments in the case in direct coordination with foreign law enforcement agencies besides Interpol channels. It has also hired the services of a local law firm to bolster their case. Wanted in bank fraud cases to the tune of over Rs 13,900 crore, Choksi fled India in Jan 2018. He went to the US and to Antigua whose citizenship he had obtained a year before.","Belgian court on Friday upheld the arrest of fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi by Belgian police on India's request and approved his extradition to face trial in Rs 13,000 crore bank fraud case.

What is the case against Mehul Choksi?



A Belgian court on Friday ordered the extradition of fugitive Mehul Choksi to India, news agency PTI reported citing officials. Choksi faces charges related to the massive Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.""The order has come in our favour. The court has termed his arrest by the Belgian authorities on India's request valid. The first legal step in getting him extradited is now clear,"" a senior official told PTI.Officials stated that the order marks a significant validation of India's efforts to secure Mehul Choksi's extradition, although he still has the option to appeal the decision in a higher Belgian court. Prosecutors argued before the court that Choksi poses a flight risk and should not be released from custody, the officials told PTI.Choksi, who relocated to Belgium in 2023 after leaving Antigua and Barbuda, was arrested there in April following India’s extradition request. He and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused of defrauding the bank of over Rs 13,000 crore.India had earlier assured Belgian authorities that if extradited, Choksi will be housed in Barrack No. 12 at Arthur Road jail, Mumbai, with adequate space and no risk of overcrowding or solitary confinement.The Union home ministry, in a September 4 communique, confirmed that the cell meets the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) of Europe’s minimum space standards.Choksi fled to Antigua and Barbuda, where he acquired citizenship, before being apprehended in Belgium. India’s agencies swiftly coordinated to secure his extradition. The cell assigned to Choksi measures roughly 20 by 15 feet, with a separate toilet, ventilation, and security measures. Inmates receive daily cleaning, fresh water, outdoor exercise, board games, yoga sessions, and access to media and telemedicine. Weekly family visits and daily legal consultations are permitted.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused in a Rs 13,000 crore fraud involving fraudulent Letters of Undertaking issued by Punjab National Bank. Nirav Modi, a declared fugitive economic offender, is currently jailed in London and contesting extradition. The CBI’s extradition request cites the UN conventions against corruption and organised crime, supported by arrest warrants from Mumbai courts. The fraud involved PNB issuing 165 LoUs and 58 Foreign Letters of Credit in 2017 without limits or proper records, leading to massive losses covered by the bank.Authorities allege that loans were obtained from overseas banks across locations including Mauritius, Hong Kong, Antwerp, and Frankfurt based on these fraudulent guarantees. When the companies failed to repay, PNB was forced to pay over Rs 6,300 crore, including interest, to these foreign banks.","Fugitive Jeweller Mehul Choksi faces charges related to the massive Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.

NEW DELHI: It was 11 years ago that Supreme Court recognised transgender people as the ‘third gender’ and upheld their fundamental right to equality and dignity.Observing that discrimination still continued, however, the court on Friday appointed a committee headed by a retired Delhi HC judge to frame a comprehensive equal opportunity policy for the community in the arenas of employment and education. It also directed setting up of a transgender protection cell and a dedicated nationwide toll-free helpline number.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan expressed its anguish over the “lethargic” attitude of the Centre and states to protect the community’s rights. It said the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 — which sought to prevent social exclusion, discrimination, unemployment and lack of educational and medical facilities faced by transgender persons — remained in law books and was never implemented in true spirit. The law was “brutishly reduced to dead letters”, SC said, for which both Centre and states were to blame.“We are pained to observe that there has either been a superficial and sporadic, or a complete lack of implementation of measures to ensure the prevention of discrimination against transgender persons in various spheres of life, both public and private... The right against discrimination of transgender and gender diverse persons has long been recognised by this court ever since the judgment in NALSA (supra) wherein it was held that the ground of ‘sex’ under Article 15 of the Constitution also includes the analogous ground of gender identity,” SC said.The court said all stakeholders concerned had not only exhibited “a serious and perennial lack of action”, but also reinforced discrimination towards the community despite the existence of a statutory framework. It said govt authorities must provide due respect and consideration to the constitutional value underlying public participation.“There is no gainsaying that the Union of India and the states need to do a lot more to create mechanisms for the transgender persons to translate their rights into reality. The lethargy exhibited on part of the govt concerned has also led the non-state establishments to put the compliance of the 2019 Act and of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020 in a cold freeze. This abeyance of rights is a matter of serious concern,” it said.",It was 11 years ago that Supreme Court recognised transgender people as the ‘third gender’ and upheld their fundamental right to equality and dignity.

Microsoft SharePoint HACKED: Global Cyber Threat Explained!

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday sought to know from the ministry of home affairs and CBI what pan-India action was required to unearth cybercrime syndicates extorting money from people, especially senior citizens, by threatening them with digital arrest.“We are of the prima facie view that stern action on panIndia basis with coordinated efforts between central (agencies) and state police is required to unearth the full extent of this criminal enterprise involving forgery of judicial documents, cyber extortion and cyber arrest of innocent people, especially senior citizens,” a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said.The order came in a writ petition registered suo motu by SC after a septuagenarian couple from Ambala alleged that fraudsters forced them to part with over Rs 1 crore by displaying forged SC orders through WhatsApp and video conferencing. “We are aghast that the fraudsters fabricated judicial orders in the name of SC and various other documents,” the court said.The bench said ordinarily it would have ordered the Ambala cyber cell to expedite the probe but when judicial orders and judge’s signatures were forged with impunity, and the crime appeared to be spreading to many parts of the country, coordinated investigation was required. It requested attorney general R Venkataramani to assist the court in the matter.“Forgery of documents and brazen criminal misuse of the name, seal, and judicial authority of SC or (Bombay) HC is a matter of grave concern. The fabrication of judicial orders bearing forged signatures of judges strikes at the very foundation of public trust in the judicial system, besides the rule of law,” SC said. “Such acts constitute a direct assault on the dignity and majesty of this institution; therefore, such grave criminal acts cannot be treated as ordinary or routine offences of cheating or cybercrime. ”",Supreme Court sought to know from the ministry of home affairs and CBI what pan- India action was required to unearth cybercrime syndicates.

HAL Celebrates Maiden Flight of the First Tejas Mk1A Fighter Jet Manufactured at its Nashik Facility

Tejas-Mk1A fighter aircraft

NASHIK: The first Tejas-Mk1A fighter aircraft produced at defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited's (HAL) Nashik complex completed its maiden flight here on Friday. The aircraft was rolled out after defence minister Rajnath Singh formally inaugurated the LCA and HTT-40 (trainer aircraft) assembly complexes here.The formal induction of Tejas-Mk1A into the Indian Air Force (IAF), however, will depend on the successful completion of ongoing weapon and radar integration trials.Nashik now hosts the third LCA production line and the second HTT-40 production line. The rollout event, which included a traditional water cannon salute for the Mk1A, comes even as HAL races to meet Tejas-Mk1A delivery timelines for the IAF.The aircraft must clear trials involving the Astra beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, short-range missiles, and laser-guided bombs.The pre-induction tests will also validate integration with the Israeli-origin ELTA ELM-2052 radar and fire-control system. Earlier tests had encountered software-related snags, prompting modifications before final validation.The Mk1A rollout from Nashik is part of HAL’s broader production ramp-up plan. In addition to its two operational lines in Bengaluru, HAL has established a third line at Nashik, designed to produce up to eight aircraft annually.The PSU has also developed a parallel private-sector supply chain — VEM Technologies (centre fuselage), Alpha (rear fuselage), and L&T (wings) — to support an additional six aircraft each year. Once stabilised, this ecosystem is projected to enable annual production of 30 fighters from 2026-27.HAL is currently grappling with delays in the delivery of 99 GE F404 engines contracted in Aug 2021 for Rs 5,375 crore. Only four engines have been received so far. GE has assured the supply of eight more engines by March 2026 and around 20 engines per year thereafter. Despite the lag, HAL maintains that it has managed to keep production moving by rotating available engines for test flights.The initial order for 83 Tejas Mk1A aircraft, cleared in 2021, was to be delivered between 2024 and 2028. In Aug 2025, the Cabinet Committee on Security approved an additional 97 Mk1A fighters for Rs 66,500 crore, taking the total order to 180 aircraft.Air Chief Marshal AP Singh has repeatedly flagged the urgency of new inductions, saying the IAF is “very badly off in numbers” and needs at least 40 fighters a year to sustain combat readiness. HAL officials have said they are confident of meeting this requirement once the production ecosystem stabilises and integration issues are resolved.Friday's event also saw a formation flying of the Tejas-Mk1A, HTT-40 and Su30-Mki.",First Tejas-Mk1A fighter aircraft produced at defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited's (HAL) Nashik complex completed its maiden flight on Friday.

Relief to SHUATS VC, SC junks action in conversion case

New Delhi: Raising questions on the state’s “involvement and interference” in conversion procedures under the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act and terming it conspicuous, Supreme Court Friday quashed criminal proceedings under the law against the vice-chancellor and other officials of Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture Technology and Science after finding infirmities in the probe.Without going into the validity of the UP law, which is pending in the apex court, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra touched upon the interplay of privacy, the right to freedom of free profession and practice of religion, and the role of govt authorities. It said an individual’s autonomy is supreme in the choice of faith and belief that are intrinsic in matters such as marriage and in which the court has prohibited the state as well as the law from controlling the choice of choosing a partner or even limiting or regulating the ability to decide on such matters. “The constitutional validity of provisions of the Act does not fall for our consideration in the instant case. Nonetheless, we can’t help but observe that the provisions of the Act pertaining to the pre-and post-conversion declaration seem to introduce a very onerous procedure to be followed by an individual seeking to adopt a faith other than the one he professes, the bench said.It said, “The involvement and interference of state authorities in the conversion procedure is also conspicuous, with the district magistrate having been legally obliged to direct a police enquiry in each case of intended religious conversion.Further, the statutory requirement of making public the personal details of each person who has converted to a different religion may require a deeper examination to ascertain if such a requirement fits well with the privacy regime pervading the Constitution. ”The bench quashed the multiple FIRs filed in the case on various grounds, including that the UP law mandates that only an aggrieved person or their relative by blood, marriage or adoption can lodge an FIR with respect to acts of unlawful conversion and the case cannot be filed by a third party.Raising questions on the state’s “involvement and interference” in conversion procedures under the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act and terming it conspicuous, Supreme Court Friday quashed criminal proceedings under the law against the vice-chancellor and other officials of Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture Technology and Science after finding infirmities in the probe.","Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra touched upon the interplay of privacy, the right to freedom of free profession and practice of religion.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal (United)-led National Democratic Alliance have a 40 per cent chance of retaining power in the upcoming Bihar election, an opinion poll by C Voter predicted on Friday.According to the poll, Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan came a close second with 38.3 per cent chance of forming the government. Meanwhile, the new entrant in Bihar politics, Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj, came third in the preference list with 13.3 per cent.The scenario, however, changes when it comes to the preferred choice for chief minister. RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav emerged as the most popular face, securing 36.5% support in the opinion polls.He was followed by Prashant Kishor with 23.2%, incumbent chief minister Nitish Kumar with 15.9%, and Chirag Paswan with 8.8%.When asked who can solve Bihar’s problems, 36.5% of respondents chose the Mahagathbandhan, 12.8% opted for Jan Suraaj, 34.3% preferred the NDA, while 9.4% felt that no one could.Earlier, Tejashwi promised a government job for every household in Bihar and pledged to introduce the legislation within just 20 days of taking office.""NDA government could not provide jobs to the youth in 20 years, but we will bring the Act within 20 days of coming to power and also ensure its implementation within 20 months,"" Tejashwi told reporters at his residence.This comes as parties have geared up for what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Seat-sharing talks are in the final stages on all sides. However, constituents of the NDA and the INDIA bloc are grappling with differences over seat-sharing, with smaller allies in both camps jostling for more seats.Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj party declared a list of 51 candidates on Thursday.Amid growing unease in the ruling NDA over the seat sharing, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan reached Patna on Friday and will hold meetings with senior party leaders.According to news agency PTI, sources in the BJP said that the seat-sharing arrangements within the NDA will be finalized in a day or two, and the party will release its first list of candidates soon after that.The JD(U), another alliance partner of the NDA, is also expected to announce its list of candidates very soon, party sources said.According to sources in the NDA, the allies — JD(U) and BJP — are likely to contest 102 and 101 seats, respectively.Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which had earlier settled for around 20–22 seats, is now asking for 45 segments, they said.In the opposition bloc, sources said the RJD is likely to contest 135–140 seats.The party has offered the Congress 50–52 seats, lower than the party’s demand for 70 assembly segments.Sources in the RJD said a meeting of senior party leaders will take place in Patna later in the day to finalize the list of its candidates.In the 2020 assembly polls, the Congress had fought 70 seats but won only 19.The other big constituent of the INDIA bloc, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, also appeared unhappy with the reportedly 20–25 seats being offered to it.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 Assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share with a strike rate of 43.2%. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share and a 33.5% strike rate. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested 7 seats, winning 4, achieving 0.9% of the vote share and a 32.9% strike rate.","BJP, Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan have 40% chance of retaining power.

NEW DELHI: As campaigning for Bihar polls gathers momentum, the Election Commission on Friday directed all the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) to step up vigil and curb the use of cash and other inducements by the candidates and political parties to swing the outcome in their favour.Chairing a meeting of the multi-departmental committee on election intelligence here, chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, along with fellow election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi, sensitised the 17 LEAs represented in the committee, to cooperate and share intelligence on economic offences with one another, followed by effective action. The Bihar chief secretary, DGP, chief electoral officer and state police nodal officer (SPNO) joined the meeting online.The 17 LEAs sensitised by EC to take pre-emptive and preventive action to curb the distribution of inducements like cash, liquor, drugs, precious metals and freebies among electors, include CBDT, CBIC, ED, DRI, CEIB, FIU- IND, RBI, IBA, NCB, RPF, CISF, BSF, SSB, BCAS, AAI and postal department.During the discussions, a comprehensive roadmap was drawn up to combat the pernicious effects of cash and other inducements in elections.The agencies briefed EC on their preparation and measures taken or proposed to be taken to keep the polls inducement-free.The commission emphasised the need for intra-agency coordination at the national, state and district-level various levels. Underlining its ‘zero-tolerance’ policy on poll inducements and freebies, the poll panel directed the LEAs to map the constituencies and take steps to intercept the transportation of smuggled goods, drugs, liquor, cash including fake currency across the inter-state and international borders. EC will also hold a meeting of chief secretaries and DGPs of states bordering Bihar soon in this regard.Bihar will witness polling in two phases on Nov 6 and 11, followed by counting of votes on Nov 14.","Bihar will witness polling in two phases on Nov 6 and 11, followed by counting of votes on Nov 14.

The Nashik team’s installation of the BrahMos missile on the Su-30, which destroyed terrorist hideouts, proved that we can design, build, and defend ourselves with our own systems,” he said.He described the Tejas-Mk1A’s flight as a “shining symbol of India’s growing Aatmanirbharta in defence” and praised HAL for transforming itself into the backbone of the sector.Pointing to the defence sector’s transformation over the past decade, Singh said India, which once imported 65–70% of its military hardware, now manufactures about 65% of it domestically.Defence production, he said, had risen from Rs 46,429 crore in 2014–15 to Rs 1.5-lakh-crore in 2024–25, while exports had climbed from less than Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 25,000 crore.The govt now aims for Rs 3-lakh-crore in production and Rs 50,000 crore in exports by 2029.He urged HAL to expand its innovation into next-generation aircraft, unmanned systems, and civil aviation. “Modern warfare is evolving rapidly with artificial intelligence, drones, and cyber technologies. India must stay ahead in this race,” he said.Secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar said the inauguration of the two (HTT-40 and LCA) production lines in Nashik marks “a new chapter in India’s technological confidence and industrial strength.”He added: “The Tejas-Mk1A is not just a fighter aircraft, but a statement of India’s design and manufacturing excellence—conceived, developed and produced indigenously through collaboration between HAL, ADA, DRDO, and the IAF.”HAL CMD DK Sunil said the Nashik division’s expansion had created about 1,000 jobs and developed over 40 industry partners. “Our capacity to produce advanced indigenous fighters in addition to the Su-30Mki gives fresh momentum to delivery timelines and reinforces our public-private partnerships,” he said.The event also featured a Tejas Mk1A sortie piloted by HAL chief test pilot (fixed wing) Group Captain (retd) KK Venugopal, followed by aerial displays by Su-30Mki and HTT-40 aircraft.",Defence minister Rajnath Singh said India’s defence ecosystem had demonstrated its growing confidence in indigenous platforms during Operation Sindoor.

MUMBAI: The ghats at Ayodhya are getting ready to transform into a sea of light for Deepotsav 2025. A staggering 26.11 lakh diyas (earthen lamps) will light up on October 19, an effort expected to secure a new Guinness World Record and serve as a monumental testament to faith and community spirit.This year's festival relies heavily on the unmatched involvement of the people. Approximately 33,000 volunteers, comprised of students, teachers, and local organizations and coordinated by Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University, meticulously arrange the lamps across 56 ghats.By the afternoon of October 17, workers completed almost half the massive undertaking—about 7 to 8 lakh diyas were already positioned on key areas like Ghats 8, 9, 10, and 11.""The enthusiasm among young volunteers inspires all. Their dedication shows how deeply the next generation connects with ‘Ram Kaaj’,"" said Nodal Officer Prof. Sant Sharan Mishra, acknowledging the spirit that fills the banks of the Saryu River.Deepotsav 2025 acts as both a grand spectacle and a significant source of support for local artisans. Around 16 lakh diyas were handcrafted by about 40 potter families from Ayodhya and nearby villages such as Jaisinghpur, Pura Bazar, and Gosaiganj. Industrial units, social organizations, and rural women from across Uttar Pradesh supplied the remaining 10 lakh lamps.The event requires considerable logistics: organizers will use 55 lakh cotton wicks and 73,000 litres of oil to sustain the illumination.Tourism and Culture Minister Jaiveer Singh guaranteed every visitor to Ayodhya will experience a divine and lifelong memory, stating that planners designed Deepotsav 2025 on a ""larger, more meaningful scale so that people not only see the light but feel the devotion behind it.""The three-day celebration runs until October 20. Highlights include a 3D holographic musical laser show and a drone show featuring 1,100 'Make in India' drones, both open to the public from October 18 to 20. The most revered moment occurs on October 19 with a majestic Maha Aarti performed by 2,100 devotees.Minister Singh also noted a significant surge in tourism, with a rise to 23.82 crore visitors in the first six months of 2025 alone, reaffirming Ayodhya’s place as a global spiritual destination.As the final lamps take their place, devotees from states like Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and across Uttar Pradesh arrive in the city, transforming Ayodhya into a vibrant center of faith ready for an unparalleled display of devotion.","A staggering 26.11 lakh diyas (earthen lamps) will light up on October 19.

“The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”

“So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition.

So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”

“We are not chasing a target. We'll continue to evaluate everyone after all the investment in learning and development that we've done…..” he continued.

We are currently at 1%, and we will continue to evaluate people whom we can redeploy -- whom we are not redeploy, and those are the people that we will release.”During the earnings call, TCS HR chief also talked about the new H-1B visa rule announced by Trump administration last month.

AI’s real value lies ahead







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu is the next to join the ongoing ‘AI bubble’ debate. Vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments. He described the market as a ‘financial bubble’ that could distort long-term innovation. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Vembu said that while AI holds enormous promise, the present wave of huge valuations and funding practices are becoming a cause on concern. “This boom makes me very uncomfortable,” he said. “While AI as a technology has enormous promise, much of today’s investment is speculative.”Along with this, Vembu also pointed to a round-tripping which a financial manoeuvre where companies fund each other to inflate revenue. This practice as per Vembu is a troubling trend for the AI sector. He further warned that such practices could lead to unsustainable valuations which is smilier to the past bubbles in dotcom and e-commerce. “Some people argue the multi-trillion-dollar valuations will be justified by productivity gains. But why aren’t those gains visible already?” he asked.However, despite all these concerns, Vembu stressed on the fact that the underlying technology of AI remains valuable and will continue to deliver real benefits in the long term.He advocates for measured, purpose-driven investment rather than hype-fueled speculation. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos may have agreed with Sam Altman over ‘AI Bubble’ warningRecently, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also pointed out that the current surge of investment in artificial intelligence (AI) constitutes an “industrial bubble” but stressed that the underlying technology is ""real"" and will bring immense societal benefits. Similar comments have been previously made by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who reportedly said earlier this year that he believes AI could be in a bubble but it’s “the most important thing to happen in a very long time”.“This is a kind of industrial bubble,” the Amazon founder said while speaking at Italian Tech Week.“The second thing that happens is that people get very excited like they are today about artificial intelligence,” Bezos added, noting that when they happen, stock prices are “disconnected from the fundamentals” of a business. He said that during bubbles, every experiment or idea gets funded.“The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas. And that’s also probably happening today,” Bezos said.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments.

Gold buying on Dhanteras 2025: It’s Dhanteras today and many people opt to buy gold for auspicious reasons. What should your gold buying strategy be and what are the top factors to keep in mind? Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities explains:The Indian gold market is witnessing an unprecedented situation. With MCX Gold futures hovering around ₹1,31,000 per 10 grams, and retail jewellery prices ranging between ₹1,35,000 and ₹1,40,000 depending on making charges and purity, the traditional buyer is caught in a dilemma: the need for auspicious purchase clashes with the high cost.However, anticipated that while volume may be restrained, the overall festive buying sentiment will remain positive, driven by an underlying fear of missing out on further price rallies and an increase in disposable income.The theme for this year's Dhanteras will be one of 'smart and strategic buying.Facing record prices, most middle-class households are expected to stick to the custom of shagun (auspicious) buying, but by purchasing in smaller quantities. The focus will shift heavily towards lightweight jewellery, such as nose pins, small earrings, or simple pendants, which offer the tradition of gold purchase without the huge bill.Jewellers report a strong rise in demand for gold coins, bars, and low-denomination digital gold over heavy traditional ornaments. For the price-sensitive buyer, a gold coin ensures purity and investment value with minimal making charges, making it a pragmatic way to participate in the 'bull run' for investment rather than mere adornment.The spectacular 60%+ surge in gold prices over the last year has created a strong 'Fear of Missing Out' (FOMO) among buyers. The belief that gold has strong upward momentum due to global geopolitical tensions and US rate cut expectations is prompting people to buy now, rather than risk further price hikes before the marriage season.The retail market is finding support from macroeconomic factors that have bolstered household liquidity:The benefit from the recent personal income tax cuts, particularly the announcement of higher tax exemptions or savings options in the budget, has resulted in a certain amount of saved money being available in the hands of individuals. A portion of this saved capital is likely to be parked into gold, which is seen as a traditional safe-haven asset.While gold still attracts a 3% Goods and Services Tax (GST) and a 5% GST on making charges, the overall simplification of the tax structure has indirectly supported consumer confidence and spending power in the organized retail sector, which jewellers are capitalizing on with festive schemes and discounts on making charges.Leading retail jewellers have aggressively rolled out schemes like advanced instalment plans, lower making charges on specific collections, and guaranteed gold rates to convert buyer intent into final purchases.This Dhanteras is unlikely to be a record-breaker in terms of sheer volume of gold sold. However, in terms of value and strategic investment participation, the market is poised for a robust performance. The Indian consumer, while cautious of the price, is unwilling to miss the auspicious opportunity or the potential for further upside in the yellow metal.","Facing record prices, most middle-class households are expected to stick to the custom of shagun (auspicious) buying.

US auto tariffs: Donald Trump offers American car makers additional relief; truck parts face 25% duty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-auto-tariffs-donald-trump-offers-us-car-makers-additional-relief-truck-parts-face-25-duty/articleshow/124654049.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Friday signed an order that provides relief for American carmakers while introducing a 25% tariff on truck parts.The White House said the order extends an arrangement allowing companies to reduce tariffs on imported vehicle parts. At the same time, it imposes a 25% tariff on medium and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, starting November 1.The moves follow a Section 232 investigation this year into truck imports, launched to assess their impact on national security. Trump has previously used such investigations under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on goods ranging from steel and aluminium to autos. The goal is to encourage domestic manufacturing and penalise countries he believes are taking advantage of the US.Currently, firms importing parts for vehicles built in the US can offset 3.75% of a car’s list price. This benefit was due to be gradually reduced and then ended, but the new order extends the 3.75% offset through 2030 without change.A similar system will now apply to medium and heavy-duty trucks. Officials cited by AFP said that the measures are designed to reward US-based production.Despite the new 25% tariff on imported trucks, senior US officials told journalists some trucks will still get preferential treatment under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).Around 78% of heavy truck imports come from Mexico and 15% from Canada, according to Capital Economics. Under the new rules, only the non-US content of USMCA-eligible trucks will face the tariff. Eligible parts will enter duty-free until the Commerce Department sets rules to assess their non-US content.Imported buses will face a 10% tariff and will not qualify for USMCA benefits, officials added.The tariffs come amid ongoing trade talks with Canada and Mexico. The levies are already affecting Mexico, with exports of heavy vehicles to the US dropping nearly 26% year-on-year between January and August.","The White House said the order extends an arrangement allowing companies to reduce tariffs on imported vehicle parts.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

'Had detailed discussions with Taliban foreign minister'







NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Thursday sharply criticised Pakistan over its recent hostilities with Afghanistan, while emphasising India’s commitment to Afghanistan’s sovereignty.Speaking on the tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan. ""In recent weeks, Pakistan has carried out targeted strikes in Kabul and other Taliban-controlled areas following a series of violent attacks by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Pakistani territory.The Taliban government had then launched the offensive in ""retaliation for air strikes carried out by the Pakistani army on Kabul.""The Taliban had carried out operations along parts of the border with Pakistan, prompting Islamabad to promise a strong response.A 48-hour ceasefire between Afghanistan and Pakistan took hold late on Wednesday.The Pakistan Taliban operates independently of Afghanistan’s Taliban, but the two groups share ideological alignment. Pakistan has accused Kabul of giving shelter to TTP leaders and other groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the ISIL affiliate in Khorasan Province (ISKP).TTP attacks have increased sharply since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, reflecting a growing trend in violence.During Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi's recent visit to India, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had announced that India will upgrade its technical mission in Afghanistan to a full embassy.When asked about the development and India’s stand on recognising Afghanistan’s Taliban government, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We had detailed discussions with foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi covering humanitarian aid, development cooperation, and upgrading our embassy. We donated 20 ambulances and plan further work in Afghanistan’s health sector. The transition of our technical mission in Kabul into a full embassy will take place in the coming days.

Pakistan has secured a $1.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund . IMF on Tuesday said that it has reached a staff-level agreement with the South Asian country under its ongoing loan program, paving the way for Islamabad to access $1.2 billion pending approval from the Fund's Executive Board.According to the official statement issued by the IMF, Pakistan will receive $1 billion through the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and another $200 million under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), taking the total disbursements under both programs to about $3.3 billion.""The IMF team has reached a staff-level agreement with the Pakistani authorities on the second review of the 37-month Extended Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the first review of the 28-month arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF). The staff-level agreement is subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board. Upon approval, Pakistan will have access to about US$1.0 billion (SDR 760 million) under the EFF and about US$200 million (SDR 154 million) under the RSF, bringing total disbursements under the two arrangements to about US$3.3 billion,"" the IMF said in an official statement.""Supported by the EFF, Pakistan's economic program is entrenching macroeconomic stability and rebuilding market confidence,"" the IMF said in its statement.The Fund noted that the country's recovery ""remains on track,"" citing contained inflation, stronger external buffers, and improving financial conditions reflected in narrowing sovereign spreads.IMF officials said the next tranche would be released once the board signs off on the review — a standard step in the Fund's lending framework, where loan disbursements follow successful periodic assessments.""The recovery remains on track, with the FY25 current account recording a surplus—the first in 14 years, the fiscal primary balance surpassing the program target, inflation remaining contained, external buffers strengthening, and financial conditions improving as sovereign spreads have narrowed significantly,"" it added.Pakistan has committed to maintaining a tight and data-dependent monetary policy and strengthening climate resilience — a key demand from the IMF after the floods devastated large parts of the country.""The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the EFF- and RSF-supported programs, and to maintaining sound and prudent macroeconomic policies while advancing ongoing structural reforms,"" the statement added.Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said earlier in the day that Pakistan was close to finalising the agreement after an IMF team concluded its review visit last week. ""The staff-level deal marks a major step forward,"" he told reporters, according to Reuters, signalling renewed investor confidence.Aurangzeb also revealed that Pakistan plans to return to international capital markets, starting with its first-ever green bond denominated in Chinese yuan before the end of 2025.

It’s the beginning of New Bangladesh,” Yunus said after the event.

A fire broke out at a garment factory and adjoining chemical warehouse in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, killed at least nine people and injured several others on Tuesday, according to fire service officials, reported AP.The blaze erupted in the Mirpur area and is believed to have started on the third floor of a seven-storey building housing a garment facility, said Talha bin Jashim, a senior fire official. The cause of the fire is yet to be confirmed.Rescue workers had recovered nine bodies by late evening and warned that the death toll could rise. “Several other people have been injured,” Jashim said.The fire was brought under control by evening, though rescue and recovery operations were to continuing late into the night.Bangladesh is the second-largest garment exporter globally after China. The sector employs around four million people, the majority of them women, and contributes nearly $40 billion annually to the country’s export earnings, mainly from the US and Europe.The industry has long faced scrutiny for industrial safety standards.

UK’s F-35B Fighter Jet Takes Off from Kerala After Month-Long Stay





LONDON: In a historic reversal of colonial times, two top guns from the Indian Air Force will soon be training Royal Air Force fighter pilots in the UK.The two IAF instructors will train RAF aircrew officers who are completing flying training at No. 4 Flying Training School in RAF Valley on the island of Anglesey, off the northwest coast of Wales.A senior RAF source told TOI: “The start date remains to be confirmed; however it will not be before Oct 2026. UK familiarisation and training may take up to a year or less, depending on experience.”It is understood that their salaries will be paid by India, while the UK ministry of defence will provide accommodation.The school is where the UK’s next generation of fighter pilots get trained on the BAE Hawk TMk2. Two Hawk-qualified flying instructors from India will be based on Anglesey for up to three years. The advanced jet trainer provides the ideal lead-in trainer for pilots graduating on to frontline aircraft such as the Typhoon and F-35.The plan to bring IAF instructors to the UK is part of a new approach to building a stronger relationship with the IAF and by association supporting wider UK military and political goals, an RAF source told TOI.The agreement was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during UK PM Keir Starmer’s visit to Mumbai last week when a £350 million defence deal to send UK-manufactured lightweight multirole missiles to the Indian Army was sealed.The World Directory of Modern Military Aircraft ranks India as having the third-strongest air force in the world, after the US and Russia, and ahead of the UK which is ranked eighth.“Having FN Qualified Flying Instructors (QFIs) involved in the UK training system provides several defence engagement benefits to both the RAF and the partner nation,” the RAF source said.“The wider benefit is the building and enhancing of interoperability with a partner nation, jointly strengthening bilateral relationships through the building of trust in a core endeavour of providing world-leading flying training. The knowledge exchange that occurs from the interaction with international trainees and trainers allows for the exchange of tactics, techniques, and procedures.”","Two top guns from the Indian Air Force will soon be training Royal Air Force fighter pilots in the UK.

'There is a deep connection between Lithuanian and Sanskrit language': Ambassador Diana Mickeviciene





LONDON: Whilst most people associate Sanskrit scholarship with the Vedas, new research by Cambridge scholars plans to show that between 1650 and 1800 a golden age of Sanskrit scholarship took place even when Britain was tightening its grip on India. Yet the erotic plays and poems, legal literature, and philosophy produced are barely known about, nor have they been translated.The largely forgotten literary figures and their works are neglected treasures of India’s intellectual achievement, argues the research team, led by Dr Jonathan Duquette, scholar of South Asian religions at the University of Cambridge.“The assumption in the field was that by 1700 nothing interesting was happening in Sanskrit scholarship, but we are trying to prove that until the late 19th century, it was very vibrant, particularly in the Kaveri Delta region. For the sake of the research we had to limit our scope to those 150 years,” Duquette told TOI.Hundreds of pandits dispersed across the Indian countryside in Brahmin settlements (agrahāra) and monasteries (maṭha) kept writing poems, plays, philosophy, theology, and legal texts in Sanskrit even when Britain tightened its grip on India.In 1799, when the East India Company took control of the court of Thanjavur — the heart of Sanskrit patronage then — English-speaking schools began to spread.Gradually fewer Brahmin families aimed for their sons to become priests and instead sent them to the new, Western-influenced, schools.“This could have suffocated Sanskrit scholarship very quickly but it survived partly because of these rural settlements,” Duquette said.Awarded a five-year grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, they are leading the first extensive survey of sites in the Kaveri Delta, where the pandits were most concentrated.He and his research team, which includes Indian scholars, are particularly interested in the village of Thiruvisanallur on the banks of the river Kaveri, which Duquette has visited. This village was founded on land that had been donated by Maratha military leader Shahaji Bhonsle, father of Chhatrapati Shivaji, to a group of 45 distinguished scholars.Among them was revered Hindu saint Sridhara Venkatesa “Ayyaval”, a crucial early figure in the development of nāmasiddhānta (a spiritual doctrine that emphasises the chanting of the name of God).“For decades these scholars worked together and produced amazing Sanskrit scholarship. Some of the works have been printed in Sanskrit but most of these works exist only in a manuscript form. Some are in the Saraswathi Mahal Library in Thanjavur but are hard to access. Others are thought to be in local temple libraries, private libraries and with descendants of the pandits,” Duquette said.Most Brahmins have moved away and many buildings have been sold, but some descendants remain. “We want to understand the importance of these sites and lives, and make this common knowledge,” he said“The native tongues of these scholars was Tamil but they wrote in Sanskrit, so we are interested in the relationship between these Sanskrit works and Tamil works and Tamil institutions. We are not just translating words but will try to show that these villages were important centres of production of Sanskrit scholarship. There were literary geniuses among these men but many people in India don’t know them,” Duquette said.","Sanskrit scholarship flourished between 1650 and 1800 when Britain was tightening its grip on India. Yet the erotic plays and poems, legal literature, and philosophy produced are barely known about, nor have they been translated.
