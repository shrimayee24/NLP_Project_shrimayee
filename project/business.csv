Schools in a fix after direction to go 'hybrid'

NEW DELHI: Schools, colleges and other educational institutions in Delhi and neighbouring cities can resume physical classes but must simultaneously keep the online option open wherever feasible, pollution watchdog CAQM said Monday after SC allowed relaxation of these provisions while keeping other Grap-4 curbs in place.Classes can be conducted in hybrid mode from Tuesday, CAQM said.""The option to exercise the online mode, wherever available, shall vest with students and their guardians,"" its order said.Earlier, SC asked CAQM to take a call on relaxing Grap curbs on online classes. With physical classes suspended, the court said poor students couldn't avail of midday meals and many didn't have facilities to join online classes.Other conditions imposed under Grap-4 would stay till further orders, the court said while slamming the authorities for not complying with CAQM's order barring trucks from entering the capital.Delhi AQI slipped back to 'very poor' at 339 after improving to 'poor' on Sunday.All lessons up to Class XII in schools and other educational institutions will be conducted in a hybrid mode in Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddh Nagar from Tuesday, the Commission for Air Quality Management ordered on Monday.Following the direction of the Supreme Court on Monday to relax certain restrictions under GRAP Stage-IV, CAQM announced that NCR cities would conduct classes in a hybrid mode comprising physical and online modes until further orders. ""The option to exercise the online mode of education, wherever available, shall vest with the students and their guardians,"" theCAQM order said.In its order, the commission also stated that NCR govts might consider conducting online classes in all other districts in addition to those named in the order. ""Further, wide publicity shall be given for immediate implementation (of the order) by all the authorities concerned in Delhi-NCR,"" CAQM stated.The apex court asked air management panel on Monday to take a call on relaxing the order on mandatory online classes under GRAP stages III and IV, noting that many students would miss out on the benefit of mid-day meals, many of them didn't have facilities to take online classes and many educational institutions too didn't have facilities to provide online education. The court also noted that the ""residences of many students do not have air purifiers, and therefore, there may not be any difference between the children sitting at home and the children attending school"".Meanwhile the schools in the city geared up for the new challenge. Sunita, principal, Ravi Shankar SKV in Bawana, said, ""We won't probably opt for hybrid, but if it happens, we will need to reorganise our timetable and teachers' work because we will require teachers to be available for both modes simultaneously. We will have to combine sections for lessons on similar subjects, especially in online mode. Offline mode will depend on classroom strength.""Rooma Pathak, principal, MM Public School, Pitampura, stated, ""It's difficult to function like this. We tried the hybrid mode once but it proved ineffective for the students. A camera recorded the teacher taking classes as usual. Students at home could watch this footage.""On November 14, chief minister Atishi had announced that all primary classes were to shift to the online mode in the wake of the city's air quality reaching 'severe' levels. Three days later on Nov 17, CAQM ordered the implementation of GRAP Stage IV, which, in respect of school education, gives govt the option to shift more classes to online mode.And then as the air quality kept on worsening, the Supreme Court stepped in and on Nov 18 - the most polluted day of the current winter season - directed all the classes to be held online. The court had also kept the GRAP Stage IV restrictions intact until further orders. On Monday, with AQI having moved out of the 'severe' zone in the past few days, it said CAQM could consider the order on compulsory online classes in schools.","The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) allowed hybrid classes in Delhi-NCR schools, hours after the Supreme Court asked it to examine the grant of relaxation of actions in relation to educational institutions.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to relax the strict Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-4 measures being enforced in Delhi-NCR to curb rising pollution, but suggested that educational institutions in the National Capital Region (NCR) can reopen for physical classes.The court also directed the Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM) to consider relaxing norms to allow schools to reopen, noting that a large number of students cannot avail mid-day meals, online classes and do not have access to air purifiers, reported news agency ANI.The top court also came down heavily on the authorities, asking the CAQM to take action against the Delhi government, city police and others responsible for not complying with its order under GARP-4 to prevent the entry of trucks into the national capital.Despite permitting relaxation of GRAP-4 measures in order to allow physical classes, the court noted that it could not order curbs below GRAP-3 or GRAP-2 unless it is satisfied with the consistent decrease in the Air Quality Index (AQI).The court also asked the state governments to use the labour cess it collected for the subsistence of the labourers during the construction ban.As of now, schools have been instructed to conduct classes online, with the heads of educational institutions ensuring that parents are informed promptly. The latest updates from the government have provided no clarity on when physical classes might resume.While the air quality in Delhi has improved slightly, with AQI levels dipping below the 300-mark on Monday morning, the pollution levels still remain in the ‘poor’ category. This continues to be a concern for residents, especially for children and elderly people.

NEW DELHI: Disregarding resistance from its ally Shiv Sena , BJP has pressed ahead with its effort to restore Devendra Fadnavis as CM of Maharashtra.Sources indicated that this decision has been communicated to NCP ( Ajit Pawar faction) which is comfortable with the idea of Fadnavis's return to the office he held between 2014 and 2019 and then, briefly, for a few days in 2019. There are indications that the decision will soon be conveyed to Sena which has pressed for the continuation of incumbent, Eknath Shinde BJP insiders expressed hope that Shinde would come around because of the huge numbers at BJP's disposal: it won 132 seats and reach the magic mark of 145 with the support of Ajit Pawar's group of 41 as well as its ""silent"" supporters scattered among other parties.Sources said the party will offer the post of deputy CMs to Sena (Shinde) and Ajit Pawar's group, though other crucial details, such as who gets what portfolios and how many, are yet to be worked out.While Shiv Sena and NCP have elected Shinde and Pawar as their legislative party leaders respectively, BJP has not yet made its official announcement, but Fadnavis's selection as the leader of the party has looked a foregone conclusion since Saturday when BJP romped home with a record-shattering tally on the strength of the strategy and ground game he had scripted.It's understood that both Fadnavis and Shinde are heading to the national capital to meet home minister Amit Shah to resolve the leadership issue and discuss government formation.Shiv Sena spokesperson Naresh Mhaske cited the Bihar model, suggesting Shinde should continue as CM. BJP MLC Pravin Darekar endorsed Fadnavis for the CM post, emphasising his capability to lead the state.","BJP has pressed ahead with its effort to restore Devendra Fadnavis as CM of Maharashtra.

Women COs' 'lack of empathy' among concerns flagged

NEW DELHI: A top Army officer has called for a comprehensive policy on "" gender neutrality "" as well as a ""pragmatic performance analysis"" of Colonel-rank women commanding officers (COs) in the force, citing several instances of them not measuring up to requisite standards due to their lack of training for command, among other factors.Lt General Rajeev Puri, who completed his tenure as the commander of the China-specific 17 'Brahmastra' Mountain Strike Corps at Panagarh on Nov 20, stressed the need to ensure gender neutrality in postings and selection of COs, in a letter addressed to Eastern Command chief Lt-General R C Tiwari last month, with copies to the Adjutant General and Military Secretary at the Army HQs.Women officers have from last year onwards begun to command units in air defence, signals, ordnance, engineers, intelligence, service corps and the like.Women officers are still not allowed in main 'fighting arms' of infantry, armoured corps and mechanised infantry of the over 11 lakh-strong Army. With eight such women COs in his corps, Lt Gen Puri said an analysis was conducted after an ""in-house review"" based on ""demonstrated performance"" of the officers. Women COs have been exhibiting poor ""interpersonal relations"", with an ""exaggerated tendency to complain"" to senior commanders about their subordinates rather than exercising their own authority and powers first, as well as ""lack of empathy"" for officers and troops in their units. ""Any professional disagreement or minor argument is viewed as insubordination... The lack of empathy may be attributable to a need to overcompensate,"" he said.Women COs have also been found to over-centralise decision-making without proper consultations, in a ""my way or highway"" kind of approach, instead of a ""directive style of command"".Some even have a ""misplaced sense of entitlement"", Lt Gen Puri said, citing the case of a woman CO who insisted the unit's subedar major (SM) open her vehicle's door whenever she arrived, contrary to orders on the subject. ""Occasionally, when the SM would get delayed in doing so, the CO would continue sitting in her vehicle and not disembark,"" he said.Some women COs exhibit ""over-ambition"", leading to repeated incidents of ""unreasonable performance demands"" on officers and troops, and consequently, high levels of stress in their units. ""An uncontrolled urge to make derogatory statements regarding juniors to usurp credit, rather than encouraging them, is routine,"" Lt Gen Puri said. On the other end of the spectrum, a few women COs have taken a ""low profile, low initiative route"" to command, he added.With Supreme Court enforcing permanent commission and command roles for women in the armed forces, who had long opposed it because of what they called ""operational, practical and cultural problems"", the Army had finally empanelled 108 women officers for command assignments through a special selection board after ""multiple policy waivers"" early last year, as was then reported by TOI. These women colonels, however, were not trained and groomed for challenging role of COs, unlike their male counterparts who do 'junior command', staff college and other adjunct courses as well as the requisite appointments as young officers.Apart from lack of command training, he said, ""The postings of these officers did not expose them to command roles. Hardly any woman officer has tenanted high-pressure command/staff assignment prior to her role as the CO."" With women officers not getting much exposure to operational tasks, ""preferential treatment"" has led to ""lack of understanding of hardships and resultant lack of compassion for the troops involved in these tasks"", he said.""The desire to prove oneself in a field which was supposed to be a male bastion is likely a driver behind the over-ambitiousness in some women COs... In order to be perceived as strong individuals and avoid being judged as soft-hearted, women COs handle HR issues with a firmer hand than their male counterparts,"" he added.","Lt General Rajeev Puri has called for a comprehensive policy on "" gender neutrality"" in postings and selection of COs.

MUMBAI: In perhaps the longest 'digital detention' in the city by cyber fraudsters posing as law enforcers, a 77-year-old south Mumbai woman was kept under 'digital custody' for more than a month. Threatened with arrest in a fake money laundering case , the accused duped her of Rs 3.8 crore, said the police.The complainant, a homemaker, lives with her retired husband (75) in the city while her two children are abroad.Police said she first received a WhatsApp call. The caller told her the parcel she had sent to Taiwan had been stopped and it contained five passports, a bank card, 4kg of clothes and MDMA drug, and so on. The woman told the caller she had not sent any parcel to anyone. The caller then said her Aadhar card details were used in the crime and asked her to talk to a Mumbai police officer. The call was transferred to a fake police officer who said her Aadhaar card was linked to a money laundering case which was under investigation, though she denied any involvement in it.""The complainant was then asked to download the Skype app and told that the police officers would talk to her through it. She was ordered not to disconnect and not to tell anyone about the case. A man posing as Anand Rana, IPS officer, sought details of her bank accounts.

They told her the money would be returned to her if found to be 'clear',"" said a police officer. The accused also sent her a fake Mumbai crime branch notice with a police logo.The accused also asked the woman to continue her WhatsApp video call 24x7. She switched on the video call on her family computer. ""If the complainant disconnected the call or it got disconnected, the accused would call her up and ask her to connect again and keep checking her location,"" said a police officer.She was then instructed to go to the bank and transfer money and told if the bank inquired why she needed it, she could tell them that she wanted to buy a property.She transferred the money and the accused returned Rs 15 lakh into her account, saying it was clear. By returning the money, they gained her trust. They then asked her to send all her money from her and her husband's joint accounts. Over a period of time, she transferred Rs 3.8 crore into six bank accounts.She suspected something was amiss when she did not get her money back while the accused kept demanding more funds for taxes and ""clearing money"" while keeping her under ""voluntary surveillance"". She spoke to her daughter over the phone, who told her she was being conned and asked her to approach the police. She called the 1930 cyber helpline.

"Trial results pending, but TB supplement gets govt nod",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trial-results-pending-but-tb-supplement-gets-govt-nod/articleshow/115676820.cms,"File photo

Instead of providing food, govt has decided to introduce Energy Dense Nutritional Supplementation (EDNS), a sachet of sweetened peanut paste, milk powder and oil, for 12 lakh underweight TB patients for two months even before results of a trial to establish efficacy of EDNS have been published. Experts questioned the haste in introducing this before publishing efficacy study and cautioned that this could commercialise the intervention and end up costing much more than supplying food to patients.The largest trial showing efficacy of nutritional support for underweight TB patients, which was published in Lancet in Sept last year, had recommended providing a monthly 10kg food basket (rice, pulses, milk powder and oil) and multivitamins for six months to help underweight TB patients gain weight and reduce mortality.This trial, called RATIONS (Reducing Activation of Tuberculosis by Improvement of Nutritional Status), funded by ICMR, involved 2,800 patients and was done between Aug 2019 and Jan 2021.RATIONS trial estimated monthly cost of the food basket at Rs 1,100 per patient at 2019 prices. However, govt estimate of Rs 1,040 crore to provide EDNS to 12 lakh patients for two months works out to roughly Rs 4,300 per patient per month. Moreover, EDNS is only for 2 months though nutritional support was recommended for six months.EDNS was being considered as an intervention for TB well before RATIONS trial results were published.A small study on acceptability of EDNS, involving 102 patients, was done between Sept 2018 and Feb 2019 by the same authors who did the efficacy trial later. It was published in Sept 2020. However, with RATIONS trials conclusively proving how effective distributing a food basket is in improving TB cure rates and reducing mortality, it has come as a surprise to many TB experts that govt has pushed ahead with EDNS.According to clinical trial registration website, efficacy trial with 329 participants, with 167 in intervention arm (given EDNS) and 162 in control arm (only given dietary advice), was funded by ICMR. It started in Jan 2020 and was completed in Feb 2023. ""Though results of the main trial have not yet been published in a peer reviewed journal, they have been presented to experts and have been accepted for presentation during Union World Congress on Lung health,"" said Dr Anand Krishnan, of Centre for Community Medicine in AIIMS Delhi, who is one of the study authors.Dr Veena Shatrugna, former deputy director of National Institute of Nutrition, said: ""The message of improving home diets in TB patients is not possible if such a programme is launched. It will be a fertile ground for the food processing industry to provide EDNS.""There was no response from health ministry, ICMR or TB division to queries sent to them.","Energy Dense Nutritional Supplementation (EDNS) is a sachet of sweetened peanut paste, milk powder and oil.

NEW DELHI: Adani group's indictment in the US dominated the discourse on the opening day of the winter session of Parliament, as the joint opposition Monday demanded that a JPC be formed to investigate the issue arising out of the American probe which has ""tarnished the image of the country and raised issues of corruption"".The matter was also raised in the two Houses through adjournment notices by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge (under rule 267) and Congress whip Manickam Tagore in LS, though the proceedings were adjourned without any business.Questioning the RS Chair's refusal to allow the notice, Kharge trained his guns at PM Modi by alleging that ""alignment of his diplomatic visits with Adani's international business expansion"" has been such that Modi's foreign tours have resulted in infrastructure contracts to the business house in Bangladesh, Israel, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Tanzania, Kenya, Vietnam, Greece. ""Without the PM's blessings, which country will give its contracts to Adani when there are so many reputed companies in India? This is impacting the country,"" he remarked.

The bench said, ""We are of the opinion that judges of SC and HCs, MPs, MLAs, officers of the AIS, journalists etc. cannot be treated as a separate category for allotment of land at a discounted basic value in preference to others.""While cancelling the allotment of land to cooperative societies, SC said the allottees and their members would be entitled to refund of the land price, stamp duty and registration fees paid by them along with interest to be quantified by Telangana govt.""The object of the policy perpetuates inequality. The policy differentiates and bestows largesse to an advantaged section/group by resorting to discrimination and denial.

The policy does not meet the fairness standards prescribed by the Constitution,"" it said.The petitioners before HC had alleged that lands worth Rs 700 crore were distributed arbitrarily at throwaway prices to influential sections of the society causing huge loss to the exchequer and depriving deserving people a shelter over their heads.Hammering down the defence of state govt, CJI Khanna said, ""Shorn of pretence, this policy of State Govt, is an abuse of power meant to cater exclusively to the affluent sections of the society, disapproving and rejecting the equal right to allotment of the common citizen and the socio-economically disadvantaged.""All India Services officers argued that they were underprivileged and have made sacrifices to entitle them to preferential land allotment of land at discounted rate. CJI Khanna and Justice Datta termed this stand as ""fallacious and untenable"".The bench said giving land at discounted rates to influential sections of the society distorts the natural market forces that determine the true value of the land. CJI Khanna said, ""The true market price of land reflects its demand and utility, but when individuals receive land at a discount, it artificially devalues the property and consequently diminishes public revenue.

"'Socialist' and 'secular' to stay in Preamble, rules Supreme Court; junks PIL",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/socialist-and-secular-to-stay-in-preamble-rules-supreme-court-junks-pil/articleshow/115672041.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ending a five-decade-old debate on insertions of words 'socialist' and 'secular' in the Preamble of the Constitution, the Supreme Court on Monday upheld the Emergency-era amendment to the Preamble and said these words neither impede private entrepreneurship nor fetter govt from getting rid of obnoxious religious practices.Throwing out challenge to the 42nd constitutional amendment that inserted these two words along with 'integrity' in the Preamble in 1976 by the Indira Gandhi govt, a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said secularism mandates the govt not to favour any religion but it does not prevent elimination of religious attitudes and practices impeding development and right to equality.It said despite freedom of religion guaranteed to the citizens and their non-discrimination on the ground of their faith, the Constitution under the Directive Principles of State Policy permits the govt to strive for a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), a hot topic in the Indian polity since the Shah Bano case judgment of the SC in 1985.The bench said socialism in the Indian context does not restrict economic policies of an elected govt. ""Neither the Constitution nor the Preamble mandates a specific economic policy or structure, whether left or right. Rather, 'socialist' denotes the State's commitment to be a welfare State and its commitment to ensuring equality of opportunity,"" it said.It said the socialism practised in India aims to achieve the goal of economic and social upliftment of citizens and in no way restricts private entrepreneurship and the right to do business, which is guaranteed as a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(9g).CJI Khanna-led bench said, ""India has consistently embraced a mixed economy model, where the private sector has flourished, expanded and grown over the years, contributing significantly to the upliftment of marginalised and underprivileged sections in different ways. In the Indian framework, socialism embodies the principle of economic and social justice, wherein the State ensures that no citizen is disadvantaged due to economic or social circumstances.""The challenge to the 42nd amendment was mounted by a PIL in 2020, a good 44 years after the insertion of the words 'socialist' and 'secular' in the Preamble on the grounds - the framers of the Constitution had omitted these two words from the Preamble after long deliberations; the word 'socialist' restricted the govt's choice of economic policy; and, that the amendment was passed on Nov 2, 1976, nearly eight months after the term of Lok Sabha got over on Mar 18, 1976. ""We do not find any legitimate cause or justification for challenging the constitutional amendment after nearly 44 years,"" the bench said.The SC said the power to amend the Constitution rests only with Parliament and this power extends to amending the Preamble. On the validity of insertion of 'secular' in Preamble, the SC said, ""Over time, India has developed its own interpretation of secularism, wherein the State neither supports any religion nor penalises the profession and practice of any faith.""Listing several fundamental rights under the Constitution, which bars govt from discriminating citizens on the ground of faith and allows people to profess a religion of their choice while allowing minority communities from establishing and administering their educational institutions, the bench said, ""Despite these provisions, Article 44 in the Directive Principles of State Policy permits the state to strive for a uniform civil code for its citizens.""",Supreme Court throws out challenge to 42nd constitutional amendment that inserted these two words along with 'integrity' in the Preamble in 1976 by the Indira Gandhi govt.

List of unsold player in IPL mega auction

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn. Notable names like David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, and Kane Williamson , who have been cornerstones in the IPL for years, found themselves without bids.Each had a base price of Rs 2 crore, but despite their immense experience and proven track records, none of them attracted offers.Their absence from the auction table raised questions, particularly given their global stature in T20 cricket. It’s a stark reminder of how the dynamics of the auction can sometimes overshadow established stars in favour of fresh talent.In addition to these marquee international names, other seasoned players like Shardul Thakur Ajinkya Rahane , and Glenn Phillips also went unsold. Rahane, a reliable middle-order batsman, and Thakur, an all-rounder with vast IPL experience, both entered the auction with a base price of Rs 1.5 crore, but failed to secure a contract.Similarly, Phillips, known for his explosive batting and wicketkeeping skills, and Thakur, a consistent bowler, were left out despite being integral parts of their national teams. This reflects the fierce competition in the auction, where franchises appear to be banking on younger, more explosive talent rather than experienced hands.Perhaps the most surprising snub was former U-19 captain Prithvi Shaw , who had once been considered one of India’s brightest young talents. With a modest base price of Rs 75 lakh, Shaw was expected to generate significant interest.However, despite his impressive domestic performances, Shaw failed to attract any buyers. This highlights a growing trend in the IPL, where franchises are increasingly looking for players who can deliver immediate impact, while the burden of expectation weighs heavily on players like Shaw, who have not yet lived up to their early promise.The unsold list also includes several uncapped players, such as Yash Dhull, Kartik Tyagi, and Piyush Chawla, who could have added value to any team. With base prices ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, these players were considered potential investments, but their inability to secure deals underscores the auction's unpredictable nature.As franchises continue to focus on emerging talent from India and abroad, the auction results serve as a reminder that the IPL is not just about star power but also about fitting the right players into the right roles, irrespective of their past achievements.","IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn.

Born in Herat, Afghanistan, Noor represents the new generation of Afghan cricketers making a mark on the global stage.Known for his ability to bowl with control and generate sharp turn, Noor is particularly effective in the T20 format.He made his T20I debut for Afghanistan in 2022 against Zimbabwe and quickly became a vital part of their spin attack.His success in franchise leagues, including the IPL, Big Bash League, and the Caribbean Premier League, further highlighted his potential.Noor's IPL journey began in 2023 with Gujarat Titans, where he showcased his skills by taking 24 wickets in 23 matches at an economy of just over 8 runs per over.In the IPL 2025 mega auction, Chennai Super Kings secured Noor's services for a staggering Rs 10 crore, solidifying his status as one of the most sought-after young talents in T20 cricket.Paired with legends like Jadeja and Ashwin, Noor's inclusion strengthens CSK's spin arsenal, making him a key player to watch in the upcoming season.","Chennai Super Kings secured Afghanistan's young talent Noor Ahmad for Rs 10 crore at the IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: All-rounder Venkatesh Iyer was bought back by Kolkata Knight Riders for a whopping Rs 23.75 crore at the IPL mega auction in Jeddah on Sunday, speculated to take on the captaincy challenge and step into Shreyas Iyer 's shoes.Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchise went for an all out bidding war against Royal Challengers Bengaluru to secure Venkatesh after choosing not to retain their 2024 IPL-winning captain Shreyas Iyer.After Shreyas ( Punjab Kings , Rs 26.75 crore) and Rishabh Pant (Lucknow Super Giants, Rs 27 crore), Venkatesh, who has played for India in nine Twenty20 Internationals and two One-Day Internationals, was the third most costly purchase in the IPL mega auction.He was one of the biggest surprises of Sunday's auction due to the high price tag.Explaining why KKR went all out for Iyer, the franchise's CEO and MD Venky Mysore said his team's priority was to maintain balance and have some core players, with marquee signings like Quinton de Kock and Anrich Nortje ""Auctions are always unpredictable. It's about the type of players you want and how they fit into your strategy. Prices certainly have a meaning within a certain band, but auctions often surprise you,"" he said.""With salary caps increasing, it's natural for prices to expand too.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

There's no grand cypher. If you have curiosity, imagination, and the willingness to try something new, you can find the treasures that I've hidden,"" Collins-Black said.The chests contain diverse items appealing to various interests, including sports memorabilia like Michael Jordan 's 1986 rookie card , alongside precious metals and historical artefacts.Notable items include Jacqueline Onassis's diamond and sapphire brooch, a fourth-century BCE gold Greek laurel, a Picasso-designed coin, and a rare lunar rock specimen.One chest contains a single Bitcoin, currently valued at approximately $100,000, with potential for increased value before discovery.Collins-Black has confirmed that all chests are positioned in safe, accessible locations above ground, within 3 miles of public roads, and not on private property.""I created this treasure hunt because I live for adventure,"" Collins-Black explained, revealing he developed the concept during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.""I hope to ignite that same sense of wonder and curiosity in everyone who joins this journey,"" he added, according to WKRC.This initiative follows a similar treasure hunt by Forrest Fenn, an art dealer from New Mexico, who around 2010 concealed a $2 million chest of valuables in the Rocky Mountains, leaving cryptic poetic clues.The decade-long search claimed at least five lives before Fenn announced its discovery in June 2020. However, the finder's identity remained undisclosed, and Fenn's subsequent death left questions about the treasure's discovery unanswered.","Jon Collins-Black has hidden five chests of valuables across the United States.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk , selected by US President-elect Donald Trump to lead efforts to reduce federal government spending, made headlines Monday by criticising modern fighter jets and advocating for drones as the future of air warfare .""Manned fighter jets are obsolete in the age of drones anyway. Will just get pilots killed,"" Musk said on his social media platform, X, where he heads companies such as SpaceX and Tesla.Musk reserved pointed criticism for the F-35 , a state-of-the-art fighter jet produced by US defence giant Lockheed Martin .The aircraft, which entered service in 2015, is renowned for its stealth capabilities and intelligence-gathering functions but has faced scrutiny for high costs and technical challenges.""Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35,"" Musk posted, sharing a video of drones flying in precise formation. He labelled the F-35 ""an expensive (and) complex jack of all trades, master of none,"" arguing that its design flaws stemmed from overly ambitious requirements.The F-35 aircraft has been adopted by several nations, including Germany, Poland, Finland, and Romania, despite enduring criticism for its high operating costs and development challenges, particularly with its advanced software systems.Mauro Gilli, a researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, defended the aircraft's role in modern warfare . ""What makes the F-35... expensive is the software and the electronics, not the pilot per se,"" Gilli said on X. He added that reusable drones would still require the same advanced electronics as the F-35, undermining Musk's argument that removing pilots would significantly cut costs.Gilli also pointed out the strategic impact of the F-35, arguing that its existence forces geopolitical rivals like Russia and China to invest heavily in countermeasures. ""By simply existing, the F-35 and the B-1 force Russia and China into strategic choices they would not have to make otherwise (i.e., budget allocations),"" Gilli explained. ""Even if Musk were right (and he is not), deleting the programs would relax these constraints on them.""","Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk made headlines Monday by criticising modern fighter jets.

Damian Williams , the first Black US Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), announced his resignation, effective 13 December 2024, just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration.His departure clears the way for a new appointee to lead the high-profile office, known for tackling financial fraud and public corruption cases .Williams, appointed by President Joe Biden in 2021, described his decision as “bittersweet.”In his farewell statement, he said, “It is bitter in the sense that I am leaving my dream job, leading an institution I love that is filled with the finest public servants in the world. It is sweet in that I am confident I am leaving at a time when the Office is functioning at an incredibly high level — upholding and exceeding its already high standard of excellence, integrity, and independence.”High-profile convictions under Williams’ leadershipDuring his tenure, Williams oversaw significant convictions, including Sam Bankman-Fried , founder of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, on fraud charges involving the theft of $8 billion in customer funds.Additionally, Archegos Capital founder Bill Hwang was found guilty of stock market manipulation, and former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez was convicted on corruption charges.Williams also brought charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams and musician Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, both of whom have denied the allegations.Williams emphasised the importance of his office's independence and praised its career attorneys, stating, “They are worthy custodians of this office's tradition of doing the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons.”As per the news agency Reuters, Edward Y Kim, Williams’ deputy, will serve as acting US Attorney following his departure.Trump has announced plans to nominate Jay Clayton , former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to lead the SDNY.According to NBC News, Trump described Clayton as “a highly respected business leader, counsel, and public servant.” The appointment requires Senate confirmation.Williams’ resignation reflects a broader pattern of US Attorneys stepping down before transitions to Trump-led administrations.His predecessor, Preet Bharara, was fired by Trump in 2017 after initially being asked to remain. Geoffrey Berman, another predecessor, was similarly removed amid allegations of political pressure.Williams maintained the SDNY’s reputation for impartiality despite the Trump administration's controversial approach to the Justice Department.As per Reuters, Williams closed an investigation into Trump’s former lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, without filing charges, while also prosecuting a case involving an alleged Iranian plot against Trump.In his statement, Williams reaffirmed his belief in the integrity of the SDNY, calling its attorneys “patriots.”","Damian Williams, the first Black US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced his resignation, effective 13 December 2024.
