NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Wednesday recalled its response to Pakistan’s pre-emptive air strikes of December 3, 1971 — attacks that triggered a 14-day war ending in a decisive Indian victory and the creation of Bangladesh.""Following Pakistan's pre-emptive strike on 03 Dec 1971, the IAF responded with precision and fury,"" the IAF posted on X.“Through the night, Canberra crews flew 23 deep-strike missions, hitting enemy airfields at Murid, Mianwali, Sargodha, Chander, Risalewala, Shorkot and Masrur (Karachi). Runways were cratered, installations shattered, and the adversary’s early move was blunted within hours,” it said.The subsequent air–land operations also began with what the post described as a “thunderous reminder” of the IAF’s reach.“AN-12s dropped forty-eight 500-lb bombs over Changa Manga, sparking a massive fire in the enemy’s supply camp,” it added.On December 16, 1971, Pakistani forces commanded by Lieutenant General AAK Niazi surrendered to the Indian Army’s Lieutenant General JS Aurora — a capitulation involving 93,000 troops, the largest surrender since World War II.The day is celebrated as ""Vijay Diwas"" (Victory Day) in both India and Bangladesh.However, relations between them have grown strained following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina as prime minister in August 2024.

Here's what Rajnath said





NEW DELHI: Congress has rejected Rajnath Singh's claim that ""Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to build Babri Masjid using public funds, and it was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who opposed it"". The grand old party accused the defence minister of propagating a ""lie"", and said they would not let ""the legacy of Nehru or Patel to be distorted by Godse’s followers.""""There is zero archival or documentary evidence to support it. Nehruji explicitly opposed using government money for religious places — including the reconstruction of Temple. He insisted it should be funded through public contributions, not the state,"" Congress MP Manickam Tagore said.Invoking the first prime minister's opposition to the use of public funds for rebuilding the Somnath Temple, Tagore said, ""If Nehruji refused public funds even for Somnath — a symbol revered by millions — why would he propose spending taxpayer money on Babri? The claim collapses under basic logic and historical record.""""Rajnath ji ‘s statements aren’t about history. They’re about politics — rewriting the past to divide the present.The BJP’s strategy is simple: insult our founders, invent stories, fuel polarisation.

Nehru ji raised the question of reconstruction of the Somnath Temple... Sardar clarified that the Somnath Temple case was different; the public had donated Rs. 30 lakh there, a trust had been formed, and not even a single penny of government money was used.""""The Ram Mandir in Ayodhya has not been funded by government money. The entire cost has been borne by the people of this country,"" he added.","Defence Minister Rajnath Singh claims Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to build Babri Masjid using public funds.

Defence deals likely to dominate talks



Possible nuclear energy agreement



Discussions on additional S-400 units

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin said that that Moscow aims to ""elevate cooperation"" with India taking its partnership to a ""qualitatively new level,"" establishing substantive dialogue on economic issues.The Russian President's remarks come ahead of his two-day India visit from December 4-5 for the 23rd India-Russia Annual Summit at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Speaking at an investment forum in Moscow on Tuesday, Putin said the goal of multiple joint projects across energy, industry, space, agriculture and other sectors, is to elevate ties with India.""We aim to elevate cooperation with the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India to a qualitatively new level by strengthening its technological component. This is the objective of numerous joint projects in energy, industry, space, agriculture, and other sectors,"" Putin said.The Russian President said that Moscow has a ""substantive dialogue"" with Chinese President Xi Jinping on economic issues and hopes to continue the same with PM Modi during his upcoming visit.""We have established a substantive dialogue on economic issues with the President of the People's Republic of China, Mr.Xi Jinping. We will also discuss these topics in detail during the upcoming visit to India with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, including increasing imports of Indian goods to our market,"" he added.Earlier, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had said that discussions could include the sale of additional S-400 long-range air defence missiles.""Highly on the agenda and this could be discussed. Our military industry is working pretty well. Russian arms 36 % in Indian armed forces and hopefully will continue,"" Peskov said.He said that Russia also hopes to take forward talks on India potentially acquiring the Su-57 fifth-generation stealth fighter. ""SU-57 is the best plane in the world. SU57 will be on the agenda,"" he added.Peskov highlighted the depth of defence cooperation, including the BrahMos programme. ""As far as our cooperation in the defence industry goes, let's remember famous Brahmos missiles. It's not only just production or it's not only acts of buying or selling, it's exchange of high technologies, and it really paves the way for a bright future in this field of cooperation,"" he said.""We're developing quite, quite a variety of very complicated systems. And in this sense, of course, we have capabilities. We are ready to share this with our Indian friends, our experience,"" he added.Russian Sukhoi-30 jets form the bulk of India’s fighter fleet, and the Su-57 offer is expected to come up in this week’s talks, two officials familiar with the matter told Reuters. However, India has not yet taken a decision on the aircraft, the official added.Peskov further confirmed that there was the possibility of an agreement on Nuclear energy between India and Russia during the visit.""There will be an offer for a small reactor. Russia possesses important tech, small and flexible reactors. Russia has real experience in producing small reactors. We're exchanging mutual investments, joint investments and it makes this kind of cooperation even more valuable for our countries, in terms for securing future of this country,"" Peskov said.""We were deeply involved in creating a sector of peaceful nuclear energy in India, in Kudankulam, and so we were hoping for the continuation of this project,"" he added.India has no plans to scale back defence ties with Russia, even as its crude oil purchases fluctuate. Discussions on additional S-400 units are also likely, defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh indicated last week, according to Reuters.Analysts say recent US–Russia talks on the Ukraine conflict could make it easier for India to deepen engagement with Moscow, though the broader relationship faces strain.""A large part of the trading relationship was based on energy, which is now losing traction under the threat of sanctions from the United States,"" Harsh Pant of the Observer Research Foundation told Reuters. ""And at the end of the day, only defence remains, which continues to bind the two together,"" he added.","Vladimir Putin says Moscow aims to elevate cooperation with India.

NEW DELHI: The Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), which provides healthcare services to lakhs of government employees, pensioners and their families, is operating with a significant shortage of staff across its allopathic and AYUSH dispensaries, the Union Health Ministry informed the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.In a written reply, the government revealed that more than 2,000 posts in allopathic dispensaries and over 100 posts in AYUSH units remain vacant, raising concerns over service delivery in one of the country’s largest healthcare networks.According to the ministry, CGHS allopathic dispensaries have a sanctioned strength of 6,630 posts, but only 4,590 are currently filled, leaving 2,040 posts vacant. The situation is similar in AYUSH facilities, where 107 of the 425 sanctioned posts remain unfilled. The data shows gaps across all levels of staffing.In the crucial Group A category, which includes doctors, 402 allopathy posts and 33 AYUSH posts are lying vacant. Group B non-gazetted positions also show shortages, with 276 allopathic posts vacant. The most acute gaps are in Group C—the largest workforce segment comprising paramedical and support staff—where 1,362 allopathic posts and 74 AYUSH posts are unfilled.The government said that recruitment of doctors is carried out through the Union Public Service Commission’s Combined Medical Services Examination based on vacancies reported by CGHS. Recruitment for Group B and Group C positions is handled by the Staff Selection Commission. However, the reply did not indicate the timeframe within which the pending vacancies would be filled or whether special measures are being planned to speed up hiring.The disclosure comes at a time when CGHS dispensaries in major cities frequently struggle with long queues, limited manpower and rising patient load. The persistent vacancies, especially in frontline and paramedical roles, are expected to intensify pressure on the system unless addressed promptly. For thousands of beneficiaries dependent on CGHS for essential outpatient care and medicines, staffing shortages continue to translate into longer waits and uneven access to services.","Central Government Health Scheme operating with a significant shortage of staff.

CrPC cover for women can’t be invoked in Fema case: Delhi HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crpc-cover-for-women-cant-be-invoked-in-fema-case-delhi-hc/articleshow/125730860.cms,"Delhi high court

NEW DELHI: The protection enjoyed by a woman under Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) is not available in proceedings related to Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema), which is governed by civil law, Delhi high court has ruled.Justice Neena Bansal Krishna dismissed a writ petition filed by a 53-year-old Canadian citizen challenging ED summons issued under Fema Section 37 for recording of her statement, rejecting the contention that safeguards guaranteed to women under CrPC applied to such summons.The petitioner argued that she could not be compelled to appear at the ED office and her statement must be recorded at her residence. She cited CrPC Section 160(1), which prevents women from being required to appear at places other than their residence for investigation. However, the HC highlighted that Fema investigations were civil-administrative proceedings, not criminal inquiries, and therefore, the gender-based protection available under CrPC could not be invoked.“The PMLA and the Fema have distinct statutory frameworks and nature of proceedings. Section 50 PMLA confers criminal investigative powers on ED involving summons for inquiries related to money laundering, which is a scheduled offence under PMLA and involves criminal prosecution.In contrast, Section 37 Fema is primarily concerned with civil-administrative investigations of foreign exchange contraventions governed by a regulatory framework distinct from criminal law. Secondly, there is a difference in the scope of summons and procedural safeguards,” the court said.“Civil code contains no provision like Section 160 CrPC mandating the recording of the statement of a woman at her residence. The insistence of the petitioner for not appearing before the authority is, therefore, without any basis,” Justice Krishna observed.“Powers regarding discovery and production of evidence under Section 37 Fema are analogous to those under Section 131 Income Tax Act, which is governed by civil code and therefore, Section 160 CrPC would not be applicable,” HC added.","The protection enjoyed by a woman under Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) is not available in proceedings related to Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema), says Delhi high court.

NEW DELHI: The family feud over industrialist Sunjay Kapur's Rs 30,000-crore estate got messier on Monday after his mother Rani Kapur joined forces with his ex-wife Karisma Kapoor in questioning the veracity of his will.Rani submitted before Justice Jyoti Singh of Delhi high court that instead of grieving Sunjay's death after accidentally swallowing a bee while playing polo in the UK on June 12, his wife Priya did everything to take control of his assets, including allegedly ""massive concealment"".Her counsel claimed she was never informed about her son's will, pointing out that it was strange that the document does not even mention her despite Sunjay publicly acknowledging that he got everything from her.""He (Sunjay) would have at least mentioned in the will that he did not want to give anything to his mother,"" Rani's lawyer Vaibhav Gaggar said. ""There is not even a whisper about the mother in the will. She has no ownership in the company built by her husband, which was exclusively left to her.""According to the petition, Sunjay and Priya had a rocky marriage since May 2023, marked by constant fights. ""It is highly unlikely that Sunjay would make Priya the sole beneficiary of his personal estate,"" Rani's lawyer said, also pointing out that the deceased had ""a deep bond with and equal affection for all his children, his mother, and other members of the Kapur family"".Priya also stands accused of omitting assets belonging to the deceased in the list submitted to court, including paintings, bank balances, mutual funds, life insurance, rental income, and watches.Justice Singh will next hear the case on Dec 3. Sunjay Kapur's children with Karisma have already sought an interim injunction to restrain Priya from alienating them from their father's assets, while questioning the authenticity of the will.","Rani Kapur claims she was never informed about her son's will.

This means that out of the Rs 58,082 crore owed, about Rs 38,895 crore remains unpaid, outstanding principal and interest that banks have not been able to recover yet.The government also told the House that only two fugitive offenders have negotiated One-Time Settlements (OTS): Nitin and Chetan Sandesara with Indian Bank, and Sterling Global Oil Resources Pvt Ltd with the State Bank of India.In response to whether a policy is being drafted to prevent economic offenders from leaving the country, the government said that no such proposal is currently under consideration.","Fugitive economic offenders collectively owed more than Rs 58,082 crore to Indian public sector banks.

IITs bar from placement drive 20+ companies that rescinded offers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iits-bar-from-placement-drive-20-companies-that-rescinded-offers/articleshow/125706903.cms,"An IIT professor said the institutes have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by Centre under Viksit Bharat scheme

MUMBAI: Even as the placement season began across the premier IITs on Monday, more than 20 companies were banned from participating this year. These firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year, some even as late as June or July this year, at the time of joining. Since many IITs do not allow students with existing offers to sit for further interviews, such late withdrawals not only jeopardised career prospects but also affected students’ mental well-being, said officials. IITs, therefore, unanimously decided to ban these companies from the current placement cycle. IITs tried helping the concerned students despite the time lapse.The list of banned companies was finalised after these firms revoked offers at more than one IIT. Some of them are data analytics and software-based firms. They, however, are allowed to place students through off-campus process.An IIT professor involved in the placement process said the names of the companies were cross-verified by placement coordinators at 15 IITs recently. “We looked at their past records too. Some of these companies had a history of revoking offers and six to seven IITs had already banned them from participation.Offers have been revoked by some companies where some alumni are working. There were also a few companies that reduced salary packages offered in the letter. The placement cells are trying to speak to higher authorities in these companies,” said the professor.Speaking about such cancellations, a computer science graduate from IIT-Bombay’s batch of 2025, said he was hired by a trading platform last December and his joining date was June 1, 2025. “My offer was revoked on May 29. The company made me an offer of nearly Rs 30 lakh and I was more than happy to join. They revoked my offer just two days before I was supposed to join, but fortunately, I got a better offer through an alumnus in some time. Though IIT-Bombay extended help, I did not need it at that time,” said the graduate. He said some of his friends’ offers were revoked too, but a few of them landed other offers. “By June and July it becomes difficult for the institutes too to help with placements as phase-II of the process concludes by the end of the academic year,” he said.The professor added that the IITs this year have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by the Centre under the Viksit Bharat programme. “The job market is slow, but we are trying to reach out to many more companies and encourage start-ups incubated on prominent campuses to reach the best targets,” he said, adding that so far the placement season looks good.","Firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year.

On a crisp winter morning, when the sun struggles to cut through a grey, smoky haze, many of us glance at the air-quality index like a daily horoscope, the number that decides whether we mask up, skip a walk, or brace for another day of breathing toxic air. But what do those figures actually mean for our lungs? Why does 200 feel unbearable while 500 feels apocalyptic? And as smoke from stubble burning mixes with vehicular and industrial pollution , what is all that particulate matter really doing inside the body?Here is a look at the mechanics of the AQI, and what a pulmonologist wants you to know before the next toxic plume rolls in.For years, India’s air-quality data was buried in technical charts and numbers, leaving most people unsure of what the readings meant for the air they breathed. Without a clear, accessible system, public engagement with pollution remained limited.To change this, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) set out to create a national Air Quality Index (AQI) that could translate complicated measurements into simple, accessible categories. An expert group, bringing together doctors, air-quality scientists, academics, NGOs, state pollution boards, and technical inputs from IIT Kanpur, developed what eventually became India’s AQI.A draft was released in October 2014 for public and institutional feedback, and after detailed review, the national framework was finalised.The AQI is designed to tell people, at a glance, not just how polluted the air is, but what that level of pollution could mean for their health. It classifies air quality into six categories:. The index accounts for eight major pollutants with 24-hour standards and calculates individual sub-indices for each as long as there is data for at least three pollutants, one of them necessarily PM2.5 or PM10, an AQI can be computed. The highest (or “worst”) sub-index becomes the overall AQI number for that location.The AQI measures key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Among them, PM2.5 is considered the most harmful because its tiny particles can travel deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, leading to serious health risks. The World Health Organisation (WHO) advises keeping PM2.5 levels below 5 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) annually, and under 15 µg/m³ for 24 hours.The US AQI, like India’s, runs on a 0–500 scale, but with one key difference. Its highest category, “hazardous,” begins at 301 with no upper cap, so readings can go well beyond 500. The two countries also use different formulas to calculate their scores, which means the same pollution data can produce different AQI values. In short, the Indian and US scales don’t line up exactly and can’t be directly compared.Every winter, vast stretches of northern India, from Punjab and Haryana to neighbouring states, witness the burning of leftover crop stubble as farmers clear their fields for the next sowing season. This practice, known as crop residue burning (CRB), remains a persistent environmental challenge in India and many agricultural regions around the world.CRB is a major driver of fine particulate pollution, especially PM2.5, that engulfs Delhi and the wider NCR region each winter. These microscopic particles pose a heightened health threat, not only to residents but also to farmers living in and around the burn sites. Because PM2.5 particles are small enough to penetrate deep into the respiratory system, they can lodge along the delicate lining of the alveoli in the lungs.A growing body of scientific evidence links PM2.5 exposure to significant health risks. Short-term exposure can impair lung function and worsen conditions like asthma and heart disease. Over the long term, the dangers intensify; prolonged inhalation has been associated with chronic bronchitis, reduced lung capacity, and increased mortality linked to lung cancer and cardiovascular illnesses.Delhi has once again topped the charts as India’s most polluted city, according to a decade-long AQI assessment by Climate Trends covering 2015 to November 2025. The analysis shows that no major Indian city has reached safe air-quality levels at any point in the past ten years, underscoring the severity of the national pollution crisis.Delhi remains the worst-hit, followed by Noida, which recorded an alarming AQI of 515. Other heavily polluted regions include Cooch Behar (362), Kishanganj (351), and Kultali (332), reflecting how toxic air has spread far beyond the metros and deep into smaller districts. The data points to a nationwide public-health emergency, with the capital continuing to sit at the centre of India’s pollution burden.Dr Kuldeep Kumar Grover, head of critical care and pulmonology at CK Birla Hospital in Gurugram, says the body reacts almost immediately when pollution levels rise. Fine particles irritate and inflame the airways, leading to coughing, excess mucus, and reduced lung function, while the heart and blood vessels come under added strain due to oxidative stress, constricted vessels, and a heightened tendency for clotting.""The cardiovascular system also responds to pollution by inducing oxidative stress, blood vessel constriction, and an increased tendency toward blood clotting.""At an AQI of around 200, the body experiences noticeable but manageable stress; symptoms like throat irritation, headaches, and breathlessness are common, especially for vulnerable groups. But when levels reach 500, the exposure becomes overwhelming. Inflammation intensifies, asthma can worsen quickly, blood pressure may rise, and even healthy people may struggle with oxygen exchange. Sustained exposure at this severity can lead to acute respiratory or cardiac complications, Dr Grover adds.Surface pollution from stubble burning and urban sources exposes people to PM2.5, PM10 and carbon monoxide, the dominant winter pollutants. The tiniest of these, PM2.5, can slip past the body’s natural defences, lodge deep in the lungs, and even enter the bloodstream. Carrying toxic metals and reactive chemicals, these particles spark chronic inflammation and gradual tissue damage. Over time, doctors see faster loss of lung function, recurring bronchitis, worsening asthma, and higher risks of heart and vascular disease.""Long-term exposure also increases risks of lung cancer, preterm birth, and impaired cognitive development in children. The cumulative effect of this pollution is almost akin to the long-term effects of smoking in some highly polluted regions,"" Dr Grover said.Children, pregnant women, and older adults face greater risks as AQI levels climb because their bodies are more vulnerable to pollution-induced stress. Children breathe faster and have developing lungs, making AQI levels above 150 likely to trigger coughing, wheezing, and fatigue.Pregnant women, who already have reduced oxygen reserves, may experience breathlessness when pollution rises above 200, and prolonged exposure has been linked to complications such as ""low birth weight and preterm labour."" Older adults, especially those with heart or lung conditions, can develop chest tightness, irregular heartbeat, or worsening COPD even at AQI 150–200, said Dr Grover.On the other hand, for people with asthma or chronic bronchitis, polluted air intensifies existing inflammation.Irritants like PM2.5 and ozone narrow the airways, increase mucus, and heighten sensitivity to triggers, leading to more frequent wheezing, coughing, breathlessness, and greater reliance on rescue inhalers. High pollution days also increase the risk of asthma attacks, respiratory infections, and a faster decline in lung function.""Patients should follow their treatment plans closely, avoid outdoor activity at times of peak pollution, and use preventive medication as recommended by their clinician,"" Dr Grover said.On days when air quality plunges into the “very poor” or “severe” range, the most important strategy is reducing total exposure, said Dr Grover.Indoors, keeping windows shut, avoiding smoke or incense, and using a certified HEPA purifier can significantly lower pollutant levels. Outside, it's best to limit activity, especially exercise, which draws particles deeper into the lungs. Only well-fitted N95 or FFP2 masks offer real protection; cloth and surgical masks do little to block PM2.5.Supporting measures like staying hydrated, using nasal saline rinses, and closely monitoring symptoms help reduce irritation. People with chronic lung or heart conditions should keep medications handy and follow their action plans carefully. Avoiding peak pollution hours, typically early mornings and evenings, remains one of the simplest ways to cut exposure.As winter smog thickens and AQI levels swing from unhealthy to severe, the message from experts is clear: pollution is not just an environmental issue but a direct, measurable threat to health.From choosing the right mask to avoiding peak smog hours and protecting vulnerable groups, even small, consistent steps can significantly cut exposure. And while individual action offers only partial defence, experts say awareness is the first line of protection until long-term, systemic solutions begin to clear the air for good.","The AQI measures key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Its highest category, “hazardous,” begins at 301 with no upper cap, so readings can go well beyond 500.

As India plans a long-term presence in low-Earth orbit, what design or mission principles from the ISS would you keep, revise, or discard?

Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla ’s (Shux) 20-day mission to the International Space Station earlier this year gave India a rare, first-hand view into how the world’s most complex engineering project functions on an ordinary day—and how it copes when things are not ordinary at all. As India prepares for a sustained human presence in low-Earth orbit through the Bharatiya Antariksh Station, Shukla’s reflections offer a grounded account of what the ISS achieved, where it stumbled, and how India should shape its own long-term strategy.In this exclusive interview to TOI, Shux speaks about the moments that defined his time on the station, the value of international collaboration, and the design philosophy that India could adopt for missions in the coming decades.The International Space Station remains one of humanity’s most dazzling examples of what happens when engineering ambition meets international cooperation, and miraculously, everyone agrees on the same orbit. Conceived in an era when floppy disks were still in fashion and the internet sounded like a dial-up flute, the ISS was built to push the boundaries of science in microgravity, test systems essential for future deep-space missions, and serve as a beacon of peaceful collaboration between nations that otherwise rarely agree on anything terrestrial.Construction of this orbital leviathan began in 1998 and reached completion in 2011. To assemble it, humanity performed a kind of celestial Lego project that required more than 1,000 hours of spacewalks and more than 40 Space Shuttle flights. The result? The largest continuously inhabited laboratory off the planet, a structure the size of a football field hurtling around Earth at 28,000 km/h, completing a lap every 90 minutes.During my own mission aboard the ISS, the station felt exactly like the global village it was designed to be. We had 11 crew members representing six nationalities, a small floating model of the United Nations , minus the speeches and with better views. Over the course of our 20-day stay, we conducted more than 60 scientific experiments spanning biology, materials science, human physiology, and space technology. We also carried out STEM demonstrations that connected us with students across the world, sparking curiosity, answering wide-eyed questions, and hopefully inspiring the next generation of explorers, engineers, and dreamers.Looking back, those 20 days perfectly captured the essence of what the ISS set out to achieve. For a machine conceived with 1990s technology, when the most futuristic thing on Earth was a Nokia phone, to not only remain relevant but to continue fulfilling and expanding its mission objectives is extraordinary. The station does not just orbit Earth; it orbits the idea that cooperation, curiosity, and courage can build something remarkable, even 400 kilometres above our heads.Working with crew members from different nationalities reaffirmed something fundamental about space exploration: at its core, it is a profoundly collaborative human endeavour. Space does not care about passports, accents, or geopolitical boundaries. Up there, the only border you notice is the thin blue line of Earth’s atmosphere.During my training for this mission, I found myself hopping across continents more frequently than airline safety videos. From the meticulous engineers in Japan, to the precision-driven teams in Europe, to the seasoned experts in the United States, and the ever-innovative minds in India, each group brought its own culture, expertise, and philosophy to the table. It was like assembling a global orchestra where every instrument mattered, and the symphony was a successful human spaceflight.Before this mission, I knew conceptually that space operations required international coordination. But seeing it firsthand—the late-night calls across time zones, the joint simulations, the integrated training programmes, and the sheer number of people quietly working behind the scenes—made me appreciate the astonishing complexity of sending even one human to space. A single crewed mission represents thousands of hours of planning, countless technical discussions, and the collective will of teams who might never meet but still trust one another implicitly.Beyond accomplishing scientific and operational goals, this collaboration builds something equally important: relationships and trust among people from vastly different cultures and backgrounds. In space, camaraderie is not optional; it is oxygen for the mission. You quickly learn that no matter where someone comes from, if they work in human spaceflight, they speak a common language: space.As we continue advancing on our journey in human space exploration, it is vital that we hold on to this foundational principle. The power of collaboration is not just a sentiment; it is the engine that drives progress. Space has always transcended boundaries, and the work we do should honour that spirit. The only way humanity will reach farther into the cosmos is by going there together.The first module of the International Space Station, the Russian-built Zarya, appropriately named “Dawn”, launched in 1998, marking the beginning of humanity’s most ambitious construction project not on Earth. Over the next 13 years, we assembled this orbital behemoth piece by piece, like a cosmic IKEA kit, except the manual was 10,000 pages long and required spacewalks instead of Allen keys.One of the ISS’s greatest design triumphs was its modular architecture. This was not just clever; it was visionary. The modular approach meant components, scientific racks, power systems, and entire habitable modules could be added, upgraded, or even replaced long after launch. Several of the station’s capabilities today, from advanced biology labs to new solar arrays, were not on the drawing board in the 1990s. Yet the structure welcomed them gracefully, proving its resilience.Another stroke of genius was the strict standardisation of interfaces and protocols. Despite contributions from different space agencies—Nasa, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA, and CSA—each with its own engineering philosophy, the requirement was simple: any module joining the ISS had to integrate seamlessly with the command-and-control backbone. This ensured that a Japanese experiment rack, a European robotic arm, and an American airlock could all operate in harmony.Equally important was the flexibility for on-orbit maintenance and upgrades. Astronauts often replaced hardware, rerouted cables, installed new instruments, and even deployed new solar arrays. When you build for decades of use, you cannot predict every challenge, so the ISS needed enough adaptability to absorb surprises.That said, the ISS was not designed to be fully future-proof. Technology has moved fast in the last two decades, and modern ISS interiors sometimes look like an enthusiastic octopus let loose with a box of cables. It is high-functioning chaos.As we look ahead, this is the lesson we must carry forward: whatever we design today must be able to absorb the technology of tomorrow.As the ISS approaches its well-earned retirement after more than two decades in orbit, it leaves behind a legacy and a treasure trove of lessons. My time aboard crystallised one truth: before building a space station, you must begin with a sharply defined question—what is it for?Is it a research laboratory? A technology testbed? A stepping stone to the Moon? A commercial outpost? A training ground? The purpose shapes everything that follows.The ISS has also shown the power of collaboration. At a time when nations often disagree on Earth, the station has remained a counterexample, an engineering handshake orbiting above geopolitics. It is still the only structure where multiple countries can send astronauts, run experiments, and access an environment otherwise out of reach. India has been a proud beneficiary of this openness.But the ISS also teaches caution: mismatched priorities, slow adaptation to emerging technologies, and design decisions frozen in the 1990s reveal pitfalls to avoid.Going forward, the challenge is to distil the ISS story into a blueprint for the next chapter of human presence in space. Embedded in its cables and maintenance logs are lessons on what must be done, what must never be done again, and what must be done better. The ISS is not merely retiring; it is passing the torch.The philosophy of modularity has been one of the ISS’s greatest gifts to space engineering. In microgravity, “weight” loses its meaning, and you can launch components separately, even years apart, and assemble them like an orbital jigsaw. But modularity works only if you treat construction as a long-term strategy, a roadmap spanning decades.Flexibility is the other key lesson. Space teaches you quickly that no plan survives first contact with reality. The ISS construction phase was a masterclass in adapting to hardware mismatches, alignment quirks, and surprises delivered by orbital mechanics. The design must have elasticity to absorb new insights and evolving technologies.A station is not just modules; it is an ecosystem. The Earth-based infrastructure—mission control, simulators, life-support testbeds, logistics chains—matters as much as the hardware in orbit. Astronauts need operational flexibility too. They become builders, plumbers, electricians, scientists, and troubleshooters.Design follows objectives. Before drawing the first bolt pattern or finalising an airlock diameter, the mission’s purpose must be clear.As India prepares for the Bharatiya Antariksh Station, we are at a pivotal moment. The insights from decades of ISS operations—its triumphs, surprises, and even its cluttered cable aesthetics—are guiding our approach. We now have the opportunity to design a next-generation station informed by a quarter-century of real orbital experience.","Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla’s 20-day mission to the International Space Station earlier this year gave India a rare, first-hand view into how the world's most complex engineering project functions.

DGCA Plans New Rules For Power Banks On Flights After Fire Scare On IndiGo Plane

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has grounded an Air India aircraft and launched a detailed investigation after the airline reported that the aircraft had operated eight revenue sectors on an expired Airworthiness Review Certificate (ARC).According to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, quoted in the press note shared by ANI, ""Air India informed the regulator on 26 November 2025 that one of its aircraft had been inadvertently deployed for commercial flights despite the ARC having lapsed. The ARC is a mandatory annual certification that validates an aircraft’s continued compliance with airworthiness standards and its main Certificate of Airworthiness. ""In the press note, the ministry explained that the lapse occurred in the context of the ongoing merger of Vistara into Air India. As part of the transition, all 70 Vistara aircraft required renewed ARCs in 2024, with the DGCA assuming responsibility for issuing the certificates post-merger.

PM Modi’s ‘Drama Nahi, Delivery’ Message Sets Fiery Tone As Winter Session Begins Amid Tensions

NEW DELHI: New complex housing the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) will be called ‘Seva Teerth’, officials said on Tuesday.Earlier known as the ‘Executive Enclave’, the complex is now in its final stages of completion, marking a significant step in the Central Vista redevelopment.Officials described Seva Teerth as a workplace designed to reflect the spirit of service, a space “where national priorities take shape”. They said India’s public institutions were undergoing a “quiet but profound shift”, with governance moving from “satta (power) to seva (service)” and from authority to responsibility.“The change was not just administrative, but cultural and moral,” they added, as quoted by PTI.The enclave will house the PMO along with the offices of the Cabinet Secretariat, the National Security Council Secretariat and India House, which will serve as a venue for high-level talks with visiting dignitaries.As part of this broader shift in governance philosophy, Raj Bhawans—the official residences of state governors—are being renamed ‘Lok Bhawans’.The Central Secretariat, too, is now known as Kartavya Bhavan.Officials said that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi , spaces of governance have been reshaped to reflect ‘kartavya’ (duty) and transparency. “Every name, every building and every symbol now points to a simple idea. Government exists to serve,” they said.Several landmarks have already been renamed in recent years. Rajpath became Kartavya Path, while the prime minister’s official residence was renamed Lok Kalyan Marg in 2016, a name intended to convey welfare rather than exclusivity.“These changes mark a deeper ideological transition. Indian democracy is choosing responsibility over power and service over status,” officials said. “A shift in names is also a shift in mindset. Today, they speak the language of seva, kartavya and citizen-first governance,” they added.","New complex housing the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) will be called ‘Seva Teerth’, officials said on Tuesday.

"Asia’s arms race shift: India climbs, China slides on PLA graft charges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sipri-2024-arms-report-india-and-china-arms-race-xi-jinping-pla-purge/articleshow/125696987.cms,"TL;DR: Driving the news

India’s steady climb

Why it matters

China’s disrupted march

Xi's purge table

Combined revenues fell by 10% to $88.3 billion

Between the lines

The big picture: Asia’s arms balance shifts

What’s next

The bottom line

Global arms revenues surged to an all-time high of $679 billion in 2024, up 5.9% in real terms, according to the latest SIPRI Top 100 ranking. While Europe and the US drove most of the increase, Asia and Oceania stood out as the only region to post a decline—largely due to a dramatic drop in Chinese arms company revenues, the SIPRI report said.India, though still far from being a global arms giant, posted a quiet but steady 8.2% increase in combined revenues across its three Top 100 companies. In sharp contrast, Chinese arms revenues fell 10%, a setback tied to a wave of high-profile corruption scandals and major contract delays that rattled Beijing's defense establishment.India’s three Top 100 firms-Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders-together pulled in $7.5 billion in arms revenue in 2024, up from $6.9 billion in 2023.BEL led the growth with a 24% revenue jump, hitting $2.47 billion. The boost came from domestic orders, particularly in radar systems and electronic warfare equipment, both prioritized in India’s military modernization drive.HAL, India’s top-ranked defense firm at rank 44 globally, earned $3.81 billion, a marginal 0.3% decrease from the previous year. The company faced delivery lags, but remained a cornerstone supplier to the Indian Air Force and Navy.Mazagon Dock, focused on naval shipbuilding, recorded $1.23 billion in arms revenue, with a 9.8% year-on-year increase, thanks to continued submarine and destroyer production.India is pressing ahead with its “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) campaign in defense production. While not grabbing global headlines, its incremental gains highlight an emerging industrial base that could challenge traditional suppliers over time.“The combined arms revenues of the three Indian companies in the Top 100 increased by 8.2 per cent to $7.5 billion on the back of domestic orders,” the SIPRI report said.The picture in China couldn’t be more different. For the first time in years, China’s eight arms producers in the SIPRI Top 100-previously hailed as key enablers of President Xi Jinping’s military modernization push-lost major ground.The steepest fall came from NORINCO, China’s primary land systems manufacturer, which saw its revenue plunge 31% due to corruption scandals and leadership upheaval.CASC, China’s aerospace and missile systems leader, dropped 16% following delays in military satellite programs and the removal of its president amid graft allegations.Even AVIC, the country’s biggest defense company, slipped 1.3%, hampered by delays in aircraft deliveries.“A host of corruption allegations in Chinese arms procurement led to major arms contracts being postponed or cancelled in 2024,” said Nan Tian, director of the SIPRI military expenditure and arms production programme.China’s top-down, state-controlled defense sector may be big-but its opacity leaves it vulnerable to internal shocks. Political purges tied to Xi’s sweeping anti-corruption campaign disrupted procurement and leadership pipelines across several top defense firms.Only two of China’s eight arms producers recorded revenue growth-CSSC, the shipbuilding powerhouse, was one, rising 8.7%, aligned with China’s naval buildup in the South China Sea.India’s slow, state-driven growth might lack flash, but it also avoids the internal disarray seen in Beijing. Its procurement is transparent, aligned to strategic plans, and largely free of major political scandal.China, meanwhile, is still far ahead in sheer scale but vulnerable to top-level instability.While China dragged down the region’s total, other Asian powers picked up slack:South Korean arms producers rose 31% to $14.1 billion, driven by booming exports.Japan posted the largest jump in Asia: a 40% increase in arms revenues across five firms, reaching $13.3 billion, reflecting Tokyo’s shift toward proactive defense spending amid regional tensions.US firms remain the backbone of the global arms industry. The 39 American companies in the Top 100 generated $334 billion in arms revenues in 2024, a 3.8 per cent increase that leaves them with just under half of global Top 100 sales. Lockheed Martin alone booked $64.7 billion, while RTX, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics each sat comfortably above $30 billion.Yet the American giant is struggling to turn money into timely capability. Programmes such as the F-35 fighter, the Columbia-class nuclear submarine and the Sentinel ICBM are all running late and over budget. Lockheed’s F-35 deliveries in 2024 were delayed by an average of 238 days per aircraft, and the programme’s projected sustainment costs have ballooned towards $1.6 trillion over its life. Northrop’s Sentinel programme has breached US cost-growth thresholds by around 80 per cent versus its original estimate.SIPRI’s Xiao Liang warns that “The delays and rising costs will inevitably impact US military planning and military spending… This could have knock-on effects on the US government’s efforts to cut excessive military spending and improve budget efficiency.” In plain terms, even as the US spends more, it risks getting less capability per dollar.European producers surged by 13%, reaching $151 billion, as countries rearm in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine.Russia’s corporate footprint in the SIPRI Top 100 remains surprisingly small—just two entities, Rostec and United Shipbuilding Corporation—but their combined arms revenues jumped 23 per cent in 2024 to an estimated $31.2 billion. Domestic demand linked to the Ukraine war more than offset shrinking exports. Russian plants have ramped up output of artillery shells, missiles and armoured vehicles; SIPRI cites reports of 1.3 million 152-mm shells produced in 2024, a more than fivefold increase over 2022.Where Russia is constrained, the Middle East is expanding. For the first time, nine companies from the region appear in the Top 100, with combined arms revenues of $31.0 billion, up 14 per cent where comparable data exist. Israeli firms alone generated $16.2 billion, a 16 per cent increase, fuelled both by the Gaza war and strong demand for uncrewed systems and missile defence worldwide.For India:Expect a continued push for domestic procurement and local manufacturing under the Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP).India may look to expand exports, especially to Africa and Southeast Asia, but lacks the global competitiveness of Korean or Israeli systems.For China:Beijing still accounts for around 13 per cent of total Top 100 arms revenues, and its shipyards and missile producers have been central to the rapid expansion of the PLA Navy and rocket forces over the past decade.But the 2024 rankings hint at a temporary pause or re-ordering in its modernisation drive just as tensions over Taiwan and in the South China Sea remain high.Recovery will depend on restoring procurement integrity, managing talent loss, and containing political fallout.For Asia:The regional arms race is far from over.The pivot from importing to building continues—but success will depend on supply chain resilience, governance, and geopolitical alignment.India is climbing slowly, but surely-fueled by trust in institutions, steady demand, and political will.China, long considered an unstoppable defense juggernaut, now faces turbulence not from outside threats, but from within.In the evolving landscape of Asian defense, discipline may matter more than dominance. And for now, India is playing the long game.","India posted a quiet but steady 8.2% increase in combined revenues across its three Top 100 companies.

KOLKATA: Even if a candidate under the reserved category scored higher than the cut-off marks and was upgraded to general category, s/he would continue to enjoy benefits of the former category, Calcutta high court held Tuesday.The directive came after an SSC candidate, who made it to the first list of the 2025 SLST exam, moved high court to restore her SC status even if she was upgraded to general category.SSC senior counsel Kalyan Bandyopadhyay sought HC’s permission to upgrade the candidate to the general category contending that another SC candidate with lower marks would miss the opportunity of being considered if the petitioner wanted to restore her status. Bandyopadhyay argued that the idea of reservation was meant for the welfare of a community and not for an individual.Justice Amrita Sinha, however, noted that the petitioner had marked herself as a reserved category candidate while filling the form and had submitted Rs 200, a fee meant for that category. The judge referred to her Nov 27 order, in which the court had held that once a candidate’s category was final, authorities could not “change it suo motu”.","SSC senior counsel Kalyan Bandyopadhyay sought HC’s permission to upgrade the candidate to the general category.

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has directed the Uttar Pradesh govt to ensure that anyone who converts to Christianity automatically forfeits all Scheduled Caste benefits, failing which it would be construed as a “fraud on the Constitution and contrary to the ethos of reservation policies”.Justice Praveen Kumar Giri’s Nov 21 order cites Paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, specifying that nobody other than a Hindu, Sikh or Buddhist can be deemed a member of an Scheduled Caste community.The court directed the principal secretary of the minorities welfare department to take appropriate steps to ensure that the distinction between minority and SC status was strictly enforced.The court said retention of SC status after conversion would amount to fraudulently claiming benefits since there is no caste system in Christianity.It fixed a timeline of four months for all district magistrates to act in accordance with the law to identify and prevent such occurrences.Justice Giri passed the order while dismissing a plea filed by a man accused of “mocking Hindu deities” and promoting enmity.The appellant, Jitendra Sahani, had petitioned the court to quash the charge sheet in the case on the ground that he had sought permission from the authorities to “preach the words of Jesus Christ on my land”.Justice Giri noted that Sahani mentioned his religion as “Hindu” in his affidavit, although he had converted to Christianity.It transpired that the appellant was from the SC community before his conversion.A witness in the case alleged that Sahani ridiculed the Hindu faith by claiming it offered no respect due to caste hierarchies, whereas embracing Christianity would lead to “jobs, business growth and financial benefits from the missionaries”.The court mentioned a recent Supreme Court judgment – C Selvarani Vs special secretary-cum-district collector 2024 – in which the bench held that a person ceases to belong to a particular caste after converting to Christianity.",Allahabad high court orders that anyone who converts to Christianity automatically forfeits all Scheduled Caste benefits.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: What India’s metros are breathing may have a link with rising acute respiratory illness (ARI) cases hospitals are logging. There were 2 lakh ARI cases in Delhi during 2022-24, with thousands needing hospitalisation — a surge the health ministry Tuesday linked to rising air pollution, while noting that the causal pathways remain complex.Responding to a question by Dr Vikramjit Singh Sahney in RS, junior health minister Prataprao Jadhav said polluted air is a “triggering factor” for respiratory diseases, and worsening air quality in urban centres is being closely monitored through an expanding national surveillance system.India’s metro hospitals have recorded over 2 lakh acute respiratory illness (ARI) cases in Delhi alone between 2022 and 2024, with thousands requiring admission each year — a surge the Ministry of Health on Tuesday linked to rising air pollution, while noting that the causal pathways remain complex. Responding to a question by Dr Vikramjit Singh Sahney in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for health Prataprao Jadhav said polluted air is a “triggering factor” for respiratory diseases, and worsening air quality in urban centres is being closely monitored through an expanding national surveillance system.Govt data shows that Delhi’s six central hospitals together reported 67,054 ARI emergency cases in 2022, 69,293 in 2023, and 68,411 in 2024, with admissions rising from 9,878 to 10,819 over the same period.Similar spikes were seen in Chennai and Mumbai, where thousands sought emergency care for breathing difficulties during severe pollution episodes. According to the Health Ministry, the impact of polluted air is shaped by multiple factors — including food habits, occupation, socio-economic conditions, immunity and medical history — making some people far more vulnerable than others.To capture these patterns in real time, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) now operates over 230 sentinel surveillance sites across 30 States and UTs. Digital ARI surveillance was also launched in August 2023 through the Integrated Health Information Portal.Adding to the evidence, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recently completed a multi-site study across five hospitals involving 33,213 ER patients with respiratory symptoms. The study found that as pollution levels rose, emergency visits for respiratory distress increased. However, the Ministry stressed that the study cannot formally prove causation, even though the association is strong and consistent with global findings.","India’s metro hospitals have recorded over 2 lakh acute respiratory illness (ARI) cases in Delhi alone between 2022 and 2024.

But EC, through senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Maninder Singh, informed the bench that as of Nov 30, over 98% enumeration forms have been distributed and over 81% have been digitised.Dwivedi said of total 5.5 lakh govt employees, Kerala govt has allotted 25,468 govt servants as BLOs for SIR exercise and another 1.76 lakh personnel for smooth conduct of local bodies elections. Since the two sets of personnel have been assigned different kinds of work and there is no overlap, neither SIR nor local bodies elections would get impacted, he said.Kerala SEC, which is conducting the local bodies elections, also informed the bench that there had been no hiccups in the ongoing process and that on conclusion of elections on Dec 13, the personnel assigned for the purpose will be free to resume their official duties.Singh said since EC and SEC are experiencing no problem in conducting SIR and local bodies polls simultaneously, Kerala govt should not have any problem either. However, advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for a politician petitioner, said political workers cannot visit constituencies because of the local bodies elections.","Kerala govt had sought deferment of SIR in the state till Dec 21.

NEW DELHI: Opposition has expressed glee that it “forced” the governing BJP to accept its demand for a discussion on SIR in Parliament, amid relief that the decision has averted the washout of another session, a prospect that was set to test the unity of INDIA bloc given the murmurs against a blockade.Congress whip Manickam Tagore sounded a triumphant note, saying, “INDIA wins. Arrogance finally bows to the unity of 240 & 100 MPs...” But beneath the claim of victory was a feeling of ease as opposition MPs were worried that a prolonged deadlock, even if forced by “govt intransigence”, would cost them floor time to take up the cause of their constituents.The meeting of opposition representatives on Monday saw some of these concerns being raised by smaller parties, while at least one big party made ambivalent remarks over blockade of proceedings — a reason why opposition decided to protest for two days and take stock of the situation again on Wednesday.RSP MP NK Premachandran said it was good that the deadlock had been resolved but added that govt could have done this much earlier. “Better late than never,” he remarked.The two-day discussion will now see regional parties like Samajwadi Party, DMK, Trinamool Congress, apart from Congress, lead the charge against SIR and, it is asserted, expose govt and Election Commission over the revision of poll rolls that they allege is “exclusionary”.The difference among regional parties is that while DMK, CPM & TMC govern their states, SP is in opposition in UP, though it did well in Lok Sabha polls, besting the governing BJP, and is now worried that deletion of voters would target its support base. That means attention would be more on Akhilesh Yadav, who leads a large contingent of 37 MPs and is expected to mount the offensive.Sparks are set to fly as BJP and allies would use their recent Bihar election sweep to debunk opposition’s allegations against SIR, focussing on “Vote Adhikar Yatra” taken out by Rahul Gandhi along with RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav. In that sense, it would be interesting to see if RJD is able to make a case against SIR post-polls.","Congress whip Manickam Tagore sounded a triumphant note, saying, “INDIA wins.

BJP bags 83% of Rs 915cr routed via Tata Group-controlled trust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-bags-83-of-rs-915cr-routed-via-tata-group-controlled-trust/articleshow/125728589.cms,"NEW DELHI: Almost 83% of the total Rs 915 crore political donations routed through the Tata group-controlled Progressive Electoral Trust (PET) in 2024-25 went to BJP, while Congress’ share was a mere 8.4%.A perusal of the contribution reports of various electoral trusts (ET) for 2024-25, now available on the Election Commission website, indicates that the scrapping of electoral bonds by the Supreme Court in Feb 2024 may not have totally dried up the coffers of BJP. The party in office received Rs 757.6 crore from PET, Rs 150 crore from New Democratic ET, over Rs 30.1 crore from Harmony ET, Rs 21 crore from Triumph ET, Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET and Rs 7.75 lakh from Einzigartig ET. This adds up to nearly Rs 959 crore.PET, which receives political donations from various Tata group companies and disburses them in Lok Sabha election year, had passed on a total Rs 454 crore to three parties in 2018-19, of which 75% or Rs 356 crore went to BJP, Rs 55.6 crore to the Congress and Rs 43 crore to Trinamool Congress.Since the 2024-25 contribution report of Prudent Electoral Trust, through which the lion’s share of political donations is routed with BJP being the biggest beneficiary, is not uploaded on EC website, its disbursals to the governing party cannot be assessed.BJP received Rs 856.4 crore via trusts, of which Rs 724 crore came from Prudent, and Rs 1,685 cr from bonds in 23-24.Congress received Rs 77.3 crore from PET in 2024-25, Rs 5 crore from New Democratic ET and Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET. Prudent contributed Rs 216.33 crore to Congress and A B General ET, Rs 15 crore, as per contribution report filed by Congress for 2024-25. Thus, the grand old party received over Rs 313 crore of its total 517 crore contributions in 2024-25 through the trust route.PET also disbursed donations worth Rs 10 crore each to Trinamool, YSR Congress Party, Shiv Sena, Biju Janata Dal, Bharat Rashtra Samithi, JDU, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and LJP-Ram Vilas.Interestingly, Congress contributions in 2024-25 fall way short of the Rs 828 crore it had received via bonds in 2023-24, but are higher than its Rs 171-crore bond income in 2022-23, a non-general election year. Similarly, TMC’s Rs 184.5 crore receipts in 2024-25, of which Rs 153.5 crore were through trusts, are no match for its Rs 612 crore receipts via bonds in 2023-24. BJD, which received Rs 245.5 crore in bonds in 2023-24, received Rs 60 crore in donations, including Rs 35 crore via trusts, in 2024-25.

Jan Pragati ET disbursed Rs 1 crore to Shiv Sena.","Almost 83% of the total Rs 915 crore political donations routed through the Tata group-controlled Progressive Electoral Trust (PET) in 2024-25 went to BJP, while Congress’ share was a mere 8.4%. The party in office received Rs 757.6 crore from PET, Rs 150 crore from New Democratic ET, over Rs 30.1 crore from Harmony ET, Rs 21 crore from Triumph ET and Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125728593,imgsize-49276,width-400,resizemode-4/bjp-bags-83-of-915cr-routed-via-tata-group-controlled-trust.jpg"
"Illegal migrants have no legal rights, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/illegal-migrants-have-no-legal-rights-says-sc/articleshow/125728314.cms,"India’s poor have priority over illegal migrants: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Tuesday said intruders and illegal immigrants have no legal right and hoped every citizen is aware of this problem in northeastern and eastern states, amplifying a concern that had prompted SC in 2005 to observe that Assam faced “external aggression and internal disturbance” due to influx of Bangladeshi migrants.Dealing with a habeas corpus plea on whereabouts of five Rohingya illegal immigrants untraceable after their detention, a plea strongly opposed by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi took exception to petitioner Rita Manchanda’s counsel referring to Rohingyas as “refugees”.The CJI said the apex court was adopting a humane approach towards them. “Once these illegal migrants are in India, they claim right to food and shelter and help for their children. We have many poor people in the country. They have a right over the country’s resources, not the illegal migrants. True, the illegal migrants cannot be subjected to custodial torture,” the CJI said.SC’s remark came amid growing demand from certain quarters to recognise Rohingyas — Muslims based in the Rakhine province of Myanmar who are considered by the junta there to be Bengali intruders and not Myanmarese citizens — as refugees.There have been instances of Rohingyas trickling into West Bengal from Bangladesh where they have been living after escaping Myanmar.Mehta said in the guise of a habeas corpus petition, the petitioner seeks to know the details of process followed for deportation of Rohingya, the talks India had with countries on this issue, and disclosure of the contents of files on this issue. The bench adjourned the hearing to Dec 16, when other matters relating to Rohingya illegal migrants would be taken up.In its 2005 judgment in the Sarbananda Sonowal case, SC had said, “There can be no manner of doubt that the state of Assam is facing ‘external aggression and internal disturbance’ on account of large-scale illegal migration of Bangladeshi nationals. It, therefore, becomes the duty of the Union of India to take all measures for protection of the state of Assam from such external aggression and internal disturbance as enjoined in Article 355 of the Constitution. ”On May 8, a bench of Justices Kant, Dipankar Datta and N Kotiswar Singh had refused to stay purported deportation of illegal Rohingya immigrants from Delhi brushing aside fervent pleas from advocates Colin Gonsalves and Prashant Bhushan who claimed that these immigrants face genocide in Myanmar and have a right to stay in India.The bench had said the right to reside anywhere in India is available only to Indian citizens and foreigners would be dealt with in accordance with the Foreigners Act.","The CJI said the apex court was adopting a humane approach towards them.

Sanchar Saathi App Optional Says Centre Amid Fierce Pegasus-Like Snooping Charges and Privacy Debate

Sanchar Saathi order is for phone makers, not users: Govt

Attempt to snoop on citizens, says Cong

Global mobile giants concerned over move

NEW DELHI: A day after a furore erupted over its decision to mandate pre-loading of state-run Sanchar Saathi app on all new smartphones, govt Tuesday said users are free to delete the application if they do not want to have it on their devices.Amidst concerns over violation of user privacy, communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia emphasised that the fears were unfounded and added that the app was to protect the users from cyber frauds.Scindia asserted that there is no chance of snooping or call monitoring through the app. “It is our responsibility to make this app reach everyone. If you want to delete it, delete it. If you don't want to use it, don't register it. If you register it, it will remain active. If you don't register it, it will be inactive,” he told reporters outside Parliament.Communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia Tuesday said mobile users were free to delete Sanchar Saathi app if they wished. However, the department of telecom’s Nov 21 order mandates the pre-installation of the app on phones under the Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Rules, 2024, and its further amendments.Not doing this will lead to action under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, 2024 (as amended).Also, the govt order had instructed manufacturers to “ensure that the pre-installed Sanchar Saathi application is readily visible and accessible … and that its functionalities are not disabled or restricted”.However, govt sources said the phrase is a direction to manufacturers, not a restriction on users.“It simply means manufacturers must not hide, cripple or pre-install a non-functional version of the app and later claim compliance. Nowhere it has been mentioned in the above clause that the Sanchar Saathi app cannot be uninstalled by the end user. It is up to the citizen if he wants to enable and register Sanchar Saathi or wants to uninstall it. Users remain free to uninstall or delete Sanchar Saathi if they do not wish to use it, as clearly clarified by the govt,” the govt sources said.The move has already seen critics find a parallel to a similar mandate issued by the Russian govt in Aug, requiring pre-installation of state-backed messaging app, MAX.The Union communications minister said there have been more than 1.5 crore downloads of the Sanchar Saathi app, over 2.7 crore fraudulent mobile connections have been disconnected, and around 20 lakh stolen phones have been traced.Congress called the directive on installation of Sanchar Saathi app in phones as another attempt by BJP to snoop on citizens, with party president Mallikarjun Kharge citing Modi govt’s “record” of “Pegasus snooping” when it “hacked” the telephones of opposition leaders, judges, journalists and even Union ministers. Kharge said, “Why does the Govt want to know what citizens talk about with their family and friends?” Demanding a rollback , AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said, “Big Brother cannot watch us. This DoT directive is beyond unconstitutional.”The govt’s diktat to mobile phone makers to mandatorily pre-install the Sanchar Saathi app has raised alarm bells among top global players such as Apple, Samsung and Google. While not officially commenting on the matter, the companies are looking to take up the matter with govt representatives directly, while also raising it through industry body ICEA.“This is a violation of user privacy and also makes the devices susceptible on the cyber security front. We are concerned about this, and will take it up,” said an executive at one of the companies","Communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said mobile users were free to delete Sanchar Saathi app if they wished.

Centre Signals Willingness to Discuss SIR, Asks Opposition Not to Set Timeline

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha on Tuesday returned to Lok Sabha the Manipur GST bill, which replaces an ordinance to implem-ent GST reforms in the state, with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman asserting that the bill will benefit people and businesses.She also hit out at the opposition. “Throughout 2024, we saw the opposition shedding crocodile tears about Manipur for everything. They raised issues, they voiced their concerns, and shed crocodile tears. I have seen it earlier as well — when we brought the bill for Manipur’s budget, the opposition did not participate in the debate. Even at that time, they didn’t think about the welfare of the people of Manipur,” the finance minister said.As the discussion on the bill was initiated, opposition parties staged a walkout over the govt not providing a timeline for a discussion on SIR. The treasury benches insisted on having first a scheduled discussion on 150 years of Vande Mataram after which a discussion on “electoral reforms” could be taken up.“Even today, when we are trying to convert an ordinance into a regular bill and get it passed here to become an Act, the opposition is not here to participate,” she said while replying to the discussion in the upper House, a day after the bill was cleared by Lok Sabha. “So, all the grievances that they voice about Manipur, accusing the PM and the home minister, is all just drama. I am ashamed and sorry to say this.

Navy Chief Confirms India’S Third Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine Soon

NEW DELHI: India will early next year add some sharp teeth to its sea-based leg of the nuclear triad by commissioning its third nuclear-powered submarine, which is larger than the first two and capable of carrying more long-range nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.The third such submarine, called SSBN in naval parlance, is in “the final stages of trials and will be commissioned soon” as INS Aridhaman, Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said on Tuesday.Sources, in turn, said the fourth SSBN (codenamed S-4*), which will also have a displacement of 7,000-tonne like INS Aridhaman, is likely to be commissioned in 2027. The first two, INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, both with a 6,000-tonne displacement, became fully operational in 2018 and 2024, respectively.Parallelly, India will also get a nuclear-powered attack submarine (called SSN), armed with conventional or non-nuclear weapons for long-range hunting-killing missions, on a 10-year lease from Russia by 2027-28.The delivery of this advanced Akula-class SSN, which will be commissioned as INS Chakra-3, was to take place much earlier under the $3 billion deal with Russia in March 2019 but has been delayed due to the ongoing Ukraine war, as reported by TOI earlier.Both SSBNs and SSNs, which can stay underwater for months on end, are crucial for India’s credible strategic deterrence against the collusive and fused China-Pakistan threat, which is only going to further expand in the coming years.While SSBNs are meant for retaliatory nuclear strikes in line with India’s “no first-use” policy, SSNs are designed for conventional warfare by quietly gathering intelligence, tracking and destroying enemy targets at extended ranges.India’s first two nuclear triad legs are the land-based Agni series of ballistic missiles and fighters like Sukhoi-30MKI, Mirage-2000, Jaguar and Rafale capable of delivering nuclear gravity bombs. SSBNs, however, are considered the most secure, survivable and potent platforms for retaliatory nuclear strikes, which in turn can deter an adversary from launching a first strike.Admiral Tripathi, on his part, said India’s own project to build two SSNs is “proceedings as per plans” after being cleared by the PM-led cabinet committee on security for Rs 40,000 crore in Oct 2024.The first of these two 9,800-tonne SSNs, each with a 190 MW pressurised light-water reactor, will be ready for induction by 2036-37, followed by the second one a couple of years later, as was earlier reported by TOI.On the SSBN front, INS Aridhaman will be capable of carrying double the number of K-4 ballistic missiles, which have a strike range of 3,500-km, as compared to INS Arighaat. INS Arihant is armed only with 750-km range K-15 missiles.The K-4 missile is going to be soon tested for the second time from INS Arighaat after the first test in Nov last year did not meet all the laid down parameters. There are also K-5 and K-6 missiles, with strike ranges of 5,000 to 6,000-km, on the anvil.India’s existing SSBNs are less than half the size of the ones with the US, China and Russia. China is rapidly expanding its existing fleet of six Jin-class SSBNs, with 10,000-km range JL-3 missiles, and six SSNs. The US, in turn, has 14 Ohio-class SSBNs and 53 SSNs.India also has the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones.","The third such submarine, called SSBN in naval parlance, is in “the final stages of trials and will be commissioned soon’ as INS Aridhaman.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality deteriorated sharply Tuesday evening, with the overall AQI climbing to 372, again edging close to the ‘severe’ category. More than 15 locations have already crossed that mark.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the city’s 24-hour average AQI at 4 pm stood at 372, rising from 304 on Monday and 279 on Sunday.Out of 39 monitoring stations, 16 recorded readings above 400 — a level known to seriously impact health. Stations in the ‘severe’ category included Burari, Anand Vihar, Mundka, Bawana, Vivek Vihar, Rohini, Sonia Vihar, Ashok Vihar and Punjabi Bagh.The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the city’s AQI is expected to remain in the ‘very poor’ range over the next few days, with mist or haze likely during the night.Weather officials said surface winds are likely to blow from the southwest at calm to light speeds, picking up slightly in the afternoon. Wind speed is expected to rise to about 10 kmph from the north during the evening and night.Data showed the transport sector was the highest local contributor to Delhi’s pollution on Tuesday at 18.4 per cent. This was followed by peripheral industries at 9.2 per cent and emissions from neighbouring cities including Noida (8.2 per cent), Ghaziabad (4.6 per cent), Baghpat (6.2 per cent), Panipat (3.3 per cent) and Gurugram (2.9 per cent).

NEW DELHI: A ping on his mobile phone reminds Sakir Khan that an EMI of Rs 21,730 for his car is due on Dec 5.In Jan, the Khans of Sohna's Jaffarpur village brought home a brand-new Maruti Ertiga after registering it as a cab. They hoped the MUV would be a dependable source of income and help bring financial stability.But as the year draws to a close, the vehicle lies in a junkyard on the premises of Maurice Nagar Police Station, reduced to a charred shell in the Nov 10 blast near Red Fort that claimed 15 lives and injured 28 people.For Sakir, discharged from hospital after fighting for his life, the struggle for survival has only begun. The compensation announced by Delhi govt is nowhere in sight, and even accessing the scrap of his vehicle - needed to initiate insurance claims - is proving to be an ordeal.After weeks of running from police stations to offices of sub-divisional magistrates, Sakir and several others like him have now hired lawyers. All they want is what was promised: damages and a means to resume their livelihood.""The blast changed my life forever. For three weeks, I have not been able to earn anything. I have EMIs to pay, my children's school fees are pending and I need money for my parents' treatment,"" said Sakir, adding that he borrowed Rs 6,000 to engage a lawyer.""Other cabbies are also approaching lawyers just to get the insurance process started.""Shanawaz Khan, another survivor, suffered severe injuries that still limit his mobility. His cab was destroyed, too. Without govt relief or insurance clearance, his family is sinking under a mountain of expenses. ""I don't know how to feed my family. My cab is gone. We are running from pillar to post but no one is helping us out. I went to the SDM's office and to three police stations but couldn't get the insurance process initiated. Compensation feels like a distant dream,"" he said.With EMIs mounting, savings exhausted and no clarity from govt or investigators, cabbies like Sakir and Shanawaz said the blast inflicted ""more financial damage than physical injuries"".Many others recounted similar frustrating experiences - standing in the same long queues, asking the same queries over and over again, and facing the same confusion about whether the documentation they have submitted is being processed.Rakesh Kumar, a lawyer at Tis Hazari who is representing multiple survivors of the blast, said he will move an application before Patiala House Court seeking permission to access the vehicles. ""Our first objective is to get the scrap released so that we can initiate insurance claims. Without that, these families can't take the first step to recover financially,"" he said.Delhi govt officials, though, said the delay was not on their part, adding that all required paperwork for disbursal of compensation had been completed. ""We have processed everything at our end and have been following up with other agencies. But until the National Investigation Agency (NIA) confirms that the survivors are not linked to the blast accused, compensation cannot be released,"" an official said, requesting anonymity.For the survivors, though, this explanation offers little comfort. Many said even basic tasks like photographing their damaged vehicles to claim insurance is proving to be an ordeal because the vehicles are inside the Maurice Nagar Police Station complex and access was initially restricted.Delhi Police, however, said it has already addressed the issue. ""The matter came to our notice, and we allowed them to take photos and videos. Some have already done so,"" said an officer.Joginder Kumar, 39, a cab driver from Nand Nagari, bought a new Swift Dzire in July to support his family of five. His EMI of Rs 19,000 is due on Dec 10. The day after his last instalment was deducted, the car was wrecked in the blast.""I went from one thana to another to find my cab. I couldn't. I don't know how to initiate the insurance claim. I have lost hope about the compensation, too,"" Joginder said. He was 10m from the car that blew up, sustaining burns and multiple injuries to his head, face, shoulders and arms.""Insurance firms want a copy of the FIR and a video of my car. I can't get either from the kotwali. They keep sending me from one place to another. Officers claiming to be from NIA took details of my Aadhaar card and bank account on Nov 16, but nothing has moved since,"" he added.Sameer Khan, 21, who sustained severe burn injuries and lost his family's autorickshaw, said, ""My brother has rented a rickshaw so that we can survive. All our details were taken at the hospital when the compensation was announced.

'Don’t need anything for myself': 1972 rape survivor ‘Mathura’ seeks work for her sons; Chandrapur DC hands over Rs 8L cheque,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/dont-need-anything-for-myself-1972-rape-survivor-mathura-seeks-work-for-her-sons-chandrapur-dc-hands-over-rs-8l-cheque/articleshow/125731126.cms,"TOI

NAGPUR: Forgotten for decades until afront-page report revived national outrage, the tribal woman known as “Mathura” — whose 1972 rape in a police station reshaped India’s sexual-assault laws — asked for nothing for herself when officials reached her rundown hut in eastern Maharashtra.Undernourished and partially paralysed at 72, she urged Chandrapur district collector Vinay Gowda to help her two sons find work.Gowda said the administration is exploring contractual jobs or business support for them. “The younger of the two seemed proactive. We can think of helping him start a shop or a goat-rearing business,” he said.During his visit Tuesday, Gowda handed over a Rs 8 lakh cheque that was deposited in the presence of a bank manager accompanying him. A fixed deposit has been opened, requiring the tehsildar’s approval for withdrawal, and is expected to generate Rs 5,000 a month for her.Maharashtra govt will also provide a home under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana at the same spot where she now lives, with the gram panchayat tasked with construction. An official has been assigned to coordinate her needs. Gowda said he is weighing support for land under a tribal scheme that can offer up to Rs 20 lakh for about 4 acres.Earlier, A 1972 rape survivor whose case transformed India’s sexual-assault laws was discovered living in a collapsing hut in eastern Maharashtra, neglected by the very welfare systems meant to protect her.Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis responded immediately after the report appeared on November 30, assuring assistance to the 72-year-old, known only as “Mathura.” In the following days, bankers, private-sector workers, film producers, Bollywood personalities, and US-based activists reached out, many planning visits to her remote village about 150 km from Nagpur.Chandrapur district authorities were the first to act. Within hours, officials pledged Rs 10 lakh—Rs 5 lakh from the DC office employees’ welfare fund and Rs 5 lakh from CSR contributions by a local power plant. They also arranged monthly rations of 30 kg, a home under the Gharkul or Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, and additional support through other schemes.“Mathura” became a symbol of systemic injustice after two policemen accused of raping her inside Desaiganj police station were acquitted by the Supreme Court in 1979. The landmark case, Tukaram vs State of Maharashtra, ignited nationwide protests and eventually led to sweeping changes in India’s rape laws in 1983.","Tribal woman known as ‘Mathura’ whose 1972 rape in a police station reshaped India’s sexual-assault laws.

They warn of significant damage to democracy, jobs, and the environment, arguing that Amazon is sacrificing climate goals and human workers for AI dominance. The employees demand ethical AI practices, including clean energy use and employee involvement in AI decisions.

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

Here's the complete open letter from Amazon 1000-plus employees:

Dear Andy Jassy and S-team,

In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond.

We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis. We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth.

We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm:

Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming.

Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019. The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants.

Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas.

Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement.

Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional.

Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally,

Jeff Bezos

owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance.

All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need.

We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following:

No AI with dirty energy.

No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments.

No AI without employee voices.

We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact.

No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.

Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine.

The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are.

This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of.

Signed,

1,039 Amazon employees (and counting!)





Thousands of Amazon employees have signed an open letter issuing to CEO Andy Jassy . The letter warns the company about its 'rapid' move toward AI. Signed by more than 1,000 Amazon workers (and counting), the open letter calls out Amazon for pushing its AI investments at the expense of climate and human workforce. The letter’s supporters come from a wide array of roles at the company, including many software engineers, and even employees focused on building AI systems. ""We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth,” the letter’s authors wrote. It adds, “We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene.”The open letter is reported to have been signed by Amazon workers anonymously, and comes almost a month after the ecommerce giant announced mass layoff plans as it increases adoption of AI in its operations. Among the signatories are employees in a range of positions, including engineers, product managers and warehouse associates. The letter argues that their employer is throwing out its climate promises in the scramble to win the AI race.Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, pointing to efficiencies from electric delivery vehicles and reduced plastic packaging in its climate commitment.","Over 1,000 Amazon employees have penned an open letter expressing grave concerns about the company's rapid AI development.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

How Elon Musk sees AI and robotics reshaping global industries





Elon Musk: A Different Conversation w/ Nikhil Kamath | Full Episode | People by WTF Ep. 16

Elon Musk’s prediction of AI-driven instant manufacturing





Elon Musk’s view of AI evolving beyond human well-being goals





Elon Musk’s vision of a future where ‘money becomes irrelevant’









Elon Musk has once again shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour. During a conversation on Nikhil Kamath’s People by WTF podcast, the Tesla and SpaceX chief suggested that the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and robotics is pushing society towards a future where humans no longer need to work to survive. Musk’s view is rooted in the belief that machines will eventually handle all essential tasks, allowing people to approach work as a creative or recreational activity rather than an economic necessity.He expressed strong confidence that the world could reach this turning point within the next two decades. For Musk, this future is not a distant fantasy but a likely outcome of the accelerating technological breakthroughs unfolding today.Musk argued that the extraordinary pace of development in AI models, autonomous systems, and humanoid robots is already rapidly reshaping industries worldwide. According to him, the next phase of technological growth will create intelligent machines that can replicate or even surpass human capability in almost every domain, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare, education, and creative services.He believes that this massive transition may occur much sooner than most people expect, possibly within ten to fifteen years. Musk compared future labour to home gardening. Just as people may choose to grow vegetables for enjoyment rather than necessity, he thinks future generations will increasingly engage in work for personal fulfilment, creativity, or social contribution rather than mere survival. The essential work that maintains society will be managed entirely by advanced automated systems that require minimal or no human oversight.A core part of Musk’s argument is that AI systems will eventually be able to create anything a person can imagine. His own AI company, xAI, along with its chatbot Grok, reflects his belief that increasingly capable generative systems will expand into physical production through robotics, automation, and smart manufacturing techniques. As these technologies combine, they could enable a world where scarcity becomes obsolete and resource distribution becomes more equitable. Musk visualises a future in which goods and services can be produced instantly and efficiently.He emphasised that the ability to turn ideas into tangible products without traditional labour inputs would fundamentally reshape economies, social structures, and the global workforce. Once technology reaches this stage, he thinks most constraints on human consumption and lifestyle will disappear, creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation, creativity, and human progress.Musk also explored a lesser-discussed aspect of hyper-advanced AI. He suggested that there may come a time when AI and robotics complete every possible task aimed at improving human well-being. After satisfying all imaginable human desires and demands, these systems could reach a saturation point where they no longer have meaningful human-centred tasks to perform.At that stage, Musk believes AI may begin working on activities that serve its own optimisation because the catalogue of tasks that benefit humanity is finite. This idea raises profound questions about the long-term relationship between humans and intelligent machines once human needs are no longer the defining force behind technological activity. Musk’s predictions extend far beyond the automation of work. At the US Saudi Investment Forum earlier this month, he stated that humanoid robots and AI systems have the potential to eliminate poverty. His argument relies on the assumption that when machines can produce goods for virtually no cost and at limitless volume, wealth becomes universal because essential resources are accessible to everyone.If machines can meet all human needs, the traditional economic struggle for income, resources, and opportunity would disappear. Musk envisions a world where every person benefits equally from the capabilities of intelligent robots that can generate abundance without relying on human labour.In his discussion with Kamath, Musk introduced an even more radical idea. He predicted that money might eventually lose its relevance. In his view, money exists primarily as a tool for allocating labour and determining the value of goods that require human effort to produce. If production becomes entirely automated and unlimited, the need for money as a mechanism for distribution fades.Musk suggested that in such a world, the primary form of value might shift towards power generation. Energy would become the foundational currency because machines require it to operate, create and sustain the systems that support human life. The economy would therefore revolve around energy capacity rather than labour or manufactured goods.","Elon Musk has shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour.
