Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection. Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group.

Tharoor flags ‘Family Business’ in Indian politics

BJP seizes on Tharoor’s remarks

Congress hits back:

Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has praised senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor ’s latest article criticising dynastic politics, using it to target the Gandhi family and the Congress leadership.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla called the piece “insightful” and hailed Tharoor as a “Khatron ke Khiladi” for directly questioning political succession in his own party.In his essay titled “Indian Politics Are a Family Business” published on Project Syndicate, Tharoor described dynastic politics as a “grave threat to Indian democracy” and urged India to move toward “meritocracy.”He argued that leadership in the Congress and other INDIA bloc parties including the Samajwadi Party, RJD, Shiv Sena (UBT) and DMK has often passed from one generation to the next.Tharoor wrote that from Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi to Rajiv Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Nehru-Gandhi family has cemented the idea that political leadership can be a “birthright.”""For decades, one family has towered over Indian politics. The influence of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty - including independent India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, and current opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra - is bound up with the history of India's struggle for freedom. But it has also cemented the idea that political leadership can be a birthright,"" his article read.He also cited examples of other political families including Uddhav and Aaditya Thackeray in Maharashtra, Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, Farooq and Omar Abdullah in Jammu and Kashmir and M Karunanidhi and MK Stalin in Tamil Nadu to highlight how dynastic politics extends beyond the Congress party.Responding to the essay, BJP’s Shehzad Poonawalla said it “rightly exposes how the Gandhi family turned Indian politics into a family business.”Speaking to ANI, Poonawalla said, ""A very insightful piece has been written by Dr Tharoor on how Indian politics has become family business and in the opening of that piece he has explained how the first family of Congress party, the Gandhi-Vadra dynasty has been responsible for cementing this negative thought that political position and power can be a matter of birth right.""In a post on X, Poonawalla wrote, “Dr Tharoor has become Khatron ke Khiladi. He has directly called out Nepo Kids or Nawabs of Nepotism. Sir, when I called out Nepo Naamdar Rahul Gandhi in 2017, you know what happened to me. Praying for you… The first family is very vengeful.”He also added, “Very insightful piece written by Dr Shashi Tharoor on how Indian politics has become a family business — he has launched a direct attack on India’s Nepo kid Rahul & chhota nepo kid Tejashwi Yadav!”Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan welcomed Tharoor’s remarks, saying they were based on “experience” and would “hurt Congress and RJD because their politics are limited to family.”Congress leaders Rashid Alvi played down the controversy, saying dynastic politics exists across fields, not just in politics.Speaking to reporters, he said: ""The public makes the decisions in a democracy... You cannot impose a restriction that says you cannot contest elections because your father was an MP.... This is happening in every field... What way will you find for this?...""Tharoor has previously faced criticism from Congress party for praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s “energy, dynamism and willingness to engage,” calling them “a prime asset for India on the global stage.”Tharoor’s recent alignment with the ruling party on several occasions, a noticeable departure from the Congress line, has drawn attention. Notably, he was chosen to lead India’s diplomatic outreach under, representing the nation on the global stage and heading delegations to several countries across the Americas, including the US.","BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla hails Tharoor as a “Khatron ke Khiladi” for directly questioning political succession in his own party.

12 OD deaths in India every week: NCRB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/12-od-deaths-in-india-every-week-ncrb/articleshow/125069465.cms,"Representative image

BENGALURU: In 2023, the latest year for which data is available, at least 12 people died every week in India on average due to drug overdose, NCRB data reveals. That is nearly two deaths daily. Between 2019 and 2023, 3,290 deaths were attributed to the same cause, with the average for the five-year period remaining roughly the same as in 2023.What makes this data particularly sobering is what it doesn't capture. These figures represent only confirmed drug overdose deaths - they don't account for unreported cases and deaths misattributed to other causes. Also, NCRB doesn't specify if the overdose involved a narcotic substance or prescription drugs.Psychiatrists, clinicians and retired police officers TOI spoke to said there needs to be more clarity in the classification of drug overdose cases. They pointed out that in many of these cases, there could have been an overuse of prescription drugs such as sleeping pills or painkillers.The figures tell a story of volatility rather than steady decline. After recording 704 deaths in 2019, the country saw a sharp drop to 514 deaths in 2020, likely influenced by Covid-induced lockdowns.The number of deaths surged to 737 in 2021 - the highest in the five-year period - before moderating to 681 in 2022, and 654 in 2023.Tamil Nadu dominated the statistics in the early years of this period. In 2019, it recorded 108 deaths, the highest in the country. The figure tapered to 110 in 2020, before spiking to 250 deaths in 2021. Since then, however, the state has seen a remarkable reversal. Deaths dropped to just 50 in 2022 and rose marginally to touch 65 in 2023.Punjab, sharing a porous border with Pakistan that has long been a conduit for drug trafficking, has maintained a consistently high position in the rankings. While it didn't feature among the top five states in 2019, it recorded 34 deaths in 2020. The figures more than doubled to 78 in 2021, before touching 144 in 2022 - making it the state with the maximum overdose deaths that year. In 2023, though deaths fell to 89, it still topped the national list.Rajasthan has shown a troubling consistency in terms of deaths. Starting with 60 deaths in 2019, the state's toll climbed to 92 in 2020. It reached 113 in 2021 and rose to 117 in 2022. While the deaths declined slightly to 84 in 2023, Rajasthan has remained in the top five every year, occupying second or third positions throughout the period.Madhya Pradesh wasn't among the top five in 2019 or 2020 but emerged in the list with 34 deaths in 2021. This figure was 74 in 2022 and rose again to 85 in 2023, making it the second-highest state in the most recent year.Mizoram and Manipur have appeared intermittently in the top five. Mizoram saw 30 deaths in 2020 and 61 in 2022, while Manipur saw 36 deaths in 2021. Karnataka was in top five in 2019, with 67 deaths, and in 2020, with 36.","In 2023, the latest year for which data is available, at least 12 people died every week in India on average due to drug overdose, NCRB data reveals.

Probe is still under way and key conspirators may be apprehended soon, sources said.Ambani and his RCom, Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd (RCFL) and Reliance Home Finance Ltd (RHFL) are among other group entities accused in two CBI FIRs - the basis of ED's probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

Gold Card versus EB-5



EB-5's rising momentum



MUMBAI: With a waiting queue running into several decades for an employment-linked Green Card, a growing number of Indians continue to resort to a faster way to live permanently in the US.The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it-despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted Green Card. The EB-5 program also finds favour among high networth individuals (HNIs) in India, who are looking at securing their children's future in America. Investors initially obtain a conditional Green Card, which is later converted into a permanent Green Card. (See table).Applicants are required to invest $800,000 (about Rs 7.1 crore) or $1,050,000 (about Rs 9.3 crore), depending on the project's type and/or location, and must create or preserve at least 10 full-time American jobs. Most investors route their funds through regional centers (USCIS-designated entities) that pool EB-5 capital into large-scale projects. Over 90% of EB-5 investments in recent years have been made through these centers rather than via direct investments.Soon after being sworn in as US president, Donald Trump announced he would launch a 'Gold Card'; commerce secretary Howard Lutnick added this could replace the EB-5 program with Gold-Card funds going directly to the US govt. This led to jitters among the EB-5 investors and those aspiring for a Green Card under this investment-linked route.On Sept 19, Trump signed an executive order to introduce the 'Gold Card' visa program. Individuals wishing to qualify for Gold Card must make an unrestricted gift of $1 million (about Rs 8.4 crore) to US Department of Commerce. If a corporation or similar entity makes the gift on behalf of the individual, the required amount rises to $2 million (about Rs 16.8 crore).The modalities of the Gold Card are yet to be rolled out. A key difference between the two programs lies not just in the amounts to be paid, but the fact that the Gold Card entails a 'fee', whereas the EB-5 program requires an 'investment'-with a return on capital.As things stand, the long-term future of the EB-5 program remains unclear. Immigration attorneys point out that the EB-5 Regional Center (RC) Program has been reauthorised until 2027 by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) of 2022. Those who have invested, or plan to invest, before Sept 2026 will be protected from future lapses in the program owing to the RIA's grandfathering clause. The clause seems to have eased initial jitters among aspiring investors. Many of India's high networth families are turning to this path to secure long-term US residency for their kids. Mid-career professionals already in the US on H-1B visas -where Green Card backlogs stretch to decades-are increasingly joining them.According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, the EB-5 program drew $4.1 billion in the first three quarters of FY2025- nearly matching investment for the entire previous year.Since the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) came into effect in 2022, around 1,050- 1,150 Indians have filed EB-5 applications, according to USCIS filing data. This places India as the second-largest EB-5 applicant group globally, accounting for roughly 20- 22% of all new post-RIA filings. The demand has remained consistent month-to-month, driven by both H-1B families already in the US facing decades-long Green Card wait times and by high networth families in India planning long-term residency and education pathways for their children.""Most people still believe that once their child gets into a decent US university, they can build a career there,"" said Piyush Gupta, vice-president of CanAm Enterprises, which operates several licensed regional centers. However, uncertainties arising out of ever-changing and tightening H-1B policies prompts many to explore EB-5, he added.For Prahlad Purohit, a 43-year-old Google engineer from Mumbai, the decision was driven by family rather than finance. After nearly a decade in the US, he feared his two India-born children would lose their dependent status when they turned 21. ""My son couldn't even apply for internships because he wasn't a resident,"" Purohit said over a call from San Francisco. ""Both my children grew up here, they don't know the system in India. That's when I chose EB-5.""Speaking to TOI on a Zoom from Mountview, California, he recalls how he selected his investment. ""It's like the Wild West, with many claiming they're the best and promising exorbitant returns on top of the Green Card-from almond farms to hotel chains,"" he said. ""I finally chose a real estate development in Manhattan that was building a corporate skyscraper.""Despite the high approval rate for applications, the EB-5 route remains a high-stakes bet: a blend of financial investment, immigration strategy, and faith in the American market. As Gupta put it, ""For many of our clients, this isn't about returns-it's about certainty. They'd rather invest in a project than a house, if it means their family never has to rely on H-1B visa lottery again.""","The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it. Despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted Green Card.

"Opened after 54 years, Banke Bihari treasury reveals dust, raises doubts; SC-appointed panel is now auditing assets of temple",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opened-after-54-years-banke-bihari-treasury-reveals-dust-raises-doubts-sc-appointed-panel-is-now-auditing-assets-of-temple/articleshow/125027537.cms,"SC-Appointed Panel Is Now Auditing Assets Of Temple

MATHURA: The long-sealed treasury - toshakhana - of Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple, believed to hold royal gifts, ornaments and centuries-old offerings, was opened last month after 54 years on the orders of an SC-appointed panel tasked with overseeing the temple's financial, structural and administrative functioning. But what emerged from the vault shocked many: one gold and three silver bars and utensils. With no inventory or donor records, the panel has launched the temple's first full asset audit, covering bank deposits worth up to Rs 400 crore, sealed lockers, land holdings and donation records - as questions mount over where the ""missing treasure"" is.Like on every Dhanteras, on Oct 18, the priest lit a small earthen lamp and placed it at the foot of the door of the treasury. The wood had darkened, carvings dulled, a panel eaten halfway by termites. No key had survived and a metal cutter was brought in. Snake catchers moved in first as forest officials stood by with oxygen cylinders. Behind the panels - sealed for more than five decades - lay the toshakhana.When it opened, there was no gold crown as expected. Or a gemstone necklace. Just a long wooden box containing a single gold bar and three silver bars streaked faintly with vermilion.Around them, there were brass utensils, wooden trays, and layers of dust so thick that one official described it as ""undisturbed for generations"". The chamber yielded no spectacle. But what it did offer was unsettling - the near-total absence of any official record of what had once been kept there: no donor register, no inventory, no valuation documents, and no reconciliation with decades of temple offerings.The toshakhana, last opened in 1971, had been spoken of for years in reverent tones - a place where ornaments, royal gifts from Bharatpur, Karauli and Gwalior, land deeds and handwritten letters were believed to lie, donated by kings and commoners to ""Thakurji"". Instead, the inventory was strikingly thin and sparked disbelief among devotees, demands for a CBI probe from locals, and a quiet but unmistakable scrutiny of the shrine's financial history.As of now, the items found in the toshakhana have not been formally valued, though they have been sealed. No FIR has been filed, and no report has been made public. ""The audit is on. This is the first official attempt to document the temple's assets,"" said a senior official associated with the panel. ""We don't have the full inventory yet. Even the panel is trying to find out. A CA firm has been appointed.""Banke Bihari temple, founded in 1864 by followers of saint and musician Swami Haridas, receives some 50,000 visitors a day - a number that rises to several lakhs on festivals and auspicious days. Yet unlike temples in the south, whose wealth was historically documented and regulated under systems of royal patronage and formal audits, Banke Bihari has evolved with a structure rooted in tradition rather than regulation. Offerings - jewellery, land, cash - have come in over generations, but few comprehensive records exist to track them.Among devotees, reactions have been mixed. ""My devotion is to the deity, not to any treasure,"" said Ramesh Patel, a Surat-based cloth trader who visits Vrindavan two or three times a year. ""Yes, I too was expecting something spectacular. But I am not disappointed. We hope all the assets will eventually be documented."" Others, however, have gone further. Dinesh Falhari, a local, has written to PM Narendra Modi seeking a CBI probe. Several residents in the vicinity have echoed the concern.The committee, chaired by retired HC judge Ashok Kumar, was formed after a series of PILs raised concerns over crowd management and administrative lapses. The recent vault opening has prompted the panel to expand its scope and begin a full structural and financial audit - the temple's first.As per official estimates, the temple holds between Rs 350 to 400 crore across over 10 bank accounts in Mathura and Vrindavan, most currently in Multi-Option Deposit form - a product that offers lower interest rates than fixed deposits. The panel has directed that these accounts be converted into FDs for better returns and asked bank officials to submit details of the temple's funds and their status.The audit has also raised questions about assets held outside the temple premises. While members of the Goswami community - hereditary sevayats who manage rituals and daily operations - acknowledge that jewellery had once been deposited in SBI's Mathura branch, there is no documentation on when this was done or what was deposited. ""Still not with us,"" said the official. ""The Goswamis say the jewellery is there. But no order to open the lockers has been given yet. We don't have a list of items, and there is no record of valuation.""There is no exhaustive list of temple-owned land, income from leases, or encroachment details. Officials have said that the local tehsildar and SDM have been asked to retrieve land records from around the temple. The temple manager has also been asked to prepare a consolidated report of all bank accounts, financial assets and donation receipts before the panel's next meeting on Nov 19.Within the sevayat community, there is growing discomfort over public speculation around the temple's finances. ""People are comparing Banke Bihari with temples in the south,"" said Shailendra Goswami, a member of the committee and part of the lineage of Swami Haridas. ""But those temples were built by kings. Our's was built in stages, in 1864, with around Rs 70,000 collected from devotees. Even the large Hindola (rocking cradle) was made from offerings. Some of Bihariji's jewellery is in the SBI branch - this has been shared with the committee. No one can make a single accusation against the priests.""Three of the four Goswami members who are part of the high-powered committee confirmed that their concerns had been placed on record at the committee's Oct 29 meeting.

Assam Police Slaps Murder Charge On Zubeen Garg’s Manager & Festival Organiser

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday claimed that state icon and celebrated singer Zubeen Garg was ""murdered,"" even as investigations into the case remain underway.Garg died under mysterious circumstances while swimming in the sea in Singapore on September 19. He had travelled there to attend the fourth edition of the North East India Festival (NEIF).“I am not calling it an accident. The charge-sheet in this murder case must be submitted by December 17, but I have set a target to file it by December 8. We are ready now,” Sarma told reporters, according to news agency PTI.The chief minister, however, did not disclose what prompted investigators to classify the case as murder. Special Investigation Team (SIT) under the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Assam Police is probing Garg’s death after more than 60 FIRs were lodged across the state.Meanwhile, Sarma added that he had met Union home minister Amit Shah to seek expedited approval to file a charge-sheet in the case, as Ministry of Home Affairs' (MHA) permission is required to file a charge-sheet in incidents that occur abroad.“Yesterday, I met the Union home minister to fast-track the process.The SIT will approach the MHA within the next three to four days to seek the necessary clearance before filing the charge-sheet,” he stated.When asked whether the Assam government had extended any financial assistance to the NEIF, Sarma replied it had not.Those arrested in connection with the case include NEIF chief organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta, Garg’s manager Siddharth Sharma, and two band members — Shekhar Jyoti Goswami and Amrit Prabha Mahanta. The singer’s cousin, Assam Police DSP Sandipan Garg, was later taken into custody as well.Two of Garg’s personal security officers, Nandeswar Bora and Prabin Baishya, were also arrested after police uncovered alleged financial transactions worth over Rs 1.1 crore in their accounts.All seven accused are currently in judicial custody and have been booked under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for murder, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, criminal conspiracy, and causing death by negligence.","Garg died under mysterious circumstances while swimming in the sea in Singapore on September 19.

Justice Ramana

slams attempts to crush farmers’ movement

Justice N V Ramana (retd) disclosed Saturday that the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government filed police cases against his family to target him before he became the Chief Justice of India in 2021 because they supported Amaravati capital city project of Andhra Pradesh.""All of you present here know how my family was targeted and criminal cases were filed against them. All this was done only to coerce me,"" he said while addressing students at the convocation ceremony of VIT-AP at Amaravati.The Jagan Reddy government diluted the previous N Chandrababu Naidu government's Amaravati capital project by announcing the trifurcation of the capital, which was opposed by farmers whose land had already been acquired.The farmers agitated for five years from 2019 till 2024 and the trifurcation idea was dropped after the Chandrababu Naidu government returned to office last year.Recalling his deep association with Amaravati since his student days, he said, ""Present-day Amaravati owes its existence to the resilience of the farmers of this region. The city survives on the back of the farmers' struggle, one of the longest in southern India.""Talking about attempts to ""crush the farmers' struggle"", Justice Ramana said, ""Rarely the media or any politician ever spoken the truth or given real credit as to how the capital of Amaravati survived and sustained,"" he said.Briefly touching on the ""painful days of police action"" against his family members, the former CJI said, ""I was not alone. During that difficult period, all those who empathised with the cause of the farmers, faced intimidation and coercion."" ""Even members of the judiciary who upheld constitutional principles faced transfers, pressure, and at times, persecution. Families of judges, who had no role, suffered collateral damage because of political machinations,"" he said.In these testing times, many political leaders hesitated to take a stand and preferred silence, he said. ""It was the jurists, lawyers and the courts which stood by their constitutional promise,"" he said. ""While govts may change, the courts and the rule of law remain as the anchor of stability. The rule of law survives only when people, in whom the public repose trust, decline to surrender their integrity for convenience,"" he said.""In the coming times, the role of farmers, lawyers, jurists, members of civil society and judges will have to remain the enduring source of inspiration with their integrity and commitment to rule of law,"" he said.",Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government filed police cases against his family to target him before he became the Chief Justice of India in 2021.

"Vedanta, BEL & more: Top stocks to buy on November 4 — Check list",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vedanta-bel-bank-of-baroda-bpcl-gail-top-stocks-to-buy-on-november-4check-list/articleshow/125072470.cms,"(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





CLSA has an outperform rating on Vedanta with the target price at Rs 580. Analysts said that the company’s July-Sept quarter (Q2FY26) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBIDTA) of Rs 11,400 crore was in line with consensus. It guided for higher FY26 EBIDTA, driven by higher commodity prices and operational improvement. Over the next couple of years ramp-up of expansion projects and backward integration (largely aluminium, power and zinc) are likely to be the key drivers. Debt at parent Vedanta Resources (VRL) is now well funded, while demerger is guided to be complete by end-FY26. The outcome of the $2 billion bid for Jai Prakash Associates is a key monitorable given it is a diversified asset.Nomura has a neutral rating on BEL with the target price at Rs 427. Analysts said the company reported strong Q2FY26 numbers but rich valuations limit any upside for the stock. They raised BEL’s FY26 EBITDA and profit after tax (PAT) estimates by 2% and 1%. They also estimated that its PAT would show a compounded annual growth rate of 13% between FY25 and FY28. Analysts also said BEL’s order book was robust but warned that large orders have larger execution timelines.HSBC has a buy rating on Bank of Baroda with the target price raised to Rs 340. Analysts said during Q2FY26, the lender showed a broad-based sequential loan growth, net interest margin (NIM) expansion and asset quality performance were key positives. Incrementally, its operating performance will likely remain healthy with an upside risk from better asset quality. They also raised FY26-FY28 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 5-7%.Jefferies has a buy rating on BPCL with the target price at Rs 430. Analysts said that during Q2FY26 the company reported strong EBITDA because of strong refining & marketing inventory gains. They also said that the govt's compensation for LPG losses will boost earnings over the next few quarters. However, they said marketing profitability has weakened somewhat in Q3, and inventory losses are likely. Also that large capex in refining and petchem would drag return on capital employed (RoCE). Analysts said BPCL’s earnings outlook was strong on range bound crude given OPEC supply.Citigroup has a buy rating on GAIL with the target price at Rs 215. Analysts said GAIL’s Q2FY26 EBITDA at Rs 3,200 crore was ahead of estimate, aided by strong gas trading performance, with gas transmission volumes also showing modest recovery. Petchem performance, however, remained subdued, they said. The management reiterated its guidance for gas trading profitability, lowered its guidance for gas transmission volumes and remains confident on their tariff hike expectations. Analysts were encouraged by the granularity provided on gas trading, which should boost investor comfort, and also from upcoming commissioning of new pipelines, which should aid volume growth even if all else stayed equal.","CLSA has an outperform rating on Vedanta with the target price at Rs 580.

The Asian Arowana: Ancient fish that rules the modern aquarium



The Asian Arowana: From banned species to billion-dollar status symbol



The super red Arowana : The fiery dragon fish worth more than gold



Also Read |





For centuries, dragons have embodied prosperity, power, and mystery in Asian culture. Today, that legend lives on in the Asian arowana, famously known as the dragon fish and hailed as the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. Native to the rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, this ancient predator moves with elegant precision, its metallic scales shimmering like coins of gold under filtered light. As highlighted by National Geographic, the arowana’s mythical resemblance to dragons has made it a potent symbol of luck and wealth across generations. Coveted by collectors, enthusiasts, and investors alike, it now commands staggering prices, often exceeding the value of gold, transforming a once humble river dweller into a living emblem of prosperity, success, and timeless prestige.The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish. Growing up to three feet in length, it glides through the dark waters of Southeast Asia with hypnotic grace, its large, shimmering scales catching light like polished coins. Two slender barbels extend from its chin, evoking the whiskers of a dragon, a resemblance that fuels its legendary reputation as a bearer of fortune, power, and eternal protection across Asian cultures.This prehistoric species, believed to have existed since the age of dinosaurs, thrives in slow-moving rivers and peat swamps in Borneo, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yet, it is far from a humble creature. In the modern world, an arowana can command prices as high as £250,000 per fish, a valuation that has elevated it from swamp inhabitant to luxury treasure.In the 1970s, the Asian arowana was added to the list of endangered species under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The trade ban was meant to protect its dwindling numbers in the wild. Instead, it ignited a new kind of frenzy.The ban transformed the arowana from a simple food fish into an elite, forbidden object of desire. Collectors across Asia began competing for the rare, mystical “dragon fish.” Suddenly, what once sold for a few dollars in a local market became a high-stakes commodity worth tens of thousands.By the late 20th century, farms in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia began breeding the fish legally under government licence. These operations were run like fortresses with guards, surveillance systems, and barbed wire to protect their valuable stock. Each fish was microchipped and issued an identification certificate to prove its legal, captive-bred origin. Despite such measures, black market smuggling and theft became part of the trade’s darker undercurrent.Among the many colour varieties, green, gold, and silver, the Super Red arowana reigns supreme. Found in the remote Kapuas River basin and the Lake Sentarum wetlands of Borneo, its scales shimmer in rich shades of ruby and crimson. In the right light, it appears almost aflame, like a dragon rising from the depths.This rare beauty can sell for astronomical prices. Reports claim that elite collectors, including high-ranking officials and business magnates, have spent more than £200,000 for a single fish. During international fish exhibitions, these rare specimens are transported in tanks escorted by security guards proof that even a creature of water can inspire terrestrial greed and glamour.Former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was said to have owned one himself, paying around £10,000 for his prized arowana. For many, ownership signifies not just wealth, but alignment with luck, prosperity, and spiritual balance.","The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish.

"Inside India’s voyeur web: 80 CCTV dashboards hacked across 20 states; hospitals, schools, homes streamed to porn channels; 50,000 clips sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/inside-indias-voyeur-web-80-cctv-dashboards-hacked-across-20-states-hospitals-schools-homes-streamed-to-porn-channels-50000-clips-sold/articleshow/125073851.cms,"



RAJKOT: A shocking cybercrime has rocked India’s digital security landscape, with hackers stealing at least 50,000 CCTV clips over nine months from facilities across the country and selling them online for anything between Rs 700 and Rs 4,000 per clip, feeding them into an international porn fetish network for profit.Investigators revealed that 80 CCTV dashboards were compromised, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate offices, factories, cinema halls, and even private residences across cities including Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Surat, Ahmedabad, Delhi, and more.The scam came to light when teaser clips from Payal Maternity Hospital in Rajkot appeared on YouTube channels like “Megha Mbbs” and “cp monda”, leading customers to Telegram groups where the stolen footage was sold.Officials said the breaches were made possible by default passwords such as “admin123”, enabling hackers to launch automated attacks and collect massive amounts of sensitive footage.Despite the primary arrests being made earlier in 2025, investigators found that these illegally obtained clips were still available on Telegram groups until at least June.Investigators found that many of these CCTV systems still used factory-set passwords like ‘admin123’, which had not been changed during setup.This enabled the hackers to initiate an aggressive and automated assault.An officer from the cybercrime branch in Ahmedabad told TOI: “The primary method used was a ‘brute force attack’ (hackers using a program or bot to try every possible combination of letters and numbers for a lock).” Parit Dhameliya, the lead hacker in the operation, a BCom graduate, employed three different software programs to achieve this.“First, Dhameliya used a website called suIP.biz to obtain the IP addresses (the unique online location) of cameras in Gujarat. These IPs were then fed into a software called ‘Masscan’ which quickly scanned for open ports (the specific digital doorways that allow remote communication).”Next, the attackers used a specialized hacking tool called ‘SWC software’, which can reveal a camera’s ID, password, and IP address once the system is compromised. Using these stolen credentials, another accused, Rohit Sisodiya — later arrested in Delhi and who had posed as a medical laboratory technology diploma holder — accessed the hospital’s cameras through the DMSS application, a tool normally used for legitimate remote viewing.The officer added, “To access this sensitive footage cost around Rs 700 per person, though the highest-demand voyeuristic clips sold for up to Rs. 4,000. Praj Patil, also a NEET aspirant, acted as the financial facilitator, providing his mobile number and bank account to collect subscription payments.”To conceal their location, the attackers relied heavily on international infrastructure, routing their activities through virtual private networks (VPNs) that made their origins appear to be in cities like Bucharest in Romania, and New York in the US.The massive scale of unauthorized access — exceeding 11,000 successful external sessions in total — was meticulously tracked through log files spanning from Jan 2024 through early Dec 2024. The core members, including Prajwal Teli, Praj Patil, and Chandraprakash Phoolchand, were arrested within 39 hours of the FIR being registered. The threat actors were charged under several sections of the BNS Act and IT Act, including cyber terrorism.","80 CCTV dashboards were compromised, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate offices, factories, cinema halls, and even private residences across cities including Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Surat, Ahmedabad, Delhi, and more.

BENGALURU: A steel distribution company employee lost Rs 80 lakh after he fell off his scooter and lost consciousness in Cantonment railway bridge underpass Saturday.Police are yet to ascertain if it is a robbery or theft as the injured man, Waseem Akram, said he felt like someone pushed him from behind while he was riding the scooter with the cash bag on his footrest.Akram's employer, Haseen Begh, who runs a steel business with 15 employees in Azeez Sait Industrial Estate near Nayandahalli, supplies steel, including waste steel, to shops in multiple locations in the city. Akram regularly collected payments from clients for the materials supplied to them.On the day of the incident, Akram collected cash from clients in Peenya Industrial Area and JC Nagar. He was heading towards Shivajinagar to collect more money and then to Chamarajpet. He had collected around Rs 80 lakh in cash and had about 160 bundles of notes. He kept the cash bag on the footrest of his scooter.An autorickshaw driver passing by the underpass around 8.30pm noticed Akram lying unconscious on the roadside. He rushed him to a hospital on Queens Road. Begh was waiting for Akram to return with the cash and tried to call him at 9pm. The auto driver responded, saying he found Akram, who had sustained a head injury, unconscious after falling from the scooter.When Begh rushed to the hospital, Akram had regained consciousness by then.When Begh asked Akram how he was injured, the latter said he'd collected cash from Peenya and JC Nagar and while riding in the underpass, he felt like someone pushed him from behind. He lost balance and crashed into the underpass wall and fell from his scooter.Akram said his scooter and bag might still be at the spot. The auto driver said he remembered seeing the two-wheeler but was not aware of any bag. Begh then sent his brother to the underpass to check the scooter and bag, but he only found the two-wheeler.A police officer said Akram is not clear whether someone pushed him from behind or a car hit him. He remembers the scooter and a car colliding before he crashed into the wall. There is no CCTV camera at the spot.

'I'm Broken': Lone AI-171 Crash Survivor Speaks Out; Walked Out Of Burning Jet, Now Stranded In UK

‘Completely Broken Down’

Getting On A Plane, Again

Early Days In Leicester

With Almost No Income Now

‘Situation Is Desperate’





On June 12, the whole world saw him walk away, alone, from the burning wreckage of the crashed AI 171 flight from Ahmedabad to London’s Gatwick. There was black smoke billowing out of the Air India flight, its tail end sticking out of a building where it had crashed, and, on the ground, this man in a white tee and grey trousers, walking with a slight limp, and repeating over and over again, “Plane fatyo che ! Plane fatyo che ! (The plane has exploded!)”He was the lone survivor. There were 242 on board that flight — 230 passengers and 12 crew members; 241 of them were dead, some charred beyond recognition. How could anyone walk out of that wreckage? This was a miracle to beat all miracles — an outcome only a very benign God could have ordained.And yet, a little over four and a half months later, when we meet Viswashkumar Ramesh, the 39-year-old lone crash survivor, he looks crushed and depressed, hardly someone who has beaten impossible odds and survived. What he is left with now is the struggle of picking up the pieces; but it’s a task for which he says he is yet to receive the help he needs, from the airline and the govt of UK, the country of his citizenship.We are in Leicester, UK, at the residence of Sanjiv Patel, a community leader. A silver Volvo SUV pulls up, and Viswash gets off. He lives nearby, but walking has been an issue ever since he jumped — or fell? — off the burning plane. Because of his mobility issues, he has also stopped driving. So, Patel — who is voluntarily helping the family — has organised for his pickup.Viswash hobbles into the room. He looks like a broken man, dazed, unable to focus or fully engage, morose, a haunted man.“After this tragedy — not just my wife and son — my whole family is all completely broken down. Me — physically, mentally — and my family also,” he says.On the plane, Viswash had been seated in 11A, next to the emergency exit. His younger brother, Ajaykumar, was in seat 11J. He was among the 241 who died. Viswash spent a few days in hospital, and then went back to Diu, where he is originally from. The two brothers used to run a fishing business there. While in Diu, Viswash underwent medical treatment at Rajkot.He came back to the UK on Sept 15 to get on with his medical treatment under NHS (the British medical service, which is free for all citizens) and to be with his wife Hiral and four-year-old son Divang, who’s just started school. However, he has not yet seen any doctor in the NHS nor received any psychiatric treatment or counselling in the UK.It is immediately clear that weighing heavily against the relief of his miTOI raculous escape is the lingering grief for his brother’s death and the psychological trauma of having survived a crash in which everyone else on board died. Ever since he came back, he has spent most of his time holed up in his two-bedroom terraced house, hardly ever stepping out.Ask him what it feels like to be a miraculous survivor, and he goes silent. Then he says, “I lost my younger brother.”Just getting back to the UK was a challenge. “It was very difficult to get on an aeroplane.” He did not fly Air India and took another carrier instead. “I was very scared. I just closed my eyes and prayed to my God.“I don’t talk with my son and wife. I just keep sitting in my room alone. Because of the tragedy, whole flashbacks come to me.“My son doesn’t speak much, he is just four years old, he doesn’t understand much of what has happened, just a little bit. My wife is struggling. My shoulder, back, knee, left side are burning — there is still pain in my body. I walk slowly. I have not gone outside of the house much. I am not walking properly. I can’t drive. Mentally, I have completely broken down,” he says.“The fishing business has completely gone down. Me and my brother (Ajay) were doing it together. After this tragedy it is almost finished. My father is trying, but struggling,” Viswash says.Can he get back to his old life? “I don’t know,” he says.His parents moved to the UK about 25 years ago. His father, Ramesh, set up a garments business in Leicester. Viswash, who was born in Diu, moved to the UK when he was around 14. “I came to Leicester with my parents to start studying. Then, after a few years, I started to support my family in the garments business,” he says.However, the family wound up the UK clothing business during Covid and reinvested their money in a fishing venture in Diu. The entire extended family in Diu and Leicester were deriving their income from that business, which, Vishwas claims, had been growing steadily.Viswash and Ajay were the two key people who were hands-on in running the venture. They would spend eight to nine months in Diu and, then, around the time the fishing season ended, they would come back to the UK for three months and spend time with their families in Leicester.Then their world fell apart. Ramesh, Viswash, and his two other younger brothers — Nayankumar and Sunnykumar — tried to run it for a while after the crash, from Diu, but it proved impossible. Viswash was too traumatised to leave his Diu house. The fishermen themselves needed income and, after the crash, the family’s boats couldn’t operate for a while, so the fishermen went to look for other work. The business has virtually collapsed now.Air India has offered Viswash an interim payment of £21,500 (Rs 25 lakh) — the same payment it is offering the families of those who died in the crash. The interim payment will be adjusted against any final compensation.With Patel, in whose house we are meeting, is Radd Seiger, a retired lawyer and crisis and reputation management specialist. Patel, by profession, is a career coach, board adviser and leadership trainer. The two of them have voluntarily stepped in to help Viswash’s family. They claim both Air India and the British govt have failed Viswash. They claim the compensation offered is nowhere near enough given his complex needs.Viswash has almost no income now. To make matters worse, his wife’s Universal Credit (UK welfare benefit) was stopped because she travelled to India for two months after the crash. Universal Credit is a UK govt-funded benefit for working-age people on a low income or unemployed. It is paid as a single monthly payment.Asked about the stoppage of his wife’s payments, a UK govt spokesperson said, “People travelling abroad due to a bereavement can continue receiving Universal Credit for up to two months, rather than the standard one-month limit. Those who are abroad for longer periods would not be able to continue receiving the benefit. People can make a new claim once they return to the UK.”Viswash says, “£21,000 is nothing. I stay in the UK. I pay mortgage….”“Before, it was different — my life was going very smoothly and nice. Now, it’s completely ruined. I feel I have changed. After this plane crash, I am not meeting many people, not talking. I just stay in my room alone,” says Viswash.Even though he came back to the UK to spend time with his wife and son, he admits, “I am not spending much time with him.”“Viswash is still suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder,” says Patel. “He is doing these interviews very reluctantly. He had some treatment in India, but the NHS is not geared up for expedited care. The whole family is traumatised. We have interacted with Air India to say we need to talk about this so they get to understand their circumstances and they have not been willing to have that conversation. The situation is desperate. ”Seiger says, “This is the sole survivor of a major aviation disaster. If ever there was a case for the (Air India) CEO to come and meet personally with the sole survivor, this is it. We have issued that invite to the CEO via our solicitors to their lawyers three times and got nowhere.”","Vishwashkumar Ramesh, 39, was the lone survivor of the AI-171 crash in June. His brother Ajaykumar, who was in seat 11J, was among the 241 people who died. Viswash has not yet seen a doctor in the NHS nor received any psychiatric treatment or counselling in the UK.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125051868,imgsize-25314,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-2.jpg"

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or AI. Instead, the real reason behind Amazon job cuts is the culture, Jassy said. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said as quoted by Business Insider. “It really — it's culture.”“And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy explained.“And when that happens, Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” he added. “And it can lead to slowing you down.”In a blog post dated October 28, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti announced that the e-commerce company is “making organizational changes across Amazon that will impact some of our teammates.”“While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles,” she said.Amazon’s latest job cuts is the company’s biggest layoff since 2022 when the company laid off 27,000 positions. Jassy’s remarks contradict what Amazon executive has been saying about the job cuts.In the blog post, Beth Galetti explained “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”Separately, Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services sent a company-wide email this week saying the company is cutting roles within its OS & Services team and asked remaining workers to ""lean in on AI.""","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or AI. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124986273,imgsize-17580,width-400,resizemode-4/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy.jpg"

Apple iPhone sales





Apple reported a surprise fall in sales in China. However, much to investors and the company's relief, the fall has not been due to the decline in demand. Apple reportedly blamed the surprise decline in China revenue on supply disruptions. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple has predicted that the company will return to growth in the world’s biggest smartphone arena as the iPhone 17 gains momentum. Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the earnings call, “It was basically supply constraints that drove the results.” Cook added, “We’re thrilled with what we’re seeing right now.”Apple CEO said that Apple’s store traffic is up significantly in China, and that the latest iPhones -- iPhone 17 series -- has been well received. Cook also said that Apple reached a new high for September-quarter revenue from services in China, while reiterating that the iPhone is doing very well.According to the report, China was a prominent topic during the earning conference, with analysts asking about the region multiple times. The threat of higher tariffs has disrupted global tech supply chain that’s already in flux because of longer-term decisions to diversify away from China.Apple’s total growth projection for the December quarter is between 10% and 12%. Cook, however, didn't specify how much China would contribute to that.Apple has seen stiffer competition from local brands in China. Reports suggest that Huawei Technologies took the top spot in June, as its campaign to reclaim a bigger share of the premium tier resonated with Chinese consumers. Xiaomi too is reported to have made a splash with its Xiaomi 17 series.IDC estimates that 58.6 million iPhones were sold worldwide in the July-September quarter, putting Apple second behind Samsung at 61.4 million of their Android-powered phones sold worldwide in the quarter.In a conference call with analysts, Tim Cook indicated his belief that the iPhone 17 lineup will continue to do well, predicting even more of the devices will be sold during the final three months of the year. “As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, I couldn’t be more excited for what’s to come,” Cook said. Apple expects its iPhone sales to increase at least 10% from last year's holiday season, according to projections provided by Apple's chief financial officer, Kevan Parekh. Total revenue is expected to rise at a similar rate.","Apple reported a surprise fall in sales in China.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Meta Q3 results





President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill has resulted in a $16 billion hit for Mark Zuckerberg 's Meta. Meta Platforms has taken a near $16 billion one-off charge in the third quarter (Q3) related to President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said that the bill had led the business to take a non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion. Meta said that excluding this, its third-quarter net income would have increased by $15.93 billion to $18.64 billion, compared with the reported net income of $2.71 billion. The expense crashed Meta's third-quarter profit.Incidentally, this is the same bill that Elon Musk and President TrumpThe implementation of Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act led to “the recognition of a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets, reflecting the impact of the U.S. Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax,” Meta said. Meta also said, “We expect a significant reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and future years due to the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. ”The markets didn't seem pleased with $16 billion charge taken by Meta, as the company's stock fell sharply lower on Wall Street, though briefly.The shares fell $53.60, or 7 per cent, to $698.99 in after-hours trading on Wall Street but recovered to close at $751.67, up less than 1 per cent.“We had a strong quarter for our business and our community,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO, said in announcing the results. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses. If we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead, then the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history.”The company ended the quarter with $44.45 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Meta’s headcount was 78,450 employees as of September 30, up 8% year-over-year.As for quarterly guidance, Meta said that it anticipates fourth quarter total revenue to be $56 billion-$59 billion and full-year 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be $70 billion-$72 billion.","Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms has taken a near $16 billion one-off charge in the third quarter (Q3) related to President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.

Watch: Pappu Yadav Gets Angry When Asked Why He Wasn’t Seen with Rahul Gandhi

Q) But when Rahul Gandhi entered the river, you were not seen there; Kanhaiya Kumar was.

Q) You are taking credit for the new trains and Purnia airport — but these are Centre–State decisions. On stage you had praised the PM as well.

Q) You have spoken about AIIMS and Metro for Purnia — when will work begin?

Q) Your irritation over ticket distribution in Congress was visible. We saw what happened at Patna airport.

Q) You are now on the Congress star campaigner list. Congress needs you today — so it has embraced you.

Q) Will you do a joint rally with Tejashwi Yadav?

Q) Your alliance has named Mukesh Sahni as Deputy CM face. Will Congress also get a Deputy CM?

Q) You said tickets were being sold?

Q) You said Congress has ‘nashak, satyanashak, sarvanashak and mahanashak’ leaders. Who are they?

Q) You had demanded six seats but got none.

Q) You were caught distributing money in Vaishali. EC has lodged a case.

Q) Will Pappu Yadav formally join Congress soon?

Independent MP from Purnia and Congress star campaigner Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav says Bihar’s young voters are done with the double-engine experiment and the mood on the ground is clearly shifting against the NDA In an interview with TOI online, he claimed that 11 years of BJP-JD(U) rule delivered neither industries nor smart cities nor jobs, and special status was reduced to a slogan. There is deep impatience for change, he said.Yadav admitted that candidate selection and CWC-phase indecision did hurt the INDIA bloc’s momentum but asserted that Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi’s back-to-back rallies are re-energising the campaign.I am not an astrologer. Bihar’s youth is fed up with the “double engine” government. There is anger over education, health and the broken exam system. One month of Rahul Gandhi’s SIR narrative had pushed us to 160–180 seats.But the two-month gap after CWC + 15–20 days of ticket confusion slowed the momentum. People are angry and want to vote against the NDA.Our leaders, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, are campaigning continuously, and the atmosphere is gradually turning again.On one side, you talk of offering chhath arghya from a mineral water bottle, on the other side our leaders are actually jumping into the river. They are on the ground among people.Should I abandon everything? I have been travelling across Bihar non-stop for 14 days. I am talking development, they are selling jumlas. No smart city, no industry, no talk on migration. 11 years of NDA made Bihar a toy. They keep crying “jungle-raj”.We paid the price for that for 20 years. Now answer for your 11 years — your goonda-raj and inspector-raj.The PM who cannot get one sugar mill started — what will he do in India? I had promised an airport in six months and I got it. Promised connectivity — I delivered Vande Bharat, Amrit Bharat and 14 trains.I only said “welcome, sir” on stage. Seemanchal loves — they hate Seemanchal.If Lalan Singh talks so big — why didn’t he get Vande Bharat from Munger? Why no airports in Bhagalpur, Raxaul and Muzaffarpur?Whatever I say — I do. Within three years, I will deliver and make Seemanchal No.1.This happens everywhere. Giriraj said the BJP should not live in illusion. Manjhi said NDA will suffer. Kushwaha said all is not well. Today, Nitish Kumar didn’t attend PM’s road show — his “aukaat” was shown. Only Lalan Singh was sent.I am a simple man. Politics is dirty — you do what you don’t like. Everyone abuses me — I embrace everyone.We all have our work. Congress has sent me as a worker. We are doing mazdoori — working like animals. Why should others enter my courtyard? I do my job, Tejashwi his, Rahul Ji his.Rahul Gandhi wants 90% people to get economic, social, political share. EBC has already been announced as Deputy CM. We will give SC and minority Deputy CMs too.Yes. Except for my party, tickets are sold everywhere like cattle. We sacrificed two sitting seats. Only Congress can do this. You find out where 12 crore was the rate.Criminals/mafia get tickets. If you plant babool, you cannot get dates. People worship caste-criminals — so leaders revolve around them.Yes, I said it. What’s the problem? I have given all four names to my leader.Media accused that seats were decided by me. Will Krishna Allavaru follow me or Rahul Gandhi?I got an IT notice — am I not even worth two lakh? I take money from friends to help people. Where in MCC is it written “don’t feed the hungry”? I was not contesting Vaishali. It’s not my area. River erosion happened — I went to help.I am fully Rahul-Priyanka.

Asian stocks traded mostly in red on Tuesday as investors weighed Wall Street’s tech rally amid concerns of tech bubble formation in the sector. Traders were also remaining cautious as Fed officials gave mixed signals about the next interest rate move.Japan's Nikkei traded in red, down 188 points or 0.36% to reach 52,222 at 9:30, AM IST.Shanghai and Shenzhen, also plunged 0.19% and 1.27%, respectively.South Korean Kospi also slipped 1.62%, to trade at 4,153.Meanwhile in Hong Kong, HSI gained 45 points to reach 26,203.A wave of multi-billion-dollar spending on artificial intelligence has driven a global rally in technology shares this year. Valuations have climbed to record levels, helped by a calmer trade environment following US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement in April and expectations that borrowing costs will continue to fall.However, analysts say the advance is increasingly being powered by a fear of missing out, raising speculation that a sharp correction could follow as gains become concentrated primarily in technology stocks.Adding to the sector’s momentum, ChatGPT-creator OpenAI signed a $38 billion deal with Amazon’s AWS cloud business, the latest in a string of major partnerships that also include Oracle, Broadcom, AMD and Nvidia.On Wall Street, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed higher on Monday, though the Dow fell into negative territory.However, Asia failed to replicate Monday’s momentum. Hong Kong, Wellington, Manila and Jakarta posted gains, while Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Seoul and Taipei slipped. Shanghai was unchanged.Comments from Federal Reserve policymakers added to the cautious mood. Chair Jerome Powell signalled last week that a third rate cut this year was not guaranteed, even after reductions at the past two meetings.Governor Lisa Cook warned that inflation may stay elevated as tariffs filter through the economy, noting that some companies were choosing to clear excess stock rather than immediately pass higher costs on to consumers.Fresh economic data released Monday pointed to more strain in the US economy, with a key manufacturing activity index contracting for the eighth consecutive month in October as demand and output weakened.","Japan's Nikkei traded in red, down 188 points or 0.36% to reach 52,222 at 9:30, AM IST.

NEW DELHI: Voting began on Tuesday for the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) elections, with students casting their votes to elect a new central panel and school councillors.Polling started at 9 am and will continue till 5.30 pm, with a lunch break between 1 pm and 2.30 pm.Counting of votes will start at 9 pm, and results are expected on November 6, according to the university’s election committee. For the first time, the JNUSU Election Committee has launched a website to live-stream the counting process.A total of 20 candidates are contesting for the four key positions on the central panel — president, vice-president, general secretary, and joint secretary.The election committee has reported that 9,043 students are eligible to vote this year. Women candidates represent approximately 30 percent of central panel nominations and 25 percent of school councillor positions.Flags of rival student groups — from the Left Unity to ABVP, NSUI and others — flutter across hostels as voting begins, marking one of the most politically vibrant student elections in the country.This year’s contest is shaping up as a direct face-off between the Left Unity — a coalition of the All India Students’ Association (AISA), Students’ Federation of India (SFI) and Democratic Students’ Federation (DSF) — and the ABVP, which has campaigned aggressively on a platform of “performance and nationalism.”The mandatory 24-hour “no-campaigning” period came into effect after the high-voltage presidential debate that began post-midnight on Monday — the grand finale of the campaign season — where six candidates from the Left, ABVP, NSUI, Progressive Students’ Association (PSA), Disha Students’ Organisation (DSO) and independent panels faced off before a packed audience at the Students’ Activity Centre. The BAPSA nominee missed the debate due to personal reasons.Left Unity’s presidential candidate Aditi Mishra, a PhD scholar from the School of International Studies, said the polls were being held “at a time when dissent and equality are under threat,” vowing to defend “an inclusive JNU that remains accessible to all.”Her main rival, ABVP’s Vikas Patel, countered that the Left had “ruled and ruined JNU for five decades,” saying students now wanted “accountability and solution-oriented politics.”Other contenders, including PSA’s Shinde Vijayalaxmi Vyankat Rao, NSUI’s Vikash and independent candidate Angad Singh, criticised both dominant blocs for neglecting key student issues such as research funding, hostel safety and fellowships. Rao’s impassioned speech — punctuated with poetry by Bashir Badr — drew loud applause from the crowd.The Left Unity panel comprises Aditi Mishra (President), Kizhakoot Gopika Babu (Vice-President), Sunil Yadav (General Secretary) and Danish Ali (Joint Secretary), while the ABVP panel includes Vikas Patel (President), Tanya Kumari (Vice-President), Rajeshwar Kant Dubey (General Secretary) and Anuj (Joint Secretary).In last year’s election, AISA’s Nitish Kumar won the president’s post, while ABVP’s Vaibhav Meena broke the Left’s decade-long streak by securing the Joint Secretary position — a result the ABVP hailed as a “historic shift” in JNU politics.With campaigning now over, the once poster-covered walls of JNU have fallen silent. Yet anticipation runs high as thousands of students prepare to cast their votes in one of India’s most watched student elections — often seen as a mirror to the nation’s broader ideological shifts.",Voting began on Tuesday for the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) elections.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Lawsuit links Steve Ballmer and Kawhi Leonard to secret payment scheme



Previously, the LA Clippers and Steve Ballmer denied wrongdoing



Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer is facing fresh controversy as 11 investors in the now-defunct financial firm Aspiration have filed a lawsuit accusing him of secretly funneling millions of dollars to star forward Kawhi Leonard.The investors allege that Ballmer used Aspiration, rebranded as Catona, to circumvent NBA salary cap rules by indirectly paying Leonard more than allowed under league regulations. The lawsuit, which surfaced through journalist Pablo Torre’s reporting, paints a complex picture of hidden deals and financial deception tied to the Clippers organization.The complaint also claims that Ballmer was “complicit in and aided and abetted [Aspiration co-founder Joe] Sanberg’s fraud for his own self-serving purpose.” According to the plaintiffs, Ballmer’s financial support kept the company afloat and concealed what they describe as an elaborate effort to benefit the team’s biggest star.According to court filings obtained by Pablo Torre, the investors accuse Ballmer of transferring funds through Aspiration to Kawhi Leonard to “induce Leonard to re-sign with the Clippers by covertly paying him more than allowed by the NBA’s salary cap rules.”The lawsuit further alleges that Ballmer’s actions misled investors about the true nature of his involvement with the company. “Absent Ballmer’s support, [Aspiration] could not have sustained the frauds set forth herein,” the complaint states.Plaintiffs claim they would not have invested in or maintained their financial stake in the company had they known about Ballmer’s alleged involvement in this hidden arrangement.Skip Miller, a Los Angeles-based attorney representing the plaintiffs, said, “A lot of people have been hurt here. This lawsuit is being brought to recoup their losses. We look forward to our day in court, where everything will be aired out and justice will be done.”The investors also allege that Ballmer funneled other funds into Aspiration to buy Sanberg’s “cooperation and silence” about the supposed secret deal with Leonard. The full scope of these transfers, they say, will be revealed during discovery.Ballmer and the Clippers have consistently denied any attempts to bypass NBA salary rules, insisting that both he and the team were defrauded by Aspiration. The organization maintains that its business with the company was tied only to sustainability efforts and carbon offset purchases linked to the upcoming Intuit Dome. “Unfortunately he was duped on the investment and some parts of this agreement, as were many other investors and employees,” the Clippers said in a statement.Still, questions persist. Torre’s reporting reveals that Ballmer continued sending grants to entities associated with Sanberg even after the Clippers cut ties with Aspiration in 2023, prompting scrutiny over when Ballmer realized the extent of the alleged fraud.Further update on the fresh lawsuit awaits.Also Read: Who is Lester Jones?

India–China trade ties: Chinese goods set to re-enter Indian markets — Why government is allowing it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indiachina-trade-ties-chinese-goods-set-to-re-enter-indian-markets-why-government-is-allowing-it/articleshow/125073826.cms,"GST rate cuts fuel more demand





BIS approval





Diplomatic ties ease too









Chinese goods are set to re-enter Indian markets after nearly four years of stalled clearances triggered by tensions with Beijing.The government is working to quickly process pending applications from local companies seeking to bring in electronics components, footwear, everyday household items, steel products, raw materials and other finished goods. These imports require mandatory certification of the overseas manufacturing plant before they can be shipped into India.The approvals had been halted since early 2020, after border clashes between India and China led to deteriorating diplomatic ties. Local factories received quick clearances, while approvals for overseas, particularly Chinese, units were held up, causing supply chain delays, according to ET.The freeze comes to an end as demand jumps sharply across consumer sectors, fuelled by GST cuts that prompted companies to slash prices to pass on the benefits of September 22 rate cuts and clear inventories faster than expected.Automobiles, large-screen televisions, washing machines, dishwashers and refrigerators have all seen unusually high sales, leaving manufacturers struggling to restock. Waiting periods have emerged for premium electronics for the first time, and companies say the backlog could take weeks to resolve.To address the situation, the department for promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) recently wrote to manufacturers, asking for “company-wise details where foreign manufacturers' certification scheme is getting delayed.” The department has also sought updated information from industry bodies and associations.A senior government official said, “We will soon begin issuing and renewing licences for suppliers from several countries, including China.”“We will initiate the process and assess applications on a case-by-case basis,” the official further told ET.Under the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) rules, certification is mandatory for any unit, domestic or foreign, that manufactures goods covered under the Quality Control Order. BIS teams physically inspect overseas factories before approvals are granted. While domestic facilities were cleared without delay, the approvals for foreign plants, particularly in China, slowed significantly, disrupting supply chains in India.The renewed processing of certificates also follows recent positive movement in India–China trade engagements. China has resumed exports of heavy rare earth magnets to India after a six-month pause, easing pressure on manufacturers in electric mobility, renewable energy and consumer electronics.In recent years, the government has deliberately kept BIS approvals slow as part of its push to build domestic capacities and increase localisation. Industry players have repeatedly argued that the transition requires time. Localisation levels differ across categories, for instance, only about half the components used in air-conditioners are sourced domestically, while the remainder is imported, ET reported.The chief executive of a major electronics firm that relies on Chinese components said the policy relaxation was necessary because, while the government continued to push for local value addition, often local production and supply chain was suffering due to scarce availability of domestic inputs.The accelerated clearances are expected to help manufacturers restore inventories and prevent further shortages during the festive and year-end buying season.Political signals have also shifted. Direct flights between the two countries have restarted, and India has begun clearing business visas for Chinese nationals.This follows Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to China in August, where he met President Xi Jinping. Investment flows from China, however, remain subject to approval under Press Note 3.","Chinese goods are set to re-enter Indian markets after nearly four years of stalled clearances triggered by tensions with Beijing.

Control of Tesla is at stake in vote on Elon Musk's pay plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/control-of-tesla-is-at-stake-in-vote-on-elon-musks-pay-plan/articleshow/125072569.cms,"A Tesla dealership in Las Vegas, March 29, 2025.





Tesla's shareholders will decide this week whether the automaker should award its CEO, Elon Musk, stock worth almost $1 trillion if he achieves a series of impossible-sounding goals.But there are big questions about how tough those goals really are.Musk would acquire voting control over nearly 29% of Tesla shares if he met all of the targets in a 10-year performance plan. Among other things, the company would have to deploy 1 million humanlike robots and boost its stock market value to $8.5 trillion from $1.4 trillion today.That sounds difficult. But the plan would also allow Tesla's board of directors to grant Musk a portion of the shares even if he fell short. Some corporate governance experts said the board, which includes Musk's brother and several long-standing friends and business associates, could award him shares regardless of his performance.""These are not independent decision-makers,"" said Dorothy Lund, a professor at Columbia Law School who teaches and writes about corporate governance.She cited a Delaware court decision that struck down a previous pay plan for Musk in part because the judge found that many Tesla directors were too close to him personally or owed their wealth to him.Tesla has criticized that decision as violating the will of Tesla shareholders, who approved the earlier plan by large margins twice. The Delaware Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on the company's appeal.Tesla's board is ""very active, very independent, and I think the outside world doesn't appreciate it,"" Robyn Denholm, the board's chair, said in a September interview with The New York Times.Supporters of Musk said the board should have some leeway in awarding shares because markets and technology could change. They also contend that they don't believe that he would be given shares he had not truly earned.""I don't see that as a big concern,"" said Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research. ""As controversial as Musk is, he sets big goals, and in time he attains these goals and surpasses them.""Denholm said there were no escape clauses for a key part of the plan that would require Musk to raise Tesla's stock price by 500%. ""Market capitalization -- the market's verdict on real value -- can't be 'gamed' through aggressive pricing or other tactics to create illusory growth,"" she said in a letter to shareholders.Tesla, Musk and their critics have been waging contentious campaigns before the company's annual meeting on Thursday. The fight has distinct echoes of the hostility that characterizes American politics. Musk's right-wing politics appear to be at play, too, with state pension managers in states governed by Democrats, like California and New York, opposing the pay plan and those in Republican-run states, like Florida, supporting it.Even Pope Leo XIV has weighed in, citing Musk's pay as an example of the gap between rich and poor. ""If that is the only thing that has value anymore, then we're in big trouble,"" he told Crux, a Roman Catholic news site, this summer.Musk and his critics are agreed on one thing -- this is a fight over how much influence he has over Tesla. Musk has said he is more interested in greater voting control than in money. After taxes, his stake would be around 25%. While that is well short of a majority, in practice it would be very difficult to pass measures he opposed.""I don't think it's an overstatement to say that it would revive the era of robber barons who wielded near-absolute control,"" Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, said during a conference call organized by SOC Investment Group, an organization associated with labor unions that opposes Musk's compensation plan.Tesla's board sees the plan as a way to motivate him as he transforms the company from primarily selling electric cars to making robots and self-driving taxis.The board points to Musk's achievements. Tesla is the only profitable U.S. electric carmaker. His admirers in and out of the company see him as the only person who can deliver products that usher in ""sustainable abundance.""But Tesla's robots and self-driving cars may not generate significant revenue, let alone profits, for years. Skeptics say some of his promises, including that Tesla robots could care for children or perform surgery, are far-fetched.Musk told investors and analysts in October that he needed to have strong influence over the ""robot army"" that Tesla would build. His supporters interpreted that as a desire to prevent control from falling into the wrong hands.""Control of Tesla could affect the future of civilization,"" Musk said on X, his social media platform.Visions of futuristic products are central to Tesla's lofty stock-market valuation, said John Paul MacDuffie, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who focuses on transportation. Wall Street values Tesla at more than four times the value of Toyota Motor, the world's largest car company by sales.""Musk has persuaded some investors that everyone is going to be in a robotaxi,"" MacDuffie said. ""I don't buy it.""For Musk to collect the whole package, which is broken into 12 parts, Tesla would have to achieve milestones like selling 10 million subscriptions to self-driving software and increasing earnings before depreciation and other items to $400 billion from $17 billon last year.""He doesn't get any compensation if he doesn't deliver,"" Denholm said during the Times interview at Tesla's California offices.She said Musk required enormous compensation because he was driven to do things ""that no one else has done before, doing things that further humankind.""But the board could give him some of the shares if it determined that he had missed a product target because of natural disasters, war, interference by government regulators or other, unspecified circumstances.It would be possible ""for Mr. Musk to earn at least the first three tranches of the award without meeting a single operational milestone,"" according to a report by Glass Lewis, a firm that advises investors on shareholder votes. Each tranche includes stock worth tens of billions of dollars.Glass Lewis and ISS Stoxx, another advisory firm, recently recommended that investors reject the pay package. During a conference call last month, Musk accused the firms of ""corporate terrorism.""Tesla said in a letter to shareholders that the firms' opinions were flawed. ""Their analysis cannot distinguish between innovation and risk, or between ambition and mismanagement,"" the company said.ISS declined to comment on Musk's remark. Glass Lewis said in a statement that it offered ""informed analysis and recommendations to our clients worldwide.""Tesla's board has created a website to promote the pay plan and has run video ads on social media. Musk has posted about the shareholder vote more than 60 times in recent months.The intensity of the campaign reflects the board's eagerness to win the vote by a wide margin to mute criticism, said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Colorado School of Law.Many analysts expect the plan to pass because Musk is allowed to vote his own shares in Texas, where the company moved its incorporation after losing the Delaware case on his earlier pay package. He controls about 15% of the total. But if the new pay package secures fewer than half of shares owned by outside investors, it could hurt Tesla's reputation, Lipton said during the SOC conference call.""The mythology of Elon Musk kind of depends on the perception that he has the continuing devotion of Tesla shareholders,"" she said.Tesla's board said in a statement that the intensity of its campaign ""is being driven by the significance of this election to the future of Tesla"" and the need to reach smaller investors who collectively own a lot of the company's stock.Investors will vote on other important measures, including an investor's proposal that calls for Tesla to invest in xAI, Musk's privately held artificial intelligence company. The board has taken no position on that measure, but Musk favors it.Shareholders will also vote on a proposal by Thomas DiNapoli, the New York state comptroller, to eliminate a restriction on shareholder lawsuits. After moving its corporate domicile to Texas, Tesla took advantage of a state law allowing it to ban suits by shareholders who own less than 3% of the company. Only a few investment funds meet that threshold.Tesla's board maintains that the restriction protects the company from suits by people who don't represent the views of a significant number of shareholders.Investors can still band together to clear that threshold, the board said in a regulatory filing. DiNapoli, who oversees a pension fund that owns about $1.5 billion in Tesla stock, said that was impractical and wants any shareholder to be able to sue.Denholm warned shareholders in a letter last week that if they rejected the pay plan, Musk might quit. ""We run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision.""To Musk's supporters, threatening to walk is a normal way to negotiate. But Randall Peterson, a professor at London Business School who studies corporate boards, said the dependence on a single executive was a red flag.""The graveyards are filled with indispensable men,"" Peterson said.","Tesla shareholders will decide this week whether the automaker should award its CEO, Elon Musk, stock. Musk would acquire voting control over nearly 29% of Tesla shares if he met all of the targets.

Shein controversy: Retailer bans all sex dolls worldwide; France warned over ‘childlike’ listings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shein-controversy-retailer-bans-all-sex-dolls-worldwide-france-warned-over-childlike-listings/articleshow/125074690.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)





Chinese-founded fashion and e-commerce giant Shein has announced a worldwide ban on all sex-doll products after French authorities accused it of selling dolls resembling children and warned the company could be banned from the French market.As per news agency AFP, France’s anti-fraud office, DGCCRF, said the listings on Shein’s website were “childlike” and of a likely pornographic nature.The Paris prosecutors’ office confirmed investigations had been opened against Shein, AliExpress, Temu, and Wish for distributing “messages that are violent, pornographic or improper” and accessible to minors.As per CNN, Shein removed the products immediately after France’s warning and launched an internal review, later announcing a “complete ban on all sex-doll-type products.” It also temporarily removed its adult products category for review.A company spokesperson quoted by AFP said that the ban applies globally.“These publications came from third-party vendors, but I take personal responsibility,” said Shein’s executive chairman Donald Tang, adding that “the fight against child exploitation is non-negotiable for Shein.”French finance minister Roland Lescure told BFMTV that the government could legally block Shein’s access to the market if such violations recur.“These horrible items are illegal,” he said, stressing that France would act firmly against the retailer.According to news agency AP, under French law, distributing child-pornographic material online is punishable by up to seven years in prison and a €100,000 fine.The scandal comes days before Shein’s first physical store opening in Paris’s BHV Marais department store — a move already facing backlash from activists and lawmakers.Some brands have withdrawn their products from BHV following the controversy, while France has fined Shein three times in 2025 for cookie law breaches, false advertising, misleading information, and undeclared plastic microfibres.","Shein has announced a worldwide ban on all sex-doll products after French authorities accused it of selling dolls resembling children.

Influencer sparks backlash after suggesting SNAP recipients be given ‘prison loaf’ instead of food benefits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/influencer-sparks-backlash-after-suggesting-snap-recipients-be-given-prison-loaf-instead-of-food-benefits/articleshow/125062748.cms,"The influencer’s suggestion to replace SNAP benefits with “prison loaf,” a bland disciplinary meal once served in US jails, drew nationwide outrage/ Image: File





A bland meal with a bitter debate

“The point of

EBT

is to ensure people don’t starve to death. That’s it,” Yap wrote. “Even if we agree that’s a worthwhile goal, it can be achieved with Nutraloaf.”

“Nutraloaf provides the correct incentives: you won’t starve and you’ll be motivated to earn enough money to eat real food again.”

How a prison meal became a political flashpoint

'Heartless' or 'pragmatic'? Internet is divided

“We should treat the poor like we treat misbehaving prisoners, is def a take I expect from u,”

“You’re a horrible person,”

“Being poor is not a sin that must be ‘atoned’ for by suffering, you soulless ghoul,

: “They can opt out at any time by simply paying for their own food.”

. “At any other time in history, and in much of the world today, Diane’s proposal of free nutritionally complete food would be considered extremely generous, but it’s not hot Cheeto-flavored so apparently it’s immensely cruel.”

“This is extreme but yes EBT should be strictly limited to rice, chicken, beans, veggie, lower carb pasta, pork to ensure people get the best value for the taxpayer buck.”

SNAP in crisis: millions face a hunger cliff

Hunger, dignity, and the politics of poverty





It goes by many names, nutraloaf, prison loaf, meal loaf, disciplinary loaf, confinement loaf, seg loaf, grue, or “special management meal.” Once reserved for misbehaving inmates in US prisons, the dense, beige slab of mashed protein, vegetables, and carbohydrates has suddenly become a flashpoint in America’s fight over poverty, dignity, and government aid.The catalyst was Diane Yap, founder of the Friends of Lowell Foundation, a nonprofit defending merit-based admissions at a top San Francisco high school. In a now-viral post on X, Yap argued that rather than offering food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the US government should simply distribute nutraloaf to low-income Americans.Her proposal, equal parts utilitarian and, to many, strikingly tone-deaf, instantly set social media ablaze.Nutraloaf was designed for prisons, a meal compact enough to deliver full nutrition but simple enough to serve without utensils — useful when dealing with inmates who had misused or weaponised cutlery. It resembles meatloaf but is typically blander, made from mashed vegetables, grains, and proteins.Once a routine disciplinary tool in correctional facilities across the United States and formerly in Canada, its use has long been controversial.Lawsuits have challenged its legality; in 2008, Vermont’s Supreme Court ruled against serving it as punishment, and four states, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York, have since banned its use altogether.Supporters maintain it’s nutritionally balanced and inexpensive. Critics call it dehumanising. And now, Yap’s suggestion to bring it outside prison walls has triggered fresh outrage, this time not from inmates, but from the public.Yap’s post came as more than 42 million Americans faced uncertainty over their food assistance benefits amid a prolonged government shutdown. Federal judges have ordered the Trump administration to explain how it plans to fund SNAP, also known as food stamps, after federal funding ran dry.With payments halting over the weekend, Yap wrote that many recipients “abuse the system by buying junk food or luxuries.” SNAP’s average household benefit stands at $332 per month, with families with children receiving about $574, and an average family of four receiving $715, roughly $6 per person per day.Online, Yap’s idea drew a torrent of condemnation.one user wrote.said another.” added a third.Yap respondedStill, some defended her argumentone commenter wrote.Another added:Behind the online clash lies a very real crisis. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program feeds more than 42 million Americans, including low-income families, veterans, the elderly, and people with disabilities. It was “invented as a way to help families afford meals in the face of rising food costs,” and remains one of the US’s most significant anti-hunger safety nets.SNAP operates through Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards, reloadable debit cards topped up monthly for purchasing food. The benefits cannot be spent on alcohol, tobacco, nonfood items, or most takeout meals.The programme costs around $8 billion a month and is federally funded through the Farm Bill but administered by individual states. For fiscal year 2024, SNAP received $100 billion, about 1.5% of total federal spending. Beyond preventing hunger, SNAP acts as an economic stabiliser, freeing up household budgets for rent, utilities, and essentials such as diapers, clothing, and medicine.This month’s government shutdown froze that funding. Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled that the US Department of Agriculture must use $5.25 billion (£4 billion) in emergency funds to continue partial payments. They gave the Trump administration until Monday at 12:00 EST (17:00 GMT) to report on how it intends to restore benefits.US President Donald Trump had earlier said he had directed government lawyers to seek guidance from the courts on how the administration could legally fund SNAP, adding, “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed.”Speaking on CNN on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed the president’s remarks, noting that Mr. Trump wanted the courts to clarify how funds could be lawfully reallocated to resume SNAP payments, which he said could go out as early as Wednesday.The funding crisis follows a statement from the USDA late last month, announcing that food assistance funds would not be distributed starting 1 November due to the ongoing government shutdown. “The well has run dry,” the department said at the time.In response, half the states, along with the District of Columbia, have filed lawsuits against the administration, arguing that they are legally required to keep the SNAP programme running within their jurisdictions despite the freeze.Yap’s comments struck a nerve because they blurred a delicate moral line: the difference between ensuring survival and preserving dignity. To her critics, replacing SNAP with nutraloaf reduces poverty to punishment. To her defenders, it spotlights waste in a system that, they argue, too often enables dependency.But the timing made the post especially volatile. As millions wait to see whether courts will authorise emergency food aid, the idea of feeding poor Americans “prison loaf” feels, to many, like a grim metaphor for the nation’s political paralysis.SNAP was built to prevent hunger, not to police taste or ambition. Yet the debate it has reignited reveals something deeper: a country divided not just by wealth, but by its understanding of what compassion should look like when the cupboard runs bare.","Diane Yap, founder of the Friends of Lowell Foundation, suggested replacing food stamps with 'prison loaf' The bland, beige slab of mashed protein, vegetables, and carbohydrates has suddenly become a flashpoint in America’s fight over poverty, dignity, and government aid.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125067032,imgsize-593961,width-400,resizemode-4/snap-vs-nutraloaf.jpg"
'Severe water shortages': Pakistan faces 'acute risk' after India’s IWT suspension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/severe-water-shortages-pakistan-faces-acute-risk-after-indias-iwt-suspension-report/articleshow/125001055.cms,"AI-generated image used for representation

Pakistan Issues Naval Warning as Its War Games Overlap with India’s Military Drills





Pakistan, heavily dependent on the waters of the Indus basin, faces a acute risk of insufficient water storage after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year, according to the Ecological Threat Report 2025.The report, released by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a Sydney-based independent and non-profit think tank, says the suspension gives India the ability to control the westward flow of the Indus and its tributaries into Pakistan. The move came after India decided to put the treaty in abeyance as a punitive measure following the Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 this year.This marks a major setback for Pakistan, whose agriculture depends 80 per cent on the Indus River system. The report highlighted that Pakistan’s dams can currently hold only about 30 days of Indus flow, leaving the country highly vulnerable to disruptions.“Pakistan lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations,” the report warned, adding, “If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons.Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers.”While India’s infrastructure limits its ability to completely stop river flows, even small disruptions could have ""disastrous"" short-term effects on Pakistan’s farm sector.In May, India carried out “reservoir flushing” operations at the Salal and Baglihar dams on the Chenab River without notifying Pakistan. This process, used to remove silt by draining reservoirs, had been restricted under the treaty due to the risk of sudden downstream changes.The impact was immediate: parts of the Chenab River in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for several days when India shut the dam gates and later released sediment-filled torrents upon reopening them.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 and mediated by the World Bank, has long acted as a key tool for water-sharing and conflict resolution between the two countries. It governs the use of the Indus River and its six major tributaries -- five on the left bank and one on the right.","India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year.

India-Bangladesh trade tensions :







Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade, marking a notable outcome of the 9th Pak–Bangladesh Joint Economic Commission (JEC) meeting -- the first such dialogue in two decades. The development arrives at a sensitive moment, as Dhaka’s relations with New Delhi grow increasingly strained following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina regime.According to the Pakistani news outlet Samaa TV, the port access would allow Dhaka to expand its trade network with China and Central Asian countries.According to the official statement, the two sides emphasized stronger cooperation between their national shipping lines, the news outlet reported.Pakistan’s decision to open Karachi Port to Bangladeshi vessels is expected to streamline trade routes for Dhaka, while also expanding opportunities for commercial engagement across regional and neighboring markets.Trade tensions between India and Bangladesh have been rising, with New Delhi imposing a series of restrictions on Dhaka’s exports this year. Most recently, India banned the import of select jute products and ropes from Bangladesh via all land routes, requiring shipments to be rerouted through the Nhava Sheva seaport in Maharashtra.These measures follow multiple earlier curbs that limited a wide range of Bangladeshi goods, including garments, processed foods, and jute fabrics, to seaborne entry only. India also withdrew a key transshipment facility in April, further tightening trade access and signaling a deepening strain in bilateral commercial ties.The latest trade curbs unfold amid heightened political friction, following comments made in China by Bangladesh’s interim government chief Muhammad Yunus that sparked sharp criticism across India’s political spectrum. Ties have also deteriorated over Dhaka’s inability to prevent rising violence against minorities, particularly the Hindu community.","Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade.

A solid gold toilet is up for auction.

Guggenheim Museum in New York. (AP Photo, File)





LONDON: For sale: The world's most valuable toilet, a lavatory literally worth its weight in gold. Sotheby's announced Friday it will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan entitled ""America. ""The auction house calls it an ""incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value."" It's also a fully functional toilet, identical to one that gained global fame when it was stolen in an audacious heist from England's Blenheim Palace in 2019.The starting price at the Nov 18 auction in New York will be the price of the just over 101.2kg of gold used to make it - about $10 million.David Galperin, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's in New York, said Cattelan is ""the consummate art world provocateur."" He's also one of most successful, an artist whose work ""Comedian,"" a banana duct-taped to a wall, sold at a New York auction last year for $6.2 million. ""Him"" - Cattelan's unsettling sculpture of a kneeling Adolf Hitler - sold for $17.2 million at a Christie's auction in 2016.The artist has said ""America"" satirises excessive wealth.""Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise,"" he once said.Two versions of ""America"" were created in 2016. The one being sold has been owned by an unnamed collector since 2017. The other version went on display in a bathroom at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2016. More than 100,000 visitors queued up to - to put it delicately - interact with the work.The Guggenheim offered the work to US President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.In 2019, it went on show at Blenheim Palace, the English country manor that was the birthplace of Winston Churchill. Within days, it was stolen by burglars who broke into the building, forcibly wrenched it from the plumbing, and fled. Two men were convicted earlier this year and jailed. The toilet has never been recovered. Investigators think it was likely broken up and melted down.Galperin is unwilling to speculate on how much ""America"" could sell for. He notes that Cattelan's duct-taped banana posed questions about ""how one assigns value to something that has, in essence, no value aside from its authorship and its conceptual idea.""'America' is in many ways the complete inverse of that. It is a perfect foil in that this work has a lot of intrinsic value in a way that most artworks do not,"" he said ""The question of the proportion of value between the raw materials and the artistic idea is very on the table here.""""America"" will go on display at Sotheby's new New York headquarters, the Breuer Building, from Nov 8 until the auction. It will be in a bathroom, and visitors will be able to see it up close and personal.At Guggenheim and Blenheim Palace, the toilet was connected to the plumbing system and visitors could book a 3-minute appointment to use it. This time, visitors won't be able to use it - they can look, but they can't flush.","Sotheby's will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan.
