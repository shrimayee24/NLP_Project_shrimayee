Indian-origin bar owner sentenced in Singapore for raping runaway 17-year-old girl,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-origin-bar-owner-sentenced-in-singapore-for-raping-runaway-17-year-old-girl/articleshow/111592765.cms,"NEW DELHI: An Indian-origin bar owner was sentenced to jail on Monday for raping a runaway 17-year-old girl after allowing her to work for him. Raj Kumar Bala, 42, was sentenced to jail for 13 years and four weeks. According to Channel News Asia, Bala, 42, was convicted of a charge each of raping and molesting the victim and pleaded guilty to a third charge of harbouring a runaway under the Children and Young Persons Act.In February 2020, the victim, then 17, ran away from the Singapore Girls' Home and learned about a job opening at Bala's Don Bar and Bistro in Dunlop Street, Little India. She was informed about the position by another runaway already employed there, who had also been sexually assaulted by Bala, a charge currently on hold.The victim visited the bar for a job interview with Bala, who outlined her responsibilities, including serving customers and making drinks. Bala offered her the job and mentioned she could stay at the bar with other runaways. After working for a few days, the police received a tip-off about absconders employed there and raided the bar in the early hours of February 22, 2020. The victim fled with another girl to evade the raid but was later picked up by Bala.He drove them to his condominium, telling them they could stay there, before drinking alcohol with the girls. He raped the victim while she was heavily intoxicated and also engaged in sexual acts with the other girl.The victim left the condominium and turned herself in to the Singapore Girls' Home in July 2020, only revealing to her case worker in August 2020 that she had been raped.Justice Mavis Chionh acknowledged the ""considerable personal harm"" the victim endured, noting that the victim blamed herself for being intoxicated, which she believes led to the incident.Her court testimony, supported by her former boyfriend, highlighted how her past trauma continues to affect her well-being, the judge observed. Justice Chionh also noted that Bala was aware of the victim's young age, her fugitive status, and her dependency on him for income and shelter.Bala faces additional charges and has yet to decide how he will address them. According to ""The Straits Times,"" the bar owner has 22 more charges pending in court related to sex offences involving five other victims.He is accused of raping and molesting a victim identified in court documents as B1, raping and sexually assaulting a victim identified as B5 and raping, molesting and threatening another victim identified as B6.He is also accused of sexually penetrating a minor under the age of 16, identified as B7, and molesting and causing alarm to another victim, identified as B8.","Raj Kumar Bala, 42, was sentenced to jail for 13 years and four weeks.

Acreage of water-guzzling paddy, on the other hand, has so far increased by merely 19%.The country had even reported higher acreage of Kharif crops in June compared to the corresponding period in 2023, despite a bigger deficit in monsoon rainfall for the month. Though both the years — 2023 and 2024 — reported deficit rainfall in June, the deficit this year (11%) was bigger than the deficit (9%) last year. Nevertheless, acreage of Kharif crops as on June 28 this year was 59 lakh hectares (over 32%) more than the corresponding period of last year.Agriculture ministry’s acreage data shows that the total sown area in the country as on June 28 was 240 lakh hectares compared to 181 lakh hectares during the same period last year.“Since many areas did not receive rainfall in June, farmers preferred to opt for less water-consuming pulses (arhar) and oilseeds (soybean) over water-guzzling paddy. Such smart choices could see higher acreage this June compared to the same month last year,” said an official.The sown area is expected to increase further in July as there is a forecast of ‘above normal’ rainfall for the month. “Fairly good distributed rainfall during July-September will, hopefully, increase the Kharif acreage this year over the normal (average of last five years) acreage of the season,” said the official.",The monsoon rainfall over the country as a whole turned from 11% deficit on June 30 to 2% surplus on July 8.

army

Russia laid out the red carpet for PM Narendra Modi as he landed in Moscow on Monday to attend the 22nd India-Russia annual summit , the first since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Before the talks on Tuesday, President Vladimir Putin held a private dinner for Modi during which the two discussed bilateral cooperation that has deepened in the recent past on the back of India's increased oil imports from Russia.According to govt sources, the visit will focus on economic issues, including energy, trade, manufacturing and fertilisers. The visit will also be used by the PM to convey to Putin, as an official source put it, that ""no solution can be found on the battlefield"" to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Ahead of leaving for Moscow for his first bilateral visit in his third term, Modi said he's looking forward to sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues.Ahead of leaving for Moscow, PM Modi said he's looking forward to sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues; and that India seeks to play a supportive role for a peaceful and stable region. Like China, India never explicitly condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine.While backing dialogue and diplomacy for enduring peace, India has also maintained that any such process must involve both the parties. The last annual summit took place in 2021 when Putin visited India. The two did meet though on the margins of the SCO summit in Samarkand in 2022, where Modi famously told Putin this isn't the era of war. He's expected to convey a similar message on this occasion too, in line with India's emphasis on dialogue and diplomacy as the only realistic way of resolving the conflict.Modi will co-chair the summit on Tuesday with Putin and also interact with the members of Indian community in Moscow. In his meeting with Putin, Modi is expected to also seek the release of Indian men fighting for the Russian army in the Ukraine war. Putin hosted Modi at his private residence in Novo-Ogaryovo, a Moscow suburb.""The Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia has advanced over the past 10 years, including in the areas of energy, security, trade, investment, health, education, culture, tourism and people-to-people exchanges,"" said Modi, adding he's looking forward to reviewing all aspects of bilateral cooperation with his ""friend"" Putin.In a post on X, Modi also said stronger ties between our nations will greatly benefit people of both countries. The PM, who is visiting Russia for the first time in five years, was received by first deputy PM of Russia, Denis Manturov. Indian officials said Manturov is senior to the deputy PM who received Chinese President during his visit to Russia. Manturov also accompanied Modi to the hotel from the airport in the same car.About his visit to Austria starting late on Tuesday, the first by an Indian PM in 41 years, Modi said he's looking forward to discussions to take the partnership to even greater heights in new and emerging areas of innovation, technology and sustainable development among others.","PM Narendra Modi is in Moscow for the 22nd India-Russia annual summit.

Top 11k ranks spread evenly across 800 NEET centres: NTA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/top-11k-ranks-spread-evenly-across-800-neet-centres-nta/articleshow/111588080.cms,"NEW DELHI: National Testing Agency (NTA) has said that only 175 candidates from 12 centres in Patna and eight from two Godhra centres managed to score 640 or above in the NEET-UG exam. None of the candidates from the Godhra centres under scrutiny scored 680 or above, and only 35 candidates from the Patna centres achieved this score, it said.Claiming there was no "" systemic leak "", agency officials told TOI that the top 1000, 5000 and 10,000 students were distributed across the 800-plus centres and were not necessarily from the cohort of centres under scrutiny.NTA said its data analysis did not indicate a ""larger leak"" beyond Patna. It also said the candidate whose test booklet was investigated scored just 103 marks. ""Roshni, whose booklet was confiscated by Bihar Police, scored 103 marks out of 720,"" an NTA official said.Agency officials claimed that data analysis of the top 11,000 ranks showed an even distribution across 800-plus centres. Explaining the analysis, an official said following the alleged leak, NTA examined not just the top scorers but also those beyond the top 100.""We looked into the scoring patterns for each group of thousand candidates and their distribution. For example, the top 1,000 candidates are spread across 800 centres,"" the official said. He added that the top 1 lakh candidates, who are most likely to secure MBBS or dental seats, are distributed across 4,500 of the 4,750 centres, debunking allegations that toppers were concentrated in specific centres. ""If we examine even smaller groups, such as the top 5,000 candidates, they too are distributed across 780 centres,"" he said.Over 13 lakh of the 23 lakh candidates who took the medical entrance test on May 5 qualified. The official argued that if there was widespread irregularities and access to question papers as alleged, the qualification average for Patna and Godhra would have been much higher. ""The qualifying average for Patna and Godhra are not only lower than the national average but also lower than their neighbouring cities and centres,"" the official said.Another concern raised by the petitioners and the SC was the significant increase in the number of perfect scorers. This year, 67 candidates scored 720, compared to just seven in the last four years. Later, six candidates were stripped of the grace marks due to time loss, which had given them perfect scores, and were offered a retest. Five who took the retest on June 23 scored less than 720.","Only 175 candidates from 12 centres in Patna and eight from two Godhra centres managed to score 640 or above in the NEET-UG exam.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday sought a report from CBI on its investigation into the NEET-UG question paper leak by Wednesday and assured over 23 lakh students who took the exam on May 5 that it may order a retest only if the beneficiaries of the leak could not be identified and the integrity of the entrance exam for MBBS courses was found to have been completely vitiated.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra heard a batch of over 50 petitions by candidates, who through lead counsel Narender Hooda have sought cancellation of NEET-UG by citing the paper leak, first detected in Patna, and other irregularities reported from different states, by arguing that the entire examination was vitiated as the questions and answers were available on social media.The bench said a retest could be ordered only if three conditions were met - one, the alleged paper leak was systemic; two, if the leak compromised the sanctity and integrity of the entire test; and, three, if it was not possible to identify and segregate the beneficiaries of the fraud from the untainted candidates.The bench, however, emphasised that it would not order a retest ""if the breach is confined to specific centres and it is possible to identify and segregate beneficiaries"".It should not lead to cancellation of NEET-UG given the massive scale on which it is conducted at 4,750 centres in 571 cities across India and 14 cities abroad involving more than 23 lakh students who had studied hard and undertaken cost and efforts and would have to go through a fresh test, the bench said.Every year, about 23-24 lakh students compete for 1.08 lakh MBBS seats in various medical colleges, including 56,000 govt-run ones.Posting the matters for further hearing on Thursday, the CJI-led bench said it may order a fresh test if CBI status report fulfils the three parameters and after they have gone through the responses of the National Testing Agency and the Centre on the entire gamut of questions relating to the manner and mechanism of conducting the exam - right from framing of question papers by a group of experts selected by NTA to their safe custody till distribution at the test centres. NTA and the Centre have to submit their responses by 5pm Wednesday.SC noted with surprise that compared to just seven candidates who secured full 720 marks in the previous four NEET-UG exams, the number soared to 67 this year, and asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta whether it was possible for the cyber forensic unit of the home ministry to use data analytics to scrutinise answer sheets of suspiciously high scoring candidates in order to ascertain the spread of irregularities.Mehta said govt was ready to disclose all material but insisted that the irregularities and paper leak were localised incidents which did not vitiate the sanctity or integrity of the exam across the country.The bench said, ""We have to be ruthless with those who indulged in paper leak and those who benefited from it."" It asked NTA's counsel Naresh Kaushik to inform the court of action taken against those identified as beneficiaries of irregularities.It asked NTA to inform also about the nature of the paper leak, the places where leak took place, the time gap between the leak and the actual conduct of examination on May 5, the manner and spread of leak and dissemination of the question paper through social media. CBI has to place the findings of its investigation into all these aspects, the SC said while asking NTA to detail the steps taken to identify the beneficiaries of the fraud and the modalities followed to order retest for 1,563 candidates.Pushing for a glitch-free NEET-UG and similar competitive examinations in future, the bench said to prevent such incidents, it would be necessary to set up a multi-disciplinary committee whose members command public confidence to lay down modalities and processes for conducting such exams on which the future of lakhs of students hinge.""If such a committee is already set up by the govt, full details of their credentials would be made available so that the court can modify the composition to bring together talents in the field of administration, experts in the domain and data analytics to ensure integrity of examinations,"" the bench said.",Supreme Court seeks a report from CBI on its investigation into the NEET-UG question paper leak by Wednesday.

BENGALURU: Flat owners in the city are demanding that the title deeds of the plots on which their apartments stand must be transferred in the name of their association, by way of executing a registered conveyance deed . They claim builders in Bengaluru and elsewhere in Karnataka are deliberately not doing so and this has created room for some promoters to mortgage the land or take up fresh construction activities, even after the passage of several years.Sections 11 and 17 of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) Act mandates the promoter or the builder should execute a registered conveyance deed of the undivided proportionate title in common areas to the association of allottees.This is required to be done within three months of getting the occupation certificate or the completion certificate.The flat owners were participating in a session organised by Bangalore City Flat Owners’ Association (BCFOWA), a not-for-profit organisation for apartment owners/ associations/ federations/ forums, to spread awareness on ownership, management and maintenance of apartments and properties. Over 30 members from different apartment associations were in attendance.Ganesh A, a flat owner from Uttarahalli, said: “We were first-time buyers of a flat so we weren’t aware of many things. I paid Rs 60 lakh to buy the flat. Except for the sale deed, we don’t have any other rights that talk about our ownership of the land. In the encumbrance certificate, my name is not shown; it actually scared me about ownership right on the flat I bought for a huge amount.”Bharathi Srivastava, a resident of an apartment complex in Whitefield, asked: “Without the conveyance of the title deed for the entire land, how can we ensure that fresh encumbrances aren’t created on the land?”Flat owners wonder why they are being fleeced in the name of common areas when the plot isn’t even in their name.Veena Shantharam Prabhu, who owns a flat in Mangaluru, shared: “The land isn’t in the name of our society and yet I pay maintenance charges every month for maintaining our common areas, which actually belong to the builder.

Banks on alert! The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks , following credible intelligence reports. Banks have been instructed to actively monitor their systems round the clock to detect any threats.In an advisory issued on June 24, the RBI said, ""In the light of credible threat intelligence received regarding potential cyberattacks, regulated entities are advised to put in place enhanced state of surveillance and resilience capabilities to guard against these threats.""According to an ET report, RBI's communication preceded a social media post suggesting that LulzSec , a group notorious for several high-profile attacks, was targeting Indian banks.The group, which was thought to have become inactive, is said to have resurfaced.Banks are required to continuously monitor network activities and server logs to identify any malicious intrusions. Additionally, they must keep a close watch on critical payment systems, including SWIFT (the messaging system for international fund transfers), card networks (facilitating card payments), and domestic real-time fund transfer frameworks such as RTGS, NEFT, and UPI.RBI has issued a reminder to banks, urging them to implement standard controls to safeguard against threats such as DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. These attacks involve hackers launching a coordinated assault on a bank's systems, overwhelming them with a flood of queries that hinder the processing of legitimate customer requests and transactions on the website and online services.In addition to DDoS protection, banks are required to impose restrictions on remote logins and access to critical systems. They must also conduct thorough scans of all information systems to detect viruses and malware, and ensure that the latest patches are installed after necessary testing.Also Read | RBI’s overseas gold reserves drop to 6-year low!

Typically, when there is some hint of a possible cyberattack, banks simultaneously test the efficacy of their continuity and contingency plans.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
'Cancellation will be last resort': Top observations made by SC on NEET-UG 2024 paper leak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cancellation-will-be-last-resort-top-observations-made-by-sc-on-neet-ug-2024-paper-leak/articleshow/111575418.cms,"The court acknowledged the occurrence of the question paper leak and stressed that if the exam's sanctity is lost, a re-test becomes necessary.""No question that question paper has been leaked, we are determining extent of leak"", the top court said.

Bench noted that the nature of leak must be determined before conducting a re-test of the exam. ""You don't cancel a whole exam only because 2 students engaged in malpractice. Therefore, we must be careful about the nature of leak. Before we order a re-test we must be conscious of extent of leak as we are dealing with 23 lakh students"", the SC bench said.

Highlighting the rapid spread of leaks through digital platforms and the potential consequences for exam integrity, SC said, ""If paper leak is taking place through Telegram, WhatsApp and electronic means, then it spreads like wildfire. If leak has been propagated through social media, then re-test has to be ordered,""

Questioning the action that the government has taken, Bench of CJI, Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said, ""We have to be ruthless with those wrongdoers and those who benefited from the leakage of paper. What action has the government taken,""

SC asked CBI to file status report on investigations into the paper leak FIRs by Wednesday. The matters would be heard again on Thursday. SC also asked NTA and Centre to answer all queries it raised and said a decision on re-test would be taken based on these responses.

CJI directed NTA to make full disclosure in 3 aspects: (1) Nature of leak (2) Places where leak took place and (3) Lag of time between occurrence of leak and conduct of exam.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday observed that if the integrity of the NEET-UG 2024 medical entrance exam has been compromised and the question paper leak has been disseminated through social media platforms, a re-examination must be conducted. The court sought accountability from authorities, adjourning the matter till July 11 and directing the CBI to provide a status report by Wednesday.The apex court was hearing over 30 petitions concerning the medical entrance examination NEET-UG.These petitions include allegations of irregularities and malpractices during the May 5 test, with some seeking a directive to re-conduct the examination.The Bench headed by CJI also heard a separate plea filed by over 50 successful NEET-UG candidates from Gujarat, requesting the court to prevent the Centre and the NTA from invalidating the disputed exam.The NEET-UG exam was marred by accusations of malpractice, including alleged paper leaks and dubious marking methods, which triggered widespread anger and demonstrations nationwide. As a result, certain students were directed to retake the NEET UG exam, and the NEET-PG exam was postponed.Here's what SC said:In their recent affidavits submitted to the SC, the Centre and the NTA responsible for conducting NEET-UG, said that annulling the exam would be ""counterproductive"" and would ""seriously jeopardise"" the prospects of lakhs of honest candidates, given the absence of evidence indicating a large-scale breach of confidentiality.To address worries about inflated scores caused by the allocation of 'grace marks,' the authorities decided to hold a retest on June 23 for the 1,563 affected candidates.In response to the alleged irregularities in NEET-UG and PhD entrance NET, the Centre has removed Subodh Singh from his position as the NTA director general. It also formed a high-level panel, chaired by former Isro chief R Radhakrishnan, to ensure that examinations conducted by the agency are transparent, smooth, and fair.Both the NEET-UG and UGC-NET matters are currently under investigation by the CBI.","The court acknowledged the occurrence of the question paper leak and stressed that if the exam's sanctity is lost, a re-test becomes necessary. The court sought accountability from authorities, adjourning the matter till July 11 and directing the CBI to provide a status report by Wednesday.

Canada Police believes that the gold stolen last year in Canada's biggest-ever gold heist must have gone to India and Dubai gold markets.

Texas hunkers down as storm Beryl approaches

Houston took a hard hit

Tropical Storm Beryl struck Texas on Monday, killing at least three people and causing widespread devastation. The storm flooded highways, closed oil ports, and canceled over 1,300 flights. It also left more than 2.7 million homes and businesses without power. Originally the season's earliest Category 5 hurricane, Beryl weakened after hitting Matagorda with dangerous storm surges and heavy rain.The storm moved across Houston, and authorities warned of potential tornadoes in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas.Hurricane Beryl , which hit Texas as a Category 1 storm, left nearly 3 million homes and businesses without power. Texas officials warned it might take several days to restore electricity. The storm, now downgraded to a tropical storm, caused significant damage by toppling transmission lines and trees, complicating restoration efforts. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, acting governor, emphasized the extensive work required to return power.“We’re not past any difficult conditions,” said acting governor Dan Patrick, adding that it would be a ""multiple day process to get power restored.""Parts of coastal Texas were evacuated amid warnings of severe flooding and power outages as Hurricane Beryl neared landfall. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported wind speeds of 70 miles per hour, predicting the storm would regain hurricane status before hitting the coast. Houston Mayor John Whitmire urged residents to stay alert, noting that conditions could change dramatically overnight.""We have to take Beryl very, very seriously. Our worst enemy is complacency,"" said John Whitmire the mayor of Houston.Houston faced severe impacts, with CenterPoint Energy reporting over 2 million homes and businesses without power. The company is deploying thousands of additional workers to prioritize power restoration for critical facilities such as nursing homes and assisted living centers. The storm's heavy rains and winds caused widespread tree falls and flooded roads, complicating recovery efforts.","Tropical Storm Beryl struck Texas on Monday, killing at least three people and causing widespread devastation.

Pakistan will continue to seek IMF bailouts if it fails to boost tax revenue: Finance minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-will-continue-to-seek-imf-bailouts-if-it-fails-to-boost-tax-revenue-finance-minister/articleshow/111580232.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has warned that the cash-strapped country will continue to seek IMF bailouts if it fails to boost tax revenue , according to a media report on Monday. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader in an interview with the the UK-based Financial Times newspaper said that he was ""relatively confident"" of reaching a staff-level agreement with the Washington-based global lender this month for an estimated loan of $6-8 billion.Aurangzeb, however, said, ""It will not be our last fund programme if we don't bring our tax revenues up.""Last month, the federal government passed the tax-laden Rs 18,877 billion budget for the fiscal year 2024-25, amidst protests from the Opposition which labelled it as an International Monetary Fund-driven document that was harmful to the public.Weeks after slashing the fuel prices ahead of the Eid ul Adha festival, the cash-strapped Pakistan government on July 1 sharply hiked their prices for the next fortnight as it began the new fiscal year.The tax rises will mostly fall on salaried workers, who comprise a relatively small part of Pakistan's mostly informal economy , as well as some retail and export businesses, Geo News reported.The budget also threatened punitive measures for tax avoiders, including restrictions on mobile phones, gas and electricity access and the ability to fly abroad.""We do not have five years for our programme,"" Aurangzeb warned in the wake of a budget that seeks to reset the country's ailing economy. ""We have to start showing, start delivering, in the next two to three months,"" he said.The finance minister said the direction of travel is positive, and investors are showing confidence in the stock market , referring to the KSE-100 index.Still, the government faces a considerable challenge in putting Pakistan on the path for longer-term growth and debt sustainability , he said.The country's debt has soared since the mid-2000s, as authorities failed to invest the money from loans into productive and export-oriented sectors, Geo News reported.Instead, the country remains reliant on imports, forcing Islamabad to borrow to pay off existing and accumulating debts, Aurangzeb said.""We need to create the capacity to repay loans,"" the finance minister said. ""As long as this economy stays import-based, what happens is the moment it heats up, ""we run out of dollars [and] we have to go back to the lender of last resort on our knees.""Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has travelled recently to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and China to solicit investments on top of the IMF programme, which would be Pakistan's 24th with the multilateral lender.","Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb says Pakistan will continue to seek IMF bailouts if it fails to boost tax revenue.

Pakistan Public Sector Enterprises: Pakistan's public sector enterprises suffocate under mounting PKR 1.7 trillion debt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-public-sector-enterprises-suffocate-under-mounting-pkr-1-7-trillion-debt/articleshow/111564121.cms,"KARACHI: The Pakistan government's efforts to reform its public sector enterprises (PSEs) have been marred by persistent challenges, as highlighted by recent fiscal data and international funding initiatives, Dawn reported.Despite a substantial loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) aimed at bolstering reforms , the cumulative debt of PSEs has soared to PKR 1.7 trillion, with an additional borrowing exceeding Rs 43 billion in the fiscal year 2024.Economic priorities underscore the urgency of privatising PSEs to alleviate the strain on the national budget, a crucial step also mandated for securing future loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The allocation for PSEs in the 2024-25 budget saw a dramatic increase, reaching PKR 1.267 trillion, largely earmarked for subsidies and grants, marking a 104 per cent surge from the previous fiscal year.The State Bank of Pakistan 's latest report reveals a notable decrease in PSE borrowing during FY23, contrasting sharply with the PKR 43.5 billion borrowed in FY24 alone, adding to the existing debt burden. Despite receiving substantial funding from the ADB, which initiated the USD 300 million Public Sector Enterprises Reform Programme (PSERP) in 2016, aimed at enhancing corporate governance and operational efficiency, meaningful reforms have been elusive.Former finance minister Ishaq Dar, during his tenure, committed to improving PSE performance, particularly in sectors like railways, Pakistan Steel, and Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). However, the political sensitivity surrounding the privatisation of major PSEs, significant employers in a job-scarce economy, has hindered progress on critical economic reforms.""The ADB's support began with a USD 300 million loan for sub-programme one in June 2016, followed by an additional USD 300 million for sub-programme two in 2017, aimed at sustaining and expanding initial reform efforts,"" noted an ADB report. Despite these efforts, the transformation of loss-making entities such as PIA and Pakistan Steel remains a contentious issue, highlighting the challenges of balancing economic imperatives with political realities, according to Dawn.Many PSEs continue to rely heavily on government subsidies and credit guarantees to maintain operations, underscoring persistent governance and accountability deficiencies. The ADB's objectives included enhancing transparency, performance management, and revenue generation in PSEs, aligning their operations with commercial principles to improve service delivery and financial sustainability.The failure to implement comprehensive reforms has perpetuated the financial woes of PSEs, jeopardising fiscal stability and inhibiting broader economic development, Dawn reported.

Administrative roles in ministries typically paid around 20,000 Afghanis, but many saw their salaries reduced to approximately 15,000 after the Taliban takeover.While these women continue to receive payment, their salaries have been slashed. The measure comes even as Afghan women have been forced to avoid work since the ultra-Islamist group seized power in 2021.One 25-year-old woman, who requested anonymity for security reasons and has been working for the Information and Culture department outside Kabul since early 2021, reported that her salary has dropped from 10,000 Afghanis. She uses her income to support her family of seven, including her ill mother, but the reduced salary barely lasts her two weeks.""Making women stay at home is already a very big problem for us -- we are in a very bad mental and psychological condition -- and now that our salaries have decreased, this has only worsened,"" she told AFP.The salary change, which took effect in July, is expected to impact tens of thousands of women employed in the public sector, according to the finance ministry spokesman.Since regaining power in 2021, the Taliban authorities have severely restricted women's freedoms based on a strict interpretation of Islamic law , which the United Nations has described as "" gender apartheid .""Women have been excluded from public life, with bans on education and access to public parks, gyms, and baths.Afghanistan has been devastated by decades of war and has long relied on international aid , which has significantly decreased since the Taliban's return to power.

""The system has to be reformed"".The current system reserves more than half of posts, totalling hundreds of thousands of government jobs.That includes 30 percent reserved for children of those who fought to win Bangladeshi independence in 1971, 10 percent for women, and 10 percent set aside for specific districts.Students said only those quotas supporting ethnic minorities and disabled people -- six percent of jobs -- should remain.Critics say the system benefits children of pro-government groups, who back Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was Bangladesh's founding leader.Hasina, 76, won her fourth consecutive general election in January, in a vote without genuine opposition parties, with a widespread boycott and a major crackdown against her political opponents.Critics accuse Bangladeshi courts of rubber-stamping decisions made by her government.The system was initially abolished after weeks of student protests in 2018.But in June, Dhaka's High Court rolled that back, saying the cancellation had been invalid.- 'Wasting their time' -Hasina has condemned the protests, saying the matter had been settled by the court.""Students are wasting their time,"" Hasina told female activists from her party on Sunday, Bangladeshi newspapers reported.""After the court's verdict, there is no justification for the anti-quota movement.""Protests began earlier in July and have grown in size.""We will bury the quota system"", students chanted on Sunday in Bangladesh's second city Chittagong, where hundreds of protesters marched.In Dhaka, hundreds of students disrupted traffic for hours, police said.At the elite Jahangirnagar University, at least 500 students blocked the highway connecting the capital with southeastern Bangladesh ""for two hours"", local police chief AFM Shahed told AFP.Bin Yamin Molla, a protest leader, said at least 30,000 students participated in the protests, although the number could not be verified.Bangladesh was one of the world's poorest countries when it gained independence in 1971, but it has grown an average of more than six percent each year since 2009.Hasina has presided over that breakneck economic growth, with per capita income in the country of 170 million people overtaking India in 2021.But much of that growth has been on the back of the mostly female factory workforce powering its garment export industry, and economists say there is an acute crisis of jobs for millions of university students.","Thousands of Bangladeshi university students throw roadblocks across key highways.
