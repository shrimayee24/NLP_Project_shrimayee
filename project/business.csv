In a bid to transform the landscape of traditional crafts and rural economies, the Uttarakhand government has launched the House of Himalayas (HoH), an umbrella brand aimed at promoting authentic, handcrafted products from the region. Unveiled during the Uttarakhand Global Investor Summit 2023 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , the initiative seeks to elevate the state’s rich heritage while empowering local producers and artisans.In a market increasingly driven by consumer demand for authenticity and sustainability, HoH stands out by offering high-quality, handcrafted goods that connect buyers to the culture and traditions of Uttarakhand.This initiative consolidates the state’s diverse range of products, from Himalayan wild forest honey to heritage-rich ‘Pahadi Rajma,’ ensuring each item carries a unique story of resilience and authenticity.The launch of House of Himalayas Ltd in April 2024, led by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami , has created a dedicated team of executives focused on positioning these Himalayan products in high-end markets. The brand aims to empower rural communities by providing training, branding support, and quality assurance, thereby fostering sustainable livelihoods and reducing rural-to-urban migration.Radhika Jha, secretary of rural development, emphasized HoH’s mission to uplift women artisans and small-scale farmers, stating, “This initiative is not just a commercial enterprise; it’s designed to strengthen the rural economy .”By adopting a direct-to-consumer (D2C) model, HoH partners with e-commerce platforms like Amazon Karigar, allowing consumers worldwide to access these premium products. The brand also plans to establish a physical presence in key locations, including Delhi International Airport, while actively participating in international trade fairs to enhance its market reach.Recent collaborations with major players, such as Lulu Hypermarket, have positioned HoH for a global presence, particularly in the Middle East. The brand has signed MOUs with the Spice Board of India and the Indian Institute of Packaging to enhance production and distribution capabilities.As consumer awareness around ethical sourcing and artisanal craftsmanship grows, House of Himalayas is well-positioned to meet this demand. With a product lineup that includes eco-friendly incense sticks and luxurious silk scarves, HoH aims to resonate with the conscious consumer segment while creating a lasting emotional connection through its offerings.This initiative not only aims to uplift local communities but also seeks to solidify Uttarakhand's identity in the global marketplace, setting the stage for sustainable economic growth across the region.","House of Himalayas is an umbrella brand aimed at promoting authentic, handcrafted products from the region.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday declared all Bangladeshi migrants who entered Assam on or after Mar 25, 1971, as illegal migrants. Given the grave adverse impact they have had on the state's culture and demography, the Union and state govts must expedite their identification, detection and deportation, SC said.A five-judge bench delivered this verdict by four to one majority while upholding the validity of Section 6A of Citizenship Act, which was introduced in Dec 1985 in sync with the 1985 Assam Accord that Rajiv Gandhi govt signed with students' unions, which were agitating against massive illegal influx of Bangladeshis.The section's validity was challenged in SC on the ground that it differed from the cut-off dates prescribed in Constitution for grant of citizenship.Under Section 6A, those Bangladeshi migrants who entered Assam before Jan 1, 1966, would be deemed Indian citizens, whereas those who came to the state between Jan 1966 and March 24, 1971, were to be given citizenship after 10 years subject to certain conditions.While the majority opinion running into 185 pages, authored by Justice Surya Kant for himself and Justices M M Sundresh and Manoj Misra, went beyond the validity of Section 6A and delved into the cultural and demographic crisis faced by inhabitants of Assam because of illegal influx of Bangladeshi migrants and prescribed remedial steps, CJI D Y Chandrachud stopped at upholding the validity of Section 6A. Justice J B Pardiwala dissented and quashed Section 6A prospectively.Illegal entry of Bangladeshis, which has been going on since the country's partition in 1947, has been a wedge issue with BJP and AGP campaigning against it as a threat to the country's integrity and security and a ""plot"" to change the demography in border areas, and their opponents accusing them of exaggerating the problem due to the Muslim faith of the illegal immigrants.The issue, which played a major role in BJP's rise as the dominant force in Assam at the expense of Congress and, interestingly, AGP, has already become a key theme in the approaching Jharkhand polls.Justice Kant dealt with the situation arising from unchecked infiltration of Bangladeshi migrants threatening to swamp Assam, and referred to a two decade-old judgment in Sarbananda Sonowal case in which the SC had observed that ""there can be no manner of doubt that the state of Assam is facing 'external aggression and internal disturbance' on account of largescale illegal migration of Bangladeshi nationals"".""Immigrants who entered Assam on or after March 25, 1971, are not entitled to the protection conferred vide Section 6A and, consequently, they are declared to be illegal immigrants. Accordingly, Section 6A has become redundant qua those immigrants who have entered Assam on or after March 25, 1971,"" Justices Kant, Sundresh and Misra said.The majority held that the directions issued for identification, detection and deportation of illegal Bangladeshi migrants who entered Assam after Mar 25, 1971, must be implemented expeditiously. Importantly, it said five laws - Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950; Foreigners Act, 1946; Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964; Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920; and Passport Act , 1967 - must act in tandem to give effect to the legislative objective of Section 6A, that is not to permit any illegal Bangladeshi migrant to enter Assam after March 25, 1971.Finding that the SC's directives in the Sonowal judgment had not been implemented properly even after 20 years as only 97,714 cases were pending before Foreigners Tribunals even though millions of illegal Bangladeshi migrants have entered the state, the SC decided to monitor progress of detection and deportation of such migrants from now.""Implementation of immigration and citizenship legislations cannot be left to the mere wish and discretion of the authorities, necessitating constant monitoring by this court,"" Kant said.In his 94-page opinion, CJI Chandrachud said, ""The legislative objective of Section 6A was to balance the humanitarian needs of migrants of Indian origin and the impact of the migration on the economic and cultural needs of Indian states. The two yardsticks employed in Section 6A, that is migration to Assam and the cut-off date of March 24, 1971, are reasonable.""All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu), the force behind the six-year-long mass movement against infiltration that led to the Assam Accord of 1985, celebrated Thursday what it termed a “historic” second victory in the fight to save the state’s identity and demography after SC upheld the constitutional validity of the key citizenship clause brought by amendment to implement the tripartite agreement.Samujjal Bhattacharjya, Aasu’s chief adviser, said the SC ruling on Section 6A of the Citizenship Act “effectively endorses the Assam Accord” as the commitments in the pact hinge on implementation of this clause that was challenged in court. “We wholeheartedly welcome the SC verdict. It has established that the Assam agitation was undertaken for genuine reasons, and all provisions stand legally validated.”Senior Gauhati HC advocate Bijan Kumar Mahajan said people, irrespective of caste, creed and religion, ought to now acknowledge the sanctity of Section 6A. “Since our student days, we have faced the dilemma of whether 1951 or 1971 is the base year for determining citizenship. The wait is over. It is the beauty of the Indian judiciary that a Constitution bench of the apex court has upheld Section 6A by a 4:1 majority.”Abhijeet Sarma of Assam Public Works, the original petitioner in the case that led SC to order an enumeration exercise to update the NRC in the state, described the validation of Section 6A as “a historic resolution of the controversy”.He flagged doubts about the authenticity of the data in the updated NRC and the delay in ordering its verification as a hurdle to implementing the Assam Accord despite SC’s order. “What about the future of the Assamese people? Even today, the answer to this question is an authentic NRC. SC’s verdict, in fact, highlights NRC’s relevance.”Retired IAS officer Hitesh Dev Sarma, the former NRC coordinator in Assam, was among those who struck a discordant note about SC upholding Section 6A as constitutionally valid. In a social media post, he termed the judgment “a disheartening development” and “a terrible day for Assam”.He said the BJP-led state govt not moving SC for a comprehensive review of the NRC may have already paved the way for citizenship to foreigners whose names were included in the updated citizenship rolls based on allegedly faulty credentials. “Chances are the current NRC with lakhs of foreigners’ names will now be declared the final document.”The core of Section 6A is that immigrants who entered Assam before Jan 1, 1966, will enjoy all rights as citizens, while those who came to the state between Jan 1, 1966, and March 25, 1971, will be subject to checks and compliance with case-specific requirements.","Supreme Court declares all Bangladeshi migrants who entered Assam on or after Mar 25, 1971, as illegal migrants. Given the grave adverse impact they have had on the state's culture and demography, the Union and state govts must expedite their identification, detection and deportation, SC said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114331280,imgsize-1428575,width-400,resizemode-4/114331280.jpg"

LAHORE: Describing foreign minister S Jaishankar ’s visit to Pakistan for the SCO meeting as a positive development that should provide an opening for more substantive engagements between the 2 countries, former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi saying the latter’s decision to visit Sharif’s home in 2015 was not an ordinary gesture. Sharif sought progress in ties saying the relationship should not be held captive by the past.Sharif, a 3-time PM and elder brother of Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, also slammed former PM and rival Imran Khan for the foul language he used against Modi as PM.“Achhe bhare talukkat ko tabah aur barbad karne waali baat ki (he worked to destroy a healthy relationship). I would have never used that kind of language. We believe in certain values that must be respected,” said Sharif, adding he had fond memories of Modi’s only visit to Pakistan on December 25, 2015, Sharif’s birthday.As then Pakistan PM, Sharif had received Modi at his home in Lahore. “I got a call from him saying he was in Kabul and wanted to visit me on his way back to India. I told him he was most welcome. He also met my mother during the visit. What he did wasn’t a chota (small) gesture,” said Sharif, in a meeting with Indian journalists in Lahore who travelled to Pakistan to cover Jaishankar’s engagements. The former PM is also the leader of the ruling PMLN party. His daughter and Punjab CM Maryam Sharif was also present in the interaction.Khan’s personal attacks against Modi after India revoked the special status of J&K only led to further deterioration of relations between the 2 countries. Sharif did not comment on India’s recent actions in the union territory as he said this wasn’t the occasion to discuss it. PM Shehbaz too had avoided raking up the Kashmir issue even in a roundabout manner at the SCO meeting.Sharif also called upon both sides to look ahead and not be held back by the past even though he didn’t make any specific commitment on resumingtrade ties or reappointing high commissioner. He did say that if there’s an opening, cheezein niklengi (things will emerge).Asked about his 2015 peace initiative with Modi that was scuttled quickly by the Pathankot terror attack, Sharif said it’s important to ensure any such effort is not disrupted. “India is our hamsaya (neighbour) mulk and we can’t change that even if we want it. We would have liked Modi to come (for SCO) but it’s good Jaishankar came. We have tried and tried again (to normalise ties). We lost the past 75 years and it’s important we don’t lose another 75 years,” said Sharif, who is known to share a close personal rapport with Modi.“Both sides have their giley-shikwe (grievances). It will be better if we can bury the past,” he added. When asked if he would play the role of building bridges, he said he was doing it.Sharif also backed SAARC, trade and cricket ties with India, saying neither country gains anything by not allowing their teams to play each other. He also recalled how former Indian PM A B Vajpayee had approached him to buy electricity from Pakistan. “I would allow my team to play. If there’s a cricket tournament on India and Pakistan and India are playing in the final, I’ll travel to India to watch it. There should be progress. SAARC or any such opportunity should not be missed. It’s important to make full use of it,” he said.“I believe we are a potential market for each other. Why should Indian and Pakistani farmers and manufacturers go outside to sell their products. Goods now go from Amritsar to Lahore via Dubai. Who is benefitting from this? What should take 2 hours takes 2 weeks,” he added.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi.

He also slammed former PM and rival Imran Khan for the foul language he used against Modi as PM.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114332425,imgsize-945823,width-400,resizemode-4/114332425.jpg"

India Canada News: Justin Trudeau alone responsible for damage to India-Canada relations: MEA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-confirms-india-on-trudeaus-admission-of-not-providing-hard-proof-on-nijjar-killing/articleshow/114297476.cms,"NEW DELHI: India on Thursday responded firmly to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ’s recent admission that his government had no ""hard proof"" when it accused India of involvement in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar . The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that Trudeau's testimony before a public inquiry only confirms what New Delhi has been saying from the start—that Canada has provided no evidence to support the serious allegations made against India.Trudeau, testifying before a foreign interference inquiry, acknowledged that his government initially accused India based on intelligence, rather than concrete evidence, in connection with Nijjar’s assassination last year. Trudeau said intelligence from Canada and its allies suggested Indian agents were involved, but admitted there was no hard proof at the time. He said, ""We told India it is not hard evidence but just intelligence at that point.""""Behind the scenes (were trying) India to co-operate with us. Their ask was...give us the evidence you have on us. Our response was it is within your security agency. You should be looking into how much they know, you should be engaging. 'No, no but show us the evidence'. At that point, it was primarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof. So we said let's work together,"" Canadian PM said.India swiftly rejected Trudeau’s statements, with MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal saying, ""What we have heard today only confirms what we have been saying consistently all along—Canada has presented us no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations it has levelled against India and Indian diplomats."" Jaiswal went on to say that the damage caused to India-Canada relations is entirely Trudeau’s responsibility.""The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone,"" he said in his statement.The diplomatic row between India and Canada erupted when Trudeau accused India of orchestrating Nijjar’s killing in British Columbia in June last year. India labelled the claims as “absurd” and part of a broader political move by Trudeau.Tensions escalated when Canada identified India's High Commissioner and other diplomats as ""persons of interest"" in the Nijjar investigation. In response, India expelled six Canadian diplomats after summoning Charge d'Affaires Stewart Wheeler. The Indian government condemned Canada's ""baseless targeting"" as unacceptable and expressed concerns about the safety of its diplomats amid rising extremism. India also announced the withdrawal of High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, asserting its right to take further action against what it perceives as Canadian support for extremism.Canada’s initial accusation, made without clear evidence, had strained an already delicate relationship, especially over the issue of Canada allowing pro-Khalistani activities on its soil. India has consistently criticised Canada for providing space for such elements, accusing them of operating with impunity.","India has responded firmly to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s recent admission that his government had no ""hard proof"" when it accused India of involvement in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

Poverty in conflicted regions



Over 1.1 billion people are living in acute poverty with India having the highest number of poor people followed by Pakistan , according to UN 's Global Multidimensional Poverty Index 2024 released on Thursday.""The five countries with the largest number of people living in poverty are India (234 million), which is medium HDI, and Pakistan (93 million), Ethiopia (86 million), Nigeria (74 million) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (66 million), all low HDI.Together, these five countries account for nearly half (48.1 percent) of the 1.1 billion poor people,"" the report said.The report said that approximately 584 million people under 18 are living in extreme poverty, making up 27.9% of all children globally, compared to 13.5% of adults. The findings also indicated that 83.2% of the world's poorest individuals reside in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.Meanwhile, low- income countries which comprise 10.2% of the population covered are home to 34.8% of all poor people (400 million). Further, 65.2% of poor (749 million) live in middle- income countries.The report noted that 2023 witnessed more conflicts than at any time since World War II causing displacement of over 117 million people.""In 2023 there were more ongoing conflicts than at any time since the Second World War.2 The number of people forced to flee from their homes due to violent conflict, disasters or other factors reached an all-time high of 117 million,"" it said.It studied the number of poor people in conflicted region.

Canada 'safe haven' for criminals wanted in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-safe-haven-for-criminals-wanted-in-india/articleshow/114327642.cms,"NEW DELHI: Canada may have taken the plea of free speech and cited legal requirement for more proof to act against pro-Khalistan extremists' alleged political persecution to find sanctuary in its territory, but the country has failed to act on India's requests even for extradition of fraudsters and those accused of drug dealing, domestic violence and rape.This has turned the country into a ""safe haven"" for criminals wanted in India, govt sources said.Sources here pointed out that no action has been taken against one Gurcharan Singh, accused in a cheating case, although a request was made in 2003. Similarly, Omkar Mal Aggarwal, accused of criminal conspiracy and cheating in a property case, has been wanted since 2016, while India sought the extradition of Jasvinder Pal Singh Walia in 2022 in a case related to gang rape and blackmail of a female employee of his spa during 2014-15, which is pending. Last year, a plea was made against Ravinder Singh for cruelty against his wife, after he fled the country.Sources said there are formal and informal channels via which information is exchanged but a common thread is there - reluctance on part of Canadian authorities.On several occasions, India has suggested that the Canadian govt check the antecedents of individuals who enter the country illegally and later seek asylum, but the suggestion has been ignored. Even the caution that the ""open door"" policy is a recipe for disaster, as those who have profited from crime are going to ply their dark trade in their new home, has not been heeded. ""Nor have the instances vindicating the warning,"" said a senior source.In the case of terrorists and criminals, Indian authorities have shared call details and even the location of suspects and suggested that action could be taken under Canadian laws but complained that they have always hit a wall.Sources also dismissed the grounds of ""higher bar"" and ""due process"" refrained by Canadian agencies to justify their action against terrorists entering the country camouflaged as ""dissenters who are facing prosecution for political reasons"" as just an alibi, saying the concerns have never come in the way of tough action against operatives and sympathisers of IS and their family members. ""The indifference and resistance to our requests... has been visceral and has been the norm since 2003,"" said the source.In fact, after years of informal sharing of information and dossiers, which Canada said didn't meet their legal requirements, a formal arrangement was worked out between NIA and RCMP but there has not been much headway.Even in the 1980s when militancy was at its peak in Punjab, Canada under then PM Pierre Trudeau, Justin's father, harboured Khalistani terrorists, including those involved in murders and bombings, including that of Kanishka that killed hundreds of passengers.In recent years too, as Sikh extremists decided to make Canada as their base for anti-India activities, govt repeatedly flagged its concern and shared evidence, including links with Pakistan, but has not met with much success. What has raised further eyebrows in New Delhi is how many extremists accused of serious terror charges have even been given official assignments.","Canada has failed to act on India's requests even for extradition of fraudsters and those accused of drug dealing, domestic violence and rape.

"Application of 6A only to Assam tied to impact of influx, says CJI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/application-of-6a-only-to-assam-tied-to-impact-of-influx-says-cji/articleshow/114330308.cms,"CJI DY Chandrachud (File photo)

NEW DELHI: In validating Section 6A of the Citizenship Act that conferred citizenship to Bangladeshi migrants entering India before March 25, 1971, Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud in his opinion said this cut-off date was reasonable as on that day Pakistan army had launched ' Operation Searchlight ' to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in then East Pakistan.Agreeing with the majority opinion of Justices Surya Kant, M M Sundresh and Manoj Misra on the validity of Section 6A incorporated in the Citizenship Act to honour the Centre's commitment under the 1985 Assam Accord signed with students' unions, CJI Chandrachud said application of the provision only to Assam had a reasonable nexus with the magnitude of the problem faced by the state due to unabated influx of illegal migrants from Bangladesh.Quoting M Rafiq Islam's book 'A Tale of Millions: Bangladesh Liberation War, 1971', the CJI said, ""On March 25, 1971, the Pakistan army launched Operation Searchlight to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in East Pakistan. The migrants before the operation were considered to be migrants of partition towards which India had a liberal policy. Migrants from Bangladesh after the said date were considered to be migrants of war and not partition. Thus, the cut-off date of March 25, 1971, is reasonable.""Referring to migrations from Bangladesh to India immediately after partition, the CJI said, ""Since the migration from East Pakistan to Assam was in great numbers after the partition of undivided India and since the migration from East Pakistan after Operation Searchlight would increase, the yardstick has nexus with the objects of reducing migration and conferring citizenship to migrants of Indian origin (that is person born in undivided India).""Justice Chandrachud referred to the Sarbananda Sonowal judgment expressing concern over Assam facing ""external aggression and internal disturbance"" due to largescale illegal migration from Bangladesh and rejected the challenge to Section 6A's validity based on the provision's application only to Assam even though West Bengal, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram shared longer borders with Bangladesh and faced illegal migrant influx.""Though other states such as West Bengal (2,216.7 km), Meghalaya (443 km), Tripura (856 km) and Mizoram (318 km) share a larger border with Bangladesh as compared to Assam (263 km), the magnitude of influx to Assam and its impact on the cultural and political rights of Assamese and tribal populations is higher,"" he said.""The data submitted by the petitioners indicates that the total number of immigrants in Assam is approximately 40 lakh, 57 lakh in West Bengal, 30,000 in Meghalaya and 3,25,000 in Tripura. The impact of 40 lakh migrants in Assam may conceivably be greater than the impact of 57 lakh migrants in West Bengal because of Assam's lesser population and land area compared to West Bengal,"" the CJI said.The petitioners, challenging the validity of Sec 6A, had argued that largescale entry of illegal migrants from Bangladesh and conferring them citizenship had jeopardised Assamese people's fundamental right to protect and conserve their culture.Rejecting this argument, the CJI said, ""First, as a matter of constitutional principle, the mere presence of different ethnic groups in a state is not sufficient to infringe the right guaranteed by Article 29(1)... Second, various constitutional and legislative provisions protect Assamese cultural heritage.""",Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said this cut-off date was reasonable as on that day Pakistan army had launched'Operation Searchlight'to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in then East Pakistan. The migrants before the operation were considered to be migrants of partition towards which India had a liberal policy.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114330384,imgsize-1464524,width-400,resizemode-4/114330384.jpg"
Justin Trudeau: 'No hard proof when we made first allegation ... ': Trudeau now admits amid diplomatic row with India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-hard-proof-when-we-made-first-allegation-trudeau-now-admits-amid-diplomatic-row-with-india/articleshow/114291387.cms,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

In a surprising admission, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revealed that his government had no concrete evidence when it initially accused India of being involved in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a prominent Khalistani extremist. The revelation comes at a time of escalating tensions between India and Canada , raising questions about the diplomatic storm that followed these unsubstantiated allegations.Trudeau, who was testifying before the foreign interference inquiry, acknowledged that when his government implicated New Delhi in Nijjar's assassination last year, they were acting on weak intelligence rather than definitive proof.Trudeau said, ""Over the course of summer I was apprised by intelligence services that govt was involved in the killing of Nijjar, there was not an obvious immediate international nexus... In August, intelligence from Canada and The Five Eyes made it clear that india was involved...agents from India were involved on Canadian soil and told them we have real concerns that your security agencies are involved. India's response to our investigation was to double down on attacks against our government...We told India it is not hard evidence but it is just intelligence at that point...India undermined our government and governance...These were clear indications that India has violated our sovereignty""He further said, ""They [India] asked us how much do you know? Give us the evidence you have on this and our response was well, its within your security agencies, you should be looking into how much they know you should be engaging.""""They [India] asked to show the evidence, and at that point, it was primmarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof,"" Trudeau said, underscoring the fragile basis of the initial accusations.The timing of Trudeau's confession coincides with an explosive claim by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a designated Khalistani terrorist and leader of the banned group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). Pannun revealed that he had been in contact with Trudeau’s office for the past three years, regularly sharing information—further complicating the narrative of Canadian-Indian relations.This diplomatic row erupted when Canada labeled India's High Commissioner and other diplomats as ""persons of interest"" in the investigation of Nijjar’s death. India swiftly denounced the allegations, dismissing them as ""preposterous"" and part of Trudeau's political maneuvering.The fallout saw India recall its High Commissioner from Canada, followed by Ottawa expelling six Indian diplomats. In retaliation, New Delhi ordered six Canadian diplomats to leave before October 20, signaling a deepening divide between the two nations.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revealed that his government had no concrete evidence when it initially accused India of being involved in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

India has extended its first-ever rupee-denominated line of credit (LoC) to the Mauritius government, amounting to Rs 487.60 crores, to fund a water pipeline replacement project. This marks the first time India has offered a rupee-based credit line for project financing under the Indian Development and Economic Assistance Scheme (IDEAS). The project will involve the replacement of approximately 100 kilometers of aging water pipelines in Mauritius.The line of credit, provided by the government of India, will be financed by the State Bank of India on concessional terms.External affairs minister, Dr S Jaishankar, formally presented the offer to Mauritian attorney general and minister of agro-industry and food security, Maneesh Gobin. The Mauritius government has accepted the offer.This initiative further strengthens India’s commitment to supporting socio-economic development in the Global South, with India's development efforts closely aligned with the needs and priorities of partner countries.The project is expected to improve the water supply infrastructure in Mauritius, addressing long-standing issues related to obsolete pipelines and helping ensure reliable access to clean water for residents.","India has extended its first-ever rupee-denominated line of credit (LoC) to the Mauritius government, amounting to Rs 487.60 crores.

It has established that the Assam agitation was undertaken for genuine reasons, and all provisions stand legally validated.”Senior Gauhati HC advocate Bijan Kumar Mahajan said people, irrespective of caste, creed and religion, ought to now acknowledge the sanctity of Section 6A. “Since our student days, we have faced the dilemma of whether 1951 or 1971 is the base year for determining citizenship. The wait is over. It is the beauty of the Indian judiciary that a Constitution bench of the apex court has upheld Section 6A by a 4:1 majority.” Abhijeet Sarma of Assam Public Works, the original petitioner in the case that led SC to order an enumeration exercise to update the NRC in the state, described the validation of Section 6A as “a historic resolution of the controversy”.He flagged doubts about the authenticity of the data in the updated NRC and the delay in ordering its verification as a hurdle to implementing the Assam Accord despite SC’s order. “What about the future of the Assamese people? Even today, the answer to this question is an authentic NRC. SC’s verdict, in fact, highlights NRC’s relevance.” Retired IAS officer Hitesh Dev Sarma, the former NRC coordinator in Assam, was among those who struck a discordant note about SC upholding Section 6A as constitutionally valid. In a social media post, he termed the judgment “a disheartening development” and “a terrible day for Assam”.He said the BJP-led state govt not moving SC for a comprehensive review of the NRC may have already paved the way for citizenship to foreigners whose names were included in the updated citizenship rolls based on allegedly faulty credentials. “Chances are the current NRC with lakhs of foreigners’ names will now be declared the final document.”The core of Section 6A is that immigrants who entered Assam before Jan 1, 1966, will enjoy all rights as citizens, while those who came to the state between Jan 1, 1966, and March 25, 1971, will be subject to checks and compliance with case-specific requirements.",All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu) celebrated what it termed a “historic’ second victory in the fight to save the state’s identity and demography.

Sec 6A suffers from vice of manifest arbitrariness: Judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sec-6a-suffers-from-vice-of-manifest-arbitrariness-judge/articleshow/114330760.cms,"NEW DELHI: In ploughing a lone furrow to invalidate Section 6A of the Citizenship Act prospectively, Justice J B Pardiwala in his dissent fundamentally differed with the opinion of the four judges of the Supreme Court who upheld the validity of the provision, which was enacted in 1985 to curb illegal migration from Bangladesh after March 24, 1971.Though CJI D Y Chandrachud in a separate opinion agreed with Justice Surya Kant, who wrote the majority opinion on behalf of himself and Justices M M Sundresh and Manoj Misra, to validate Section 6A, Justice Pardiwala focused only on Justice Kant’s opinion and mentioned his name 36 times in his 127-page opinion, which was conspicuous in its absence of any reference to the CJI.Justice Pardiwala did not fault the enactment of Section 6A in 1985 following the Assam Accord but said the provision has “acquired unconstitutionality with the efflux of time”.“The efflux of time has brought to light the element of manifest arbitrariness in the scheme of Section 6A(3) which fails to provide a temporal limit to its applicability. The prescribed mechanism also shifts the burden of detection of a foreigner solely on the state, thus, counter-serving the very purpose for which the provision was enacted, that is, the expedient detection of immigrants belonging to the 1966-71 stream, their deletion from the electoral rolls, and conferment of de-jure citizenship only upon the expiry of 10 years,” he said.“I am of the clear view that Section 6A suffers from the vice of manifest arbitrariness on account of the ‘systematic failure of the legislative vision’, if I may put it in the very words of Justice Kant,” he said, adding that continuance of Section 6A had resulted in the influx and continued presence of illegal immigrants into Assam till date.“Inadequate implementation of Section 6A(3) of the Act is inextricably linked to the fallacious mechanism (for detection and deportation of illegal migrants) that has been prescribed under it,” he added.Justice Pardiwala was, however, one with his peers and predecessors who wrote the Sonowal verdict in underlining the failure to stem the flood of illegal migrants from Bangladesh. Criticising successive govts since 1985 for doing precious little to detect and deport illegal migrants, Justice Pardiwala said, “In my view, although the mandate of timely detection and deportation of illegal immigrants was the fundamental premise on which the Assam Accord was signed, yet, this intention recorded in the Accord was never translated statutorily, due to a faulty mechanism prescribed under Section 6A(3), either due to inadvertence or advertence of the legislature.”",Justice Pardiwala focused only on Justice Kant’s opinion and mentioned his name 36 times in his 127-page opinion. He did not fault the enactment of Section 6A in 1985 following the Assam Accord but said the provision has ‘acquired unconstitutionality’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114330766,imgsize-229824,width-400,resizemode-4/114330766.jpg"

Two batches admitted in 2021 and 2022 have just been transferred out following an order of Punjab and Haryana high court that was unsuccessfully challenged in Supreme Court.The HC order castigated National Medical Commission (NMC) for allowing the college to admit students when the ""college has been a consistent defaulter"".

Scheme for gig workers’ social security by January,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scheme-for-gig-workers-social-security-by-january/articleshow/114328609.cms,"NEW DELHI: The labour ministry will soon put in place a framework for social security of gig workers , including health insurance and pension, a move that will benefit drivers with ride-hailing apps and those working with delivery platforms. The decision to roll out the framework in place is seen as a “soft launch” of the provisions in the labour codes, which is yet to be implemented as several states are still not on board.“We cannot deprive them of their rights till the implementation of the Code.We have to bring a policy before that,” labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Thursday. The labour code had for the first time defined gig workers. He also announced extension of the enhanced insurance benefits for all six crore EPFO members that will provide them up to Rs 7 lakh life cover.The scheme, which had expired, has been extended with retrospective effect from April 28. After a meeting with representatives of Platform Workers ’ Association earlier on Thursday, the minister said he will seek to put in place the social security framework before the budget in Feb and added that the policy will be legally binding across the country. Some of the states have enacted laws for gig workers.Mandaviya said that several suggestions such as creation of unique identity numbers for providing benefits and a cess on transactions to create a social security corpus have been made, which will be studied. The minister said that the ministry is exploring all suggestions as there is no employer and employee relationship in their case, and the main issue is who would pay for employers’ contribution to social security schemes for them.Niti Aayog has estimated 65 lakh gig and platform workers in the country, but the number is likely to be over two crore as the segment is growing rapidly.

NEW DELHI: United States on Thursday charged a second Indian, former intelligence officer Vikash Yadav , in an alleged plot to kill terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who holds US and Canadian citizenship.The US justice department announced that while Yadav is not in custody currently, the 39-year old faces charges of conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and money laundering.Yadav worked for Cabinet Secretariat, which includes the Research and Analysis Wing ( RAW ), the country's foreign intelligence service.Sikh separatist Pannun is linked with Sikhs for Justice, a New York-based group advocating for the secession of Punjab from India. The justice department said Yadav directed the plot and hired Gupta to find a hitman.Earlier, Nikhil Gupta, 53, pleaded not guilty after being extradited from the Czech Republic in June. The justice department claimed that Gupta contacted someone he believed was a criminal associate, who turned out to be a confidential source working with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).Anne Milgram, the DEA chief, stated, ""Yadav, an employee of the Indian government, used his position of authority and access to confidential information to direct the attempted assassination of an outspoken critic of the Indian government here on US soil.""The justice department press release said that in June 2023, Yadav provided Gupta with personal information about Pannun, including his address in New York City, phone numbers and details on day-to-day activities, which Gupta then passed to an undercover officer of DEA. ""Yadav directed Gupta to provide regular updates on the progress of the assassination plot , which Gupta accomplished by forwarding to Yadav, among other things, surveillance photographs of the victim. Gupta directed the undercover to carry out the murder as soon as possible, but Gupta also specifically instructed the undercover not to commit the murder around the time of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s official state visit to the United States on June 20, 2023,"" said US.This comes amid souring of diplomatic relations between India and Canada over terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was murdered outside a Gurudwara in British Columbia.US further claims that a day after Nijjar murder, Gupta told the undercover officer that Nijjar 'was also the target' and 'we have so many targets.' ""Gupta added that, in light of Nijjar’s murder, there was 'now no need to wait' on killing Pannun. Yadav then sent Gupta a news article about the victim and messaged Gupta, “[i]t’s [a] priority now.”Attorney general Merrick Garland added, “As alleged, last year, we foiled an attempt by Vikash Yadav, an Indian government employee, and his co-conspirator, Nikhil Gupta, to assassinate an American citizen on US soil. Today’s charges demonstrate that the justice department will not tolerate attempts to target and endanger Americans and to undermine the rights to which every US citizen is entitled.”The United States reported on Wednesday that India had informed them that the accused intelligence operative was no longer in government service. State department spokesman Matthew Miller said, ""They did inform us that the individual who was named in the Justice Department indictment is no longer an employee of the Indian government. We are satisfied with the cooperation.""","Vikash Yadav, 39, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and money laundering.

After March 1971, influx of migrants was viewed differently by the government, it said.In a separate opinion, Justice Surya Kant, writing for self and Justices M M Sundresh and Manoj Misra, agreed with CJI's opinion. Meanwhile Justice Kant examined Section 6A threadbare and said the government was competent to take measures to preserve law and order as well as interest of citizens.Rejecting arguments that Section 6A can't be enacted only for Assam and not applied to West Bengal, Meghalaya and Mizoram which too faced influx of Bangaldeshi migrants, Justice Kant said problem of Assam was more severe and hence govt could act to address the situation there.Justice Kant, referring to Sarbananda Sonowal judgments for detection of Bangaldeshi illegal migrants, said the state has the power to identify and deport illegal migrants through not only Foreigners Act, but also under other similar laws for the purpose.The majority judgment by Justice Kant declared that those who have entered Assam from Bangladesh on or after March 25, 1971 are all illegal immigrants, who must be indentified, detected and deported.The top asked Centre and state govt to effectively implement directions in Sarbananda Sonowal judgments for identifiction, detection and deportation of Illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. Justice Kant said SC will from now onwards monitor this identification and deportation process","A 5-judge bench --CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices Surya Kant, M M Sundresh, and Manoj Misra, with Justice J B Pardiwala, heard the case.

India batters embarrass in Bengaluru | What's happening at Delhi Capitals? | Beyond the Boundary

NEW DELHI: After India's dismal batting collapse on the second day of the first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru, captain Rohit Sharma expressed his disappointment, saying it was painful to witness such a low score.Rohit also acknowledged that his decision to bat first may have backfired, but he emphasized that a rare poor call in a year is acceptable.""I am hurting to see this score of 46 as captain as it was my call to bat first.But one or two bad calls in a year is alright,"" Rohit said after the day's play.India collapsed to their lowest home Test total of 46 against New Zealand after pacers Matt Henry and William O'Rourke joined forces to bowl out the hosts in mere 31.2 overs during the second session.This was India's third-lowest score in Test cricket, following their 36 all-out against Australia in the 2020 pink-ball Test in Adelaide and 42 all-out against England at Lord's in 1974.India's previous lowest score at home was 62, also against New Zealand at Mumbai in 2021.Riding on opener Devon Conway 's 91, New Zealand powered into a lead of 134 at stumps on a dramatic day two in Bengaluru.New Zealand were 180-3 at close of play with Rachin Ravindra on 22 and Daryl Mitchell on 14 when stumps were drawn in an extended session.""On a pitch where there was assistance for the seamers, and now that we were bowled out for 46, you could say the shot selection wasn't up to the mark. It was a bad day. Sometimes you plan to do something but fail to execute,"" the Indian skipper added.India's decision to promote Virat Kohli to the number three spot did not pay off, as he was dismissed for a duck after taking on the responsibility following discussions with the team.Sarfaraz Khan, batting at number four, also fell cheaply, while KL Rahul, who was at number six, failed to capitalize on his familiarity with the local conditions and was dismissed without scoring.""We don't want to touch KL's batting position much. He has found a place at 6, so let's give him a rope there. Same with Sarfaraz, we wanted to give him a similar position to where he bats because he is new to international cricket as well. So Virat was the one who wanted to take responsibility. We had a discussion, and he was fine with it. That's a good sign that players are taking responsibility,"" Rohit said.",India bowled out for 46 on second day of first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru.

Intel has begun implementing mass layoffs that it announced back in August, impacting more than 2,000 jobs across several US states. The company says these workforce reductions are part of its broader cost-cutting measures.According to multiple reports, the job cuts will affect approximately 1,300 employees in Oregon , 385 in Arizona, 319 in California, and 251 in Texas.The impact is particularly significant in Oregon, where Intel is the second-largest private employer with over 20,000 workers.

Three factors why he sold his startup

Jyoti Bansal , the 46-year-old founder of computer application company AppDynamics sold his firm to Cisco for $3.7 billion in 2017. The deal made hundreds of the startup ’s employees millionaires. In an interview with CNBC Make It’s The Moment series, Bansal reflected on the complex emotions surrounding AppDynamics' sale – from the challenging deliberation process to the subsequent doubts he experienced shortly after the deal.He said ""that’s the bittersweet part of selling your company. It’s a great outcome in a lot of ways, but it’s the end of a chapter, or end of a book, in many ways too. I was kind of lost.""AppDynamics then employed about 400 employees. The Cisco acquisition proved life-changing for AppDynamics' workforce. The decision to sell was driven by several factors, such as the alignment of AppDynamics' software with Cisco's portfolio and the potential financial and cultural impact on the company’s 1,200 employees. ""We had dozens of employees with $5 million-plus outcomes. These are life-changing outcomes,"" Bansal told CNBC Make It.A spokesperson for Bansal confirmed that roughly 400 employees became millionaires when their shares were valued at $1 million or more following the deal.During the interview, Bansal revealed three factors that he considered while selling his firm to Cisco.“We could be part of a bigger platform, like Cisco, and their customer base and market. That’s one factor. The second is culture, what kind of home your employees get. Cisco, to their credit, did an excellent job giving a high degree of independence to the AppDynamics unit, I’d say”, he said.“The third factor is financial. Is it the right thing for the stockholders — founders, investors and employees?”He further added “As the only founder, I was fortunate enough [that] any outcome financially would be fine for me. [But] we had about 300 or so employees who made more than a million dollars in the final offer we accepted.”Bansal also revealed why, with his current venture, he would likely reject a comparable acquisition offer. He said “[After the sale] I realized that I really enjoyed building the company, creating products, solving problems, competing in the market, every element of company building that I’d gone through. It was intense and stressful, but I really enjoyed it. I also felt like we didn’t fully finish what we could’ve done.”","Jyoti Bansal, 46, sold AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion in 2017.

Citizenship under Assam accord: 4:1 SC verdict upholds validity of Section 6A; dissenting judge says provision 'has become more prone to abuse',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/citizenship-under-assam-accord-41-sc-verdict-upholds-validity-of-section-6a-dissenting-judge-says-provision-has-become-more-prone-to-abuse/articleshow/114320905.cms,"What did the SC bench say

What did the dissenting judge say

Historic verdict, validates our agitation: AASU

Can't make Assam a dumping ground for illegal migrants: Petitioner

What is Section 6A of the Citizenship Act 1955?

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the constitutional validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act which grants Indian citizenship to immigrants who came to Assam between January 1, 1966 and March 25, 1971. A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud said the Assam Accord was a political solution to the problem of illegal migration.Section 6A was inserted into the Citizenship Act in 1985 as a special provision to deal with the citizenship of people covered under the Assam Accord. It formed the basis of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam in 2019.In 1985, the Rajiv Gandhi government and the All Assam Students Union (AASU) and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AAGSP) negotiated and drafted the Assam Accord and created categories of immigrants. AASU and AAGSP were groups that agitated against the influx of Bangladeshi-immigrants after Bangladesh separated from West Pakistan on 26 March 1971.The CJI, writing for himself, upheld the validity of the provision and said the magnitude of influx of migrants in Assam is higher as compared to other states considering the smaller land size and the detection of foreigner is an elaborate process. Justice Surya Kant, who wrote for himself and Justices M M Sundresh and Manoj Misra, concurred with the CJI and held that Parliament had the legislative competence to enact such a provision.The majority verdict held that cut off date of March 25, 1971 for entry into Assam and granting citizenship is correct.Justice J B Pardiwala, who dissented from the majority judgment, said the open-ended nature of Section 6A had become more prone to abuse due to the advent of forged documents. He said the mandate of timely detection and deportation of illegal immigrants was the fundamental premise on which the Assam Accord was signed, but this intention was never translated statutorily, owing to a faulty mechanism prescribed under Section 6A(3), either due to ""inadvertence or advertence"" of the legislature.Justice Pardiwala said Section 6A promotes further immigration into Assam without any end date of application and immigrants come hoping with forged documents to set up the defence of belonging to pre-1966 or the 1966-71 stream upon identification as a foreigner and reference to the tribunal.The judge said while the object that was sought to be achieved with the enactment of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act remained a distant dream, its misuse had only continued to increase with the passage of time.""The open-ended nature of Section 6A has, with the passage time, become more prone to abuse due to the advent of forged documents to establish, inter-alia (among other things), wrong date of entry into Assam, inaccurate lineage, falsified government records created by corrupt officials, dishonest corroboration of the date of entry by other relatives so as to aid illegal immigrants who are otherwise not eligible under Section 6A by virtue of having entered into Assam after March 24,1971,"" he noted in a separate 127-page dissenting judgement.""I say so because with the passage of time, the government records would get damaged and perish, making it increasingly difficult to cross-check the false claims that may be made by the immigrants of the post-1971 stream trying to misuse the benefits conferred exclusively to the immigrants of the pre1971 stream,"" observed Justice Pardiwala.He further said that Section 6A, in the absence of any temporal limit to its application, was being counter-productive to the object of enactment.""Neither Section 6A nor the rules made thereunder prescribe any outer time-limit for the completion of detection of all such persons who belong to the 1966-71 stream and are eligible to avail the benefits of Section 6A(3). The clock only starts to tick once the detection is made by the foreigners tribunal and there is no prescription as to the period of time within which the exercise of detection is to be completed from the commencement of Section 6A,"" he underlined.The All Assam Students Union (AASU), which spearheaded a six-year-long agitation against illegal immigrants in Assam in 1979-85, welcomed the Supreme Court judgment upholding the validity of Section 6A of Citizenship Act.AASU chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharjya said with its order, the Supreme Court has given its stamp of approval to the Assam Accord under which all those who had entered Assam illegally must be detected and deported from the country.""We wholeheartedly welcome the Supreme Court verdict. It is a historic verdict. It has established that the Assam agitation was undertaken with genuine reasons and all provisions of the Assam Accord are now legally validated by the apex court,"" Bhattacharjya said.Matiur Rahman, a former AASU leader who filed the original petition in the Supreme Court on behalf of the Sanmilita Mahasabha, an Assam-based organisation challenging the inclusion of Section 6A in the Citizenship Act, said they wanted 1951, and not 1971 which is the year fixed in the Assam Accord, as the cut-off year for the detection and deportation of all illegal immigrants in Assam.""We wanted the rights of the indigenous people of the Assam to be fully protected and hence, we have been seeking 1951 as the cut off date for deportation of all illegal immigrants from Assam. The Supreme Court verdict will jeopardise the rights of Assam's indigenous people. You can't make Assam a dumping ground for illegal immigrants. The judgment is very very unfortunate,"" he told news agency PTI.Section 6A was inserted into the Citizenship Act as a special provision to deal with the citizenship of people covered under the 1985 Assam Accord. It is referred in the law as ""special provisions as to citizenship of persons covered by the Assam Accord"".The provision provides that those who had come to Assam on or after January 1, 1966, but before March 25, 1971, from specified territories, including Bangladesh, and since then are residents of Assam, must register themselves under Section 18 for citizenship. These people were barred from registering as citizens of India for 10 years from the day of their detection as per the provision of the Assam Accord. As per Assam Accord, those who had come after March 25, 1971, are bound to be deported from India. As a result, the Section 6A fixes March 25, 1971, as the cut-off date for granting citizenship to migrants, particularly the ones from Bangladesh, residing in Assam.(With inputs from agencies)","The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the constitutional validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Australian PM Anthony Albanese buys $4.3million beach pad amid housing crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australian-pm-anthony-albanese-buys-4-3million-beach-pad-amid-housing-crisis/articleshow/114300230.cms,"Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese (AP file photo)

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is facing criticism after purchasing a multimillion-dollar waterfront home amid a national housing crisis .The 4.3 million Australian dollar ($2.9 million) clifftop property is located in Copacabana , north of Sydney. Critics argue that the purchase shows Albanese is out of touch with Australians struggling with high interest rates, rising prices, and limited housing supply.Albanese addressed the criticism on Wednesday, stating, ""We want to get on with helping Australians, whether it be public housing , whether it be rentals or whether it be buying their own homes.""Some opposition lawmakers, including Sussan Ley and Angie Bell, questioned the timing of the purchase, calling it ""questionable"" and suggesting it demonstrated how disconnected Albanese is from ordinary Australians.Lawmaker Paul Fletcher added, ""The real issue for Australians is a lot of people want to be able to buy a home, but they're finding it very, very difficult and the current government is doing a very poor job at getting the policy settings in place to make it easier.""However, government lawmakers have defended Albanese. Cabinet minister Chris Bowen commented, “I think the average Australian says, 'Fair enough, leave him alone, I'll criticize his policies or I'll support his policies, I'll criticize or support his government, but I'm not going to criticize or support what he does with his own bank account with his own money.’”Albanese’s Labor Party is seeking a second term in office with elections due by May next year. Monash University political scientist Zareh Ghazarian described the decision as “politically risky” due to housing affordability likely being a top election issue.Albanese maintains that his upbringing in public housing by a single mom has given him an understanding of the financial struggles of low-income families. He explained that he is buying the house in Copacabana because his fiancee Jodie Haydon’s family lives on the Central Coast, and he plans to sell his private Sydney house to help pay for it.""I am much better off as prime minister. I earn a good income. I understand that. I understand that I've been fortunate,"" Albanese said. ""But I also know what it's like to struggle. My mum lived in the one public housing that she was born in for all of her 65 years. And I know what it's like, which is why I want to help all Australians into a home, whether it be public homes or private rentals or home ownership.""","The 4.3 million Australian dollar ($2.9 million) clifftop property is located in Copacabana, north of Sydney.

Both Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton were seen without their engagement rings in their latest public appearances but the situations are not the same as Meghan's missing engagement ring possibly hints at her ongoing marital strife but Kate's is different, explained royal experts.Princess Kate was spotted without her iconic sapphire engagement ring which once belonged to Princess Diana but she wore several eternity bands and her wedding ring -- in her first official engagement since completing her chemotherapy treatment.""The Princess of Wales may have chosen to wear the eternity brands to represent her relationship with Prince William surpassing several major milestones - like anniversaries or births - or as a show of love and commitment,"" an expert told GB news adding that the gesture probably means Kate and William are in more love than ever. There could be many other reasons for the missing engagement ring such as cleaning or resizing etc.But Meghan's missing engagement ring tells an altogether different tale. During her solo appearance at Greater Santa Barbara, Meghan was seen wearing various pieces of jewelry but not the engagement ring. This was not the first time that Meghan was seen without her engagement ring. She was seen without it at the Invictus Games last year but at that time the ring was ""being fixed"". After that, she was seen wearing the ring at a recent film premiere but it was not there at her recent outing. Instead, she wore her wedding band.Reports said Meghan and Harry are living separate lives and have a blueprint ready for how it will be going forward. Meghan Markle wants to devote her time in her Hollywood projects and entrepreneurship works while Prince Harry wants to be busy in his charitable works. Prince Harry concluded his solo trip in New York, London and then in Africa while Meghan was on her own in California. Whether this separation is only for work or whether they are headed for a divorce is not really known but speculations are rife.Megan's engagement ring underwent several transformation over the years. Prince Harry presented her with the ring in 2017. He designed it taking two diamonds from Princess Diana's collection and one from Botswana. In 2019, the ring was remade to appear thinner.",Both Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton were seen without their engagement rings in their latest public appearances but the situations are not the same.

US says it is 'satisfied' with India's cooperation in alleged plot to kill Pannun,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-says-it-is-satisfied-with-indias-cooperation-in-alleged-plot-to-kill-pannun/articleshow/114323956.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

Taking a more measured and lowkey approach than Canada in the matter of purported transnational hit jobs, the Biden administration on Wednesday said it is ""satisfied"" with the cooperation it is getting from New Delhi in the US investigation into the alleged foiled assassination plot targeting Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Pannun .""It continues to be an ongoing process. We continue to work with them on that, but we do appreciate the cooperation, and we appreciate them updating us on their investigation as we update them on ours,"" state department spokesman Matthew Miller said at the daily briefing, following a meeting with the visiting Indian team probing the matter.Characterising it as a ""productive meeting,"" Miller said the visiting Indian team informed the US that the individual named in the Justice Department indictment relating to the alleged plot against Pannun's life is no longer an employee of the Indian Government.The individual, identified as CC1 in the US indictment, is reported to be a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) officer on deputation to Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) named Vikram Yadav. According to US accounts, CC1 allegedly recruited Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national, to hire a hitman to eliminate Pannun, who the Indian government has designated as a terrorist. The hitman turned out to be an undercover US agent.Gupta was arrested in Prague earlier this year and extradited to the US, where he has pled not guilty ahead of an expected trial. India has said it does not sanction or condone transnational killing amid suggestions that certain players may have gone rogue.At the same time, New Delhi has also pushed back at US and Canada for adopting a benign attitude -- all in the name of political freedom -- towards violent Khalistani extremists who have attacked Indian diplomatic missions and threatened Indian diplomats and officials.Pannun, a dual citizen of US and Canada, has a free run in both countries and continues to openly threaten Indian officials, most recently sending out an email showing India's ambassador to the US, Vinay Kwatra, in the cross hairs of a rifle in a visual, with the message ""Wanted: Enemy of Sikhs.""While Washington has kept engagement with New Delhi on the issue fairly low-key, Canada has elevated the matter into the public domain, insisting New Delhi has had a hand in the assassination of Sikh separatists, despite by its own admission, not providing evidence for what it calls ""credible allegations."" Canada's political arena is replete with charges that the country Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has stirred up the matter for political survival since his government is dependent on support from Sikh leaders, many of whom are Khalistani separatists.","The Biden administration says it is ""satisfied"" with the cooperation it is getting from New Delhi.
