PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court directed ASI on Wednesday to whitewash “flaking” portions of Sambhal Jama Masjid 's outer facade and the mosque committee to reimburse the expenditure within a week.HC said that barring the use of LED or focus lights to illuminate the periphery, there should be no extra lighting installation on the walls lest they damage the structure.Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal ’s order came on a petition filed by the mosque management committee seeking permission to whitewash the mosque and clean the disputed premises, which a group of Hindu litigants say was built over a razed temple.The court will next hear the case on April 8.ASI filed a second supplementary affidavit Wednesday in response to a March 10 court order seeking to know whether whitewashing, extra lighting and installation of decorative lights were required outside the structure or not.Advocate SFA Naqvi, counsel for the mosque committee, pointed out that ASI never explicitly stated in an affidavit that the exterior of the structure didn’t require whitewashing, extra lighting and installation of decorative lights.Manoj Kumar Singh, representing ASI, said that there was some flaking on the structure’s exterior, but it would be possible to take a call on the extent of work required only after a proper survey involving archaeologists and conservation experts.On Feb 27, the court directed ASI to inspect the site and report its findings the next day. ASI’s report said the enamel paint was still in good condition, at which the court asked it to clean the surroundings and shear the long grass. The court also permitted the mosque committee to submit objections to ASI’s report.","HC said that barring the use of LED or focus lights to illuminate the periphery, there should be no extra lighting installation on the walls.

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh deputy CM and finance minister Jagdish Devda on Wednesday presented the state budget of Rs 4,21,032 crore for 2025-26, a 15% increase in outlay over the 2024-25 estimate of Rs 3,65,067 crore. There are no new taxes and no hike in existing taxes. Govt assured that no welfare scheme would be stopped, but several key schemes faced fund cuts.Ladli Behna Yojana — seen as the gamechanger in 2023 assembly election — got the lion’s share of funds, but it was trimmed by Rs 315 crore. This year’s allocation of Rs 18,669 crore is lower than last year’s Rs 18,984 crore.The Ladli budgetary allocation is higher than those for PM Modi’s flagship schemes like Jal Jeevan Mission (Rs 17,136 crore), Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (Rs 2001 crore), PM Awas Yojana (Rs 4,400 crore) and PM Gram Sadak Yojana (Rs 1,550 crore).Devda said Ladli Behna beneficiaries will be linked to central schemes like Atal Pension Yojana, PM Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and PM Suraksha Bima Yojana.Under Ladli, beneficiaries get Rs 1,250 a month.When the scheme was launched, govt had promised that the Rs 1,000 payout would be gradually increased to Rs 3,000 per month. But the last hike was in Oct 2023, a month ahead of polls.Cuts were also announced in Ladli Laxmi Yojana, PM Gram Sadak Yojana, and even allocation for govt schools. The allocation for primary schools has been reduced from Rs 15,509 crore to Rs 11,837 crore, and that for secondary schools from Rs 9,258 crore to Rs 7,206 crore.Funds for Ladli Laxmi Yojana have been trimmed from Rs 1,231 crore to Rs 1,183 crore. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana has faced a cut from Rs 1,788 crore to Rs 1,550 crore.Dewda said focus has been on PM’ s categorisation of GYAN — ‘garib’ (poor), ‘yuva’ (youth), ‘annadaata’ (farmers) and ‘nari’ (women). “This is a budget for development. Our target is to increase per capita income from Rs 1.4 lakh to Rs 22.3 lakh,” he said.","Madhya Pradesh deputy CM Jagdish Devda presented the state budget of Rs 4,21,032 crore for 2025-26.

NEW DELHI: India and Mauritius upgraded their ties to an Enhanced Strategic Partnership as PM Narendra Modi held formal talks with his counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam, reaffirming commitment to a free, open and secure Indian Ocean and pledging full support for the security of Mauritius’s Exclusive Economic Zone, including through increased deployment of ships and aircraft.Modi also advanced the vision of ‘Mahasagar’ ( Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions) for the Global South, 10 years after he announced India’s ‘Vision Sagar’ (Security and Growth for All in the Region) from the same strategically located Indian Ocean country that, he said, connects India to the wider Global South.It shall encompass the ideas of trade for development, capacity building for sustainable growth, and mutual security for a shared future. Under this, we will extend cooperation through technology sharing, concessional loan and grants,” Modi said, describing Mauritius also as a special partner in the region.Modi’s meeting with Ramgoolam was followed by signing of eight agreements and several announcements, including construction of a new Mauritius Parliament building by India, which Modi said would be a gift from the “mother of democracy”.India had last year welcomed the UK-Mauritius agreement for Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago, which houses a US-UK military base, and Modi reiterated India’s “firm support” for Mauritius on this issue. Ramgoolam thanked Modi for his personal support and engagement with global representatives on this issue, according to a joint statement that described the two countries as natural partners.“We fully respect the sovereignty of Mauritius with regard to Chagos. We will extend our cooperation through forums such as the Colombo Security Conclave, Indian Ocean Rim Association, and Indian Ocean Conference,” Modi said in his media statement after the meeting.India also announced a rupee-denominated line of credit amounting to Rs 487 crore for undertaking the replacement of water pipelines in Mauritius. “It is the first-ever Indian rupee-based line of credit that’s being extended by India to any country and, therefore, a significant development,” foreign secretary Vikram Misri said.Modi laid special emphasis on defence and maritime security cooperation, calling it a key pillar of the strategic partnership and committing to fulfil all the needs of the local coast guard. “India shall also assist in setting up of the police academy and National Maritime Information Sharing Centre in Mauritius. Cooperation will be further strengthened in white shipping, blue economy, and hydrography,” he said.According to the joint statement, Ramgoolam thanked Modi for “unwavering support” to Mauritius in protecting its vast EEZ through provisioning of defence and maritime assets, regular deployment of ships and aircraft, conducting joint maritime surveillance, hydrographic surveys and patrolling, bilateral exercises and information sharing and training support, “thereby emerging as a significant security provider for Mauritius”.The representatives also agreed to deepen cooperation towards securing the EEZ of Mauritius, including through enhanced utilisation of a new runway and jetty on the Agalega islands that India has built amid increasing Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean.The representatives called for ratifying the protocol on amendment of double taxation avoidance agreement, which was signed last year, at the earliest “to harmonise with international standards on treaty abuse, after ongoing discussions are concluded”. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said Mauritius had sought some clarification and those had been addressed by India at a very high level. “Our aim is to set at rest all doubts and provide satisfaction to our friends and colleagues from Mauritius that they have a good and a solid agreement on this front… we very much hope that Mauritius will complete its internal processes at the soonest, and the protocol will come into force very quickly,” he added.",Modi also advanced the vision of ‘Mahasagar’ ( Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions) for the Global South.

NEW DELHI: On the day he was awarded the highest civilian honour of Mauritius, Prime Minister Narendra Modi , alongside his Mauritian counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam, jointly inaugurated the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Public Service and Innovation in Mauritius on Wednesday. This milestone marks another significant step in India’s ongoing efforts to establish itself as a reliable development partner on the global stage.The institute, named in honour of the former Indian PM, underscores Vajpayee’s legacy of fostering strong India-Mauritius relations and symbolises the deepening ties between the two countries.A senior govt official emphasised that PM Modi has consistently championed India’s role as a reliable partner in global development, supporting a wide array of initiatives worldwide. These efforts span critical sectors such as infrastructure, healthcare, education, and connectivity. “The inauguration of this institute is a testament to that vision, aligning with India’s broader mission to contribute meaningfully to the Global South and the Indian Ocean Region,” the govt functionary said.The Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute was funded through a $4.7 million grant from India under a 2017 MoU.

It will promote research, governance studies, and institutional collaboration with India, further strengthening bilateral ties.India’s global outreach extends far beyond Mauritius.

Sensex outlook: Worst over?

Global Market Turmoil: US equities bleed as well



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





What a fall! BSE Sensex and Nifty50 have plunged drastically from their lifetime peaks in a matter of a few months. According to a Bloomberg report, the Indian stock market decline has erased over $1 trillion in market value during the previous four months! This has led to a reduction in India's portion of worldwide market capitalisation.Based on a 20-day average calculation, India's share of global equity market value is approaching 3%, showing a significant decrease from its highest point of over 4% recorded in the previous year, the report said.The Indian stock market is experiencing an unusually prolonged downturn, with a 16% decline from its peak - a correction phase that has lasted significantly longer than typical market adjustments outside major global crises.Historical data examining 20 previous instances of market corrections exceeding 10% (excluding the global financial crisis and Covid-19) reveals that standard corrections averaged 14% and typically resolved within 70 days, states an ET report.Also Read | Why Jim Walker, man who foresaw 2008 market crash, wants investors to ‘absolutely double down’ on Indian equities The current situation stands apart, with the Nifty 200 experiencing a substantial 16% decrease over 165 days, establishing this as one of the most significant and extended downturns in recent market history.This correction differs from previous market declines, which were primarily caused by significant global events. The present downturn lacks a major external catalyst, aside from US trade-related tensions. The primary factors appear to be domestic economic challenges, including poor corporate performance, high valuation levels, and continuous Foreign Institutional Investor withdrawals.What initially appeared as a standard market adjustment has evolved into a persistent decline, affecting both active traders and buy-and-hold investors.The continuous decline in the Nifty since September, extending across approximately six months, represents an unusual pattern. This gradual but persistent downturn presents a notable contrast to the previous extended bull market phase, which continued for 55 months without experiencing even a 5% reduction.The BSE100 companies, comprising major and frequently traded firms on the Bombay Stock Exchange, witnessed their revenue growth decelerate to one-third in the previous calendar year versus 2023, whilst their net profit growth accelerated fivefold, demonstrating successful cost management strategies.Also Read | Trump tariffs and trade tensions: Three reasons why India is best placed in Asia to outperform Analysis of BSE100 data by the financial daily, which offers a comprehensive view of India's equity markets beyond the Sensex, indicated considerable deceleration across industrial, service and consumer sectors.These organisations recorded a 9% increase in revenues and 32% growth in net profit during 2024, in contrast to 25% sales growth and 7% profit increase in 2023.""It is largely due to a slowdown in the overall consumption segment as well as oil, gas and steel businesses, where prices essentially remained benign and hurt value growth,"" Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda was quoted as saying. ""If BFSI is excluded, the overall growth will moderate even further. While profit was higher, it was largely due to high base effect, cost control by companies that include cost of production, and marginal salary hikes.""According to Sabnavis, these organisations are anticipated to deliver improved collective results in the upcoming year.Morgan Stanley maintains its year-end Sensex projection of 105,000 points by December 2025, despite recent global tariff conflicts. Morgan Stanley’s team, headed by Ridham Desai, identifies India as 'A stock pickers' market' and notes that India's comparative earnings growth is improving, even considering conservative consensus estimates.A separate analysis from Morgan Stanley suggests that India's position, with minimal share in global manufacturing exports but substantial presence in services exports, could prove advantageous during international trade disputes.“Valuations are the most attractive since the Covid pandemic. The market has ignored the RBI's policy pivot, and a strong budget from the government, among other positive developments since early February. India's low beta characteristic make it an ideal market for the uncertain macro environment that equities are dealing with. Importantly, our sentiment indicator is in strong buy territory,” Desai’s report says.US equity markets have seen a $4 trillion decline in market capitalisation, entering correction territory with a drop exceeding 10% from their December high. The substantial decline stems from economic uncertainties, recession concerns and growing trade disputes, triggering widespread selling that has erased vast amounts of market worth.The technology sector has experienced the steepest declines. Tesla witnessed a single-day value erosion of $125 billion, whilst Apple and Nvidia each declined approximately 5%. The technology component of the S&P 500 registered a 4.3% fall. Additionally, Delta Air Lines shares tumbled 14% following the airline's announcement of halved first-quarter profit projections.","India's share of global equity market value is approaching 3%, showing a significant decrease from its highest point of over 4% recorded in the previous year.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Wednesday criticized the National Education Policy (NEP), calling it a "" saffron policy "" and alleging that it is aimed at promoting Hindi rather than the country's overall development.""National Education Policy is not education policy; it is saffron policy. The policy is not created to develop India but to develop Hindi. We are opposing the policy as it would destroy the Tamil Nadu education system completely,"" Stalin said while addressing a rally at Thiruvallur.He also claimed that NEP does not recognize reservation, which he described as social justice . ""NEP denies assistance amount to SCs, STs, and Other Backward Classes,"" he alleged during the public meeting.Stalin further accused the central government of withholding Tamil Nadu’s share of funds because the state did not adopt NEP. ""We are asking for your tax share, which we paid with our efforts. What is the problem with this? Is it fair to threaten without releasing funds for the welfare of 43 lakh schools? As we didn't accept NEP, they are refusing to release funds that belong to Tamil Nadu. We would have welcomed the scheme if it brought everyone into education. But is NEP like that? NEP has all the factors that remove people from education. This is how this policy is, and that's why we are opposing it,"" he said.The point of contention in the debate over NEP is its three-language formula , which Tamil Nadu fears could lead to the imposition of Hindi in the state. Stalin earlier argued that the policy gives preference to Hindi over regional languages, affecting the state's autonomy and linguistic diversity.The central government, however, insists that the NEP is designed to encourage multilingualism and provide flexibility in language education. Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has refuted claims of Hindi imposition , stating that the policy allows states to decide on their preferred languages.On the issue of delimitation, Stalin alleged that the BJP is trying to increase the number of MPs in states where it has influence to strengthen its position. ""BJP is attempting to sustain power by winning in northern states,"" he said.He further added, ""BJP is trying to increase the number of MPs in states of their influence and develop the party. DMK will stop it.""Stalin also alleged that the BJP wants to destroy the federal structure, adding that ""they will never be submissive to the BJP's fascism even if we lose our lives.""""Let's gather whole India against BJP fascism . BJP's casteist thoughts neglect social justice to our people and destroy communal harmony. If we fail to stop this now, then it can't be stopped ever.

NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Wednesday inked a Rs 2,906 crore contract for procurement of 18 `Ashwini’ low-level transportable radars (LLTRs) for the IAF, as part of the ongoing drive to strengthen indigenous military capabilities .The contract was inked with defence PSU Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), in the presence of defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, for the LLTRs designed and developed by the Electronics & Radar Development Establishment of DRDO. This is the first time that the IAF will induct indigenous LLTRs instead of those imported from abroad.“The Ashwini LLTR is an active electronically scanned phased array radar based on state-of-the-art solid-state technology. The radar is capable of tracking aerial targets from high-speed fighters to slow-moving targets such as UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or drones and helicopters,” a MoD official said.“The acquisition will significantly enhance IAF’s operational preparedness. The programme is a major step towards achieving self-reliance in defence manufacturing by reducing dependency on foreign companies, besides acting as a catalyst for development of the country’s defence-industrial ecosystem,” he added.The IAF deploys a variety of ground-based radars, including LLTRs, as well as airborne sensors for ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) capabilities along the borders with China and Pakistan.The force is also looking to induct specialized mountain radars to look deep into enemy territory along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with China, which has upgraded all its air bases facing India and deployed an extensive network of radars and surface-to-air guided weapons since the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh erupted in April-May 2020.","The defence ministry on Wednesday inked a Rs 2,906 crore contract for procurement of 18 `Ashwini’ low-level transportable radars (LLTRs) for the IAF.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane has endorsed Malhar certification as an alternative to halal mutton for Hindus, saying that halal food is rooted in Islamic practices, not Hinduism.""The workers following Hindutva ideology have come together and brought a good alternative to Mutton for the Hindu society for their rights. It has been forced for years that only Halal mutton should be eaten. Either eat Halal, or you have no other alternative. We have brought a good alternative for it. Eating Halal is not written in Hindu religion, it is written in Islam religion. Therefore, if someone is bringing a good alternative like this, then I am supporting them,"" Rane said on Tuesday.His remarks triggered sharp reactions from the opposition.Congress MLA Nana Patole opposed the statement, arguing that a minister should not make divisive comments. ""A minister cannot talk like this. It gives a message that the chief minister has no control over his ministers. If any minister is inciting a fight between two religions, then the CM should take action,"" Patole told ANI.However, BJP MLA Sanjay Upadhyay backed Rane, claiming that Halal practices produce harmful chemicals. ""I don't have any issues regarding who is eating what but if someone is being fed something in a wrong way, then it should be objected...the chemicals that are produced during 'Halal' are harmful for our body...I support Nitesh Rane in this case...chicken and mutton shop should have licence,"" he said.On Monday, Rane launched the Malhar certification for Hindu meat traders, describing it as a means to ensure access to ""rightful mutton shops"" that are ""100 per cent Hindu-owned"" and free from adulteration.Announcing the initiative on social media, Rane wrote, ""Today, we have taken a crucial step for the Hindu community in Maharashtra. Malhar Certification will help identify mutton shops run exclusively by Hindus, ensuring purity and authenticity.""He urged people to buy only from certified outlets, emphasizing that the initiative would economically empower Hindu youth.

Centuries of discrimination

Dalit families enter temple but fear backlash

'God is with everyone'

NEW DELHI: For the first time in nearly 300 years, Dalit families in a West Bengal village have been allowed to worship at the Gidheshwar Shiv Temple , breaking a long-standing caste barrier.On Wednesday, representatives of 130 Dalit families stepped into the temple in Purba Bardhaman district’s Katwa subdivision, marking a historic moment in their fight for religious rights.The breakthrough came after weeks of tension and intervention by local authorities. Around 10 am, five members from the Das community—including four women and one man—climbed the temple steps in Gidhgram’s Daspara area. Under police protection, they poured milk and water on the Shivling and offered prayers without any obstruction.For centuries, Dalit families, traditionally cobblers and weavers, were not allowed to enter the temple. When they tried to break this practice on Maha Shivratri (February 26), they faced strong opposition. They were forced to leave and faced economic boycotts, including a ban on selling milk from their cattle.The families were determined to worship and turned to the administration for help. But early talks with village elders and temple authorities failed. After several discussions, a key meeting on Tuesday, led by Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO) Ahimsa Jain, finally resolved the issue. Local MLAs, police officials, and temple committee members attended, ensuring that Dalit families could worship freely.The families expressed joy and relief but remained cautious about the future. “We are ecstatic to have been granted the right to perform puja at the temple. I prayed to God for everyone’s well-being,” said Santosh Das, a villager previously barred from entering the temple.“We received tremendous support from the local police and administration on whom we had reposed our faith,” added Ekkori Das. However, she voiced concerns over whether the temple doors would remain open once the police deployment was withdrawn. The economic boycott against the Das families also continued until Wednesday morning, with milk procurement centres refusing to collect milk from them. “Police have directed the centres to resume collection. If it doesn’t happen by evening, we will have to report it to the authorities,” she said.While the administration hailed the resolution as a step towards equality, some temple authorities admitted they were not entirely in favour. “We used to take care of everything at the temple during the Gajan fair. It is now a big question whether we will be able to maintain the purity and sanctity of the ancient tradition of puja at the temple,” said Sanat Mandal, a temple servant.Local political leaders welcomed the development. “It wasn’t easy to break the deadlock arising out of a long-standing tradition. Standing in the 21st century, such ideas cannot be entertained. God is with everyone. Together, we managed to convince everyone of this. That is what has resolved the dispute,” said Trinamool Congress MLA Apurba Chatterjee.","For centuries, Dalit families, traditionally cobblers and weavers, were not allowed to enter the temple.

"Air India clogged lavatories: Aging aircraft, old ducts, scaling in pipes and passenger behaviour lead to stink",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aging-aircraft-old-ducts-scaling-in-pipes-and-passenger-behaviour-lead-to-stink/articleshow/118906475.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Clogged toilets are not new to Air India flights, but the legacy of the old govt-run airline has been flushed across to the new Tata Group-owned company, right in the middle of its modernisation and expansion spree.For years, cleanup crew of Air India’s long-haul flights has found in holding tanks of blocked lavatories everything from socks to hand towels, plastic bags, underwear and even small pillows given on board.Just as the Chicago-Delhi flight was forced to return to O’Hare International Airport last Wednesday when eight of its 10 lavatories were clogged, over the years, several of the airline’s Europe and US flights have been forced to divert or return after flying for hours with hundreds of bursting bowels and bladders for similar reasons.The dumping has gone on regardless of clear signage asking flyers not to throw anything in the commode as that could “clog the toilet and cause inconvenience to you and your fellow passengers”.As Air India’s legacy Boeing 777s, used for North America nonstops, age, the problem is worsening as the old ducts find it increasingly difficult to suck in whatever indiscreet passengers flush away. “These aircraft are very old. The lavatory ducts or suction pipes have got scaling due to which their available width has reduced. External particles like shawls, sheets or towels easily and immediately clog them up,” said an engineer who has spent decades maintaining aircraft. Aircraft toilets use a vacuum system to remove waste into a storage tank.According to Air India’s former executive director Jitender Bhargava, the airline got 21 of its 23 B777s between 2007 and 2010. The other two were inducted much later and are now used as dedicated long-haul VVIP planes operated by the Indian Air Force. The B787 Dreamliners, used on the Europe, Far East and Australia routes, came in a few years later, starting 2010, and are also getting old now.The problem of clogged toilets has shown up on both these long-haul planes in the airline’s fleet. Due to night curfew in Europe, Air India’s affected B777s have in the past returned to either India or North America after flying hours. An engineer explained, “A B777 has two waste tanks. If a duct leading from a lavatory gets clogged, it will affect only that particular lavatory. But if the duct close to the waste tank inlet gets clogged, it will affect all lavatories connected to it.”On AI 126 being forced to return to Chicago on March 5, Air India said in a statement on Monday, “Our teams found polythene bags, rags and clothes that had been flushed down and stuck in the plumbing. This led the lavatories to become unserviceable. While not found on AI 126 of March 5, 2025, our teams have previously also found objects such as blankets, innerwear, and diapers, among other waste, having been flushed down the toilets on other flights. We take this opportunity to urge passengers to use lavatories only for the purposes that they are meant for.”Is this problem faced by airlines of other countries as well? TOI spoke to officials of multiple leading foreign airlines, who said they have only experienced this problem sporadically. This suggests passengers behave differently in an Indian carrier than when they are aboard a foreign airline.“This is a very, very rare occurrence that can happen anywhere. Sometimes, a couple of lavatories may become unserviceable. If detected before taking off from a place that is not our engineering base, we resort to denied boarding and proportionately reduce the number of passengers on that aircraft,” said an official with a foreign airline.Apart from educating passengers, aircraft maintenance engineers have a word of advice for Air India. “Small bottles are kept in lavatories by AI and almost all other global airlines operating medium to ultra-long hauls. However given the peculiar situation of AI, it will be better to have bigger fixed dispensers that can be refilled by crew as a lot of small bottles end up getting flushed. Ditto for dental hygiene kits but those have to be given,” said an engineer.Crew members say passengers ignore the waste bins, which are right there, below or beside the wash basin, and flush everything down the toilet instead. Toilets in the economy section are more prone to clogging simply because the passenger load is higher. “Given the impact on reputation for Air India, the management must take a call on whether pre-flight instructions by crew should also include what not to flush in the lavs,” said a crew member.","The Chicago-Delhi flight was forced to return to O’Hare International Airport last Wednesday when eight of its 10 lavatories were clogged. Over the years, several of the airline’s Europe and US flights have been forced to divert or return after flying for hours with hundreds of bursting bowels.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118911717,imgsize-1204919,width-400,resizemode-4/118911717.jpg"

MUMBAI: Mahayuti government’s populist pre-poll sops last July had left the state saddled with a massive debt. On Monday, it tabled its first Budget after its landslide win in the assembly polls. It reveals that the state faces the highest debt projection in its history at Rs 9.3 lakh crore and the steepest revenue deficit (gap between income and expenditure) at an estimated Rs 45,891 crores for 25-26.With little financial elbow room, the Budget does not offer new big-ticket schemes. Promises in Mahayuti poll manifesto, including a hike in stipend of its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,100 per month and a farm loan waiver, have been kept aside for another day. Instead, the Budget has focused on keeping existing schemes going and in trying to keep its debt and fiscal deficit within prescribed limits.Indeed, the estimated outlay for the Ladki Bahin scheme, whose beneficiaries are being scrutinised and trimmed, is Rs 10,000 crore lower than last year. The estimated allocation is Rs 36,000 crore for Rs 2025-26.With local body polls looming, the Budget has hiked the district annual plan by 11% from Rs 18,165 crore to an estimated Rs 20,165 crore. In a gesture towards social justice, it has hiked the proposed scheduled caste component of the annual plan by 42% and the tribal component by an estimated 40%. It proposes new taxes, mainly related to motor vehicles, which are expected to generate revenue of Rs 1,125 crore. It has also hiked stamp duty on certain transactions.The financial strain is apparent in the figures. The debt projection is Rs 2 lakh crore, higher than it was in 2024-25 when the figure was Rs 7.1 lakh crore. It is almost thrice as high as it was a decade ago. Its revenue deficit – the gap between the state’s income and expenditure — is more than twice the estimate last year, which was Rs 20,051 crore.However, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who controls the finance portfolio, emphasised that the debt and fiscal deficit were within fiscal limits.The state’s fiscal deficit is estimated at 2.76% of its GSDP. Also, the estimated debt is 18.7% of GSDP while the prescribed limit is 25%.The infrastructure projects are mainly ongoing projects for which no fresh outlay has been mentioned.","Mahayuti government’s populist pre-poll sops last July had left the state saddled with a massive debt.

‘Indians among our biggest job applicants:’ Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indians-among-our-biggest-job-applicants-riyadh-air-ceo-tony-douglas/articleshow/118932650.cms,":

NEW DELHI: Aviation industry personnel in India have made a beeline for joining Saudi Arabia’s soon to be launched second national carrier Riyadh Air. The airline website’s career portal has been open for two years on which pilots, cabin crew members, ground, maintenance staff and others can evince interest by submitting their details. “In the last two years, we have received 14 lakh applications from 146 nationalities of which 52% are women. India is one of the biggest source countries for the applications. We are overwhelmed by the interest and faith in our brand despite the fact that so far we have not announced any salary structures,” Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas said here Wednesday.The upcoming full service airline has ordered up to 132 aircraft, Airbus A321neos and Boeing 787 Dreamliners. It is currently in talks with both Boeing and Airbus for placing orders for ultra long range wide bodies with the choice being between the B777 9X and A350-1000. It currently has one aircraft and 500 employees, including 36 cabin crew and pilots each. “After Saudis, the second biggest nationality of employees is Indians. Ditto for the population of Singapore,” he said.The airline, which is going to start operations in a few months, says India is a key market for it. “In 2024 Saudi Arabia saw 15 lakh tourists from India which was a 50% jump over previous year. Ninety-three per cent of flyers at Riyadh are point to point and just 7% are in transit. That shows the scope of growth from India as well as of our connecting potential from our hub, Riyadh, as our fleet grows. Nearby Doha has 80% transfer traffic and the figures for Dubai are also very high,” Douglas said.The Saudi Tourism Authority aims to welcome 75 lakh visitors from India per annum by the close of the decade. Unlike Dubai, Qatar, Singapore and many other countries/regions, Saudi still has a lot of unutilized bilaterals or flying rights for India that Riyadh Air will use. The CEO and his team are meeting both IndiGo and Air India management to discuss partnerships with them. “We have made good partnerships like Delta for North America; two airlines in China and some other countries. We have two gaps, one in northwestern Europe and the other in India which is a huge market,” he said. The Riyadh Air delegation will meet the officials at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for “requisite permissions and support to launch India operations.”Douglas said“India has long been a crucial part of Riyadh Air’s network planning ahead of our operations launch. India is a beautiful nation which will play a big part in the success story of our airline, as travel and business opportunities multiply with the expanded offerings we are set to provide. Beyond connecting people, fostering economic growth, and enhancing and diversifying the Saudi Arabian and Indian tourism sectors, Riyadh Air’s network will help develop even stronger bonds between the two great countries.”","The airline website’s career portal has been open for two years on which pilots, cabin crew members, ground, maintenance staff and others can evince interest by submitting their details. “In the last two years, we have received 14 lakh applications from 146 nationalities of which 52% are women,” Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118932629,imgsize-853913,width-400,resizemode-4/118932629.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Socialite Shalini Passi , wife of businessman Sanjay Passi , has been summoned by the Meerut unit of Directorate General of GST Intelligence ( DGGI ) for questioning on Thursday in a case of alleged Goods and Services Tax evasion.According to sources, the matter pertains to alleged short payment of GST by Pasco Motors LLP of which she was a partner. Shalini Passi shot to fame after starring in the ‘Fablous Lives of Bollywood Housewives’ on Netflix.Pasco Motors LLP is an authorised dealer of Tata Motors and is in the business of sale of heavy motor vehicles, both chassis and fully built buses and trucks. The tax intelligence department had earlier served summons to Sanjay Passi and other executives of Pasco Motors but they are yet to join the investigation.J K Mittal, lawyer of Sanjay Passi, has denied any tax evasion and told TOI that the allegations are false. “GST summons issued by the DGGI is malafide and the information of tax evasion is not mentioned in the said summon at all,” he said, adding that the matter has already been challenged in the Punjab and Haryana HC and is presently sub judice. Mittal also confirmed that Shalini Passi was a partner in Pasco Motors LLP and DGGI was making an inquiry into alleged “short payment of GST” as mentioned in the summons.Sources said while supplying fully built-up buses and trucks, Pasco Motors issues a single invoice but splits the total value into two components: the value of the chassis, which is charged at a GST rate of 28%, and the value of body fabrication, which is charged at a GST rate of 18%.“As per the law, if a bus body builder constructs and supplies a fully built-up bus, the entire supply should be taxed at flat 28% GST. Therefore, Pasco Motors LLP is evading GST by charging different GST rates for the chassis and body fabrications in a single invoice,” a source said.GST Intelligence has asked the company to clarify the differential rate of GST billed to customers and provide supporting documents. After queries remained unanswered, the agency sent summons to the company and its partners to record statements and ensure compliance. Generally, summonses are issued after non-compliance and non-cooperation by the other party.",Shalini Passi shot to fame after starring in the ‘Fablous Lives of Bollywood Housewives’ on Netflix.

Konkan and Vidarbha in Maharashtra and southwest Rajasthan are among the other regions battling temperatures that have already climbed significantly above normal for this time of the year.IMD advised “extreme caution for vulnerable populations” – infants, senior citizens and those with chronic illnesses – in Maharashtra and southwest Rajasthan, where an orange alert has been declared. The department advised residents to avoid heat exposure and stay adequately hydrated. An expert from the Vagaries of Weather blog said Wednesday was Pune’s hottest day so far this season, with Lohegaon and Koregaon Park recording a high of 40.2°C.“Several other locations in Pune region, including Rajgurunagar, Shirur, and Dhamdhere, also crossed the 40°C-mark. So far in March, the average maximum temperature in Konkan has been 2-3 degrees above normal,” he said in a statement while discussing the current scenario.In Rajasthan, heatwave conditions were reported at one or two stations on Wednesday. Parts of North Konkan, including Mumbai, also experienced a heatwave earlier this week. Sanap said temperatures would start declining in some parts of India from Thursday. Maharashtra’s Akola was the state’s hottest, reaching 41.3°C (4.6 degrees above normal), while Chandrapur sizzled at 40.6°C (+3.4°).",Health risk warnings issued across states scorched by an early April heatwave.

WASHINTON: The Trump White House on Tuesday flagged New Delhi’s tariffs on American bourbon, accounting for a pittance of overall US exports, as a contentious issue at a time the World Health Organisation has said no level of alcohol consumption is safe for health.Ignoring India’s lowering of duty on American bourbon from 150% to 100% just before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Feb 13 visit to Washington, Trump’s spokesperson Karoline Leavitt insisted on Tuesday that India’s 150% tariff on American alcohol is unhelpful, even as the US President was outside promoting Tesla, which is also making inroads into India much to his disapproval of a prospective manufacturing facility there.“Look at India, 150% tariff on American alcohol. Do you think that’s helping Kentucky Bourbon be exported to India? I don’t think so,” Leavitt raged at the WH press briefing, pulling out what she called a “handy-dandy chart” of tariffs imposed by various countries on American products.“President Trump believes in reciprocity and it is about dang time that we have a president who actually looks out for the interests of American businesses and workers,” Leavitt fumed, even as Trump’s erratic tariff policy that changes by the day has caused turmoil in global markets.Leavitt also seemed not to take note of India’s well-publicised lowering of tariffs on bourbon from 150% to 50%, with an additional tax of 50%, bringing down the overall duty to 100%.Much of the grandstanding appeared to involve domestic politics where Kentucky, the fount of American bourbon and a solid red Republican state, has a Democratic governor who defeated a Trump-endorsed candidate in the 2023 gubernatorial elections.India is a pitifully small market in the mini-millions for American spirits, which itself accounts for only around $2.2 billion — of about $3 trillion overall US global exports — with Europe being the major market for American alcohol.American whiskeys account for 63% of all US spirits exports, reaching $1.4 billion in 2023.But renowned for its fried chicken, Kentucky wants to supplement it with bourbon to India, a whisky-loving country that is famously said to drink more Scotch than is manufactured in Scotland. Kentucky’s Republican lawmakers eager to advance the state’s economy and keep it solidly red have taken note of India’s lowering of duties on bourbon but that’s inadequate for the White House.“Big win for Kentucky’s signature bourbon industry! Due to President Trump’s leadership, India is cutting tariffs on bourbon by 50%, expanding the global marketplace for our distillers. I met with treasury secretary Bessent and incoming commerce secretary Lutnick to ensure America’s signature spirit is treated fairly in all corners of the world,” Andy Barr, a GOP congressman from the state, said recently.But for a White House intoxicated with the prospect of making America richer, that’s not enough.It wants India to drink more, never mind the WHO advisory that alcohol is a Group 1 carcinogen which also includes asbestos, radiation, and tobacco.","India is a pitifully small market in the mini-millions for American spirits, which itself accounts for only around $2.2 billion.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra transport minister Pratap Sarnaik triggered an uproar in the legislative council on Wednesday by admitting that employees provident fund-gratuity was being used to manage day-to-day expenses and increases in the wage bill of the loss-ridden Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation.His admission and the written submission by the govt about use of Rs 2,214 crore from the PF-gratuity corpus to meet increase in expenses at MSRTC set off an argument with an angry opposition, which demanded that a cognisable offence be registered against the managing director of MSRTC.BJP MLC Parinay Fukey had raised the issue of PF and gratuity funds which led to the written reply on diversion of funds. During Question Hour in the council, Fukey said, “PF and gratuity of employees has not been deposited for the last 10 months. What are the reasons? What has happened to the 2214 crore?”Fukey said that had it been an industrialist or a private company a cognisable offence would have been filed. “As principal employer it is the state govt’s responsibility to ensure the money is deposited,” he said.Sarnaik replied that the financial condition of MSRTC was delicate and the govt had offered various fare concessions to different groups of people. “As of January 2025, an amount of Rs 2,214 crore is due as PF and gratuity. The daily earnings are being used for fuel and other day-to-day expenses. And the subsidy for the various schemes from the govt is being used to pay wages of employees. Sometime back, there was a strike by employees and their salaries were raised. The increase in salary is being paid from the PF and gratuity funds,” he said.To this, NCP (SP) MLC Shashikant Shinde protested saying, “Even the President cannot touch this money. If it has been misused, will the govt register a cognisable complaint?” he asked.Sarnaik replied that in the recent budget, a generous provision has been made for the corporation. “And I want to assure the House that in future, the funds will not be used to pay wages,” said Sarnaik, adding employees would not lose interest on the money diverted.Shiv Sena (UBT) MLC Anil Shinde said when he was transport minister it was BJP’s Gopichand Padalkar, advocate Sada Varte and Sadabhau Khot who lodged a complaint when the money was not deposited for a month. “If you have cut from the employees’ salary and not deposited it, it is a fraud. File a complaint and arrest the managing director and trustee immediately,” said Parab.As the protests grew louder, Sarnaik retracted his earlier statements and said council members had been provided wrong information. “Employees’ PF has been deposited and they have been paid interest too,” he said. But Opposition members continued shouting slogans.",Mumbai transport minister Pratap Sarnaik triggered an uproar in the legislative council.

SRINAGAR: When the seasons paint Kashmir in myriad hues, the Chinar burns red in autumn and glows green in spring. But even giants fall. Over the years, this legally protected tree has been felled — sometimes by the axe of greed, sometimes on the frail excuse of decay.No more. Now, each Chinar has been given an identity. Through the “Digital Tree Aadhaar” initiative by J&K Forest Research Institute (JKFRI), Chinars have been assigned unique numbers — etched into the digital world with geographic information systems (GIS) and QR codes to enable real-time tracking and monitoring.“It’s like a car plate number,” said forest division officer Syed Tariq Kashani, who carried out the Chinar census over the years. “Through a car number, you identify everything about the car and its owner. In the same way, we have done this for Chinar trees.”Metal cards dangle from their branches like medals of honour, carrying data — location, height, health — etched in codes, scannable at a touch. Their digital footprint ensures that every tree can be tracked, its health examined, its absence accounted for.Urbanisation, climate change, and illegal felling have all taken a toll on these majestic trees that can grow up to 98 feet tall with large maple-like leaves. With the Aadhaar, encroachment, illegal felling, and neglect can no longer go unnoticed.Once, the number of Chinars in Kashmir was lost in uncertainty — rumours placed them anywhere between 4,000 and 40,000. But when Kashani and his team began their work in 2021, the truth emerged from the shadows — 28,560 Chinar trees stood counted across Kashmir, though many more remain hidden behind the high fences of military cantonments, waiting for permission to be recorded.Step by step, year by year, the census grew — 18,000 trees geotagged in 2021-22, another 10,000 in 2023-24. Each tree, measured and recorded, was marked for its longitude, latitude, altitude, health, height, and even “diameter at breast height”.Among them, some stand taller than the rest, carrying centuries in their rings. Budgam district holds some of the oldest Chinars in Asia, their roots digging deep into the valley’s soul. And in Ganderbal, a new legend has emerged — a tree so vast that it overshadows the previously declared largest Chinar in the continent.“The girth of this newly recorded tree is 22m, its height 27m,” said Kashani. “The older record-holder was smaller — 14m in girth and 16m tall.” Yet even this giant bows to a greater one — the world’s largest Chinar, found in Europe’s Georgia, standing at 27m in girth and 30m high.The Chinar, or “Bouin” as it is called in Kashmiri, has been here long before the Mughal emperors, though history credits Akbar with planting an estimated 1,200 Chinars in Naseem Bagh near Dal Lake in Srinagar. Even today, that legacy survives — rows of Chinars still standing.Bijbehara — the “Town of Chinars” — remains a living monument to these giants. Here, the trees gather like sages in silent communion, their gnarled branches stretching skyward, their canopies casting shadows older than the city streets they overlook.But history alone cannot protect the Chinar. The digital Aadhaar ensures these trees are no longer just silent sentinels but monitored beings.","J&K Forest Research Institute (JKFRI) has assigned unique numbers to Chinars.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel has flagged that the housing and urban affairs ministry may not be able to spend over Rs 50,000 crore of the Centre’s allocation for the second phase of its urban rejuvenation scheme , AMRUT, even after the tenure ends in March 2026. It has also highlighted how the ministry is unable to utilise funds for the National Urban Digital Mission (NUDM) as the cabinet has not yet approved it, despite it being announced in the last budget.The panel, in its report on the ‘Demand for Grants for 2025-26’ tabled in both Houses of Parliament on Wednesday, stated that the public bus transport scheme, which was announced in the 2021-22 Budget, was approved by govt only in Aug 2023 as the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme . The funds under this scheme were, “for the first time, actually spent during the financial year 2024-25”.Similarly, the NUDM, which was announced as a new scheme in the July 2024 Budget with an allocation of Rs 1,150 crore for FY 2024-25, has yet to receive cabinet approval. “The funds allocated thus remained unutilised,” it said.On fund utilisation under the AMRUT 2.0 mission, which was launched in Oct 2021 with the target to make cities ‘water secure’ and provide functional water tap connections to all households in all of about 4,852 urban local bodies and universal coverage of sewerage and septage management in 500 AMRUT cities, the panel observed that the size of the scheme was Rs 2.8 lakh crore, including the central share of Rs 76,760 crore for five years (2021-22 to 2025-26). However, only Rs 13,172 crore central assistance has been disbursed so far since the inception of the scheme and the total outlay for 2025-26 is Rs 10,000 crore.“Accordingly, post proposed budgetary allocation of Rs 10,000 crore, the remaining amount of the central share for the mission will be Rs 52,651 crore. The committee has observed that even after the utilisation of the proposed budgetary allocation of Rs 10,000 crore in the FY 2025-26, the mission which is ending in 2026 still has to spend 68% of its centre share of Rs 76,760 crore,” it added.In its report, the panel on PM-eBus Sewa Scheme, which targets to deploy 10,000 electric buses, mentioned that the ministry has informed that the total demand of buses so far tendered for aggregation stands 6,518 from 13 states and four UTs. Flagging concerns, it said the eligibility of buses per city based on the 2011 census may not provide the correct parameter for their allocation.It added that the central assistance (CA) of Rs 24, Rs 22 and Rs 20 per km proposed to be provided for 12, 9 and 7 metre buses is less and may result in increased financial burden on municipal corporations. Similarly, the condition of fixed assured kms of 160, 180 and 200 for 7, 9 and 12 metre respectively needs to be revisited as many municipal buses operate only for 150-160 kms daily.","A parliamentary panel has flagged that the housing and urban affairs ministry may not be able to spend over Rs 50,000 crore of the Centre’s allocation for the second phase of its urban rejuvenation scheme.

Little known byrnihat

NEW DELHI: India was the fifth most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with Byrnihat in Meghalaya being the most polluted metropolitan area globally last year, according to IQAir’s 2024 World Air Quality Report released Tuesday.Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) which was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards. High air pollution level in the little-known Meghalayan city can be attributed to rapid industrialisation, unregulated emission, construction and deforestation.Though India improved its overall ranking from third most-polluted in 2023 to fifth last year, it had the dubious record of having six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities and 13 of the 20 most polluted cities globally, with Delhi being the most polluted capital in the world in 2024.The report that analysed a critical pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) data from over 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, finds Chad — a central African country — as the most polluted country last year, followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Congo and India by exceeding the WHO standards of acceptable limit of that pollutant multiple times.Only seven countries — Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — met WHO annual average PM2.5 guideline level of 5 µg/m3.As far as India is concerned, the report finds that the country with the annual average PM2.5 concentration of 50.6 µg/m3 in 2024 reported more than 10 times higher than the WHO PM2.5 annual guideline and over 26% higher than the acceptable limit of the hazardous pollutant as per Indian national ambient air quality standards.The report shows that India saw a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentrations in 2024, averaging 50.6 µg/m3 compared to 54.4 µg/m3 in 2023, but the capital, New Delhi, maintained consistently high pollution levels, with annual average of 91.6 µg/m3, nearly unchanged from 92.7 µg/m3 in 2023.“Overall, 35% of Indian cities reported annual PM2.5 averages exceeding 10 times WHO guideline,” it says. In 2024, air quality data was reported from 371 cities across 11 countries, with India being the most monitored, hosting more than half of central and south Asia region’s stations. The region was home to the top nine most-polluted cities in the world with six of them in India last year.Citing Air Quality Life Index released by University of Chicago in 2023, IQAir’s report noted that air pollution remains a significant health burden in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years.PM2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, is considered the most hazardous air pollutant. It can be deposited in lungs, causing respiratory problems and other health issues.","Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) It was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards.

Meanwhile, a heatwave warning at isolated places was also issued for Mumbai, Thane, and Raigad on the morning of March 11, which was contradictory to the hot and humid weather conditions that were forecast by the IMD for Tuesday. Minimum temperatures recorded by the IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatory on Tuesday were 25 degrees and 23.8 degrees, which were 2.8 degrees and 3.7 degrees above normal, respectively.Tuesday was also the third consecutive day that a heatwave warning was issued.

Cleveland Browns' Future Hinges on Quarterback Selection After Myles Garrett Extension



Myles Garrett, Browns agree to massive contract extension: Orange and Brown Talk Emergency Podcast

Veteran Options and the Role of Joe Flacco



The Road Ahead for Cleveland



The Cleveland Browns made a bold statement about their future by securing a massive contract extension for Myles Garrett . What initially seemed like the beginning of an inevitable full-scale rebuild has now taken a drastic turn. With Garrett locked in, the Browns have solidified a cornerstone of their defense, shifting their focus toward contending rather than starting over from scratch. However, one glaring issue remains: the quarterback position.The upcoming NFL Draft presents Cleveland Browns with a golden opportunity to address its most pressing concern. Owning the No. 2 overall pick, the Browns now find themselves in a position where selecting a quarterback is not just an option—it is an absolute necessity. While rumors have suggested that Cleveland might explore different directions, the reality is clear. With Garrett committed to the team’s future, passing on a top-tier quarterback prospect would be indefensible.The names most frequently linked to the Browns at No. 2 are Shedeur Sanders and Cam Ward. Both signal-callers possess the upside and leadership qualities needed to stabilize Cleveland’s tumultuous quarterback situation. There were initial discussions about drafting Penn State defensive end Abdul Carter, but with Garrett staying put, prioritizing the defensive line no longer holds the same urgency. Unless the Browns shockingly decide to double down on strengthening their front four, the likelihood of selecting Carter seems slim.Yes, the possibility of trading down for additional picks or selecting wide receiver Travis Hunter exists, but that scenario would contradict the team’s immediate need. Garrett’s previous dissatisfaction with the quarterback situation played a significant role in his initial trade considerations. It is hard to imagine that Cleveland’s leadership, including general manager Andrew Berry, did not assure Garrett that a franchise quarterback would be a priority moving forward.While drafting a quarterback seems like a foregone conclusion, the Browns must also consider their short-term solution. Deshaun Watson remains under contract until at least 2025, but with his season-long absence looming, Cleveland cannot afford to enter the year without a viable starter. The team has explored various veteran options, and among the most intriguing is a familiar face—Joe Flacco.Flacco made a remarkable impact in 2023, leading Cleveland on an unexpected playoff run and earning the Comeback Player of the Year award. Yet, despite his resurgence, the Browns opted not to extend him a contract for 2024. The reasoning was evident: keeping both Watson and Flacco on the roster would have caused a divided fanbase, especially given Watson’s struggles. But with Watson now sidelined, Flacco’s return as QB1 suddenly makes sense. At 40, he remains a serviceable option, and given Cleveland’s financial constraints, he could be signed at a low cost.Carson Wentz has also emerged as a surprise candidate. Nine years after Cleveland passed on him in the draft, they now have an opportunity to acquire him at a bargain price. Pairing Wentz with a rookie quarterback could provide the Browns with a transitional plan, ensuring that their young signal-caller has a veteran presence to lean on.With the quarterback situation in disarray, Cleveland’s decision at No. 2 will define its trajectory. Miami’s Cam Ward could be off the board at No. 1, which might prompt the Browns to trade up to secure him. Given the team’s history of instability at quarterback, it is imperative that they finally land a franchise-caliber player to lead them forward.What cannot be ignored is the lasting impact of the Browns’ costly decision to acquire Watson in 2022, surrendering three first-round picks and committing $230 million in guaranteed money. The franchise has been in a tailspin ever since, and now, with limited cap space, signing Sam Darnold or any high-priced free agent is simply not realistic.Also Read: Why Myles Garrett’s trade request was never about money, despite his big Browns extension At this point, all speculation should be put to rest. Cleveland must draft a quarterback. Anything less would not only defy logic but would also shatter any remaining trust in the organization’s ability to chart a successful course for the future.","The Cleveland Browns made a bold statement about their future by securing a massive contract extension for Myles Garrett. The Browns now find themselves in a position where selecting a quarterback is not just an option—it is an absolute necessity. The team has explored various veteran options, and among the most intriguing is a familiar face—Joe Flacco.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118853613,imgsize-26998,width-400,resizemode-4/118853613.jpg"

Woman Granted Protective Order After Accusing Chiefs' WR Xavier Worthy



In a case where the district attorney has chosen not to press charges, the woman accused Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy of assaulting her last week was granted a protective order against him by a Texas judge. In a statement to The Associated Press on Wednesday evening, Tia Jones 's lawyers affirmed the order. They further stated that Jones is ""fully cooperating with law enforcement as they continue to actively investigate the violence that occurred.""The order comes after Worthy’s arrest last Friday in Georgetown, Texas, on a charge of assault involving a household member, where the victim's breathing was allegedly impeded. Despite the seriousness of the allegations, the Williamson County District Attorney’s office decided not to press charges at this time after reviewing witness statements.Attorneys representing Tia Jones confirmed the protective order in a statement to The Associated Press on Wednesday night. Jones’ legal team, which includes Angelica Cogliano, Addy Miro, Leslie Booker, and Deniz Kadirhan, stated that Jones is ""fully cooperating with law enforcement as they continue to actively investigate the violence that occurred.""""Ms. Jones has chosen to use her voice to speak up for herself,"" said Cogliano. ""In doing so, she looks forward to the facts and circumstances of that night coming to light through the formal legal process and getting the justice that she deserves.""Worthy’s arrest stemmed from allegations that he assaulted Jones, an incident which allegedly involved choking. After being held in a county jail overnight, he was released the next day when District Attorney Shawn Dick announced that his office would not pursue charges after gathering information from multiple witnesses.Worthy’s attorneys, Chip Lewis and Sam Bassett, have maintained their client’s innocence. They claimed that Jones had been living at Worthy's residence but had been asked to leave several times over the past two weeks after alleged infidelity was discovered.""She has refused to vacate the residence and made a number of extortive efforts prior to resorting to this baseless allegation against Mr. Worthy,"" the lawyers stated. ""The complainant further destroyed a room in the residence, scratched Mr. Worthy's face and ripped out parts of his hair, which there is photographic evidence of. Worthy told law enforcement at the time of the incident he did not want to press charges against the complainant.""The Kansas City Chiefs issued a brief statement on Saturday, confirming they were aware of the situation and were in the process of gathering more details.Xavier Worthy entered the NFL with significant promise after being selected by the Chiefs as the 28th overall pick in last year’s draft. He gained attention at the NFL combine after setting a record for the fastest 40-yard dash, raising expectations for his professional career.Worthy quickly made an impact with the Chiefs, scoring two touchdowns in his debut and emerging as a key target as the team pursued an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl title. He ended the season with 59 receptions for 638 yards and six touchdowns, while also contributing 104 rushing yards and three additional scores.In the Chiefs' 40-22 Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Worthy stood out by catching all eight of his targets for 157 yards and two touchdowns at the Superdome in New Orleans. His standout performance was one of the few bright spots for the Chiefs in an otherwise disappointing championship game.Also Read: Mac Jones joins 49ers on two-year deal to bolster quarterback depth: Can he make the difference While the legal case remains unresolved, Worthy’s future both on and off the field hangs in the balance as the investigation continues.","Woman Granted Protective Order After Accusing Chiefs' WR Xavier Worthy of assaulting her.

"Facebook's ex-COO Sheryl Sandberg 'lied' about boarding flight that crash-landed, claims former employee Wynn-Williams' book",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebooks-ex-coo-sheryl-sandberg-lied-about-boarding-flight-that-crash-landed-claims-former-employee-wynn-williams-book/articleshow/118919496.cms,"What Sheryl Sandberg said about taking the San Franciso flight that crash-landed

What Wynn-Williams wrote on Sandberg’s post

Sheryl Sandberg , former COO of Meta, allegedly fabricated a story about narrowly escaping disaster by claiming she had planned to board Asiana Airlines Flight 214 , which crash-landed in San Francisco over a decade ago, killing three and injuring nearly 200 people. This accusation, according to a report in New York Post, comes from Sarah Wynn-Williams , a former subordinate who served as director of public policy under Sandberg for six years at Facebook (as the company was then called). Wynn-Williams makes the claim in her new memoir, Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, asserting that Sandberg, once Mark Zuckerberg ’s second-in-command, lied about almost being on the ill-fated flight.“Do people really lie about dodging plane crashes?” Wynn-Williams muses in her book. “Why would she? It’s not like Sheryl craves the spotlight.” She adds, “After that, I could never look at Sheryl the same way.”The flight in question departed from Incheon International Airport near Seoul, South Korea, on July 6, 2013, carrying 307 passengers and crew. During its approach to San Francisco International Airport, the Boeing 777-200ER descended too low and too slow, resulting in a catastrophic crash landing. Emergency crews responded swiftly, and most passengers evacuated before flames engulfed the aircraft. Tragically, three people perished—one killed by a rescue vehicle in the chaos — and 187 were injured, many with spinal or head trauma.Shortly after the incident, Sandberg posted on Facebook, claiming she, her family, and several Facebook colleagues had originally intended to take Flight 214. “We switched to United so we could use miles for my family’s tickets,” she wrote. “Our flight was due to arrive at the same time, but we landed about 20 minutes earlier.” In subsequent posts, she reassured followers of her safety and noted that Samsung executive David Eun, a friend who was on the flight, had survived. “Serious moment to give thanks,” she concluded. The post rapidly gained attention, amassing over 3,000 likes in its first hour.Wynn-Williams, however, disputes Sandberg’s account. In her memoir, she recalls seeing news reports suggesting Sandberg and other team members, including then-director of global communications Debbie Frost, were slated to be on the flight—information she says the staff only learned from Sandberg’s post. Skeptical, Wynn-Williams contacted Frost, who allegedly called Sandberg’s claim “totally weird,” pointing out that Sandberg “always flies United” and that Asiana was never an option. “I don’t know why she posted it or tagged us all,” Frost reportedly told her.Frost, when approached by The Post, directed inquiries to her Threads account, where she wrote, “Everyone’s got their own take, but a lot of these stories are blown out of proportion or just didn’t happen.” Wynn-Williams’ book also includes other provocative allegations, adding fuel to the controversy surrounding Sandberg’s tenure.","Sarah Wynn-Williams served as director of public policy under Sheryl Sandberg for six years at Facebook.

He will rejoin Intel's board of directors as part of his appointment.""I am honored to join Intel as CEO,"" Tan said in a statement. ""I see significant opportunities to remake our business in ways that serve our customers better and create value for our shareholders.""In his first memo to employees, Tan indicated Intel would maintain both its chip design and manufacturing operations: ""Together, we will work hard to restore Intel's position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before.""During his tenure at Cadence, Tan more than doubled the company's revenue and drove a stock price appreciation exceeding 3,200%. He is known for customer-centric innovation and deep relationships across the semiconductor ecosystem.The leadership change comes as Intel faces significant business challenges. The company's stock fell approximately 50% from the beginning of 2024 until Gelsinger's departure in December.

NEW DELHI: Bengaluru’s infamous traffic has once again become the subject of online satire, with a viral post humorously packaging the city's gridlock as a must-visit tourism experience. Former Infosys director Mohandas Pai shared an image promoting a fictional ""4-day, 3-night Bangalore Tourism"" trip, with the city's worst congestion points—Outer Ring Road, Silk Board Junction, Marathahalli, and HSR Layout—listed as key destinations.Calling it “a sad joke on Bengaluru,” Pai remarked that while locals may find humor in their daily ordeal, the government remains indifferent to their suffering. Sharing the now-viral text, he wrote, “Bangalore Tourism is organising a 4 day 3 nights trip to the following four destinations - Outer Ring Road , Silkboard Junction , Marathalli & HSR layout . Its called ' Chaar Jam Yatra '”—a sarcastic dig at the city's never-ending traffic snarls. He further criticized the authorities, stating, “Having a sense of humor about our suffering is all we can do with an uncaring government.”Bengaluru’s battered roads have also drawn public ire, with residents of Bellandur staging a protest ahead of Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar’s scheduled visit at 4 PM on Wednesday. Hundreds gathered at Devarabeesanahalli near Sakra Hospital, waving placards that read, ""No Need for a Moon Mission, Isro — Just Drive Here!""—a sarcastic jab at the crater-sized potholes dotting the city's roads.However, their frustration only grew when Shivakumar failed to turn up. ""This road has been in a terrible condition for the last six months,"" said Kusum Sahay, an elderly resident. ""There are no pavements for pedestrians, and stepping out of a car itself is a challenge.""Venkat, another protester, was furious over the state of one of Bengaluru’s prime localities. ""We are the crème de la crème of Bengaluru, yet infrastructure here is cringe-worthy. This is a major road connecting Koramangala and Indiranagar—how hard is it to fix it quickly?""For many, navigating these roads has become an everyday nightmare. ""We moved here two years ago hoping things would improve, but nothing has changed,"" said a Mantri Espana resident. ""Just yesterday, I took my father to an eye hospital—a seven-minute drive took 20 minutes because of these crater-sized potholes. For elderly people, walking to Sakra Hospital is impossible. We are forced to take cars even for short distances, and that just adds to the traffic chaos.""Kanchana Ganeshan, another protester, reminisced about how cycling in the area was once a joy. ""Four years ago, I used to cycle on the lake road. Now, I wouldn’t dare. What used to be a smooth ride has turned into a bone-rattling nightmare. Every day, travelling just seven kilometres is an ordeal.""While Bengaluru residents continue to air their grievances, the government’s response remains to be seen.","Bengaluru's infamous traffic has once again become the subject of online satire.
