Projections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) indicate that India is set to surpass Japan by 2025, making it the fourth-largest economy. Despite impressive economic growth, a significant gap persists between this expansion and the labour market, particularly among the youth, as highlighted by the latest data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS).Released by the Labour Bureau on September 23, 2024, the PLFS for July 2023 to June 2024 reveals ongoing challenges in the Indian labour market.Despite five years of decline, the overall unemployment rate has stagnated at 3.2% for 2023-24.Alarmingly, the youth unemployment rate is at 10.2%, with males at 9.8% and females facing a higher rate of 11%. This trend is particularly concerning for women, whose unemployment rate has increased from 2.9% to 3.2% over the past year.Topping the list, Lakshadweep has the highest unemployment rate for those aged 15 to 29, with an overall rate of 36.2%. Female unemployment in the union territory stands at a staggering 79.7%, compared to 26.2% for males.With an unemployment rate of 33.6%, this UT also has a significant gap between male (24%) and female (49.5%) unemployment.Despite having the highest literacy rate in India, Kerala faces an unemployment rate of 29.9%, with a particularly high female unemployment rate of 47.1%, compared to 19.3% for males.This northeastern state has an unemployment rate of 27.4%, with a more balanced distribution between males (27.9%) and females (26.6%).Manipur’s unemployment rate stands at 22.9%, with females facing higher unemployment (27.5%) compared to males (19.9%).The union territory of Ladakh has a total unemployment rate of 22.2%, with female unemployment reaching 38.3%, which is significantly higher than male unemployment at 11.4%.Arunachal Pradesh has an overall unemployment rate of 20.9%, with male unemployment at 21.9% and female unemployment at 19.6%. The relatively lower gap between male and female unemployment in this state shows a more balanced employment landscape. However, with a fifth of the youth population unemployed, the state still faces serious labour market challenges.Goa’s unemployment rate stands at 19.1%, with females experiencing much higher unemployment (31%) compared to males (13.2%). This sharp contrast in gender unemployment rates raises concerns about gender-specific barriers to employment in the state, despite its tourism-driven economy.Punjab faces an unemployment rate of 18.8%, with female unemployment at 24.5% and male unemployment at 16.7%. The state’s agricultural base and industrial growth have not translated into sufficient job opportunities for women, indicating the need for policies that foster more inclusive economic participation across genders.Andhra Pradesh rounds out the top 10 with an unemployment rate of 17.5%, featuring a female unemployment rate of 19.7% and a male unemployment rate of 16.4%. While the gap between genders is narrower here, the overall high rate of youth unemployment suggests a skills mismatch in the state’s labour market.","Despite impressive economic growth, a significant gap persists between this expansion and the labour market, particularly among the youth.

LUDHIANA: Cyber cheats from Assam and Bengal duped industrialist and Padma Bhushan awardee S P Oswal , chairperson of the $1.1bn Vardhman Group , of Rs 7 crore by purportedly masquerading as members of a CBI team probing misuse of his Aadhaar for passport and financial fraud, Ludhiana Police said Sunday after arresting two suspects from Guwahati the previous day and recovering Rs 5.2crore from them.Investigators said this was the highest amount seized in a cybercrime case in the country, based on data available with MHA’s Indian Cyber Crime Coordi nation Centre.Ludhiana police commissioner Kuldeep Singh Chahal said Vardhman Group lodged a complaint after Oswal realised he had been tricked into transferring money to two accounts. Till late Sunday, nobody from the company was available for comment.Atnu Chaudhary and Anand Kumar Chaudhary, the arrested men, were part of a nine-member gang that allegedly convinced Oswal about CBI registering a case against him after finding that his Aadhaar had been used to send a parcel to Malaysia containing 58 fake passports and 16 debit cards.The web of deceit started with a person claiming to be a CBI officer from Mumbai calling the industrialist, the police commissioner said . The imposter then made a video call , wearing a police uniform and seated in an office with CBI’s logo in the background. He sent a fake “arrest warrant” to Oswal over WhatsApp, claiming it was authorised by SC .The caller got Oswal to transfer Rs 7 crore to two bank accounts for bail proceedings and claimed he was being placed under “digital arrest”. After Oswal’s team lodged the complaint, investigators promptly initiated a process to get thebank accounts frozen , the police said.Inspector Jatinder Singh, SHO of Ludhiana cybercrime police station, said the gang member asked Oswal to transfer Rs 4 crore to one account and deposit Rs 3 crore in three transactions into a second bank account.By the time the accounts were frozen, the suspects withdrew Rs 1.7 crore . “We have already returned to the complainant the Rs 5.2crore that was seized,” Singh said.","S P Oswal, chairperson of the $1.1bn Vardhman Group, was duped of Rs 7 crore.

Nandini: A popular household name in South India

Leadership at KMF

The origins of

Karnataka Milk Federation

(KMF)

How KMF functions today

NEW DELHI: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam ( TTD ) has appointed ‘ Nandini ’ as the new ghee supplier, with the supply order already issued to the company. The Andhra Pradesh government took this action amid controversy over the alleged adulteration of laddus at the Tirupati temple, following claims of the use of animal fat and other substances.‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.It is Karnataka’s biggest milk brand and is also recognised in neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Goa. The ‘Nandini’ brand is owned by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Limited ( KMF ), the second-largest dairy cooperative in India, after Gujarat’s Amul.The current managing director and CEO of KMF is Karnataka administrative service officer MK Jagdish.KMF’s history dates back to 1955, when the first dairy cooperative was established in the Kodagu district of Karnataka. At that time, there was no system of packaged milk, and farmers delivered milk directly to households. There was also a shortage of milk. It wasn't until the 1970s, during India’s ‘White Revolution,’ that efforts to increase milk production took hold, supported by World Bank projects.In 1974, the Karnataka government created the Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (KDCC) to implement these dairy projects. By 1984, KDCC was renamed the Karnataka Milk Federation, and it began selling packaged milk and other products under the brand name ‘Nandini.’ Over time, ‘Nandini’ grew into Karnataka’s most popular dairy brand and expanded to neighbouring states.KMF operates 15 dairy unions throughout Karnataka, including the Bengaluru, Kolar, and Mysore Cooperative Milk Unions. These unions buy milk from village-level Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS) and deliver it to KMF for processing. According to the Karnataka Milk Federation’s website, KMF purchases over 86 lakh kilos of milk daily from 26 lakh farmers in 24,000 villages.One of KMF’s standout features is its daily payment system for milk suppliers, who are mainly small farmers and producers. The federation distributes more than Rs 28 crore in daily payments. KMF has 15 units that process and package milk, which is then sold through various channels.","‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.

Water shortage in Bengaluru: Tanker bill per house goes up to Rs 25k here,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/water-shortage-in-bengaluru-tanker-bill-per-house-goes-up-to-rs-25k-here/articleshow/113683003.cms,"The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand.

BENGALURU: Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now, forcing them to rely on very few private water tankers to meet their daily needs. The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand, and each household is spending anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 every month on water.BWSSB officials attribute the delay in addressing the issue to the pending activation of Cauvery Stage 5.Rishabh Aditya, a software engineer and new father, shared the difficulties faced by his family due to irregular water supply. ""I have an infant at home, and water has become a top priority for us. We need it for cooking, cleaning, and giving warm baths to the baby. Unfortunately, we receive no support from BWSSB, and we are forced to rely on tankers,"" he said.Aditya described the frustration of having to stay awake until late at night to ensure water delivery. ""Tankers supply water based on who books first. With more than 100 people in the layout, we often have to wait until 1am, which is exhausting,"" he said.The cost of water from tankers varies, with residents paying anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000 for a 5,000-litre load. For larger families, the expenses quickly add up. Naveenchandra Keshavmurthy, another resident, shared that his household spends Rs 20,000 to Rs 35,000 each month on water. ""We are in absolute misery because of the lack of BWSSB water supply. Despite our complaints, nothing has been done,"" he maintained.Senior citizens living in the area are also feeling the pinch, especially those who rely on pension and savings. Jaishankar V, an elderly resident, expressed concern over the financial strain caused by the ongoing crisis. ""It is painful for us, especially those who are retired. Depending on tankers every day is draining our savings, and monthly costs are overwhelming just for basic water supply,"" he lamented.Venkateshwar, a local tanker owner, said the challenges faced by operators in sourcing and supplying water to the area. ""There is a huge demand for water here, and it is difficult for us to source enough to meet everyone's needs. We charge reasonable rates, but residents still complain.""The residents approached BWSSB officials multiple times, but have only received assurances. According to BWSSB chairman Ram Prasath Manohar, the delay is due to the pending release of Cauvery Stage 5 water. ""These layouts, including Kamadhenu, were developed in 110 villages, and water supply was not originally allocated for them. However, in a few weeks, they will receive water from BWSSB. We are working to address the tanker mafia problem in the area,"" he said.","Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said that India would have been willing to provide Pakistan with a financial aid package larger than what the country is currently seeking from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ), had Islamabad maintained friendly relations with New Delhi.""I said, my Pakistani friends, why have strained relations, we are neighbours.If we had good relations, we would have given more money than the IMF,"" defence minister said.Speaking in the Gurez assembly segment of Bandipora district, Singh said that the government is dedicated to the development of Jammu and Kashmir, citing the substantial Rs 90,000 crore package announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014-15. He argued that this commitment to the region starkly contrasts with Pakistan’s reliance on international financial assistance.During his speech, Singh invoked former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's remark that ""we can change friends, but we cannot change our neighbours,"" urging Pakistan to reconsider its strained relations with India.The defence minister criticised Pakistan for allegedly misusing financial aid to fund terrorism . He highlighted that India’s financial support for Jammu and Kashmir is aimed at fostering development and expressed hope that the region could once again become a ""paradise on earth,"" aligning with Vajpayee's vision of restoring ""Insaniyat, Jamhooriyat, and Kashmiriyat.""Singh said that Pakistan's use of terrorism as a tool against India has led to its isolation on international platforms, with even traditional allies distancing themselves.""Whenever we have investigated terrorism, we have found Pakistani involvement. Our successive governments have tried to make Pakistan understand that they should stop terror camps but to no avail. Pakistan is frustrated after revocation of Article 370 and is making attempts to revive terror. They do not want democracy to take roots here. (But) India is strong enough that it can take on Pakistan on its soil. If anyone in Pakistan carries out an attack on India, we can crossover and respond,"" he added.The defence minister also addressed local concerns in Gurez, promising increased recruitment from the area into the Indian Army if BJP candidate Faqeer Mohammad Khan is elected. He reiterated the demand for an all-weather tunnel through the Razdan Pass, which would enhance connectivity to the rest of the country.With improvements in infrastructure, including 24-hour electricity and better roads, Singh assured residents that discussions would be held post-elections to address their needs further. ""As the defence minister of the country, I assure you that after the polls I will bring the concerned minister here to discuss it,"" he said.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh said India would have been willing to provide Pakistan with a financial aid package larger than what the country is currently seeking from the IMF.

NEW DELHI: Putting the onus of deciding whether life support should be withdrawn from a terminally ill patient or not would impose undue stress on doctors, Indian Medical Association has said.According to Dr R V Asokan , IMA's national president, such clinical decisions have always been taken in good faith by doctors.""Our job is to inform the patient or her or his family member about the condition and explain to them about the prognosis.After that, it is their call as to whether they want to continue life support or not. This guideline, however, intends to create a framework defining the role of doctors which is concerning for us,"" he said.The draft guideline put out by the health ministry for public comments on the issue suggests life support can be withdrawn from a terminally ill patient if both the primary board and the secondary medical board constituted by a hospital and the family or surrogate of the patient give their consent. It is applicable to patients who are terminally ill, and not expected to benefit from life sustaining treatments (LST) that include (but are not limited to) mechanical ventilation, surgical procedures, parenteral nutrition or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).According to the guideline, the primary medical board (PMB) which must assess the inappropriateness of life support should consist of the primary physician and at least two subject experts with at least five years of experience. After that, the decision is to be verified further by the secondary medical board (SMB) which should consist of one registered medical practitioner (RMP) nominated by the CMO and at least two subject experts.A member of the PMB cannot form part of the SMB. Additionally, the govt guideline suggests, the hospital may constitute a clinical ethics committee of multi-professional members for audit, oversight and conflict resolution.Dr Sushma Bhatnagar , who heads the cancer centre at AIIMS , was also involved in the development of the govt guideline. She said, ""In medicine, we all have learnt how to diagnose and how to treat but no one has taught us what should be our approach when end is inevitable. Thus, we keep treating a person even if we know that there is no chance of recovery. And finally the person may not survive even after we have provided all sorts of technologically-advanced treatment with best equipment at hand. Those could have been used for someone who could be cured.""""This policy can help in better understanding of diagnosis and prognosis.

North India logs its best monsoon in 11 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/north-india-logs-its-best-monsoon-in-11-years/articleshow/113793693.cms,"Monsoon at record high

NEW DELHI: This has been the wettest monsoon in north India in 11 years. The region, often plagued by large monsoon deficits while staring at a worsening groundwater situation, recorded 628mm from June 1 to Sept 29, its highest rainfall since 2013.That this was the best monsoon in the region in over a decade with the seasonal rainfall just 7.1% above normal - less than the national average of 7.8% - shows that north India hasn't had a significantly wet June-Sept period in recent years.Meanwhile, this year's monsoon season is set to officially end on Monday with India having received the highest rainfall since 2020 and recorded the lowest number of subdivisions with deficient rains - three out of 36 - since 2019. Overall, the monsoon is set to be 7-8% higher than the long period average (LPA), in the 'above-normal' category. This marks the sixth year in a row that the country has seen normal to above-normal rainfall in the season. In north India, where showers have persisted till the fourth week of Sept, the plains have received better rainfall than the hill states, with the exception of Punjab, which is one of the three deficit subdivisions with a seasonal shortfall of 28%.Other subdivisions in the plains have received rains in the normal range (-20 to +20% of LPA), the exceptions being west Rajasthan (excess rainfall) and east Rajasthan (above normal). Rains in late Sept, particularly in UP, augur well for soil moisture for rabi crops which will be sown from late Oct onwards.The region with by far the highest surplus this monsoon is central India. It has received nearly 20% higher-than normal rainfall at 1,165.6mm, making it the wettest monsoon in the region since 2019. As central India's output closely mirror's monsoon's performance across the country, this is the sixth straight year of normal to above-normal seasonal rainfall in the region. In 2019, the year of 'excess' monsoon in the country, central India had logged 1263.2mm of rain, 29% above the LPA. After central India, the South logged the second highest rain surplus in the country. The region has recorded 811.4mm of rain since June 1, 14.3% above the LPA. East & Northeast is the only region in the country to show arain deficit during this monsoon at 13.7%.This year's monsoon was expected to have been propelled by two largescale factors - La Nina in the Pacific and a 'positive dipole' in the Indian Ocean. Both failed to materialise. ""While these remained neutral, intra-seasonal factors came into play to aid rainfall,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, IMD chief. An equatorial storm system called MJO remained in favourable phases from the end of June till mid-Sept, leading to formation of higher-than-normal number of low-pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal, which travelled inland and caused rainfall.""","This has been the wettest monsoon in north India in 11 years.

NEW DELHI: With the huge trust deficit with China continuing along the Line of Actual Control, India is going full steam ahead with preparations to maintain its forward deployment of troops for the fifth successive winter in the forbidding terrain of eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh-Sikkim.There may be indications of ""progress and narrowing of differences"" in political-diplomatic talks, but top sources in the defence establishment told TOI that ""the trust deficit on the ground with the People's Liberation Army PLA ) remains very high"".The way China continues to strengthen its forward military positions as well as build 'permanent defences' and infrastructure all along the 3,488-km LAC , it is quite clear the PLA will not be returning to its peacetime locations in the near future, the sources added.As the Army transitions from 'the summer to winter posture', with massive 'winter stocking' underway for the additional troops forward deployed along the frontier, General Upendra Dwivedi and the commanders-in-chief of the force's seven commands will also review the operational situation at a meeting to be held in Gangtok (Sikkim) on Oct 9-10.Talk of a possible breakthrough in the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh has been fuelled by a flurry of bilateral political-diplomatic talks over the last couple of months. These included the 30th and 31st meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) on July 31 and Aug 29, which were followed by a meeting between national security advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on the side-lines of a BRICS meet at St Petersburg on Sept 12.The rival military corps commanders, however, held their 21st round of talks way back on Feb 19. China had then once again rebuffed India's push for defusing the two major continuing face-offs at the strategically-located Depsang Plains, which is towards the crucial Daulat Beg Oldie and Karakoram Pass in the north, and the Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok.""Disengagement at Depsang and Demchok, if it happens, will only be the first step. Till the subsequent de-escalation and de-induction of troops take place for restoration of status quo ante, the threat will remain,"" a senior officer said.The creation of buffer zones after the earlier troop disengagements at Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso-Kailash Range and Gogra-Hot Springs up till Sept 2022 as well as the confrontation at Depsang and Demchok has meant that Indian troops cannot access 26 of their 65 patrolling points (PPs), which begin from the Karakoram Pass in the north and go down to Chumar in the south in eastern Ladakh.""Even the buffer zones were meant to be only temporary arrangements. China continues to make unreasonable demands and is playing the long waiting game. India has to be careful about not falling into China's trap,"" the officer said.There is, of course, the realization that with the military stalemate persisting, only politico-diplomatic talks can break the deadlock.“If the two sides agree to a broad framework, the actual disengagement modalities at Depsang and Demchok can be worked out at the military level,” he added.The Army, meanwhile, is maintaining ‘a high level of operational preparedness’, with readjustment of troops along with adequate reserve forces and logistics in each sector of the LAC, to deal with any contingency","India is going full steam ahead with preparations to maintain its forward deployment of troops for the fifth successive winter in the forbidding terrain of eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh-Sikkim.

NEW DELHI: The government has set off the process to verify and include in the foster care and adoption pool of the Central Adoption Resources Authority children above six years living in child care institutions (CCIs) who have not been visited by anyone from their family for a stipulated period of time or whose guardians have been found to be unfit to take care of them due to any mental or terminal illness.States are verifying and processing all these cases for inclusion in the pool. Speaking at the closing session of the national consultation organised under the aegis of the Supreme Court ’s Juvenile Justice Committee and Unicef on the protection of the rights of children with disabilities , women and child development secretary Anil Malik shared that to include the identified children in the adoption pool two new categories are being added pertaining to cases involving “unfit guardians” and “no visitations”. These new categories have been added in addition to the existing categories of orphaned, abandoned, and surrendered (OAS) children in the adoption pool of the Central Adoption Resources Authority.Nearly 15,000 children, across these categories, who can be moved to the adoption pool from CCIs have been identified across institutions in the country.The Supreme Court had in Nov 2023 directed the government to identify and register all such children languishing in CCIs and those not reaching the care institutions without any delay.The WCD secretary reiterated that the step to include these older children in CCIs in the adoption pool was in line with the view of integrating as many children with the mainstream by trying to see that they grow up in a family and have a social upbringing and not be left to grow in the confines of a children home.“As far as children registered under the category of ‘no visitation’ and ‘ unfit guardians ’ are concerned, they will primarily be potential cases for foster care. Once such children are declared legally free, their permanent rehabilitation can be facilitated through adoption,” CARA had stated in its memorandum issued earlier this year to all state adoption resource authorities, district child protection units, specialised adoption agencies and child care institutions.While emphasising the growing focus on foster care, Malik also emphasised that to step-up adoptions of children with disabilities the process has been streamlined which has given an impetus to the adoptions in this category not just by foreigners and NRIs but also prospective parents from within the country. Malik said they were noticing a positive change in attitudes. The WCD secretary shared that in 2022-23, 152 children with disabilities were adopted. This rose to 309 last year and so far this year, around 150 children have already found a family.","Nearly 15,000 children, across these categories, who can be moved to the adoption pool from CCIs have been identified.

NEW DELHI: France has submitted its final price offer to India for the purchase of 26 Rafale Marine jets . This comes ahead of Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval 's visit to France. Defense sources told ANI that the French side has provided a significant price reduction after tough negotiations.India and France are in talks to buy the jets for deployment on the INS Vikrant aircraft carrier and various bases.A French team was in India last week to finalise discussions.

India has approved modifications in the letter of request, including integrating the indigenous Uttam radar in the jets. Although integration may take about eight years and be costly, it has been a point of negotiation.India had also requested France to integrate indigenous weapons on the plane, including the Astra beyond visual range missiles and the Rudram anti-radiation missiles. The deal's price is based on previous agreements, such as the rate of inflation, and the past deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets for the Indian Air Force.The Indian side will also receive a larger number of long-range air-to-air Meteor missiles and anti-ship weaponry in this project, which is planned to be concluded before the end of this financial year. Some of the Indian Air Force requirements have also been incorporated in the naval deal, including around 40 drop tanks and a small number of work stations for the planes.","India and France are in talks to buy the jets for deployment on the INS Vikrant aircraft carrier and various bases.

"Lawyer in Pakistan out to prove Bhagat Singh innocent, determined to name a roundabout after him in Lahore",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawyer-in-pakistan-out-to-prove-bhagat-singh-innocent-determined-to-name-a-roundabout-after-him-in-lahore/articleshow/113791229.cms,"Imtiaz Rasheed Qureshi wearing Tee with pic of Bhagat Singh at Shadman chowk, Lahore high court

BATHINDA: Raising voice for a freedom fighter from another country and demanding to name a roundabout after him is not an easy task but an advocate in Pakistan is relentlessly fighting a legal battle for Bhagat Singh for over a decade. Advocate Imtiaz Rasheed Qureshi had to face onslaught from fundamentalists but undeterred about it he is continuing with his fight untiringly.Qureshi had first brush with legal recourse involving Bhagat Singh in May 2013 when he along with his father advocate Abdul Rasheed Qureshi, had filed a petition in Lahore High Court demanding to reopen the Lahore Conspiracy Case of 1928 pertaining to the killing of the then Assistant Superintendent of Police John P Saunders stating the case did not fulfill the requirements of justice as due process had not been followed. The death sentence to Bhagat Singh, Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar was pronounced without hearing testimonies of nearly 450 witnesses or giving defendants a chance to appeal. They had demanded to declare the three as innocents as even Bhagat Singh’ name was not mentioned in the FIR registered at Anarkali Bazaar Police station on December 17, 1928 upon the killing of Saunders.The last hearing in the case was held on February 3, 2016, when Abdul Rashid Qureshi had demanded the setting up of the constitution bench comprising more than 3 judges as the death sentence to Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev was awarded by a bench of three judges. They were sentenced to death on October 7, 1930, and were hanged on March 23, 1931, at Lahore Central Jail.Concerned over undue delay in taking up the petition to prove the innocence of the martyrs, Imtiaz Rasheed Qureshi moved applications for early fixation of the case including an application for fair trial in March this year after the Pakistan Supreme Court had ruled on March 6 that former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was hanged 44 years ago on April 4, 1979 in a murder case, did not get a fair trial.Imtiaz earlier on February 21, 2018, had filed another petition in Lahore High Court under article 199 of constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 where a prayer was made seeking direction to the Punjab provincial government to change the name of a roundabout ‘ shadman chowk ’ in heart of Lahore of as Bhagat Singh Chowk and made Punjab Chief Secretary, Deputy Commissioner Lahore and Lord Mayor Lahore as respondents. Shadman roundabout had come up at the place then part of Lahore Central Jail where Bhagat Singh was hanged with Rajguru and Sukhdev on March 23, 1931.Disposing of the petition on September 5, 2018, the court of Justice Shahid Jamil Khan had directed the Lord Mayor of Lahore to decide the petition seeking the shadman roundabout to be named after Bhagat Singh at the earliest.When no progress was made even after more than 5 years over the issue, Imtiaz Qureshi on March 1, 2024, filed the contempt petition under article 204 of the constitution of Pakistan, 1973 read with sections ¾ of the contempt of court act, 2003. The court of Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza of Lahore High Court on March 4 approved the contempt petition, for naming the roundabout as Bhagat Singh Chowk.Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza on September 13, 2024, while giving the last chance to the respondents to act on the contempt petition against not naming Shadman Chowk of the provincial capital after freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, adjourned the matter to November 8.Before starting the legal battles, during which he received threats from fundamentalist elements, Imtiaz Rasheed Qureshi had formed the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation in 2010 along with father Abdul Rasheed.“My elder brother, who was Inspector in Punjab police, during his college days used to observe the days associated with Bhagat Singh and getting inspiration from it I decided to take ahead the memory of Bhagat Singh and formed the foundation by taking along like minded people”, said 53 years Qureshi while speaking to TOI over phone from Lahore while reminiscing about fondness about Bhagat Singh.“Bhagat Singh was born at village Chak 105 Bangay near Faisalabad on September 28, 1907, studied at Lahore and was even hanged at Lahore Central Jail. Bhagat Singh is not the martyr of India alone, but he is the Hero of the sub- continent and could not be limited to Hindus or Sikhs rather Muslims also see him as a Hero who fought against imperialist forces. Even the founder of Pakistan Mohammad Ali Jinah had praised Bhagat Singh on September 4 and 12, 1929 in the national assembly”, says Imtiaz telling reasons behind his pursuing cases pertaining to Bhagat Singh in Pakistan without any assistance. Taking the cases to a logical conclusion is now the only mission of my life, he says.Similar efforts had also been made in Lahore well before Qureshi, as activists including Diep Saeeda, founder of centre for peace and secular studies raising voice for naming the roundabout after Bhagat Singh. Even earlier in 2012 the Lahore authorities had agreed to rename chowk in the name of Bhagat Singh after ‘Dilkash Lahore Committee’ formed for rehabilitation/restoration of historical buildings by involving judicial officers, academicians, eminent citizens. But Tehrik Hurmat-e-Rasool, a concern associated with Jamaat-Ud-Dawah (JuD) approached the Lahore High Court which stayed the issuance of notification and after that it was only in 2018 that Imtiaz again took up the cause.Even while disposing the writ petition 168074 of 2018 of Imtiaz Qureshi, in its order on September 5, 2018, Justice Shahid Jamil Khan had mentioned that the same grievance was voiced through writ petition in 2012.","Advocate Imtiaz Rasheed Qureshi has been fighting a legal battle for Bhagat Singh for over a decade. He had to face onslaught from fundamentalists but undeterred about it he is continuing with his fight untiringly. The last hearing in the case was held on February 3, 2016, when Abdul Rashid Qurehi had demanded the setting up of the constitution bench comprising more than 3 judges.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113791290,imgsize-601255,width-400,resizemode-4/113791290.jpg"

Citing Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif 's United Nations General Assembly ( UNGA ) speech where he accused New Delhi of ""escalating tensions"" in Kashmir, Jaishankar also warned that Islamabad's ""actions will most certainly have consequences"".Addressing the UNGA, Jaishankar said that the ""issue to be resolved between the two countries is only the vacation of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir by Islamabad and the abandonment of its long-standing attachment to terrorism.""""Some make conscious choices with disastrous consequences.

She further claimed that Combs impregnated her, and despite pressure from his associates to terminate the pregnancy, she experienced a miscarriage, the Deadline reported.The lawsuit outlines a troubling pattern of conduct, accusing Combs of coercing the plaintiff to consume ketamine and alcohol while subjecting her to non-consensual sexual acts while she was in an unconscious state.“At every visit, (Combs) would make her ‘perform a show’ for him and would ply her with alcohol and substances until she passed out — she would wake up with bruising and injuries but with no recollection of how she sustained her injuries,” it added.According to the lawsuit, she claims she first met the rapper at an ""overseas location,"" where he paid for her travel, and the two began seeing each other ""regularly"" afterward, BBC reported.Represented by Joseph L. Ciaccio from Napoli Shkolnik's Personal Injury Practice, Jane Doe is seeking unspecified damages.These serious allegations surface while Combs remains incarcerated, adding to a growing series of complaints.

Dominik Mysterio , a rising star in WWE and the son of legendary wrestler Rey Mysterio , has gained attention not only for his impressive in-ring career but also for his personal life. Fans have often wondered about his relationship status, and many have speculated on whether he’s married. While there have been rumors regarding Dominik being in a relationship with Liv Morgan.Dominik’s romantic life has frequently been tied to fellow WWE Superstar, Liv Morgan and this was further escalated after the WWE Women’s World Champion stole a kiss after he failed help Becky Lynch capture the title.Former North American Champion Dominik Mysterio is married to his long-time girlfriend, Marie Juliette . The two tied the knot earlier this year, on March 6, 2024. However, Mysterio had made their relationship public on social media nine years ago. Their wedding was attended by several WWE stars, including Damian Priest, Austin Theory, Rey Mysterio (his father), and his on-screen partner, Rhea Ripley.Dominik and Marie Juliette’s love story feels like a fairy tale, as they instantly connected when they first met at the age of 14 in a school Spanish class. After nearly 12 years of dating, they got engaged in January 2023. While not much is known about Marie Juliette's career, rumors suggest she may be pursuing a path in music.Although Dominik Mysterio is making waves on WWE Raw , his heart belongs to his wife, MJ.

NEW DELHI: Foreign investors have poured Rs 57,359 crore into Indian equities in Sept, making it the highest inflow in nine months, mainly driven by a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve .With this infusion, foreign portfolio investors’ (FPIs) investment in equities has surpassed the Rs 1 lakh crore mark in 2024, data with the depositories showed. FPI inflows are likely to remain robust, driven by global interest rate easing and India’s strong fundamentals.However, the RBI ’s decisions, particularly regarding inflation management and liquidity, will be key in sustaining this momentum, Robin Arya, smallcase manager and founder & CEO of research analyst firm GoalFi, said.According to the data, FPIs made a net investment of Rs 57,359 crore in equities until Sept 27, with one trading session still left this month. This was the highest net inflow since Dec 2023, when FPIs had invested Rs 66,135 crore in equities.Since June, FPIs have consistently bought equities after withdrawing Rs 34,252 crore in April-May. Overall, FPIs have been net buyers in 2024, except for Jan, April, and May.Several factors have contributed to the recent surge in FPI inflow into Indian equity markets, such as the start of the interest rate cut cycle initiated by the US Fed, increased India weightage in global indices, better growth prospects, and a series of large IPOs, Himanshu Srivastava, associate director — manager research, Morningstar Investment Research India, said.","Foreign investors have poured Rs 57,359 crore into Indian equities in Sept.

They will also write to Delhi govt for disbursal of the Rs 1 crore compensation, besides service benefits, they said.Belonging to the batch of 2018, Sandeep was a brave and diligent policeman, his colleagues said. The cops described him as hardworking, kind-hearted and cheerful. ""He took his work seriously and was brave. He would single-handedly catch criminals and help needy people in the area. He was always ready to help people,"" said a colleague.""Sandeep knew every household in his beat area, including the number of people living there and any guests visiting,"" recalled a head constable, who didn't wish to be named.""We generally patrol in pairs. Despite warnings from us to avoid patrolling alone late at night, Sandeep would often rush to the scene whenever he received information about any disturbance,"" said a sub-inspector who knew Sandeep closely.Unfortunately, Sandeep's murder isn't an isolated instance, but, in fact, an addition to the growing lawlessness in the city.""The fear of law is evidently waning in the capital. Criminals have become trigger-happy like never before and shoot at will. The city's streets have turned into a playground for rogue elements and police seem to be watching helplessly,"" said a retired cop. ""An unprecedented situation seems to be unfolding wherein even the cops are also not being spared now,"" the cop added.Then, there are gang wars breaking out in the city, which were earlier restricted to outskirts, but are now happening inside crowded restaurants and upscale areas like GK-I.""The fact that criminals believe that they can get away with ease after this scale of violence shows how brazen they have become. There seems a lack of fear of police and it's a matter of serious concern,"" another cop said.Even in the latest case, there were not one but three cops at the spot, but not only did the WagonR driver manage to mow Sandeep down, but also managed to flee with ease, leaving his car behind. The FIR, accessed by TOI, even cites cops saying that they heard the driver, Dharmender, screaming: ""Let's kill this cop today!"".Retired police officers pointed out that such incidents also showed that the force needed to strengthen and modernise policing measures like street surveillance, area domination, night patrolling and beat policing. Former top cops agree that an immediate course correction was the need of the hour and that Delhi Police needed a complete overhaul across its ranks to make the city safer.","Sandeep Malik was a brave and diligent policeman, his colleagues said.

""Other GMs around the league believe the Jets need to start making calls.""

""I don't sense panic internally in New York, especially considering the play of 2023 first-rounder Will McDonald has been better than expected (five sacks),"" she reported. ""As for Reddick, unless he gets a new deal, I don't expect him to show up anytime soon. At this point, it might be more surprising if he ever plays a single snap for the Jets.""

Risky Acquisition and Potential Fallout



With his holdout entering its 15th day, Haason Reddick 's losses are growing closer to eight figures. The New York Jets ' edge rusher is due to face the Denver Broncos in Week 4. Rich Cimini of ESPN reported that in that time, Reddick has lost $3.16 million in-game checks alone, each of which is worth around $792,000. That loss is compounded by $5.9 million in fines—both mandatory and discretionary—that he incurred.Also Read - Record Breaking Viewership of NFL Adding to Reddick's challenge is that the Jets may be able to recover some of his prorated signing bonus starting in Week 5, potentially another $2.74 million. The two-time Pro Bowler seems adamant about getting a new contract from New York or working a trade to another team. But he has to end his holdout eventually; he might end up doing nothing for his career chances if it goes on through the season.According to Joel Corry of CBSSports.com, Reddick likely is in line for free agency if deadlock persists, but he can be tolled into '24, which would keep the 30-year-old from entering free agency, keeping him tied to New York's roster till '25.General manager Joe Douglas will face increasing pressure with the Nov. 5 trade deadline as, with each week that passes, Reddick's market value continues its downhill trend.The Athletic's Dianna Russini reported,New York moved its chips onto Reddick in this case, hoping that his preference lies with security. That sounds like the worst-case scenario is playing out for the house in question, and it leaves the Jets trying to figure out what they are going to do with an unresolved fate of Reddick.Also Read - How NFL Players Invest","Haason Reddick's holdout is entering its 15th day.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Islamabad, In an effort to minimise administrative expenditures, cash-strapped Pakistan on Sunday announced to abolish about 150,000 government posts , close six ministries, and merge two others, as part of reforms agreed upon with the IMF under USD 7 billion loan deal . The International Monetary Fund on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to cut expenditures, increase tax-to GDP ratio, tax non-traditional sectors like agriculture and real estate, limit subsidies and transfer some fiscal responsibilities to provinces.Addressing the media on his return from the US, Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb said that a programme had been finalised with the IMF, which would be the last programme for Pakistan.""We need to implement our policies to prove that it will be the last programme,"" he said, and emphasised that in order to join the G20, the economy must be formalised.The minister said right-sizing within ministries was going on and the decision to close six ministries is set to be implemented, while two ministries will be merged. ""Additionally, 150,000 posts across various ministries will be eliminated,"" Aurangzeb said.He dwelt at length on increasing tax revenues, noting that there were approximately 300,000 new taxpayers last year, and so far this year, 732,000 new taxpayers have registered, increasing the total number of taxpayers in the country from 1.6 million to 3.2 million.Aurangzeb also said that the non-filers category will be abolished and those not paying taxes will no longer be able to purchase property or vehicles.The minister claimed that the economy was moving in the right direction and the country's foreign exchange reserves had increased, reaching their highest level. He highlighted significant growth in both national exports and IT exports, and stated that investor confidence regarding the strength of the economy is a major success.Aurangzeb stated that the policy rate has been reduced by 4.5 per cent by the government after coming to power, and expressed optimism that the exchange rate and policy rate will remain as expected.""Our claim that the economy is improving is not a hollow claim because inflation has decreased due to government policies. Inflation has dropped to single digits,"" he said.Pakistan has been struggling to fix its economy for the last many years and it was close to default in 2023 but a timely loan of USD 3 billion by the IMF saved the situation.Pakistan has negotiated a long-term loan with the global lender with the hope and commitment that it would be the last loan. However, many doubt this claim as the country has already secured about two dozen loans from the Fund but failed to address the economy on a permanent basis.","Pakistan to abolish about 150,000 government posts, close six ministries, and merge two others.

Malcolm Gladwell , the best-selling author ofone of the most important non-fiction books of the 21st century, is back with its dark sequelWhile discussing the new book with the Guardian, Gladwell calls out what he calls Harvard’s admission officers’ “bias towards affluent white students”.Pointing out the disparity between Harvard and an institution with a merit-based admissions process like Caltech compared to Harvard, he writes: “My suspicion is that for many people it’s unconscious, but there must be a point at which [Harvard admissions tutors] are confronting the fact that they have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their campus hasn’t become dominated by Asians and Indians.”In the book, Gladwell notes that Caltech, a highly competitive university with a merit-based admissions system, saw the proportion of Asian American students rise from 25% to 43% between 1992 and 2013.In contrast, at Harvard, where the admissions process is influenced by factors such as legacy, donor contributions, and athletic scholarships, the percentage of Asian American students has remained consistently between 15-20% during the same period. Indian applicants are even more likely to be excluded by Harvard’s application process.Gladwell goes on to argue: ""Meritocracy is one of the most beautiful inventions of the 20th century – it is a foundation of a free society.""Here are 10 other key points aboutand Malcolm Gladwell:Malcolm Gladwell was initially reluctant to revisit his debut work but ultimately chose to create an entirely new version, one that reflects today's more anxious world rather than simply updating the original.The foundational idea that social trends behave like epidemics, initially growing slowly before suddenly taking off, still holds true. However, some of Gladwell's original examples have not aged well.Gladwell now finds his earlier chapter on crime ""embarrassing,"" as he once credited New York City's crime reduction to 'broken windows' policing. He has since acknowledged that this approach led to over-policing in minority neighbourhoods and wasn't actually responsible for the drop in crime rates.Gladwell values the process of learning from errors, a trait he respects in his father. He proposes that authors should periodically reassess their original works every 25 years to stay aligned with new insights.The new book is darker and more nuanced than the original. It delves into how a small number of individuals can disproportionately influence significant events, such as the opioid crisis, where a minority of doctors were responsible for nearly half of all prescriptions.While The Tipping Point became a cultural phenomenon, Gladwell’s latest book explores how individuals with substantial influence can shape societal changes, both positively and negatively.Gladwell reflects on how male leadership failures over the past eight years make a strong case for female leaders, particularly in the current political climate.Gladwell has expressed his support for Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election, noting a personal connection through his mother, who shares Jamaican heritage with Harris's father.He argues that recent examples of male leadership failures have made it increasingly difficult to justify misogynistic attitudes and believes that America is ready for a female president.Now living with his partner and two young daughters, Gladwell views parenting as a journey of intellectual humility. He continuously adapts his understanding of his children as they grow and sees this phase of his life as a ""productivity mechanism"" that shapes his evolving perspective.","Malcolm Gladwell's new book, ""Revenge of the Tipping Point,"" is darker and more nuanced than the original.
