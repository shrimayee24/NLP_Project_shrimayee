BJP MP seeks privilege proceedings against Rahul for 'gibberish canards',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-mp-seeks-privilege-proceedings-against-rahul-for-gibberish-canards/articleshow/117933986.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Tuesday wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla for initiating breach of privilege proceedings against Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi for spreading ""gibberish canards"" through his speech in the House.This comes a day after a privilege notice was filed by BJP MPs against senior Congress neta Sonia Gandhi for her remarks on President Droupadi Murmu.With Rahul's speech on Monday, during the discussion on the motion of thanks on the President's address, drawing strong protests from BJP, Dubey submitted his notice to the speaker, stating the Congress MP was using his parliamentary privilege to spread canards without authenticating his charges.Dubey said the Congress MP's speech carried mainly claims, including that mobile phones were not made in India but only assembled here, and China has captured Indian territory. Rahul had also alleged that India had sent external affairs minister S Jaishankar to the US to get an invite for Prime Minister Narendra Modi for US President Donald Trump's swearing-in ceremony.Dubey also touched on the issue of the Congress MP's allegations related to his demand for caste census.""While raising these issues, Rahul Gandhi has not only shamelessly distorted the historical and substantive facts but also made an attempt to ridicule our country and lower the prestige of our Republic,"" he said, adding Birla had asked Rahul to authenticate his claims while noting that the Congress MP had not done it yet.""This 'erudite' person has neither authenticated his gibberish canards nor apologised of using the pious forum of Parliament to defame our country and the elected govt,"" the BJP MP said.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla for initiating breach of privilege proceedings against Rahul Gandhi.

"Rajnath: Rahul’s remark on Army chief, China irresponsible politics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajnath-rahuls-remark-on-army-chief-china-irresponsible-politics/articleshow/117933689.cms,"NEW DELHI :

Refuting Rahul Gandhi ’s claim that the Army chief had said Chinese troops were present inside Indian territory, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday slammed the Congress MP for making “false accusations” and indulging in “irresponsible politics” on matters of national security.“The Army chief’s remarks referred only to the disturbance of traditional patrolling by both sides. He also mentioned these practices have been restored to their traditional pattern as part of the recent disengagement (in Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh in Oct),” Singh said in a post on ‘X’.Noting that the words attributed to Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi “were never spoken by him at any time”, Singh added that it is “a matter of deep regret that Shri Rahul Gandhi should indulge in irresponsible politics on matters of national interest”.Speaking during the debate on the President’s address in Lok Sabha Monday, Rahul said Gen Dwivedi’s statements had contradicted PM Modi, who had denied that Chinese forces were present inside Indian territory.“The PM has denied that Chinese forces are inside our territory, but for some reason, our Army keeps talking to the Chinese about their entry into our territory and our Army chief has said the Chinese are inside our territory. This is a fact, this is not an invention,” Rahul had said.Singh also said that India, in fact, lost territory to China in the early-1960s when Jawaharlal Nehru was the PM.“If at all there is Indian territory into which China has come, this is 38,000 sq km in Aksai Chin as a result of the 1962 conflict and 5,180 sq km illegally ceded by Pakistan to China in 1963. Shri Rahul Gandhi may consider introspecting about this phase of our history,” Singh said.Speaking ahead of Army Day on Jan 15, Gen Dwivedi had said there was still “a degree of standoff” persisting between the India Army and the PLA despite the troop disengagement at Depsang and Demchok, and the two countries need to rebuild trust to de-escalate overall tensions.Gen Dwivedi said both sides have “doctored” the terrain, carried out constructions, made troop deployments and resorted to military stockings since April 2020. Consequently, there is still “a degree of standoff” in place, he said, adding that India will not reduce the number of its troops deployed along the LAC anytime soon.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh slams Congress MP for making “false accusations” and indulging in “irresponsible politics” on matters of national security.

"Annual, lifetime toll passes for use on national highways to cost Rs 3,000 & Rs 30,000",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/annual-lifetime-toll-passes-for-use-on-nhs-to-cost-3000-30000/articleshow/117933096.cms,"NEW DELHI: In yet another relief to the middle class and private car owners who frequently use national highways , govt is likely to soon offer the option of purchasing an ‘ annual toll pass ’ with a one-time payment of Rs 3,000 for unlimited use. It will also offer car owners the option to purchase a ‘lifetime pass’ for 15 years with an upfront payment of Rs 30,000.Sources said the proposal is at an advanced stage with the road transport ministry . TOI has also learnt that the ministry is looking at the option of tweaking the base toll rate per km for private cars to give relief to highway users. No new pass has to be bought as they will be embedded in FASTags.At present, only monthly passes are issued to local and frequent commuters for crossing a single toll plaza. For such passes, they need to provide the address proof and other details. This pass is priced at Rs 340 per month, that works out to Rs 4,080 for a year. “So, the offer of Rs 3,000 for unlimited travel across NH network for the entire year is much less than what people pay for free travel at one plaza. This would be optional and detailed analysis has shown that this can be a preferred choice,” said a source.Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had recently said that his ministry is working on the plan to offer passes for car owners. Sources said the ministry is looking at it as one solution to several issues, including the growing resentment against toll plazas within municipal limits, toll gates at less than 60 km interval and violence at plazas.Data show that out of the total toll revenue of Rs 55,000 crore of 2023-24, private cars had a share of barely Rs 8,000 crore. The trend of toll transaction and collection also shows that while 53% of the transactions were for private cars, their share in toll collection is barely 21%. Moreover, while nearly 60% of traffic are private vehicles at toll plazas between 6 am to 10 pm, the distribution of commercial vehicles are almost even throughout day and night.Sources said there will be no loss of earning due to the passes over a period of few years, though initially the NHAI has to forgo some revenue.","The proposal is at an advanced stage with the road transport ministry.

"PM Modi, Donald Trump likely to relaunch talks for trade agreement",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-donald-trump-likely-to-relaunch-talks-for-trade-agreement/articleshow/117932804.cms,"NEW DELHI: The result of the assembly election could have a telling effect on the seat share of AAP and BJP in MCD as both the parties have nominated several sitting councillors, who, if they win, will have to resign from the civic body.The seat difference bewteen AAP and BJP in the MCD is 2 - AAP has 122 councillors, and BJ. In the 2022 MCD elections, AAP won 134 of the 250 seats, BJP 104, and Congress 9. Three seats went to independents.MCD is also expected to hold its mayoral election in April. AAP won the previous election by a slim margin of three votes, which was attributed to cross-voting. In such a scenario, the performance of the sitting councillors who have got assembly election tickets will become crucial in determining which party will secure the majority in the corporation.For the assembly election, BJP has nominated 12 sitting councillors and two aldermen. AAP has nominated seven councillors, including the leader of the house in MCD, Mukesh Goyal, from the Adarsh Nagar assembly constituency, and former deputy mayor Aaley Mohammad Iqbal from Matia Mahal. Congress has given a ticket to councillor Ariba Khan from the Okhla assembly constituency.The aldermen, who are experts from various fields, cannot vote in the mayoral election.One seat in the MCD is vacant for nearly a year after former BJP councillor Kamaljeet Sehrwat became the MP from Dwarka.Following defections of councillors to BJP in the last two months, the BJP's seat count in MCD has risen to 120, while AAP's tally has dropped to 122. No party has the majority. AAP has the maximum councillors.MCD officials said that it was not manadatory to conduct elections on vacant seats before conducting the mayoral election, according to the DMC Act. However, if a large number of councillors win the assembly elections, the officials said, they may ask the Election Commission to conduct bypolls in those MCD seats in March. ""We will need to have resignations from the elected candidates and then we will pursue the EC,"" an MCD official said.Among the sitting municipal councillors of BJP who got assembly election tickets are Gajendra Daral from Mundka, Priyanka Gautam from the reserved constituency of Kondli, Umang Bajaj from Naraina, Neelam Pehalwan from Najafgarh, Manoj Kumar Jindal from Sadar Bazar, Kamal Bagri from Ballimaran, Urmila Kailash Gangwal from Madipur (SC), and Anil Gaur from Seelampur. Daral won the 2022 civic election as an independent after being denied a ticket by BJP. He returned to the party within a few months. Gautam won the MCD election on an AAP ticket but joined BJP only a few months earlier.On Dec 25, AAP councillor from Ghadoli, Priyanka Gautam, joined BJP along with her supporters.KS Mehra, a former commissioner in the unified MCD, said the situation will become unstable in MCD if the majority of councillors fighting the assembly elections win. ""Already due to the standing committee, many projects are failing to get implemented. People usually complain about the non-completion of tasks, but it is difficult to explain to them the reasons every time,"" Mehra said.Trump had pledged cooperation with India to deepen the strategic partnership, including through Quad in the Indo-Pacific. Trump sought a fair trading relationship with India, in line with his commitment to reduce the trade deficit, and expressed confidence that Modi would do what's right on the issue of irregular migration.Modi will be among a select group of leaders who will visit the White House in the first month of Trump's second term. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu will be the first foreign leader to call on Trump on Tuesday. This is likely to be followed by a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II early next week.While there was no official word from either side about the dates for the visit till late in the evening, sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Trump is likely to host a dinner for Modi and that no community event had been planned for the PM till now. As of now, Modi is also not scheduled to travel to any other city. A meeting with business leaders isn't ruled out.While looking to iron out differences over trade, which India sought to address in the budget by slashing import tariffs on high-end motorcycles, the govt will look for a reaffirmation of the US commitment to the initiative on critical and emerging technology that the Biden administration launched to expand the technology partnership and boost defence industrial cooperation. India expects strong convergence in this area as the first Trump administration had pledged support for transfer to India of advanced US military technology.Modi and Trump are also expected to relaunch negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement that didn't work out last time despite some progress in the initial phase of talks. India will hope to soon have at least a mini deal that will restore Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) benefits that had been revoked by the Trump administration in 2019 because of restricted Indian market access.The visit will also be an important occasion for the two sides to underline the strategic convergence in the Indo-Pacific where a close partnership between the US and India is seen by both as central to a free, open, inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous region. On the illegal migration issue, India has already made it clear it will accept all illegals, like it has in the past too, but after verifying the Indian origin of the people facing deportation.","The seat difference bewteen AAP and BJP in the MCD is 2 - AAP has 122 councillors, and BJ has 104.

Bhopal’s Dr B R Ambedkar Flyover Under Scrutiny for Structural Defects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/new-flyover-goes-off-the-rails-flaws-mar-design-questions-rise-from-multiple-sides/articleshow/117866611.cms,"Bhopal: MP Public Works Department (PWD) has identified deficiencies in Dr B R Ambedkar flyover merely days after its inauguration. On Saturday, PWD and NHAI uncovered substandard quality of edge rails on both sides of the elevated corridor and took action against PWD engineers and private contractor.The newly opened PWD elevated flyover extends alongside the metro rail corridor for approximately 3 km. The timing of the PWD flyover's approval, subsequent to the metro rail project's commencement, raised questions amongst public transport advocates in the state capital.The flyover, besides the quality of construction, has several long-term design impacts. A first would be on traffic density at landing points. Second, the flyover, could have been a much needed connect between Bhopal main railway station to Ranikamlapati station. A swift entry and exit at the later has been missed by the PWD flyover.Bhopal has witnessed the construction of numerous major flyovers in the past ten years to enhance road connectivity. Two cable-stayed bridges span the Lower and Upper Lake. These structures, despite facing construction delays, lack comprehensive traffic management plans. The bridges' effectiveness has diminished due to inadequate traffic regulation and permanent blockades at connecting turns. The flyover's construction was executed by Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) through Bhopal smart city development corporation limited (BSCDCL).The Veer Savarkar bridge, connecting to Hoshangabad road and AIIMS Bhopal, features an extension that presents significant safety concerns. This narrow addition, not part of the initial design, creates a hazardous descent with minimal space for emergency vehicles and no margin for error when vehicles mistakenly ascend. BMC oversaw this flyover's construction.""Most of the flyovers that have been recently constructed in Bhopal, have largely failed to accomplish their proposed goals. Ginnori flyover is an example of how, traffic police and BMC, have eliminated gains from a flyover for decongesting traffic in the area,"" said an urban development consultant seeking anonymity.The PWD's forthright assessment, conducted with NHAI assistance, demonstrates commendable transparency in acknowledging structural concerns.

A US military plane is deporting migrants to India, marking President Donald Trump's first crackdown on Indian immigrants after assuming office, Reuters reported quoting an official on Monday.The official confirmed that a C-17 aircraft carrying migrants had departed for India but is not expected to arrive for at least 24 hours.The US embassy spokesperson denied providing any information on the matter but added that the country was ""vigorously enforcing its border, tightening immigration laws, and removing illegal migrants.""""I have received a number of inquiries on reporting of a deportation flight to India. I can’t share any details on those inquiries, but I can share, on the record, that the United States is vigorously enforcing its border, tightening immigration laws, and removing illegal migrants. These actions send a clear message: illegal migration is not worth the risk,"" the spokesperson said.The Pentagon has begun deporting over 5,000 immigrants detained in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California, using military flights. So far, the military aircraft have transported migrants to Guatemala, Peru, and Honduras.Military deportation flights come at a high cost, with a recent flight to Guatemala estimated to have cost at least $4,675 per migrant, according to a Reuters report.The Indian government has signaled its willingness to cooperate with the Trump administration in identifying and repatriating its citizens residing illegally in the US, aiming to maintain strong ties and avoid a trade conflict.""We are against illegal immigration, especially because it is linked to several forms of organised crime,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said last month.""For Indians not just in the United States, but anywhere in the world, if they are Indian nationals and they are overstaying, or they are in a particular country without proper documentation, we will take them back, provided documents are shared with us so that we can verify their nationality and that they are indeed Indians. If that happens to be the case, we will take things forward and facilitate their return to India,"" he added.According to sources familiar with the matter, both nations have identified approximately 18,000 illegal Indian migrants for deportation, though the actual number could be significantly higher, as the total remains uncertain, Bloomberg had reported last month.India accounts for a relatively small share of illegal migration to the US, with its citizens making up about 3% of all unlawful crossings in fiscal 2024, according to US customs and border protection data.In contrast, Latin American nations like Mexico, Venezuela, and Guatemala contribute a much larger portion. However, the number of Indian illegal migrants has been steadily increasing, particularly at the northern US border, where they now represent nearly a quarter of all illegal crossings—the highest among migrants stopped at that entry point.While the exact total remains uncertain, a 2022 department of homeland security report estimated that approximately 2,20,000 unauthorized Indian immigrants were residing in the US.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to pay a two-day visit to the US and meet Trump starting February 12.(With inputs from agencies)","A US military plane is deporting migrants to India, marking President Donald Trump's first crackdown on Indian immigrants after assuming office.

PM Modi references JFK's Forgotten Crisis: What former CIA officer's book says about former PM Nehru,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-nehru-jfk-forgotten-crisis-bruce-riedel/articleshow/117919051.cms,"JFK’s Forgotten Crisis: Tibet, the CIA, and the Sino-Indian War

Historical Context



Nehru’s Leadership During the Crisis



Nehru’s Pragmatic Turn: Seeking US Assistance



Nehru’s Legacy Post-1962



During his reply to the Motion of Thanks during the Budget Session, PM Modi made several interesting cultural references. The first involved a famous TOI cartoon by R.K. Laxman, which showed the ubiquitous “common man” dragging a float with an aeroplane carrying a group of politicians, where the pilot closely resembles former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.Another reference was the bookby Bruce Riedel , a former CIA officer and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. The book examines the 1962 Sino-Indian War and its profound impact on US foreign policy under President John F. Kennedy.The early 1960s were marked by intense geopolitical rivalries shaped by the Cold War . The world was divided between the Western bloc, led by the United States, and the Eastern bloc, dominated by the Soviet Union, with newly independent nations like India trying to carve out a neutral space through the Non-Aligned Movement. Nehru was one of the movement’s key architects, advocating for peaceful coexistence and diplomatic engagement rather than aligning with either superpower.However, China’s rise as a communist power under Mao Zedong presented new challenges. After the 1949 Communist Revolution, China became increasingly assertive in its foreign policy, particularly concerning territorial disputes. The relationship between India and China, once symbolised by the slogan ""Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai"" (India and China are brothers), deteriorated due to border disagreements, especially in Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh . The situation was further complicated by India’s asylum to the Dalai Lama following the 1 959 Tibetan uprising, which strained Sino-Indian relations.Amid these tensions, the world witnessed other critical events: the Cuban Missile Crisis unfolded in October 1962, bringing the US and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war. It was during this volatile period that the Sino-Indian War erupted, creating a parallel crisis that is often overshadowed in historical narratives.Riedel’s book paints a nuanced portrait of Nehru, depicting both his visionary ideals and the strategic miscalculations that contributed to India’s unpreparedness for the 1962 war. Nehru’s foreign policy was rooted in moral diplomacy, non-alignment, and the belief that India could maintain peaceful relations with both the Western and Eastern blocs. However, JFK’s Forgotten Crisis argues that Nehru’s idealism left him blindsided to the realpolitik of China’s territorial ambitions.Riedel critiques Nehru’s overreliance on diplomacy, which led to complacency in addressing the growing military threat from China. Despite intelligence reports and clear signs of Chinese aggression along the Himalayan border, Nehru underestimated the likelihood of an armed conflict. When the People’s Liberation Army launched a surprise, well-coordinated offensive in October 1962, Indian forces were ill-prepared, poorly equipped, and unfamiliar with high-altitude warfare.The war was a personal and political blow to Nehru. It exposed the weaknesses of India’s defence policy and shattered his belief in the power of diplomacy to resolve conflicts with authoritarian regimes. Riedel describes how the defeat deeply affected Nehru’s morale and public image, as he faced criticism both domestically and internationally for India’s lack of preparedness.One of the pivotal moments Riedel highlights is Nehru’s decision to seek military assistance from the United States. This was a significant shift, as Nehru had previously maintained a distance from the US, wary of its Cold War alliances and interventionist policies. The crisis forced Nehru to prioritise national security over ideological consistency, demonstrating his capacity to adapt under pressure.Nehru’s appeal to President John F. Kennedy marked an unprecedented moment in Indo-US relations. Despite being preoccupied with the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy responded swiftly, recognising India’s strategic importance as a democratic counterbalance to communist China in Asia. The US provided military aid, including weapons, ammunition, and logistical support, which helped stabilise India’s defence capabilities in the immediate aftermath of the conflict.Riedel notes that although Nehru’s request for help was born out of desperation, it laid the groundwork for a brief period of closer Indo-US ties. The personal rapport between Nehru and Kennedy grew during this time, with Kennedy’s quick response helping to bridge the ideological divide between the two leaders. However, the momentum was short-lived following Kennedy’s assassination in 1963.While JFK’s Forgotten Crisis critiques Nehru’s missteps, it also acknowledges his role in steering India through the aftermath of the war. The defeat catalysed major reforms in India’s defence policy, including a significant military build-up and a strategic reassessment of foreign relations. Nehru oversaw these changes, recognising the need for a stronger military to complement India’s diplomatic efforts.Riedel argues that the 1962 crisis was a turning point not just for India, but for global geopolitics. For Nehru, it was a harsh lesson in the limits of idealism in international relations. The war forced him to confront the complexities of power politics, balancing India’s moral principles with the pragmatic demands of national security.","Nehru’s appeal to President John F.

'Hawa Hawai' promises

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , while responding to the Motion of Thanks debate in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, invoked a famous RK Laxman cartoon that appeared in The Times of India to critique past leadership, drawing laughter from NDA MPs and sharp reactions from the opposition.Recalling the illustration, PM Modi described how it depicted an airplane—symbolizing grand ambitions—placed on a wooden cart being puled by the 'common man'. The words ""21st century"" were written on it, yet the plane remained grounded. ""At the time, it seemed like a joke, but later, it proved to be true,"" he remarked, suggesting that previous governments were disconnected from reality.Without naming him, PM Modi took an indirect dig at former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and said, ""There was one PM who used to continuously speak about the 21st century... At that time, RK Laxman made a very interesting cartoon. That cartoon was funny back then, but later, it became the truth. It was an example of how that PM's talks were 'hawa hawai' (empty words) and disconnected from reality. We are almost 40-50 years late... The work that should have been done decades ago is happening now. That’s why when the public gave us a chance, we focused on youth development and nation-building.""The remarks were widely interpreted as a dig at former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who frequently spoke about modernizing India in the 1980s. Laxman, in his cartoons, had critiqued how this vision of technological advancement remained an elite-driven project, with benefits trickling down slowly, if at all, to the masses.","PM Modi was responding to the Motion of Thanks debate in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.

India reports 59 HMPV cases: Health ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-reports-59-hmpv-cases-health-ministry/articleshow/117921488.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Union minister Prataprao Jadhav informed the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday that 59 cases of HMPV and two deaths due to co-morbidities were reported between January 6 and 29, according to the integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP). The cases include 17 from Tamil Nadu, 11 from Gujarat, and nine from Puducherry, Jadhav stated in a written reply.Young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals are more prone to the virus, causing respiratory illnesses that vary from mild cold-like symptoms to severe pneumonia.According to minister of state for health Jadhav, the Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been present worldwide since 2001 and there hasn't been a notable increase in instances of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) or influenza like illness (ILI) anywhere in the nation.He added that the union health ministry has implemented a number of initiatives to track and control the spread of HMPV cases as well as raise public awareness about HMPV symptoms and strategies.The Indian council for medical research (ICMR) sentinel surveillance data also confirmed no unusual rise in ILI or SARI cases across the country, Jadhav stated.Outlining the measures taken to control HMPV, he said that the Public Health Emergency Operation Centre (PHEOC) at the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has been operational since January 6, 2025, to monitor the HMPV situation regularly.A daily situational report (SitRep) is shared with relevant stakeholders. In order to test and sequence any positive respiratory samples from hospitalized SARI cases, states and union territories have been advised to remain attentive and transmit them to authorized virus research and diagnostic laboratories (VRDLs), said Jadhav. He added, India already has a strong ILI and SARI surveillance infrastructure in place via the ICMR and IDSP networks.States have been advised to strengthen information, education, and communication (IEC) efforts to raise awareness about preventing the transmission of the virus through simple measures like washing hands with soap and water.The states are advised to cover their mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, avoid close contact with those who are displaying symptoms of the sickness, and refrain from touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.The government conducted a nationwide preparedness drill, confirming that the health system is adequately equipped to handle the seasonal rise in respiratory illnesses, Jadhav said.The situation of respiratory illnesses in India and the status regarding HMPV cases were reviewed in a number of meetings with various stakeholders at the level of secretary (health and family welfare), director general of health services, and joint monitoring group, he said.The stakeholders are department of health research, DGHS, health secretaries and officials of states, experts from the integrated disease surveillance platform (IDSP), NCDC, Indian council of medical research (ICMR), national institute of virology (NIV) and state surveillance units of IDSP.He advised the states to review and improve ILI/SARI surveillance.One of the several respiratory viruses that can infect people of all ages is the HMPV, especially in the winter and early spring. Coughing, runny nose, fever, sore throat, and dyspnea are some of the symptoms.The virus infection is usually a mild and self-limiting condition and most cases recover on their own, the minister said.Jadhav informed that the majority of patients heal on their own and that the viral infection is often a mild and self-limiting disease.","59 cases of HMPV and two deaths due to co-morbidities were reported between January 6 and 29.

"PM Modi set to travel to US, meet Donald Trump on February 13",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-set-to-travel-to-us-meet-donald-trump-on-feb-13/articleshow/117898606.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi will travel to Washington from Paris on February 12 for his first bilateral meeting with President Donald Trump after the latter’s inauguration last month. His official engagements are scheduled to take place over the next 2 days, with the summit likely on February 13.Modi will travel to France next week to co-chair an AI summit that President Emmanuel Macron is hosting on February 10-11. While Trump too had been invited for the summit, the US is likely to be represented in the meeting by Vice President JD Vance.With Trump not travelling to Paris, the bilateral summit with Modi will now take place in the US capital. Trump in fact had confirmed last week, after a phone conversation with the PM, that he would be visiting the White House in February.In what was their first conversation since the January 20 inauguration, Trump had raised the 2 possible sticking points in ties - trade and illegal immigration - while pledging cooperation with India to deepen the strategic partnership, including through Quad in the Indo-Pacific. Trump sought a fair trading relationship with India, in line with his commitment to reduce the trade deficit, and expressed confidence that Modi would do what’s right on the issue of irregular migration.Modi will be among a select group of leaders who will visit the White House in only the first month of Trump’s second term. Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu will be the first foreign leader to call on Trump on Tuesday. This is likely to be followed by a meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah II early next week.While there was no official word from either side about the dates for the visit till late in the evening, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump is likely to host a dinner for Modi and that no community event had been planned till now for the PM to participate in. As of now, Modi is also not scheduled to travel to any other city. A meeting with business leaders isn’t ruled out.While looking to iron out differences over trade, which India sought to address in the budget by slashing import tariffs on high-end motorcycles, the government will look for a reaffirmation of the US commitment to the initiative on critical and emerging technology that the Biden administration launched to expand the technology partnership and boost defence industrial cooperation. India expects strong convergence in this area as the first Trump administration had pledged support for transfer to India of advanced US military technology.Modi and Trump are also expected to relaunch negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement that didn’t work out last time despite some progress in the initial phase of talks. India will hope to soon have at least a mini deal that would restore Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) benefits that had been revoked by the Trump administration in 2019 because of restricted Indian market access.The visit will also be an important occasion for the 2 sides to underline the strategic convergence in the Indo-Pacific where a close partnership between the US and India is seen by both as central to a free, open, inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous region. On the illegal migration issue, India has already made it clear it will accept all illegals, like it has in the past too, but after verifying the Indian origin of the people facing deportation.","PM Narendra Modi will travel to Washington from Paris on February 12 for his first bilateral meeting with President Donald Trump after the latter’s inauguration last month.

Trump’s USAID Funding Halt to Impact India’s Health and Education Sectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trumps-usaid-funds-freeze-set-to-hit-india-health-education-projects-hard/articleshow/117898469.cms,"Poll What Will Be the Biggest Impact of USAID's Suspension of Work in India? Setback for Education, Gender, and Climate Change Initiatives Disruption of Health-Related Programs and Services

NEW DELHI: Following the issuance of an executive order by President Donald Trump to review US foreign assistance and align them with the policies of the new administration, US Agency for International Development (USAID) has issued a directive asking all organisations implementing projects with its support in India to suspend work until further notice. The move has raised concerns among those engaged with USAID-funded projects in India.The biggest impact is expected on health-related programmes where USAID funds have been seen to have bolstered technical support to grassroots-level outreach. Other sectors where impacts going forward are likely to be felt include education, gender and climate change. Though USAID has a small footprint in India, the prospect of its engagement shrinking further comes at a time when global aid has considerably dropped, and can compound the financial troubles facing NGOs in development.USAID's directive to partners including voluntary organisations and agencies steering projects for govts, make it clear that they must minimise expenditure on the collaborations during the pause period. ""The recipient shall not resume work under this agreement until notification has been received in writing from the Agreement Officer (USAID) that this award suspension has been cancelled,"" the directive states. It is learnt from sources in the development sector that the 'stop work' orders come with the caveat of a 90-day period during which the existing grants will be reviewed.""But the uncertainty is causing panic,"" a development practitioner said on conditions of anonymity while asserting that her organisation is able to continue work as there are other donors.According to the USAID website, as of Jan 2021, the agency was supporting mother and child health initiatives in six states with a focus on improving maternal and child health services. It was also funding initiatives to improve health by advancing access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene in several cities, and in addition to this, partnered with states and private agencies to support programmes preventing gender-based violence and protecting and supporting the disabled population.According to development sector professionals, the civil society has already been feeling the heat of a funds crunch with sources of global aid slowly drying up over the decades. Moreover, the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act restrictions in recent years have made it harder for local organisations to get foreign donations.Harsh Jaitli, CEO of Voluntary Action Network India, which is a network of 600 civil society organisations, said USAID pause on funding is part of a larger global trend with big agencies from Sweden, Germany and UK cutting down on aid to countries.However, smaller civil society organisations working at the grassroots level largely remain unimpacted by the USAID directive as the agency support is largely seen in big programmes like combating tuberculosis and outreach on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). According to those working in the sector, since 2004, USAID has been largely supporting technical work on the projects steered by govts.","US Agency for International Development (USAID) has issued a directive asking all organisations implementing projects with its support in India to suspend work.

'Goofy conspiracies': Nate on ties with Soros



NEW DELHI: Hindenburg founder Nathan Anderson said on Tuesday that the firm's decision to investigate Adani Group came after ""red flags"" were raised by certain media groups and added that he stood by all the reports and findings.""We initially saw media articles outlining red flags, took a closer look, and just kept following the evidence,"" he said in an exclusive interview to PTI, when asked about the firm's decision to choose Adani Group.Responding to claims that the Hindenburg report was against India and its growth story, he said, ""We have always believed in India's potential and view market transparency and strong corporate governance as key factors that can fuel India's growth story.""Clearing the air that the firm did not shutting down because of any legal of personal threats, Nate said, ""As to why I retired - it is all in the letter (released on January 16 that announced shutting down of Hindenburg) - it is not based on any threat, health issue, personal issue or otherwise.""When asked if he stood by Hindenburg's reports, particularly those on the Adani Group, Nate said, ""We 100 per cent stand by all of our research findings.""Hindenburg accused the Adani Group of using a network of offshore companies to inflate revenue and manipulate stock prices while accumulating debt. Although the conglomerate strongly denied the allegations, the report initially wiped out over $150 billion from its market value, losses it later recovered over the course of a year.The matter reached the Supreme Court, which found no need for further investigation beyond the ongoing probe by market regulator Sebi, which had already been looking into certain issues before the Hindenburg report was published.Responding to the allegations of having ties with OCCRP and George Soros, Nate said, ""Of course not, but we have a policy of not feeding into silly conspiracy theories. When the main response to 100+ pages of evidence (presented in the report against Adani Group) is a goofy conspiracy, we view it as a sign that we were right on the mark.""He dismissed claims of sharing reports with hedge funds saying, ""We have always maintained full editorial control over all of our research.""""As we and many other US-based short sellers have discussed in public interviews for years, our model involves investing our own capital and sometimes also bringing on a balance sheet partner.

The polling booths will open at 7am and voting will continue till 6pm.The last two assembly elections were one-sided with AAP winning two huge mandates. BJP could barely manage to mark its presence in the assembly and Congress was almost decimated. In 2015, AAP romped home with 54.6% vote share and a record 67 seats with the remaining three going to BJP. The 2020 assembly elections saw AAP's vote share and seats drop only marginally to 53.6% and 62, respectively. BJP won the remaining eight seats and Congress failed to open its account yet again.The three political parties are engaged in a fierce electoral battle once again and have spared no effort in wooing the electorate. Most of the promises made in their election manifestos have a similar ring.Several seats are going to witness a keen contest this time. While AAP chief and former CM Arvind Kejriwal is facing a stiff challenge from BJP's Parvesh Verma and Congress's Sandeep Dikshit, both former MPs from different constituencies in different years, CM Atishi is pitted against BJP's Ramesh Bidhuri, another former MP, and Congress's Alka Lamba.As the city votes today, several contests would be closely watched, among them former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, who has shifted from Patparganj to Jangpura, where BJP's Tarvinder Singh Marwah and Congress's Farhad Suri are his two main rivals. In Ballimaran, there is a keen contest between Congress heavyweight and former minister Haroon Yusuf and incumbent AAP minister Imran Hussain.Greater Kailash, Malviya Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Mangolpuri, Patparganj and Matia Mahal are some of the other seats of immense consequence this time.AAP has promised a number of new welfare schemes, which, it claims, will help families make huge savings. It has showcased free electricity and water provided to frugal consumers and free travel for women in public buses as some of its schemes which, along with ""good education and health"", have helped each household make a monthly saving of nearly Rs 25,000. The party has also claimed that a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,100 for eligible women, free treatment for senior citizens and free travel for students in buses will save another Rs 10,000.While promising to continue the schemes run by the AAP-led Delhi govt, BJP - which has not won a single assembly election in Delhi after 1993 - has promised a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,500 to women besides increasing the pension for senior citizens; implementation of the Ayushman Bharat healthcare scheme for senior citizens; a monthly pension for small traders and entrepreneurs; paid internship for the youth; and a gas cylinder at Rs 500 for the poor.For Congress, it is a matter of survival and staying relevant in city politics. Its campaign was aimed at wresting at least a section of its vote bank from AAP. The party has assured Rs 8,500 per month to the unemployed for a year; Rs 2,500 a month for women under 'Pyari Didi Yojana'; an insurance cover of Rs 25 lakh every year; and zero bills for consumers using up to 300 units, if it elected to office.A bitter campaign that ended on Monday saw AAP, BJP and Congress hurl allegations at each other. Regular representations were made by all three parties to EC, accusing each other of violating the model code of conduct. Interestingly, all three parties this time have an exclusive focus on Poorvanchalis, who form almost one-fourth of the total vote share. Not only have the three parties given tickets to several candidates from the region, BJP has even allied with political parties of Bihar - Janata Dal (United) and Loktantrik Janshakti Party (Paswan) - and allocated them one seat each.The Delhi election office, meanwhile, has promised a ""free and fair"" poll in the city. According to chief electoral officer R Alice Vaz, nearly 1.1 lakh civil officials - polling teams, counting staff, flying squad, sector magistrates, expenditure monitors, control room officials, micro observers and volunteers - and 60,000 security personnel have been deployed.There are nearly 82.7 lakh men and 72.4 lakh women eligible to cast their votes on Wednesday at 13,766 polling booths spread across 2,696 locations across the city.Vaz added that 21,584 ballot units, 20,692 control units and 18,943 VVPAT machines have been procured to conduct the polls. ""A paid holiday has been declared for employees working in govt and private sectors as well as for those employed in shops and commercial establishments. This move, aimed at facilitating voter participation, also applies to voters from bordering states, UP and Haryana, who are employed in Delhi,"" Vaz said.While voting will take place till 6pm, Vaz said all voters standing in a queue at 6pm will be allowed to cast their vote. ""ECI has issued clear directives, prohibiting the use of mobile phones, cameras, smartwatches and any other electronic items inside the polling stations,"" Vaz said.The CEO said that all polling stations will be closely monitored by her office and also by the offices of the district election officers through webcasting.","More than 1.5 crore eligible voters will have the chance to choose their representatives for the 70-member Delhi assembly.

He cited that in the Mithila region, major chunk of Bihar’s makhana farming happens and it involves five lakh families from the state’s most backward communities.

Repurposing sports waste



Promoting fitness and sustainability through cycling



Women’s health takes priority



Yoga and Mallakhamb make debut in medal tally



Celebrating local culture and tourism



Uttarakhand is making a mark at the ongoing 38th National Games not just with stellar athletic performances but also through innovative initiatives aligned with the Green Games theme. From sustainable practices to promoting local culture and women’s health, the state’s efforts have drawn national attention, with even Prime Minister Narendra Modi praising the initiatives.The environmental commitment is evident across various aspects of the event. Uttarakhand has chosen Monal, the state bird found in the Himalayas, as the official mascot, symbolising conservation efforts. In a unique move, medals awarded to winners have been crafted from e-waste.The state is also establishing a Sports Forest (Khel Van) to honour victorious athletes. A 2.77-hectare land has been designated for the project, where 1,600 Rudraksha trees will be planted.Other eco-friendly measures include invitation cards made from recycled materials, electric rickshaws at venues to curb pollution, the use of solar panels, and reusable water bottles.Discarded sports equipment is being creatively upcycled. Various symbols, including a running athlete and the Monal bird, have been crafted from sports waste materials. A massive tiger sculpture made entirely from e-waste has become a major attraction at the Games.To encourage both environmental conservation and fitness, bicycles have been made available at event venues. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during the inauguration, underscored the importance of fitness and physical well-being.Uttarakhand has introduced special welcome kits for female athletes, featuring sanitary pads and other essentials to promote menstrual health awareness. The initiative has been widely appreciated for addressing an often-overlooked aspect of women's health in sports .In a historic first, Yoga and Mallakhamb have been included in the medal tally, thanks to Uttarakhand’s efforts. These traditional sports were absent in the previous edition held in Goa but are now being recognised alongside other competitive disciplines.Uttarakhand has ensured that the National Games extend beyond metropolitan hubs, hosting events in hilly towns like Tehri and Almora. Local culture is being showcased in multiple ways—traditional pahadi cuisine such as Jhangora and Gahat Dal is being served, while the folk art Aipan is featured in posters, banners, and event decorations.With its blend of sports, sustainability, and cultural pride, Uttarakhand’s innovative approach to the 38th National Games is setting new benchmarks for future sporting events in India.","Uttarakhand has chosen Monal, the state bird found in the Himalayas, as the official mascot, symbolising conservation efforts.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

How the Lakers could benefit from acquiring Looney and Payton from the Golden State Warriors



Therecently pulled off a blockbuster trade for Luka Doncic , sending Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a first-round pick to the Dallas Mavericks. But the front office isn’t done wheeling and dealing just yet. With championship ambitions still in focus, the Lakers are now eyeing Kevon Looney and Gary Payton II from the Golden State Warriors According to ClutchPoints' Brett Siegel, the Los Angeles Lakers are closely monitoring Golden State’s roster.Siegel reported.Kevon Looney, a battle-tested big man, has a reputation for dominating the glass when it matters most. During the 2023 NBA Playoffs, he averaged a staggering 15.1 rebounds per game in the first-round matchup against Domantas Sabonis and the Kings. This season, he's putting up 5.2 points and 6.7 rebounds, providing steady production for a Warriors squad fighting to stay in the playoff picture.On the other hand, Gary Payton II is a defensive menace. At 32 years old, he’s still one of the most tenacious perimeter defenders in the league, routinely locking down elite scorers. He boasts a 111 defensive rating per 100 possessions and a 1.5 defensive box plus-minus, proving his value as a stopper and high-energy spark.Adding Kevon Looney and Gary Payton II would instantly boost the Los Angeles Lakers ’ depth and defense. Looney would provide much-needed size and rebounding to help fill the void left by Anthony Davis, while Payton II would bring defensive toughness to the backcourt, replacing Christie’s presence. Plus, both have championship experience—an asset that could be invaluable alongside LeBron James and Doncic in a deep playoff run.The big question is whether the Warriors are willing to part ways with them. Golden State is looking to stay competitive ahead of the February 6 trade deadline, which means the Los Angeles Lakers would need to offer serious value in return. Potential trade pieces include Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt, or rookie Dalton Knecht.Also read: LA Lakers Trade News: GM Rob Pelinka drops perfect adjective to describe Luka Doncic’s Lakers move; claims the trade was a game-changer in NBA history The Lakers are running out of time to make a big choice.

Team,

We are building a new

Dell Technologies

for a new future. The pace of innovation has never been faster, and for us to lead, the speed of our business must continue to accelerate. What we're finding is that for all the technology in the world, nothing is faster than the speed of human interaction. A thirty second conversation can replace an email back-and-forth that goes on for hours or even days.

We've already asked our sales teams, manufacturing teams, engineers in the labs, onsite team members and leaders to be in the office five days a week, and we have seen these areas come alive with new speed, energy, and passion. Now, we want to see that same sense of urgency and drive everywhere.

Starting March 3, all hybrid and remote team members who live near a Dell office will work in the office five days a week. We are retiring the hybrid policy effective that day. We remain committed to flexibility within your workday, and you should continue to work with your manager to meet your needs. But for the most part, you should plan to work in the office five days a week.

If you opted-in for remote work and live near a Dell office, we expect you to join us in the office. If you are remote and live a long distance from a Dell office, you'll stay remote. If you are field, you will continue to spend five days a week with customers and partners or in a Dell Technologies office.

We know you may have questions about what this means for your specific situation. Please hold those for now. We're still working through details, and additional information will be available soon. But I personally wanted to share this news sooner rather than later, so you have time to process and plan.

We continually evolve our business to deliver the best value and service to our customers and partners. I'm excited for us to have more in-person connections to drive speed, market leadership, and an even stronger culture.

I look forward to seeing many more of you in the office. Welcome back!

For an annual income of Rs 13.7 lakh, with basic salary at 50% (Rs 6.85 lakh), the NPS contribution at 14% would amount to Rs 95,900. Combined with the Rs 75,000 standard deduction, this eliminates tax liability on the entire Rs 13.7 lakh.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 after Budget 2025: Zero income tax on Rs 13.7 lakh salary? Don’t rub your eyes! Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget 2025 speech announced that there will be NIL or zero income tax for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh. But did you know that for salaried individuals, the tax-free annual income can reach Rs 13.7 lakh, compared to Rs 12 lakh for others!“I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable upto income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000,” FM Sitharaman announced in her Union Budget speech.This advantage of no tax till Rs 13.7 lakh income stems from the Rs 75,000 standard deduction and National Pension System (NPS) investments. Section 80CCD(2) allows tax deduction of up to 14% of basic salary invested in NPS, whilst the old tax regime offers 10%.According to an ET analysis, a salaried individual with Rs 13.7 lakh yearly income can achieve tax savings of approximately Rs 96,000 through NPS contributions. It’s important to note that this benefit requires employer participation in NPS as part of cost to the company, as employees cannot opt independently.It’s interesting to note that despite this opportunity existing for nearly a decade, only 2.2 million individuals have enrolled. ""Only a few corporates are interested in rolling out the NPS benefit, and even fewer employees are willing to enrol in it,"" said Sudhir Kaushik, chief executive of tax filing portal Taxspanner.com.Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: Post income tax slab changes, which tax regime is better for salaried middle class taxpayers? The extended NPS lock-in period and withdrawal limitations at maturity discourage many investors. Pre-retirement withdrawals are restricted to exceptional circumstances. Upon maturity, only 60% can be withdrawn, whilst 40% must be invested in an annuity for lifetime pension.Financial experts consider these restrictions beneficial. ""The lack of liquidity in NPS is not necessarily bad because the money is at the right place.

Rohan Khaunte: Will not tolerate Goans subletting shacks to Delhiwallahs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/khaunte-will-not-tolerate-goans-subletting-shacks-to-delhiwallahs/articleshow/117701194.cms,"PANAJI:

Tourism minister Rohan Khaunte has instructed the tourism director to initiate an enforcement drive to regulate the operations of shacks, water sports, adventure activities, and other tourism-related activities. Khaunte said the department will not tolerate Goans subletting their shacks to “Delhiwallahs” and outsiders.“Using technology, we will go to the next level and ensure each shack is monitored. From Mandrem to Calangute to the south, mapping has started,” said Khaunte.He said that shack operation was a traditional business of locals and that it “must remain with Goans”. He said the tourism department simplified the allotment process, agreed to all the demands of the Shack Owners Welfare Society , and issued permissions for shacks well in advance with the “belief that a Goan will not give away his own business” to a “Delhiwallah come here to make money”.The minister said that enforcement drives will be continuous. He also said Goan shack operators finding it unviable to operate the allotted shacks should surrender them so that those on the waiting list get a chance. “These Delhiwallahs come here to make money and these incidents happen. We have been very clear that these businesses cannot be allowed to be taken over by outsiders,” said Khaunte.Speaking about paragliding activities, Khaunte said extreme adventure sports are fraught with risks, which tourists and enthusiasts need to understand and accept. “Adventure activities come under extreme sports and such extreme sports will always have some danger. There needs to be safety standards in place. People are illegally doing it in panchayat areas. If there are safety standards and all permissions, anyone can come to the director and get an NOC,” said Khaunte.","Tourism minister Rohan Khaunte has instructed the tourism director to initiate an enforcement drive to regulate the operations of shacks, water sports, adventure activities, and other tourism-related activities.

Rajasthan High Court: Live In Relationships to be registered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/all-live-in-relationshipsto-be-registered-raj-hc/articleshow/117704120.cms,"Poll Do You Think Live-In Relationships Should Be Registered? No Yes

JAIPUR: The Rajasthan High Court on Wednesday ordered that live-in relationships must be registered by a govt established authority or tribunal until such time that the Union and state govts legislate on the subject.A single judge bench of Justice Anoop Kumar Dhand issued directions to the state govt and Union social welfare and justice secretary to draw up a legal format for registering live-in relationships, and sought compliance with the order by March 1.The court passed the order while hearing a writ petition for protection filed by a married woman from Fatehabad in Haryana who is in a live-in relationship with a man from Sikar district.Separately, the single bench requested the chief justice to constitute a larger bench to address the question of granting protection to married individuals cohabiting with unmarried partners or married persons from different marriages living together without dissolving their respective marriages.Emphasising that a law on live-in relationships is the need of the hour, Justice Dhand said legislation should be framed by the Centre and state govt. ""Till the enactment of the appropriate legislation by the govt, let a competent authority be established in each district of the state to look into the matter of registering such live-in-relationships, which will address and redress the grievances of such partners or couples who have entered into such a relationship and the children being born therefrom. Let a website portal be launched in this regard for redressal of the issue arising out of such a relationship,"" the court said.The HC sought fixing the liability of male and female partners in the form of a plan to bear the responsibility for education, health and upbringing of children born of such relationships. Additionally, the court said the liability of the male partner must be fixed for maintenance of his non-earning female partner in such a relationship and the children born of such a relationship.Though such relationships are often disapproved of by the society, they are not legally prohibited, the court said, pointing to couples in live-in relationships seeking judicial protection against threats from their families. ""Several couples in live-in relationships are facing threats from families. They approach constitutional courts seeking protection. Courts are inundated with such petitions. Every day dozens of petitions are submitted,"" the judge noted.Given the differing opinions of coordinate benches, Justice Dhand said it was necessary to refer the matter to a special bench for a definitive ruling. ""This seeks to ensure uniformity in handling such cases, considering the numerous protection requests from couples in various live-in arrangements,"" he said.",Rajasthan High Court orders that live-in relationships must be registered by a govt established authority or tribunal.

"As Trump tariffs take effect, China hits back with trade measures against US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/as-trump-tariffs-take-effect-china-hits-back-with-trade-measures-against-us/articleshow/117934119.cms,"Moments after President Donald Trump's 10% tariff on all Chinese products took effect on Tuesday, Beijing struck back with tariffs on US coal, gas and other goods, restrictions on exports of some minerals and an antimonopoly investigation into Google.Trump said on Monday that he would speak with China President Xi Jinping within 24 hours. But the tariffs on Chinese goods went into effect just after midnight as scheduled, and there was no word of a call between the two leaders.Trump's 10% tariff on all Chinese products went into effect at 12:01 am Tuesday, the result of an executive order issued over the weekend aimed at pressuring Beijing to crack down on fentanyl shipments into the US. The Chinese govt's retaliatory steps includes additional tariffs on liquefied natural gas, coal, farm machinery and other products from the US. It also said it had implemented restrictions on the export of certain critical minerals, many of which are used in the production of high-tech products.In addition, Chinese market regulators said they had launched an antimonopoly investigation into Google. Google is blocked from China's internet, but the move may disrupt the company's dealings with Chinese companies.The US tariffs, which Trump said on Monday were an ""opening salvo,"" come on top of levies that the president imposed during his first term. Many Chinese products already faced a 10% or 25% tariff, and the move adds a 10% tariff to more than $400 billion of goods that Americans purchase from China each year.China's counterpunches suggested an effort to hurt American businesses and send a warning to the Trump administration, while holding in reserve measures that could do even more serious damage to trade between the world's two biggest economies. But the measures announced by Beijing, particularly the tariffs and export controls, could take time for Chinese officials to revoke, even if Trump were to signal a willingness to compromise.""As far as I can see so far, it's a relatively limited response, affecting no more than 30% of US exports to China,"" said Bert Hofman, a former World Bank official and now an adjunct professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore. ""They're probably trying to keep their powder dry, because this could still be only the first step from the Trump administration.""The Trump administration's tariffs ""seriously undermine the rules-based multilateral training system, damage the foundation of economic and trade cooperation between China and the US, and disrupt the stability of global industry supply chains,"" China's ministry of commerce said in a statement.The commerce ministry and China's customs agency announced new restrictions on exports of tungsten, tellurium, molybdenum and other metals important for industry and new technologies, citing ""national security and interests."" China's measures included an additional 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural equipment, larger cars and pickup trucks, as well as an additional 15% tariff on coal and natural gas, Chinese tax authorities announced.China also said it had added two American companies to its ""unreliable entities"" list. One of the companies, PVH - the American retailer that owns the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands - had already been placed under investigation by Chinese regulators in Sept. China said PVH had taken ""discriminatory measures"" against goods from the Xinjiang region in China's far west.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the announcement of the antitrust investigation.While Google dominates the world in digital advertising and internet search, restrictions in China mean it cannot operate its search engine, its YouTube video platform or its app store, Google Play, in the country. Still, its operating system, Android, is used by some Chinese phone-makers, including Xiaomi, Lenovo and Vivo. nyt","Beijing responds to US 10% tariff on all Chinese products.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.
