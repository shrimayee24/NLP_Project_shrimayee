India demands IMO probe into foreign cargo ship incidents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-demands-imo-probe-into-foreign-cargo-ship-incidents/articleshow/122353778.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: India strongly demanded that the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) undertake a comprehensive investigation and global review of all maritime incidents involving foreign-flagged container vessels operating in Indian waters. It said these incidents, caused by undeclared hazardous cargoes, and structural and stability issues, have raised serious safety concerns.Participating in the 134th session of the Council of the IMO, port and shipping secretary T K Ramachandran underscored the need to reinforce international protocols related to packaging, declaration, stowage, and monitoring of lithium-ion batteries and International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDGs).In a statement, the port and shipping ministry said, ""India delivered a principled statement addressing recent maritime incidents involving foreign-flagged container vessels operating in Indian waters.""Citing the proactive role of Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard in ensuring the safety of life at sea, the statement said India called for urgent enhancements in the safety framework for container shipping. India also proposed the establishment of IMO-led investigations into such incidents to help build global best practices, improve standardisation, and strengthen operational norms that ensure the safety and security of container ship operations across the world.There have been serious maritime incidents along India's coastline that exposed vulnerabilities in the current emergency response framework. The sinking of the container ship MSC ELSA 3 in May 2025 and the major fire and explosion on the container ship WAN HAI 503 in June 2025, off the coast of Kerala, led to the loss of several containers in the waters and the release of hazardous cargo and significant environmental risk.","India strongly demanded that the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) undertake a comprehensive investigation and global review of all maritime incidents involving foreign-flagged container vessels operating in Indian waters.

It's Janaki V: Makers agree to rephrase film title after censor board objections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-janaki-v-makers-agree-to-rephrase-film-title-after-censor-board-objections/articleshow/122353760.cms,"Representative image

KOCHI: The production company of the movie 'JSK - Janaki v/s State of Kerala', starring Union minister of state Suresh Gopi , agreed Wednesday to rephrase its title by adding the initial 'V' to the name, as suggested by Central Board of Film Certification CBFC also agreed to mute or edit the word 'Janaki' in two scenes, thereby ending legal tussle over the movie.The bench of Justice N Nagaresh accordingly directed the petitioners, Cosmos Entertainments, to submit the modified version of the film for certification. CBFC has been instructed to issue a censor certificate within three days of the submission.CBFC had informed HC that permitting films such as 'JSK - Janaki vs State of Kerala', in which lead character is portrayed as a rape victim bearing the name of a revered deity like Goddess Sita/Janaki, raises serious concerns regarding public order.CBFC made these remarks in a counter-affidavit filed as part of the legal battle related to the film. The affidavit stated that allowing such films to be publicly exhibited would set a dangerous precedent and open a 'Pandora's Box' for future productions.According to the affidavit, the lead character Janaki is shown to be sexually assaulted in the film. The film further portrays Janaki being cross-examined in court, where defence counsel subjects her to several humiliating questions.CBFC argued that posing such provocative questions to a character bearing the revered deity's name could disrupt public order and offend religious sentiments. Moreover, it pointed out that following the rape, Janaki is aided by a man from a particular religious community, while she is cross-examined and asked harrowing questions by a person from another community. This religious dichotomy in the treatment of a character named after Goddess Sita, it was contended, has potential to inflame communal tensions. CBFC emphasised that the determination of whether a film tends to disrupt public order must be made from perspective of an average moral person - someone of ordinary common sense and prudence - not through the lens of an individual completely indifferent to religious sentiments.The affidavit also cited the details of the themes of other films using divine names, including Janaki Jane, Sita Ramam (Telugu), Kallanum Bhagavathiyum and Malikappuram, and referenced prior instances where film titles were modified, such as Sexy Durga becoming S. Durga, Laxmmi Bomb changed to Laxmii and Loveratri to Loveyatri. CBFC also noted that the petitioner had not claimed that the film's substance, theme, or intended social commentary would be compromised by changing the title or the name.","The production company of the movie 'JSK - Janaki v/s State of Kerala' agreed Wednesday to rephrase its title by adding the initial 'V' to the name.

China's rare earth exports clampdown: Curbs backfire as local magnet makers reel from demand collapse; revenues plunge and inventories pile up despite US deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-rare-earth-exports-clampdown-curbs-backfire-as-local-magnet-makers-reel-from-demand-collapse-revenues-plunge-and-inventories-pile-up-despite-us-deal/articleshow/122303856.cms,"Share prices rebound, but outlook remains grim

Industry braces for long disruption and possible shakeout

China's rare earth export restrictions seem to be backfiring on its own industry! China’s export restrictions on rare earths have disrupted the global auto supply chain, forced production halts by carmakers, and pushed US President Donald Trump back to the negotiating table—but back in China, the curbs have dealt a fresh blow to struggling Chinese magnet makers.Beijing imposed the restrictions in April in retaliation to US tariffs, severely impacting rare earth and magnet exports just as the domestic economy shows signs of weakness. Electric vehicles (EVs), a key end-use sector, are already facing headwinds, compounding the pain for magnet producers.According to a Reuters report, magnet exports have plunged 75% in the two months following the export controls, and several global automakers were forced to pause production. Although the US and China announced a deal on June 27 to restart rare earth trade flows, implementation is expected to take time.In a post on WeChat just 12 hours after the deal was announced, the state-backed Baotou Rare Earth Products Exchange said inventory was piling up in warehouses and warned that the damage would not be reversed quickly.The Baotou exchange, located in Inner Mongolia—one of China’s major rare earth hubs—described the impact in May as a “crisis” for domestic magnet producers.Despite China producing 90% of the world’s rare earth magnets, export sales remain critical. In 2024, overseas sales accounted for between 18% and 50% of total revenue for the 11 largest publicly listed magnet firms, Reuters reported, citing public filings.“Their sales are now being squeezed from both ends – disrupted exports and flagging domestic demand,” said Ellie Saklatvala, head of metal pricing at commodities information firm Argus. “They have temporarily lost an important part of their customer base, with no certainty about when they will regain it.”Two rare earth magnet producers told Reuters that revenue is expected to fall in 2025, though they declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. One producer said the export curbs would have a “huge impact” on business, while small- and mid-sized players have already slashed production by around 15% in April and May, according to another source.Much like US chipmaker Nvidia, Chinese rare earth firms are caught in the middle of geopolitical crossfire. After an initial share price crash in April, some listed magnet producers have bounced back—but analysts caution the rebound is not backed by industry fundamentals.“I can see various market outlooks, more or less negative depending on the assumptions, but none of them yield a sustainable rise in share price like we’re seeing,” said Cory Combs, head of critical minerals research at Trivium China. He added that many players in the industry are private, limiting the insight that stock prices can offer.Magnet manufacturers are also under pressure at home due to a brutal EV price war, with automakers demanding price cuts from component suppliers. Complicating matters further is the customised nature of most magnet products, which makes them hard to resell domestically. Four sources told Reuters that producers are being forced to store unsold cargoes while they await export licences.Some companies have acknowledged the strain. Baotou Tianhe Magnetics Technology Co flagged potential export revenue risks in its annual report published in late April. Yantai Zhenghai Magnetics said last week that it had received export licences and operations were running normally, while deferring financial details to upcoming filings.However, analysts warn that rare earth trade flows are unlikely to return to pre-restriction levels any time soon.“Looking at China’s recent export controls on other critical minerals – such as antimony – it is clear that it can sometimes take longer than expected for exports to resume and normalise,” said Argus’ Saklatvala, quoted Reuters.China imposed similar export restrictions on germanium and antimony across 2023 and 2024. Despite being mostly used in civilian sectors, which theoretically face fewer licensing hurdles, exports have yet to fully recover, customs data shows. Europe, for instance, is now receiving only a fraction of the antimony it once imported from China, leading to shortages for lead-acid battery manufacturers.David Abraham, an affiliate professor at Boise State University, said the export licence process now involves extensive documentation, leading to delays and added costs. “In some sense, there’s no going back,” he said.With the industry consisting of hundreds of manufacturers, the growing pressures could spark consolidation. “I do not know if Beijing sees that as a bad thing, because further consolidation is helpful for controlling and understanding where materials go,” Abraham added.","China's rare earth export restrictions seem to be backfiring on its own industry.

UAE's ICP Denies Golden Visa Rumours

UAE Golden Visa : Rs 23 Lakh Visa Confusion

Has the UAE launched a new golden visa pilot programme? Reports about UAE launching a pilot programme for a new golden visa have created excitement on social media. However, visa consultants and applicants are confused due to lack of official announcements, leading to doubt and frustration.While Indian media outlets had extensively covered the news about UAE's new golden visa pilot, there had been no coverage in UAE media outlets or the Emirates News Agency, which typically publishes all official announcements. The story had gained significant traction on Indian social media platforms, as affluent Indian citizens have shown keen interest in investment visas and residency programmes in recent years.Nomination-based visa schemes, despite being contentious, have become a preferred option for wealthy families worldwide seeking relocation opportunities for various reasons including taxation, quality of life, and educational prospects.The ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security) has finally dismissed claims spread across various media platforms and online sources suggesting that the UAE offers permanent Golden Visas to specific nationalities, according to a Emirates News Agency report.The Authority emphasised that Golden Visa specifications, requirements and guidelines are explicitly outlined in official regulations and government decrees. Those seeking accurate details can access this information through the Authority's official digital platforms, including their website and mobile application.The authority emphasised that legal measures would be taken against organisations disseminating inaccurate details whilst unlawfully soliciting funds from people who wish to establish residence in the UAE. Such entities take advantage of individuals' aspirations for a respectable and stable lifestyle.The possibility of obtaining a permanent visa to relocate to Dubai, a highly sought-after destination, for the cost equivalent to a mid-range SUV, appeared unrealistic, and it turns out that it was a rumour.A prominent Dubai-based golden visa consultant had confirmed to ET that UAE officials have not announced any modifications to Golden Visa regulations permitting Indian nationals to obtain a lifetime Golden Visa for AED 100,000.Speaking to ET from Dubai via telephone, Iqbal Marconi, former chief executive of ECH Group (recognised by Khaleej Times as the region's principal golden visa facilitator), mentioned receiving numerous enquiries from India following the circulation of this information.""I checked with the authorities here, and they say they have no such information. So, the news is likely to be untrue. The only new update they have is that crypto investors won't be considered for the Golden Visa scheme.”“I checked with the GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs Dubai) also, they too said they don't have any information on this. I also checked with a couple of officials here who are in the same line of work, they also said they don't have any information in this regard,” he added.A senior official, speaking anonymously to the financial daily, had emphasised that UAE visas are not available for purchase. The government may grant Golden Visas based on various criteria, including AED 2 million real estate investments, business ownership, and notable achievements in science, medicine, arts, culture, media, and sports.The Vision Dubai 2033 strategy aims to double the UAE economy, acknowledging population growth as essential for achieving this objective.Also read | UAE rolls out new golden visa: Lifetime residency at Rs 23 lakh, India among first to benefit","UAE's ICP has dismissed claims spread across various media platforms and online sources suggesting that the UAE offers permanent Golden Visas to specific nationalities.

*HRA exemption is calculated for non-metropolitan cities

At a gross income of Rs 7.50 lakh, the new income tax regime results in zero tax, while the old regime leads to a liability of Rs 16,640. Your total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 2.00 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

At a gross income of Rs 18 lakh, the new regime offers savings of over Rs 29,432, despite the old regime having a significant amount of deductions. The total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 5.59 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

At a gross income of Rs 25 lakh, even with more than Rs 5.25 lakh in deductions, the old regime tax is Rs 26,000 higher than the tax outgo under the new regime. The total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 6.08 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

At a gross income of Rs 75 lakh, even with significant deductions/exemptions under the old regime, the new regime still proves better by Rs 45,760. The total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 9.58 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

The above examples take into account individuals contributing to NPS (employer’ contribution). However, if one does not contribute to such NPS, for an individual having gross income of more than Rs 15.75 lakh, he/she is better off taking new regime only if the eligible tax saving investments under the old tax regime are less than Rs 4,33,333/-

(Please note that the above calculations are specific to the numerical examples captured in the above table and may change depending on your specific scenario)

ITR filing FY 2024-25: The choice of the income tax regime while filing Income Tax Return (ITR) is an extremely important one. Your final tax outgo is dependent on the tax regime you opt for, hence the choice between the new and old income tax regime should be an informed decision.Salaried taxpayers have the option to choose between the new and old income tax regime every year. As your financial journey evolves, and changes are made in both the new and old income tax regime, it’s crucial for you to do a final check on which regime suits you best before filing ITR for FY 2024-25.“The Government has over the years brought significant revisions, in the New Regime, making the choice more compelling—and more consequential—than ever,” says Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner, EY India.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2024-25: Do you need to file your income tax return if TDS has been deducted? Explained If you are confused about the new versus old income tax regime and are still wondering which works out better for you, we have you covered.Before understanding the math to decide between the new and old regimes, here’s a look at the tax slabs in the respective regimes.The above tax slabs are applicable for resident individuals up to the age of 60 years. For senior citizens between the age of 60-80 years, the basic exemption limit is Rs 3 lakh.For super senior citizens the basic exemption limit is Rs 5 lakh.The tax slabs under the new regime are very different from those in the old regime, with new tax brackets and lower tax rates. However, there is no separate basic exemption limit for senior and super senior citizens.The table below by EY, gives a side-by-side comparison of the new and old Tax regimes, highlighting key differences in structure, eligibility, and suitability to help taxpayers make an informed choice.To illustrate how tax liabilities vary under each regime (for the Financial Year 2024-25), here’s a comparative snapshot across income levels for a Resident individual:Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner, EY India tells TOI that an income-wise comparison of tax liability under the new and old Regimes reveals a clear trend: the new tax regime offers lower tax outgo across all income brackets, from middle to high-income groups—even when taxpayers under the old regime claim substantial deductions like HRA, Section 80C, NPS, and standard deductions. He explains:“These findings suggest that the new regime is not only simpler but often more tax-efficient, especially for individuals who may not fully utilize all deductions or prefer a hassle-free filing process. While the old Regime still holds value for some with structured investments, the broader appeal of the new Regime continues to grow, making it a compelling default choice for many taxpayers,” Amarpal Chadha tells TOI.Yet another detail that you should not miss is that the new income tax regime is now the default tax regime. While filing ITR, you can choose between the old and new regime. But, if the return is filed after the due date (this year it is September 15, 2025), then you will have to by default file ITR under the new tax regime, the option of old regime would not be available.Also Read | ITR filing: Why are ITR-2 and ITR-3 forms still not available on Income Tax e-filing portal?

"Bihar SIR: Electoral revision process shows Urban-rural divide; Aadhaar accepted in Patna, not in Seemanchal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-sir-aadhaar-accepted-in-patna-not-in-seemanchal/articleshow/122350645.cms,"Representative image

Poll Do you think the current voter document requirements are clear and easy to follow? No, they’re confusing and inconsistent Yes, the process is manageable

Aadhaar not valid here

PATNA: The special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar has gained pace with 57% (4.5 crore) of the 7.89 crore enrolled voters submitting their enumeration forms by Wednesday. But the process seems to have thrown up an urban-rural divide, TOI found after speaking to officials and people across regions. While officials were seen taking forms on basis of Aadhaar cards in Patna, not many were willing to accept the card in Seemanchal and other parts of rural Bihar, where birth certificates or, in lieu, caste or land allotment documents were being insisted on.TOI hit the ground for a reality check and found that booth level officers (BLOs), Jeevika didis, shiksha mitras and Anganwadi sevikas distributing enumeration forms in villages and towns of Bihar at a rapid pace.In Patna and adjoining areas, voters said they have been asked to fill in and sign the forms and submit a copy of their voter ID cards, Aadhaar, or even ration cards, if they don't have any of the 11 documents required by the Election Commission.Don’t worry, just provide your Aadhaar card,” Rahul Yadav , a ward councillor, was seen telling a group of worried women.Aadhaar and ration cards are not included in the list of 11 documents mandated by the EC, triggering widespread protests from the opposition India Bloc.But, in reality, some BLOs in urban areas like Patna say they have been asked to just get the enumeration forms filled in and signed by existing voters and upload them as the EC itself says the other needed documents can be submitted later. July 25 is the last date to submit forms.Ramashish, of Bikram area in Patna district, said the BLOs distributing the forms had initially asked them to submit the documents listed by the EC.“Since very few people had any of the 11 listed documents, the villagers were reluctant. But now they have been asked to just fill the columns of mother, father, spouse names, Aadhaar card number and mobile number with signature. That may be the reason why the SIR exercise has gained pace in the last few days,” he said.Many voters enrolled in urban areas of East Champaran district are getting their names added to the voter lists of their respective villages where they have landed property, revealed BLOs in Motihari, Raxaul, Sugauli, Areraj and Chakiya.Shiwani, a teacher at Urvarak Nagar in Begusarai, said, “The BLO asked for my voter ID and Aadhaar cards and I faced no difficulty.” Kalyanesh Agrawal of Chatti Road locality in Begusarai said the verification process was smooth.Awadhesh Kumar Singh, principal of SBSS College, Begusarai, said the BLO visited his house and the process was conducted without hassle.In Patna, people were seen at Jan Suvidha Kendras in their areas to get their forms filled. Former councillor Bharti Devi said there was confusion among people about the documents required. “But we are getting the forms filled to submit them to the BLO,” she said.Born in 1949, Dukhani Devi of Mushari Tola feared her name would be struck off the voter list. “Some people in my area said I will not be allowed to vote if I do not submit some papers. I only have an Aadhaar card and voter ID card. Will I be removed from my hut,” she asked. She was told that for now an Aadhaar would do, bringing a smile to her face.However, the real challenge for the EC to seek one of the 11 documents seems to be in Kishanganj, Purnia, Araria and Katihar districts of Seemanchal region, where people did not have proper documents in place and were seen standing in long queues at block offices, desperate to get residential certificates.More than two lakh such applications have been submitted in Kishanganj district alone in the first week of this month. “This is alarming and should be investigated,” BJP’s deputy CM Samrat Choudhary said.About a dozen BLOs in East Champaran district’s rural areas, when contacted, said since the Aadhaar card is not a valid document and birth certificate a must for enrolment as a voter, they suggest that voters provide either a caste certificate or land allotment certificate or any specific family register.At least two to five members of a family have migrated to urban areas for a long time and are not available in the villages.In Rupani village, in Patahi block of East Champaran, around 25 families are facing this problem as they have no papers. “We have voter cards only and have cast our votes on that basis in earlier polls. The BLOs suggested that we enrol where we live,” said a woman voter.Those who are employed somewhere else are also finding it difficult to fill in the form. Shyam Bihari Ojha, a railway employee posted at Bongaon, West Bengal, said he is a resident of Babhangaon near Ara, in Bhojpur district. “I can’t afford to take leave to visit my village for the documents of my parents, as is required among the 11 documents. My father is not even aware of the electoral roll revision. My parents have no birth certificate or any other document, except Aadhaar cards,” he said.Vivek Kumar of village Ratanpur, under Haspura block in Aurangabad district, said his family of 15 electors received only four forms. “We have been asked to attach documents like a copy of a matriculation certificate, Aadhaar card, and residential certificate with each form,” he said. Since all the documents are not available, they might face problems retaining their names on the voter list.Dhananjay Yadav of Baluan, Ara, said he is a zilla parishad member but had not yet got the enumeration form. Satyadev of Bhakura village has 10 eligible voters in his family but got only three forms. Many in Ara, including Kamlesh Kumar, have similar complaints.A BLO in Ara said many voters — particularly the elderly — without birth or any academic certificate are reluctant to furnish their land ownership documents.In Bhagalpur, Indradev Yadav said he and many others were camping at Babupur as their diara area was flooded. “From where will we procure documents?” he asked. Manohar Mandal, Jitendra Kumar, Anil Rai and Bhairo Paswan, also from the riverine area, said this was not the right time for such an exercise.There was a mixed response in Gaya district. While many said the process was easy, some voters complained they had not received forms. Anwar Hussain of Murarpur, in Gaya town, said all his 13 family members filled the forms and handed them to the BLO. Anju Kumari of New Godown area said the BLO collected the forms with a copy of a matriculation certificate attached.","The special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar has gained pace with 57% of the 7.89 crore enrolled voters submitting their enumeration forms by Wednesday.

AJMER: In a damning indictment of public infrastructure management, the Ajmer Judicial Magistrate Court Number-2 on Wednesday ordered to immediately close the newly inaugurated Ramsetu bridge that suffered structural damage last week after the first rainfall since its construction.Rajasthan's Rs 243 crore project, meant to be a symbol of urban development, now stands as a monument to alleged administrative negligence and questionable construction practices.Judge Manmohan Chandel passed the order while treating a joint suit filed by two residents as a PIL. The court has directed both the Ajmer Municipal Corporation (AMC) and the Ajmer Smart City Ltd (ASCL) to submit their responses by July 11. The suit was filed on July 5, after which court issued notices to the district collector, AMC and ASCL. None of the respondents appeared on July 8 leading to a subsequent hearing on July 9.The closure order came on Wednesday despite the corporation's assertion that it had blocked one of the four roads on the elevated stretch. The court noted that since the same material was used in the bridge's construction, the entire structure posed a safety risk.The court's decision came after shocking revelations that the bridge, operational for merely days, showed significant structural deterioration following the season's first heavy rainfall on July 3. More alarmingly, court proceedings revealed the project proceeded without expert consultation, and relied instead on decisions made by a local citizens' forum. The pressing question that people are now grappling with is: How did a multi-crore infrastructure project fail so spectacularly, and who will be held responsible?","Rajasthan's Rs 243 crore project, meant to be a symbol of urban development, now stands as a monument to alleged administrative negligence and questionable construction practices.

NEW DELHI: Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Wednesday, signalling a possible reset in ties between the industrial group and the state.The meeting, the first between Mamata Banerjee and a Tata group chairman since Banerjee became chief minister, comes over 17 years after her agitation led to Tata motors pulling out its Nano project from Singur.In a post on X, the TMC said, ""Mamata Banerjje hosted Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, for a constructive dialogue on Bengal's industrial growth and emerging opportunities. The meeting reflected Bengal's commitment to fostering meaningful public-private partnerships that drive innovation, investment, and inclusive development.""Seventeen years ago, following a protest led by Banerjee against land acquisition for a Tata Motors facility in Singur, the company relocated the plant. At the time, the state was governed by CPM under the late Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.The opposition Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, led by Mamata Banerjee, had led widespread protests after the state government had rejected her demand to return 400 acres land to farmers.In a move that was termed ""sad"" by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Tata announced his exit plan. PM Modi, who was then chief minister of Gujarat, spotted an opportunity and slid into the industrialist's DMs with a 'welcome' text.""When Ratan Tata said in a press conference in Kolkata that they are leaving West Bengal, I sent him a short SMS saying 'welcome'. And now you can see what a Re 1 (worth) SMS can do,"" Modi had said.Production of Nano cars was discontinued in 2018.At the Bengal global business summit (BGBS), held in February this year, Banerjee had said in her speech that the Tata group chairman could not make it to the summit owing to certain exigencies.Banerjee had a detailed discussion with him on the eve of the summit. ""He has assured (me) that they want to invest more and more in Bengal. And he will come to Bengal very soon and discuss (things) in detail,"" she had said then.","Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Wednesday.

KOLKATA: Tata Group chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran came down to Nabanna on Wednesday to meet Mamata Banerjee - the first time a Tata Group chairman has done so in her 14-year tenure as West Bengal CM - to discuss future investment in the state.Chandrasekaran met Banerjee for about an hour at the latter's 14th-floor office, also marking the first face-to-face conversation between a Bengal CM and the Tata Group's senior-most executive since the group's forced exit from Bengal in 2008 amid the tumultuous Singur agitation (which was led by Banerjee, then the state's principal opposition leader).The Tata Group has a strong presence in Bengal through multiple entities - like TCS , Tata Hitachi, Tata Steel and Tata Global Beverages (formerly Tata Tea). There was no official communication from the administration on the subject of Wednesday's meeting but Nabanna seniors said it revolved around the availability of large land parcels in the state. Another topic that the discussion might have explored was the possibility of a direct Air India flight to Europe, they added.Chandrasekaran holds the post once held by Ratan Tata for close to two decades, and then by Cyrus Mistry. Banerjee has never met either Tata or Mistry after taking over as Bengal CM.The Tata Group (and Tata Sons ) chairman was accompanied by Confederation of Indian Industry director-general Chandrajit Banerjee. State chief secretary Manoj Pant, too, was present. Chandrasekaran left the city after the meeting, officials said.",Chandrasekaran met Banerjee for about an hour at the latter's 14th-floor office.

KOCHI: Vinitha Radhakrishnan's long vigil for her childhood friend Nimisha Priya teeters on the edge of desperation at the thought of what July 16 might bring.That's the date set by Yemen to execute the 37-year-old expat nurse from Kerala, convicted in 2018 of murdering her Yemeni business partner and kept on death row at the central prison in Sana'a since. It's a reality Vinitha and everyone else in Poonkayam village of Palakkad district still haven't reconciled to.""We can never imagine Nimisha killing someone,"" Vinitha said as the clock ticked on the fate of the ""honest, well-mannered girl"" who once walked the corridors of Dhathri Girls' High School in Kollengode with her.Poonkayam hasn't given up hope, though. Vinitha believes ""a last-minute reprieve through govt intervention"" could still happen.

All these years, I knocked on every door possible to save Nimisha, but nothing has worked so far. My earnest plea to the Indian govt is to step in immediately,"" Tomy said.Michele lives in a school hostel in Kothamangalam. During Nimisha's weekly permitted phone calls or chats from prison, Tomy updates her on the initiatives to secure her release. He last spoke to his wife a week ago.Nimisha's mother is currently in Yemen for negotiations with tribal leaders and the victim's family to secure her release, hoping that the community's high regard for women would make them accept offers of ""blood money"".Nimisha was convicted of killing Talal Abdo Mahdi, with whom she had started a private clinic in Sana'a, in retaliation for allegedly torturing her and seizing her passport. A trial court pronounced the death sentence, that an appeals court upheld.Nimisha had travelled to Yemen along with Tomy in 2012, just a year after their marriage. After Michele was born, father and daughter returned home in 2014 due to the civil war in Yemen, while Nimisha stayed back to run their clinic in Sana'a.As the execution date draws near, the Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council has stepped up efforts to start negotiation talks with Talal's kin.

NEW DELHI: A Financial Action Task Force (FATF) report on a comprehensive update on terrorist financing risks, released this month, has for the first time mentioned the role of 'states' as terror sponsors, something India has been harping on while seeking to designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism.India had identified state sponsored terrorism from Pakistan as a source of terrorist financing risk in its money laundering/terror financing risk assessment in 2022. The findings of the FATF reinforces India's position as for the first time, it has introduced the concept of state sponsored terrorism in its report, a senior govt official said.""Political and economic realities within states play a significant role in the close cooperation between criminal elements and terrorist organisations' operations and settlements,"" the report said, adding that weak governance-related matters, systemic corruption and high criminal levels influence the nature of terror financing risks.It stressed on the fact that criminal and terrorist organisations thrived in states with ineffective legal and institutional frameworks, experiencing widespread and systemic corruption, particularly ones which offered lucrative criminal opportunities. The report also mentioned widespread use of banking channels by terrorist outfits in Pakistan.The Paris-based inter-governmental body said Pakistan-based terror outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) had used non-profit organisations (NPOs) and gaming platforms to raise terror financing.""Sham NPOs are established or registered knowingly for the purpose of terror financing and used to raise, store and move funds, commonly under false charitable pretexts,"" the FATF report said.

Political aggression manifesting in acts of violence like the Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad who slapped a canteen staff at the MLA hostel on Tuesday has also become a cause of concern. Some say the so-called ""language war"" needs to be curbed urgently.Puran Singh Rajput, whose family comes from Nathdwara in Rajasthan, runs a grocery shop in Mira Road. ""I was born here and know Marathi, but my father who has been in the city for over three decades cannot speak Marathi. I fear that tomorrow any activist can confront my father and humiliate him just because he does not speak Marathi,"" said Rajput.A taxi driver from UP, who did not want to be named, said his grasp of Marathi is ""30%"". ""I've been working in Mumbai for 25 years and picked it up on the job. I can answer basic questions, if someone wants to test me,"" he said, adding that this inadequacy has now led to a sense of insecurity.He said Indians should be free to work where they want within the country, and not be constrained by language. ""Maharashtrians live and work in different states and no one demands that they learn Bhojpuri in Bihar or Odia in Odisha. Then why do we, in Maharashtra, learn Marathi? This is nothing but politics, given BMC elections are around the corner,"" he said.Many say learning the language is an advantage, but forcing someone to speak in the tongue is akin to fuelling linguistic chauvinism, and using violence to ""punish"" those who cannot speak this language is simply lawlessness. They also blame the misuse of social media to amplify acts of violence perpetrated in the name of asserting linguistic supremacy. Shaikh Abdullah, whose Kurla-based bakery employs around 200 workers from different states, said in order to win over voters ahead of BMC polls, political workers are coining bigoted slogans and creating a climate of fear.

Centre set to approve 110-km Bhubaneswar bypass; road to connect Khurda and Cuttack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-set-to-approve-110-km-bhubaneswar-bypass-road-to-connect-khurda-and-cuttack/articleshow/122348382.cms,"Odisha is set to get a mega 110-km highway project, costing around Rs 8,300 crore.

New Delhi: Odisha is set to get a mega 110-km highway project, costing around Rs 8,300 crore. The six-lane Greenfield Capital Region Ring Road, or Bhubaneswar Bypass, will work as an arterial road for three major cities—Khurda, Bhubaneswar, and Cuttack. The new road will bring down travel time by 40 minutes, from the current two hours to 80 minutes.TOI has learnt that the proposal for the project has been cleared by an inter-ministerial panel, and it is likely to be approved by the Union cabinet in the next couple of weeks. The main purpose of the proposed access-controlled highway, which starts from Rameshwar in Khurda and terminates at Tangi (outside Cuttack), is to ease congestion in the existing 86-km section of the NH-16 passing through the three cities.The Kolkata-Chennai NH-16 passes through highly urbanised areas of these Odisha cities, and considering rapid urbanisation and growth in the state capital, Bhubaneswar, it is not practical to widen the NH. As per estimates, traffic in the state capital has crossed one lakh passenger car units (PCUs), leading to congestion. Officials said the proposed project is essential to address congestion and for the overall development of the region.The travel time on the existing NH is around two hours during peak hours, but it can stretch up to two and a half hours. The proposed greenfield road, designed for 100 kmph, is expected to reduce travel time to 1.2 hours. This will also help develop more urban areas outside these cities, sources said.As per the Centre’s policy for building bypasses, the Odisha govt will share 50% of the land cost. The total land cost has been estimated at Rs 1,029 crore. The project has been divided into three packages, and the entire corridor will have six interchanges, four elevated stretches, five major and 44 minor bridges, three rail overbridges, and 17 vehicle underpasses.Sources said the project will be built under the hybrid annuity model (HAM), and the successful bidder will have to complete the project in two and a half years and maintain it for the next 15 years.","Odisha is set to get a mega 110-km highway project, costing around Rs 8,300 crore.

BHOPAL: She never mated, yet raised generations of calves. She survived brutal attacks, lived through blindness, and stood as a matriarch in the forests of Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh for over three decades. But when Vatsala died this week, the gentle elephant did so just short of global recognition - because of one missing document.On Tuesday, Vatsala collapsed into a pit near Hinauta Elephant Camp and could not rise. Her body finally gave way. Forest officials said she was more than 100 years old - a contender for Guinness Book of World Records - but could not secure the title. ""Without official records from her early life or veterinary documentation from the time of her capture, we couldn't meet the strict criteria set by Guinness. We were so close,"" said a senior officer.Vatsala was brought from Kerala to MP's Narmadapuram in 1971, already around 50. She understood only Malayalam then, silent before the Hindi- and Gondi-speaking mahouts of MP. But she eventually bonded with Maniram Gond, the mahout assigned to her in 1994, when both were transferred to Panna.""When I first called her, she didn't even blink,"" said Maniram. ""We were strangers - two beings from different worlds.""But over 30 years together, they formed a bond beyond language. ""She began to understand my tone, my touch. Even without words, we figured each other out.""Known across the reserve for her calm temperament, Vatsala allowed schoolchildren to play beneath her belly. ""She was like a grandmother,"" said Maniram. Though she never bore calves, she mothered many. Called 'Dadi' by staff, she nurtured young elephants, guiding and protecting them while keeping a deliberate distance from males.That refusal triggered one of the darkest moments in her life. In 2003 and again in 2008, a male named Rambhahdur attacked her when she resisted his mating attempts. ""He tore her stomach open. Her intestines were out. It took nine months to treat her,"" Maniram said. Vatsala never retaliated.By 2004, her eyesight had deteriorated completely. She was retired from patrol duty and placed under Maniram's full-time care. ""Even fully blind, she'd raise her trunk when I called her name,"" he said.Officials had sent tusk samples to labs to verify her age through scientific analysis. ""There's no forensic system available to determine exact age,"" said APCCF (Wildlife) L Krishnamurthy, ""but she would be remembered forever.""","Vatsala, who forest officials said was over a 100 years old, died in Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday.

EC quotes Article 326 of Constitution to justify poll rolls revision in Bihar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-quotes-article-326-to-justify-poll-rolls-revision-in-bihar/articleshow/122351501.cms,"NEW DELHI: A day before Supreme Court takes up a batch of petitions challenging the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar, Election Commision took to X to quote from Article 326 of the Constitution, which unequivocally mandates the poll panel to register only Indian citizens above 18 years of age, unless disqualified, as voters.With enumeration forms of nearly 57.5% of Bihar's 7.9 crore voters collected in the initial 15 days of SIR, EC officials told TOI the names of all electors who figured in Bihar rolls on June 24, 2025 and who turn in their filled-up enumeration forms before July 25, 2025, shall be included in the draft electoral roll to be published on Aug 1, 2025.""However, if the electors included in such draft rolls do not meet the enrolment requirements under Article 326, the electoral registration officer (ERO) can remove them after due inquiry,"" said a senior EC functionary.As per Article 326: ""Elections to the House of the People and to the Legislative Assemblies of states to be on the basis of adult suffrage; that is to say, every person who is a citizen of India and who is not less than 18 years of age on such date as may be fixed in that behalf by or under any law made by the appropriate legislature, and is not other otherwise disqualified under the Constitution or any other law... on grounds of non-residence, unsoundness of mind, crime or corrupt or illegal practice, shall be entitled to be registered as a voter at any such situation"".""Pure electoral rolls are inevitable for strengthening democracy,"" chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said, while hailing the nearly 57.5% submission of enumeration forms with 16 days of SIR still remaining.

The bridge connected Vadodara and Anand districts, serving as a vital link between Central Gujarat and Saurashtra

VADODARA: At least 13 people, including two children, died Wednesday morning when six vehicles plunged 50 to 60 feet into Mahi river after a key section of a 39-year-old bridge caved in near Mujpur village, 27km from Vadodara.The collapse reignited memories of the Morbi tragedy in Oct 2022, when a 19th-century suspension bridge gave way after renovation, killing 135 and injuring 56. Investigations blamed shoddy repairs and rushed timelines.Built in 1986, the bridge near Mujpur links central Gujarat to Saurashtra and is heavily used by trucks and tankers from industrial zones in Padra and Ankleshwar. Many commuters favour it to avoid tolls on Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway.A 15- to 20-metre segment of the 830m-long bridge gave way around 7.30am, sending three trucks, a pick-up van, an auto-rickshaw, and a seven-seater vehicle crashing into the water below. A large tanker truck teetered dangerously at the edge before being pulled to safety.Residents of nearby Dabka and Mujpur villages, jolted awake by the sound of collapsing concrete and cries for help, mounted rescue efforts for nearly an hour before teams from Vadodara fire brigade and NDRF arrived.By late evening, 13 bodies had been pulled from the river. The victims were from Vadodara, Anand, and Panchmahal districts. Five injured survivors are being treated at SSG Hospital in Vadodara.""I was on my way to Anand. The truck suddenly began shaking violently. Before I could grasp what was happening, the bridge collapsed and I plunged into the river,"" said driver Ganpat Solanki, who survived the fall.Vadodara district panchayat member Harshadsinh Parmar had flagged concerns about the Gambhira bridge's condition to state govt in Aug 2022, prompting inspections. Funds were sanctioned recently, with a new Rs 212-crore bridge project in the pipeline.President Droupadi Murmu, PM Narendra Modi, and CM Bhupendra Patel expressed condolences. Gujarat govt announced Rs 4 lakh in compensation for families of the deceased, while Centre pledged Rs 2 lakh from PM's National Relief Fund. The injured will receive Rs 50,000 from both state and Centre.Wednesday's tragedy added to growing calls for mandatory structural audits, stricter bridge maintenance, and accountability for years of neglected infrastructure.A 30-year-old iron footbridge over Indrayani river near Kundamala in Pune collapsed on June 15, killing four and injuring over 50. Age, overcrowding, and ignored safety warnings were cited as reasons.","A 15- to 20-metre segment of the 830m-long bridge gave way around 7.30am, sending three trucks, a pick-up van, an auto-rickshaw, and a seven-seater vehicle crashing into the water below.

BHOPAL: A Bhopal court will continue to hear the criminal case linked to the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster, rejecting Dow Chemical's plea to shift proceedings to a CBI court in Indore. Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) Hemlata Ahirwar ruled Wednesday that her court holds jurisdiction, fixing the next hearing for Aug 23.Dow Chemical, which took over Union Carbide Corporation in 2000, had earlier been declared a proclaimed offender after failing to respond to six court summonses. It responded only after seventh notice was served to its US headquarters. Dow's counsel - senior advocates Siddartha Luthra and Ravindra Shrivastava - said Indian courts, including JMFC Bhopal, lack jurisdiction over a US-based company and only CBI court in Indore is competent to hear the case. The argument marked a shift in Dow's earlier stand that no Indian court could conduct proceedings against it.CBI's counsel Manphool Vishnoi and lawyers for NGO Bhopal Group for Information & Action (BGIA) - Avi Singh and Prasanna B - opposed the jurisdictional challenge. They said the disaster happened in Bhopal and the case falls squarely within its courts' authority, regardless of CBI's role as prosecuting agency.The court will now examine three key issues: Dow Chemical's claim that no legal action can be initiated against it in India; the company's accountability for the Bhopal disaster after its acquisition of UCC; and BGIA's 2024 application seeking Dow's business integration plan during the UCC takeover. BGIA had earlier urged the CJM court to formally make Dow a party in the case.","Dow Chemical took over Union Carbide Corporation in 2000.

Suns double down on franchise face Devin Booker with record-setting $75M average deal

The Phoenix Suns made their record-breaking big move by signing of their four-time All-Star Chris Paul, but they also shockingly extended his contract to two years at $150 million, making his annual salary (AAV) the highest in NBA history at a mouthwatering AAV of $ 75 million. The huge contract extends Booker to the Suns till the 2029 to 2030 season, making him one of the pillars of the club.In early July, ESPN's Shams Charania along with NBA insider Duane Rankin confirmed that Booker had locked in a two-year, $150 million extension, marking the highest deal ever for any NBA player. This extension comes right after a 2024–25 season where Booker averaged 25.6 points, 4.1 rebounds, and a career-high 7.1 assists over 75 games, his most since the 2016–17 season. His shooting percentages were solid too, hitting 46.1% from the field, 33.2% from beyond the arc, and 89.4% from the charity stripe — proof that he’s still climbing.Booker's agreement beats the previous AAV record held by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the MVP of the Oklahoma City Thunder, who raked in $71.25 million per season. The Suns clearly consider this a strategic move: despite the offseason drama, including the trade of Kevin Durant and a shift in roster strategy, they have made Booker's future a must-have.The contract appears when the Suns are under a huge transition. They failed to reach the playoffs in 2024 25 with the records of 3646 and the owner Mat Ishbia has made a culturally change including firing the current head coach Mike Budenholzer. Amidst all this turmoil, Booker has not relented and played a role in assisting with the interviews of the coaching hopefuls like Jordan Ott and even expressing his opinion on the rebuilding plan of the Suns. It is important to note that this is reflective in his active involvement in making the organization invest hugely in him.Also Read: Angel Reese’s first signature shoe with Reebok signals a new era for women’s basketball With this landmark $75 million per year contract, Devin Booker isn’t just getting paid—he’s being recognized as the Suns’ long-term centerpiece.

Narayana Murthy 's recent advocacy for a 70-hour workweek. The Bengaluru-based firm has implemented an automated monitoring system that triggers alerts when employees work beyond 9 hours and 15 minutes daily.""We must work for 9.15 hours a day for five days a week, and if we overshoot this while working remotely, it prompts a trigger,"" an employee told The Economic Times. The company's HR department now tracks remote working hours monthly, sending detailed notifications to staff members who exceed prescribed durations.The monitoring system was introduced following hybrid working arrangements for Infosys's 323,500 employees. When excessive hours are detected, HR sends comprehensive notifications including information about remote working days, total hours worked, and daily averages. The company's workplace policy, implemented in November 2023, requires staff to be present in office for minimum 10 days monthly.""While we appreciate your commitment, we also believe that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial for both your well-being and long-term professional success,"" states the HR communication reviewed by financial dailies. The emails emphasize that prioritizing health and work-life balance benefits both personal wellbeing and professional success.This initiative emerges amid growing concerns about young tech professionals facing health challenges, particularly cardiac issues attributed to irregular dietary and rest patterns. The company's guidance includes specific recommendations: ""Take regular breaks during your workday; Let your manager know if you are feeling overwhelmed or need support with reviewing priorities.""The policy represents a significant departure from Murthy's recent statements calling for Indians to work 70 hours weekly to accelerate economic growth.

NHL Trade Rumor: Jordan Kyrou’s future in St. Louis uncertain amid Canadiens' growing interest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumor-jordan-kyrous-future-in-st-louis-uncertain-amid-canadiens-growing-interest/articleshow/122353752.cms,"Jordan Kyrou trade talks escalate (Imagn Images)

Jordan Kyrou Trade Rumors Heat Up: Blues May Be Ready to Move On From Their Star Winger



As the St. Louis Blues aim to reshape their roster following a playoff appearance, a familiar name continues to surface in trade talks—Jordan Kyrou. The dynamic winger, known for his speed and offensive output, is reportedly at the center of intense trade speculation as the Blues look for ways to upgrade their squad amid salary cap constraints.Despite delivering a respectable 36-goal, 34-assist season across all 82 games and adding three goals during the playoffs, Kyrou’s future in St. Louis is anything but secure. The chatter, once dismissed as typical offseason noise, has grown significantly louder. NHL insider Frank Seravalli recently revealed, “The Blues remain very motivated to move on from Kyrou.” That revelation has sent waves through the fanbase and around the league.One of the biggest reasons behind the Blues’ motivation appears to be financial. Kyrou is in the third year of his eight-year contract that carries a cap hit of $8.125 million annually. With six more seasons remaining, St. Louis may be rethinking the value he brings relative to his price tag. Whether it’s an attempt to reallocate cap space for a more balanced roster or to create room for a marquee acquisition, the writing is on the wall.Teams have reportedly been circling, with the Montreal Canadiens emerging as a serious suitor. TSN’s Pierre LeBrun reported that Montreal’s front office, even after landing defenseman Noah Dobson, was not finished making moves. “They were among several teams expressing an interest in Kyrou,” said LeBrun. While the Canadiens primarily need a second-line center, they remain open to adding a top-tier scoring winger—a role Kyrou could instantly fill.However, complications remain. Kyrou’s no-trade clause officially kicked in on July 1, giving him significant leverage in any potential deal. Jeremy Rutherford of The Athletic added that while the Canadiens were interested, “it would take multiple assets for the Habs to land him.” Compounding matters, Montreal may lack the specific center the Blues have been hunting—although St. Louis has since addressed that need by signing Pius Suter and Nick Bjugstad.Despite the murky path forward, Marco D’Amico of RG.Org reports that Montreal is still trying to bolster their top six and “still have the Blues winger among their targets.” Their recent trade history—with Logan Mailloux going to St. Louis in exchange for Zack Bolduc—suggests the communication lines are open.Yet, unless Kyrou waives his clause and the Canadiens are willing to meet what is expected to be a steep asking price, this potential blockbuster may never leave the ground. Still, as the offseason drama unfolds, one thing is clear: Jordan Kyrou’s future in St. Louis is far from guaranteed.Also Read: Connor McDavid's patience tested as Oilers trade key prospect amid rising 2025-26 expectations","Jordan Kyrou is reportedly at the center of intense trade speculation.

Rishi Sunak: A journey from banker to Prime Minister to a job at Goldman Sachs — a return no one expected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunak-a-journey-from-banker-to-prime-minister-to-a-job-at-goldman-sachs-a-return-no-one-expected/articleshow/122344536.cms,"Image: Getty Images

Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.W hen Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser.

The AI chip maker has notched a market capitalization of $4 trillion. This makes Nvidia the first public company in the world to reach the milestone and solidify its position as one of Wall Street's most-favored stocks. Nvidia, the leading chip designer, saw its shares surge by 2.4% to $164, fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence technologies. The company’s meteoric rise has solidified its position as a tech titan, with its market value surpassing $1 trillion in June 2023 and tripling within a year.This growth outpaced Apple and Microsoft, the only other U.S. companies with market capitalizations exceeding $3 trillion, making Nvidia a standout in the tech sector. Microsoft, holding the title of the second-largest U.S. company with a $3.75 trillion market cap, saw its shares climb 1.3% to $503. Nvidia’s stock has rebounded impressively, up 74% from its April lows, when global markets faced turbulence due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements. The volatility rattled investors, but recent optimism surrounding potential trade deals between the U.S. and its partners has lifted market sentiment, propelling the S&P 500 to a record high.Nvidia’s dominance is underscored by its 7.3% weighting in the S&P 500, the largest of any company in the index. By comparison, Apple and Microsoft hold weights of approximately 7% and 6%, respectively, highlighting the trio’s outsized influence on the broader market. The surge in AI-driven demand has positioned Nvidia as a key player, with its chips powering cutting-edge technologies across industries.As trade tensions ease and investor confidence grows, Nvidia’s stock continues to benefit from both its technological leadership and favorable market conditions. The company’s trajectory suggests it will remain a cornerstone of the tech sector, with analysts closely watching its performance as AI adoption accelerates globally.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.
