How hypersonic missile works



NEW DELHI: The Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) on Saturday conducted a flight trial of a long-range hypersonic missile from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Odisha.The hypersonic missile that the DRDO tested is designed to carry various payloads for ranges greater than 1500 km for all the services of the Indian armed forces.The missile has been indigenously developed by the laboratories of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Missile Complex, Hyderabad along with various other DRDO laboratories and Industry Partners.The flight trial was carried out in the presence of senior scientists of DRDO and the armed forces.Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO on the successful flight trial of the missile, calling it a ""major milestone"" for the nation.""India has achieved a major milestone by successfully conducting flight trial of long range hypersonic missile from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Island, off-the-coast of Odisha. This is a historic moment and this significant achievement has put our country in the group of select nations having capabilities of such critical and advanced military technologies. I congratulate Team DRDO, our armed forces and the Industry for stupendous achievement,"" Rajnath Singh wrote on X.Hypersonic missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound in the upper atmosphere - or about 6,200 km per hour (3,850 mph). This is slower than an intercontinental ballistic missile, but the shape of a hypersonic glide vehicle allows it to manoeuvre toward a target or away from defences.Combining a glide vehicle with a missile that can launch it partially into orbit - a so-called fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) - could strip adversaries of reaction time and traditional defences mechanisms. Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), by contrast, carry nuclear warheads on ballistic trajectories that travel into space but never reach orbit.","The missile has been indigenously developed by the laboratories of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Missile Complex, Hyderabad. The flight trial was carried out in the presence of senior scientists of DRDO and the armed forces. Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO on the successful flight trial of the missile.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115376217,imgsize-2788590,width-400,resizemode-4/115376217.jpg"

PUNE: Union minister Nitin Gadkari slammed the Congress party over the "" Constitution campaign "" and accused the party of ""altering"" the Constitution during the Congress government under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi Addressing an election rally in Pune's Wakad, Gadkari attacked the Congress party and alleged that only sloganeering statements were made of ' Garibi Hatao ,' and that the poor continue to suffer under the Congress rule.""During the Congress regime, various programs like the 8-point, 20-point, and 40-point initiatives were launched with the slogan 'Garibi Hatao,' but unfortunately, poverty persisted among farmers, labourers, dalits and muslims. Despite the promises, only announcements were made, and the poor continued to suffer. However, our country's adoption of new economic policies has led to significant growth and development,"" he said.He accused Congress of propagating false information about the BJP amending the constitution and claimed that Congress altered the constitution during Indira Gandhi's administration when her election was pronounced invalid by the Allahabad Court.""During the last Lok Sabha elections, the Congress party spread misinformation that the BJP would change the constitution if they won more than 400 seats. However, the constitution is a solid foundation of India's democracy and no one dares to change it. The BJP's policies and leadership are focused on developing the country and making it a 5 trillion economy. When Indira Gandhi's election was declared invalid by the Allahabad Court, the Congress Party, for their gain, altered the Constitution, which Baba Saheb Ambedkar had created. Now, those who once broke the Constitution are using it to spread misinformation during elections and confusing people,"" he said.""The Bharatiya Janata Party does not engage in caste politics, and I'm a daredevil who doesn't let delegations influence me. In front of 10,000 Muslims, I said, 'I am chaddiwala. If you want to vote, vote; if not, I'll still work for you.' I believe a person's qualities, not their caste, define them. I'll never be casteist."" he added.According to the Union minister, India's automobile business is worth Rs 22 lakh crore and ranks third in the world, whereas it was ranked eighth and Rs 7 lakh before 2014.""In 2014, India's automobile industry was worth Rs 7 lakh crores and we ranked eighth globally. However, through the power of growth and technological advancements, we've surged past Japan and secured the third position worldwide. Today, the industry is valued at Rs22 lakh crores, with the United States and China leading the way.

As Jake Paul and Mike Tyson face off this Friday, Netflix has its own stakes to consider. This marks the streaming giant’s biggest live sports event yet, with potential impact on future NFL and WWE deals.Streaming live from AT&T Stadium, it will be available to Netflix’s 280 million subscribers at no extra cost. Delayed due to Tyson’s medical emergency, Netflix has kept expectations under wraps, what does this mean for their future in live sports? Keep reading to find out.JP Morgan Chase analyst Doug Anmuth stands firm in his belief that the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could set a new record as the most-watched boxing match in history. While surpassing Muhammad Ali's iconic bouts, which drew an estimated one billion viewers globally, may be a lofty goal, the 4.6 million viewers from the 2015 Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight might be within reach.Anmuth explains “We believe the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could be the most watched boxing match ever given ease of access and NFLX’s (Netflix's) large global subscriber base, and it should attract Ad Tier subs, viewers, and dollars,"" Anmuth said in his analyst note according to CNBC Pro. He also notes that Netflix’s increasing focus on sports entertainment and live events, especially with NFLX’s growing negotiating leverage, will only enhance its reach. (via: Independent)Netflix has already begun utilizing live sports as complementary programming to its popular documentaries and series. A prime example is the three-part documentary series Countdown: Paul vs. Tyson, which has quickly climbed the ranks, securing the second spot among Netflix's most-viewed shows.In addition, the platform’s recent ventures, such as last November’s Netflix Cup pairing Formula 1 drivers with PGA golfers demonstrate its expanding sports portfolio. Their March exhibition match featuring Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz was tied into promotional content for upcoming documentaries. This continued push into live sports is evident, with the NFL even partnering with Netflix for a Christmas Day doubleheader, thanks to the global success of series like Quarterback and Receiver.Also Read: Patriots provide major update on DT Christian Barmore after blood clot diagnosis before Rams matchup Netflix’s sports strategy isn’t stopping with boxing and football.

promoting rape culture

Even as doctors protest across the country for safety inside hospitals, fresh entrants in several medical colleges are being forced by seniors to memorise and read aloud from booklets filled with vulgar abuses, lauding sexual violence against women in general - and against their female classmates and nurses in particular - in the name of ragging. These 'ragging' sessions and booklets are described by experts in gender violence as grooming in rape culture.Freshers are told to learn the content in the booklets titled 'medical sahitya' or 'personality development programme' and always keep the copies with them. These encourage freshers to look at women of all ages as sex objects.For instance, in the list of acronyms is BHMB (badi hokar maal banegi), and that's the only expansion in the list that is just about printable!According to freshers, they are forced to read aloud from the booklet and if they stumble or laugh, they have to start over. There are descriptions of stages of breast development comparing them with fruits or vegetables, starting from 0-15 age group. There are disrespectful references to cadavers.Every reference to women, including their classmates, is about violent, forceful sexual acts and description of genitalia in the crudest possible terms and nurses are consistently portrayed as 'being available' and willing, indeed craving, to be sexually assaulted by doctors.Jasmeen Patheja, founder of Blank Noise which is working on a project called 'Campus of Belonging' in colleges, describes it as encouraging rape culture.A senior female doctor said, ""Joking about patients' bodies when they are lying unconscious on the operation table is some of the cheapest things that I have seen male anaesthesiologists and surgeons do. This kind of grooming produces doctors who would do such things.""Another doctor recounted her college experience, and said, ""As students, we stood around male doctors asking young women to take off their clothes while they showed us how to do a 'breast examination'. The women were touched without consent and unnecessarily.""Sunita Sheel Bandewar of Forum for Medical Ethics Society said: "" Seniors who indulge into such gross ragging practices might be a threat to women colleagues across the spaces.""",Freshers are told to learn the content in the booklets titled'medical sahitya' or 'personality development programme' The booklets encourage freshers to look at women of all ages as sex objects.

"Air India Baggage Policy: Now, pay more for checking-in second bag to Europe & UK on Air India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/now-pay-more-for-checking-in-2nd-bag-to-europe-uk-on-air-india/articleshow/115363712.cms,"NEW DELHI: Passengers will now have to pay may more to check-in a second bag on Air India flights to and from Europe and the UK. AI has from October 17 introduced fare families where the lowest economy fare allows one check-in of 23 kg to these two places. Those who wish to check in two bags will need to opt for the higher economy fares, the difference starting at about Rs 4,000 (one-way). Most big Western airlines like Lufthansa allow one check-in bag to economy flyers and extra charges have to be paid for the second bag. British Airways starts with a handbag-only economy fare and then has higher economy fare levels that allow two bags of upto 23 kg each.Earlier this year, AI had done the same with domestic where the base category of economy fare now allows baggage allowance of upto 15 kg — down from earlier 25 kg but in line with all other Indian carriers. In its pre-divestment days (before 2022), state-owned AI used to offer higher baggage allowance to woo passengers and make up for its dilapidated cabin product and poor punctuality.Now with the Tatas investing billions of dollars in improving AI and hopefully the result will show in coming years across the fleet, the baggage allowance is getting in sync with big global airlines. While passengers understand that, they wonder if AI should have dome that once its wide body product had improved (something expected to happen over next two years) along with its punctuality. AI still allows two bags of upto 23 kg each in economy on North American routes. How long that stays remains to be seen.“Air India has restructured its fare families on Europe and UK routes to better align the same with market trends and offerings. AI now offer travellers a more affordable ‘value’ fare option that provides one piece of checked baggage weighing 23kg with limited travel flexibility. Travellers who seek more baggage allowance and higher travel flexibility can opt for the ‘classic’ and ‘flex’ fares that continue to offer two pieces of checked baggage weighing 23kg each in economy. ‘Value’ fares are available only for economy class bookings,” AI had said in a statement recently while announcing new fare families across cabins. AI has 264 weekly flights to and from Europe and the UK.A Delhi-based CA who is booking a ticket for his son in Europe to come home this Christmas said: “The fare difference between the one and two check-in bags fare is Rs 8,000. A leading Gulf carrier is cheaper by Rs 20,000 and is offering 35 kg baggage allowance. But taking that will mean increased travel time of five hours due to the connection at its hub.”As AI improves — overall in terms of cabin product and on time performance — and IndiGo spreads its wings on longer-range planes, foreign airlines with hubs in places like the Gulf, further West Asia, Europe and south/southeast Asia that have historically carried a lion’s share of traffic between India and rest of them world will have to offer lower fares to wean away passengers from the nonstop convenience that these two desi carriers will provide.A senior AI official said: “The difference is not much between our one and two check-in bags economy fares for Europe and UK flights. For instance it could be about Rs 4,000 (one-way) for a, say, Delhi-Frankfurt flight. The idea was why should a person travelling with one check-in pay the same as someone doing so with two check-in bags.”","Air India has from October 17 introduced fare families where the lowest economy fare allows one check-in of 23 kg to these two places.

However, as Gsat-20 weighs more than four tonnes, Isro is seeking help from SpaceX for launching its satellite with its heavy-lifter Falcon-9 rocket, which can launch payloads of 8300 kg or 8.3 tonnes to GTO.Isro was till now dependent on Arianespace to launch its heavier satellites, but the European space rocket at present lacked commercial slots for the Gsat-20 launch. This is because Arianespace’s Ariane-5 rocket retired last year and commercial satellite slots for the next few launches of its successor Ariane-6 are already booked. With Russia engaged in the Ukraine conflict and China’s commercial services never considered by India, SpaceX is the only reliable option for India.The Gsat-20 or GSAT N-2, a continuation of the Gsat series of communication satellites, is funded, owned and operated by Isro’s commercial arm New Space India Ltd. The satellite, which has a mission life of 14 years, features a Ka-band high-throughput communications payload with 70 Gbit/s throughput utilising 40 beams offering HTS capacity of nearly 48Gpbs. Each beam will have two polarisations, effectively making them 80 beams.The satellite is intended to add data transmission capacity to the communication infrastructure required by the Union govt’s Smart City mission. It will also help enable in-flight internet connectivity.The satellite was initially expected to be launched on an Isro’s LVM-3 rocket, but was later shifted to Falcon-9 due to the satellite being 700 kg overweight.As India lacks a launcher for over four-tonne satellites, Isro has now fast-tracked the development of its Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV). The Rs 8,240-crore NGLV program is designed to enhance payload capacity threefold compared to the current LVM3, while its cost will be only 1.5 times more. NGLV is designed to have a maximum payload capability of 30 tonnes to the Low Earth Orbit and will also have a reusable first stage. It will also be able to carry payloads around 10 tonnes to GTO.","Isro’s heavy lifter LVM-3, popularly known as ‘Bahubali’ or ‘Fat Boy’, can lift satellites weighing up to four tonnes into the geostationary transfer orbit.

& AI: Vaishnaw

NEW DELHI: Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Saturday highlighted the critical issue of fair compensation for traditional media, underlining how it is financially disadvantaged as news consumption is ""rapidly shifting"" from the conventional modes to the digital space.During his address on National Press Day, hosted by Press Council of India, the minister argued that substantial investment in traditional journalism - including training, editorial processes, and verification - has been undermined by digital platforms' unequal bargaining power.While the investment that goes behind creating a team of journalists, training them, having editorial processes and methods to check the veracity of news, and taking responsibility for the content is huge both in terms of time and money, they are becoming irrelevant since these platforms are having a very unequal edge in terms of bargaining power vis-a-vis conventional media,"" Ashwini Vaishnaw said while adding that efforts made by the conventional media in creating content must be suitably compensated.The minister called for a balanced approach to ensure that traditional media remains viable while holding digital platforms accountable for the content they disseminate. ""It's time for a collective effort to redefine these provisions and safeguard the future of journalism,"" he said.He identified three other pressing challenges facing media and society today: fake news and misinformation, algorithmic bias, and the impact of artificial intelligence on intellectual property.Vaishnaw emphasised the need to revisit the ""safe harbour"" provision which shields intermediaries and internet service providers from liability for third-party content hosted on their platforms and has allowed tech companies to act selectively, often prioritising their interests over public accountability. ""So, the question is, who will take the responsibility for the content published on these platforms,"" he asked.Further, Vaishnaw stressed upon the ethical imperative of protecting creators' rights amid AI advancements. ""AI models today can generate creative content based on vast datasets they are trained on. But what happens to the rights and recognition of the original creators who contributed to that data? Are they being compensated or acknowledged for their work?"" he asked.

CBSE also coming up with reward system for teachers

NEW DELHI: With learning gaps increasingly being linked to ineffective teaching practices in schools, CBSE plans to launch an 'assessment centre' by June next year to address the challenge, focusing on aligning teaching with student outcomes, elevating education quality, and improving student evaluation.Findings of studies, such as the education ministry's National Achievement Survey, Annual Status of Education Report, and CBSE's Structured Assessment for Analysing Learning, unanimously agree on one point: that the fault of dissatisfactory teaching in schools lies with teachers. The studies have been repeatedly revealing ""significant"" learning gaps and achievements between board scores and actual skills as well as indicating that students are increasingly relying on external assistance like private tuitions or coaching for academic preparation.The way you assess will shape the way you teach, CBSE chairperson Rahul Singh said about the initiative that will directly impact 15 lakh CBSE teachers and is likely to assist teachers from state board schools as well.On the issues pointed out by different studies, he said the proposed centre is a response to these concerns. It aims at supporting teachers in designing effective assessments that not only evaluate academic performance, but also identify individual student competencies. ""The assessment centre will develop state-of-the-art tools capable of creating question papers, administering assessments, scanning responses, and tracking individual student progress. Teachers will have personalised pages on the platform to design assessment items of varying difficulty, tailored to evaluate multiple competencies.""To foster innovation and motivation among educators, CBSE will introduce a reward system for teachers who develop high-quality assessment items. This initiative also seeks to address the challenges faced by teachers in Tier-3 cities, where salaries are often limited between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000.One of the core goals is to instil a sense of healthy competition within classrooms. Teachers will receive training to ensure that their assessment methods drive better teaching practices. The tools for preparing question papers, as well as the assessment tools will also be opened to teachers of other educational boards for free use.","CBSE also coming up with reward system for teachers who develop high-quality assessment items.

This sentiment, he noted, resonated throughout the state.During a virtual interaction with BJP workers in Maharashtra as part of the 'Mera Booth Sabse Mazboot' program, Modi compared the Mahayuti government 's achievements with that of the previous Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) administration, stating, ""Everywhere I've been, I've witnessed the affection and support for Mahayuti. The people of Maharashtra desire this government to continue for another five years.""He highlighted that the state government has been making efforts to empower every section of society, a stark contrast to the Aghadi government's approach, which he said, people have clearly felt.To ensure success in the upcoming November 20 assembly elections, Modi encouraged BJP booth workers to strengthen grassroots support by organising strategic meetings with women, youth, and farmers, and by sharing videos that highlight the BJP-led government's achievements.Modi urged them to counter what he described as ""misinformation"" spread by the opposition MVA alliance.""You people are direct representatives of Modi. People feel reassured by sharing their hopes and aspirations with you,"" he emphasised, underlining the crucial role of BJP members in connecting the public with the government.Modi also critiqued the Congress, alleging it historically thrived on dividing voters. ""Until the SCs, STs, and OBCs were kept in the dark, Congress used to form a government with a full majority at the Centre,"" he said and added, ""However, since these communities have become more aware and united, the Congress's position has weakened. Now, they aim to fragment these communities further to diminish their collective power to challenge Congress.""The interaction was interactive, with Modi addressing queries from party workers. A worker from Pune inquired about strategies to engage urban voters more effectively. Modi suggested leveraging social media and local influencers, highlighting digital outreach as the new frontier in political engagement.Another query from Kolhapur concerned rural connectivity, to which Modi responded by detailing ongoing initiatives to enhance digital infrastructure in remote regions, ensuring every booth and worker could communicate efficiently.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the people of Maharashtra are highly impressed with the performance of the ""Mahayuti"" government.

had revolted against his uncle Sharad Pawar and walked away with not just legislators but

’s name and symbol. Despite his party’s dismal performance in the Lok Sabha polls, he exuded confidence during an interview with TOI about the assembly poll outcome. Excerpts:

A few days ago, you had said there was a meeting in New Delhi in 2019 which was attended by Gautam Adani, Praful Patel, home minister Amit Shah, Sharad Pawar, Devendra Fadnavis and you. Suddenly, later you said the meeting did take place but Adani did not attend it, while Sharad Pawar has confirmed Adani's presence.

You have been at loggerheads with your political mentor and uncle Sharad Pawar. In fact, in your hometown, your cousin is contesting against you.

What will be the outcome of the assembly elections?

Mahayuti has announced a series of populist schemes. Do we have adequate funds for implementation?

You worked under more than half a dozen chief ministers. Who was the best?

Are you in the race for the CM's post?

During Lok Sabha elections, the performance of your party was dismal, you won only one seat out of four you contested.

There is no question of a U-turn. It's a fact the meeting did take place, but Adani was not present. Several meetings were held in New Delhi for formation of government, and I attended a few meetings along with Praful Patel and others. I have no comments on the statement by Sharad Pawar; he has been meeting industrialists for seeking investments in the state.I have no comments to make on our family matters. My entire focus is on the assembly elections.Mahayuti is contesting unitedly. It should not be difficult for it to cross the 175 mark. We are determined to retain power.We will implement the Ladki Bahin and other schemes in letter and spirit. We have made a budgetary provision of Rs 76,000 crore for all the schemes. Out total budget outlay stands at Rs 6.5 lakh crore, while expenditure on salary, pension and interest on loans stands at Rs 3.5 lakh crore. So I feel our financial situation is quite sound to meet the expenditure. On the contrary, it will not be possible for MVA to implement the ‘five guarantees' it has given as the total cost of the guarantees will be Rs 3.5 lakh crore. We have geared up our revenue mobilization and will enhance GST mobilization, stamp duty on registration and excise duty on liquor products.It's a fact I had occasion to work under several CMs. In my opinion, Vilasrao Deshmukh , who was CM on two occasions, was the best CM. We are in an era of coalition politics, and there is no possibility of a single party govt at the national level or state level. Deshmukh had developed the tactics of leading a coalition govt.I am not in the race. The CM will be decided after results are out, in the meeting of the Mahayuti legislature party.Post-Lok Sabha polls, the situation has changed, voters will vote for Mahayuti. People have realized Mahayuti alone will deliver results. Key factors during Lok Sabha elections, particularly (the issue of) reservation, have changed, which will help Mahayuti improve its performance.","Mahayuti is contesting unitedly. It should not be difficult for it to cross the 175 mark. We are determined to retain power. We will implement the Ladki Bahin and other schemes in letter and spirit. We have made a budgetary provision of Rs 76,000 crore for all the schemes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115344391,imgsize-549434,width-400,resizemode-4/115344391.jpg"

Miller’s Stance on H-1B Visas

Impact on Indian Tech Professionals

Indian nationals, who hold a significant portion of H-1B visas, may face several challenges due to Miller’s restrictive stance:

Increased Visa Denials: Stricter eligibility criteria could result in higher rejection rates for applications from Indian professionals.

Stephen Miller: Controversies



President-elect Donald Trump has appointed longtime adviser Stephen Miller , known for his strong stance on immigration, as the deputy chief of policy for his new administration. Vice President-elect JD Vance confirmed the appointment on Monday, congratulating Miller on X, calling him “another fantastic pick by the president.” Miller has been one of Trump’s closest aides since his first presidential campaign and was a senior adviser during Trump’s first term. He has played a central role in many policy decisions, particularly on immigration, including the 2018 family separation policy.Additionally, on Sunday, Trump announced that former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director Tom Homan would serve as the administration’s “Border Czar.” In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump shared that Homan would oversee border security , including the Southern and Northern Borders, as well as maritime and aviation security. Homan, a longtime ally of Trump, is also being considered for the role of Secretary of Homeland Security. Trump praised Homan’s expertise in border control, stating he would also oversee deportation policies.Miller is expected to continue his advocacy for restrictive immigration policies, including limits on H-1B visas. According to a Forbes report, the Trump administration’s stance has often been at odds with economic consensus, which suggests that high-skilled immigrants and international students benefit the US economy. The administration worked to decouple study in the US from work opportunities, particularly through H-1B visa restrictions, making it more challenging for high-skilled foreign nationals to stay and work in the U.S. after graduation. The Cruz-Sessions bill, which reflects Miller’s influence, proposed significant barriers for H-1B visa holders, requiring them to work abroad for 10 years before qualifying to work in the U.S., and setting a high minimum salary of $110,000. The bill also sought to restrict Optional Practical Training (OPT) for international students, a policy that was nearly eliminated by a Trump administration regulation.Homan and Miller are anticipated to work closely in the upcoming administration to implement these restrictive immigration measures, with Homan overseeing border control and deportation, as well as maritime and aviation security.Miller argues that the H-1B program can lead to American worker displacement and wage suppression. During Trump’s first term, policies were introduced under Miller’s influence to tighten H-1B regulations, including raising denial rates and narrowing the definition of “specialty occupation,” reducing the positions eligible for H-1B workers.These potential changes may discourage U.S. companies from hiring Indian tech talent, limiting opportunities for those seeking employment in the US.Stephen Miller, born on August 23, 1985, in Santa Monica, California, was raised in a Jewish family with a conservative ideology that influenced his early political views and career choices.Miller attended Duke University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. At Duke, he became a prominent conservative voice on campus, frequently contributing to publications and engaging in political debates. His early career included positions as a press secretary for U.S. Representatives Michele Bachmann and John Shadegg, where he developed a strong foundation in political communication.In 2016, Miller joined Donald Trump’s presidential campaign as a senior policy advisor. After Trump’s election, he took on the role of senior advisor for policy and White House director of speechwriting from 2017 to 2021. Miller played a significant role in crafting Trump’s major speeches, including the inaugural address, and was instrumental in shaping the administration’s stringent immigration policies. He was one of the chief architects of the travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries and the family separation policy aimed at deterring illegal immigration at the U.S. border.Following Trump’s first term, Miller founded America First Legal , an organization dedicated to advancing conservative legal principles and challenging policies of the Biden administration. Through this platform, Miller continued to impact public policy, focusing on immigration and national security, key areas of his earlier work.In November 2024, after Donald Trump’s re-election, Miller was appointed as Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy in the White House. In this role, he is expected to oversee the administration’s policy agenda, especially concerning immigration and national security.Miller is married to Katie Waldman, former press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence. The couple has three children. Throughout his career, Miller has been a divisive figure, gaining praise from supporters for his unwavering conservative principles and facing criticism from opponents for his hardline stance on immigration and involvement in controversial policies.Miller’s career has been marked by several controversies. In 2019, leaked emails revealed that he had promoted articles from white nationalist sources, sparking public criticism and calls for his resignation. Despite these incidents, Miller has retained significant influence within conservative political circles.","President-elect Donald Trump has appointed longtime adviser Stephen Miller as the deputy chief of policy for his new administration.

Jerry Jones stated that the NFL plans to increase business with Netflix

The loss by the Dallas Cowboys over the Philadelphia Eagles could be remembered through a viral moment when glare from the windows of AT&T Stadium caused an incomplete pass from Cooper Rush to CeeDee Lamb. Owner Jerry Jones denied the existence of the problem, going further to lash out at reporters and say that the stadium should be pulled down and that a new one should be constructed.Jerry Jones appeared on the K&C Masterpiece on Friday morning before the Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul fight at AT&T Stadium and his Cowboys' Monday night game against the Houston Texans. Topics include the fight, his Cowboys, whether he's a proponent of the idea that the NFL should play an 18-game schedule, and Jason Witten being an NFL head coach someday.Jerry Jones' stadium hosted the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson event streamed by Netflix on Friday night, ensuring no sun exposure for fighters. Jerry emphasized the NFL's desire to increase business with Netflix, which will partner with the streaming giant for the first time on Christmas Day. “Worldwide coverage with Netflix,” Jones said. “We’re all being introduced to Netflix. We’re so excited in the NFL about Netflix becoming a huge part of our future. This tonight gives us a chance to go to forty, fifty million people and do it from right here.”A similar but distinct deal could be done with Netflix, which could very well obtain rights bundles in the near future. It would focus on more international games, primarily staged in Europe. The NFL hopes to see more international games at 16 in the next five years. The American league's regular season will comprise 18 games. This may be the best time for the million domestic viewers and possibly more around the globe for a Netflix package.Also Read: ""What the f--- is Jerry talking about?”: Travis and Jason Kelce talked about the Jerry Jones vs Sun war at AT&T Stadium Fight fans were shocked by the call to draw the 'curtain' inside AT&T Stadium, especially in apparent contradiction to the claims Netflix wanted the opposite of the mega fight pitting Jake Paul against Mike Tyson. The decision runs contrary to the assertion by owner Jerry Jones that the stadium had been designed to counter sunlight issues that tend to blind his side during home games.

NEW DELHI: The air quality in the national capital remains a concern as the Air Quality Index (AQI) stays in the 'severe' category for the fifth consecutive day on Sunday morning.The overall AQI of Delhi stood at 428 in the ‘severe’ category at around 7.30 am., as per the Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ).CPCB data showed that most areas reported air quality in the severe category, with AQI levels above 400.Key locations recorded severe pollution levels, including Anand Vihar at 457, Ashok Vihar at 466, Aya Nagar at 426, Bawana at 471, Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range at 415, Dwarka Sector 8 at 445, and Dilshad Garden at 448.Other areas showed similarly alarming figures: 411 at ITO, 466 in Jahangirpuri, 419 near Major Dhyan Chand Stadium, 434 on Mandir Marg, 463 in Mundka, 402 in Najafgarh, 444 in Narela, and 442 in Nehru Nagar.Further hotspots included North Campus DU at 427, NSIT Dwarka at 410, Okhla Phase 2 at 409, Patparganj at 439, Punjabi Bagh at 442, Pusa at 407, RK Puram at 434, Rohini at 449, Shadipur at 457, Siri Fort at 405, Sonia Vihar at 440, Vivek Vihar at 454, and Wazirpur at 463.The hazardous pollution levels are triggering serious health issues, including respiratory problems, eye irritation, and an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), over 14 locations in Delhi recorded AQI levels exceeding 400 on Sunday.Visuals from the city reveal dense smog blanketing the skyline.In response, the Delhi government has enforced a ban on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel four-wheelers under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP-III) to curb emissions.The restriction came into effect on Friday and aims to mitigate the worsening pollution levels.As per the government directive, violators will face penalties under Section 194(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, which includes a fine of Rs 20,000.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) ordered the activation of GRAP-III across Delhi-NCR on Friday at 8 am, following a sharp spike in pollution levels that pushed Delhi's AQI into the 'severe' category.

'Alarming misuse of antibiotics by patients a serious concern',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/alarming-misuse-of-antibiotics-by-patients-a-serious-concern/articleshow/115376019.cms,"This misuse, coupled with a lack of awareness about antibiotic use, has made common infections harder to treat, posing a significant public health risk in India.

MUMBAI: A new city survey shows that many patients - almost six out of 10 - take antibiotics without medical consultation, despite research indicating that common bacteria such as E. coli have become lethal in Indian ICUs due to inappropriate use of medications. Not taking the right antibiotic in the right dosage for the right time period could result in certain bacteria developing resistance to the drug and give rise to drug-resistant infections .A study published in 'The Lancet' medical journal a few months ago said that resistant bacteria, also called superbugs, could kill nearly 40 million people over the next 25 years. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is hence listed as one of the major public health challenges in the world.A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, based at the University of Washington School of Medicine, estimated that in 2019 alone, India saw nearly 3 lakh deaths attributable to AMR and another 10 lakh deaths associated with AMR. ""People take antibiotics such as azithromycin and doxycycline like 'chana-kurmura' because their doctors prescribed it to them at some point for symptoms similar to what they have right now,"" said Infectious Diseases Specialist Dr Anita Mathew from Fortis Hospital, Mulund, who was part of the team that conducted the survey.Around 4,500 patients and their relatives visiting four Fortis Hospitals in the city were surveyed about their attitude towards antibiotics; 62% said they self-prescribed antibiotics when they had a common cold, throat pain, or flu. ""Antibiotics are not a one-size-fits-all solution; they need to be tailored based on the infection site and the bacteria we suspect. For conditions such as the flu, which is caused by a virus and not bacteria, antibiotics are not effective. Since flu is self-limiting, it typically resolves on its own without the need for antibiotics,"" added Dr Mathew.Her colleague from the Kalyan hospital, Dr Kirti Sabnis, said that around 71% of those surveyed were unaware of the differences between bacterial and viral infections. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, while antivirals and antifungals are used to treat viral and fungal infections respectively; misusing or wrongly using any of these medicines could contribute to the corresponding microbe becoming drug-resistant and emerging as superbugs.According to Professor Dr Mala Kaneria from BMC-run Nair Hospital near Mumbai Central railway station, the levels of antimicrobial resistance in the country are highly worrisome. ""We are now encountering patients with pan drug resistance as opposed to multidrug resistance, with none of the known antibiotics working for them,"" she said. Doctors have to work out or repurpose other drugs to save lives in ICU. ""There must be no ICU in the country without a case of pan or multi-drug-resistance,"" she said.Until 20 years ago, many bacteria could be treated with the drugs specifically designed for them. ""Pseudomonas aeruginosa has become a real cause for worry now, and Staphylococcus aureus has emerged as MRSA that is no longer easy to treat,"" added Dr Kaneria.The annual AMR report by the Indian Council of Medical Research said that diseases such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and typhoid have developed resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Analysing almost 1 lakh samples from over 200 hospitals across the country, the ICMR report found that the susceptibility of E. coli, the most common bacteria across OPDs and ICUs, to many antibiotics dropped by 10% to 20% between 2017 and 2023. The susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to antibiotics such as imipenem and meropenem has dropped in the same period.Dr Mathew said a patient in her eighties who was getting admitted with frequent infections passed away on Friday due to sepsis. ""As she was recently admitted for a urinary tract infection, we started her on high-end antibiotics right away this time around. We even put her on colistin, the last-resort antibiotic, but she succumbed,"" said the doctor. Dr Sabnis said that people's awareness and attitude have to change so that today's antibiotics are still effective for future generations. ""The problem is people look for quick fixes. They have a viral infection that would take a week to resolve, but they presume their body is a machine that can heal faster without rest. Even patients with diabetes want their infections to resolve within a day or two without realising that recovery could be longer for those with no baseline fitness,"" she added.","Six out of 10 patients in Mumbai take antibiotics without medical consultation. Misuse of antibiotics has made common infections harder to treat. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the major public health challenges in the world. In 2019 alone, India saw nearly 3 lakh deaths attributable to AMR.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115376071,imgsize-778730,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/115376071.jpg"

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said.

There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"Slash first, fix later: How Elon Musk prefers to cut costs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/slash-first-fix-later-how-elon-musk-prefers-to-cut-costs/articleshow/115374208.cms,"On a Saturday morning in December 2022, Elon Musk summoned finance executives at Twitter, which he had bought six weeks earlier, to a conference call. Then he drilled into a spreadsheet that contained the social media company's expenditures.Musk was angry, three people who were on the call said. Even though Twitter had just shed more than three-quarters of its employees - leaving it with just over 1,500 workers, down from nearly 8,000 - the company's spending still appeared to be out of control, the billionaire told attendees.Over the next six hours, Musk read out the spreadsheet line by line and asked workers to account for each item. He ordered some items - such as car services for executives - to be cut. At one point, he confronted an employee who was responsible for a multimillion-dollar contract related to website security and said his electric vehicle company, Tesla, spent far less on the same task. After the employee pushed back, Musk said she was no longer with Twitter.Frugal to a fault, the 53-year-old has been intimately involved in hacking down budgets at his companies, including Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter, which he renamed X. Perhaps most importantly, Musk has been unsentimental about the cuts, paying little regard to conventions. ""He used to be a deity,"" said Jim Cantrell, SpaceX's first VP of business development. ""But you know he's a business guy. He wants to cut everything to the bone.""Now Musk, with a net worth over $307 billion, is set to take his economising tactics to the federal govt. At a Trump rally in Oct, Musk promised to eliminate $2 trillion, or 30%, from the annual US budget.From his earliest days as a tech entrepreneur, Musk was allergic to costs. In 1995, after establishing his first business in Silicon Valley - a software company for newspapers called Zip2 - he slept in the office to avoid paying for an apartment and showered at a nearby YMCA.At SpaceX, he stripped out unnecessary components from rocket parts, simplifying them in a way that made them cheaper and faster to manufacture. Cantrell said he had once told Musk that the fuel tanks on the first rockets would cost $1 million or more. ""It so offended Elon,"" Cantrell said. SpaceX ultimately bought rolls of steel and welded pieces to build its own tanks for a few hundred thousand dollars.In 2010, SpaceX launched its Falcon 9 rocket, which costs about $550 million in inflation-adjusted dollars to manufacture. It is used for all of SpaceX's commercial launches. Nasa has estimated that the same system would have cost it as much as $4 billion to build. Musk's frugality not only saved SpaceX money but also created a commercial space boom. Getting a kilogram of cargo to orbit today costs about $2,600, compared with $65,000 on now-retired Nasa shuttle.At Tesla, his low-cost tactics helped make the company's electric vehicles profitable, while rivals lose money on every EV they sell.","Musk, 53, has been intimately involved in hacking down budgets at his companies, including Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter, which he renamed X.

A whistleblower report on the U.S. government's secret UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) program was made public, sparking a renewed discussion about the existence of extraterrestrial life and the potential government cover-ups surrounding these phenomena. The report, titled Immaculate Constellation, was released by Representative Nancy Mace and presented during a Congressional hearing held on the same day.The hearing was titled “Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth”, and it addressed several pressing questions about UAPs: Are we being observed by intelligent extraterrestrial life? Has the U.S. government been concealing evidence about UAPs? Has the government recovered any non-human biological materials from UAPs? And most critically, does the U.S. possess any UAPs?In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Representative Mace raised pointed questions: “If UAPs don’t exist, why are taxpayer dollars being spent on something that isn’t real? And if they do exist, why is this information being deliberately hidden from the public?” These questions set the stage for an intense session where whistleblowers testified, some making alarming claims about the U.S. government's handling of UAP data and technology.The hearing featured testimony from four key figures—Luis Elizondo, a former Department of Defense official; Tim Gallaudet, a retired rear admiral of the U.S. Navy; Michael Shellenberger, a journalist and founder of Public news outlet; and Michael Gold, a former NASA official. All four agreed that the U.S. government is deliberately concealing information about UAPs. They suggested that certain UAPs could represent non-human intelligence and that the U.S. might possess advanced technologies that are not of this world.At a recent UAP hearing , Luis Elizondo, a key advocate for UAP transparency, firmly stated that ""UAPs are real"" and described how these phenomena, potentially linked to non-human intelligence, are monitoring sensitive military sites globally. He argued that the U.S. government has recovered UAP technologies, and other nations may possess them, while criticising the secrecy surrounding UAP programs.Retired Navy rear admiral Tim Gallaudet shared his 2015 encounter with a UAP during a naval exercise, highlighting the ""Go Fast"" video that showed an object exhibiting flight characteristics beyond known military technology. He emphasised that key UAP information is hidden in classified programs.Journalist Michael Shellenberger referred to comments by Presidents Trump and Obama, both suggesting the U.S. government holds undisclosed UAP information. He called for bipartisan transparency, arguing that the public has a right to know the truth, especially if UAPs pose a national security threat.Michael Gold, a former NASA official, highlighted the stigma that has long surrounded discussions of UAPs. He called on government agencies and the scientific community to overcome this stigma and open up to the possibility of scientific inquiry into the nature of UAPs. Gold echoed the famous phrase, “The truth is out there,” urging society to be brave enough to confront the possibility that humanity might not be alone in the universe.The 2024 hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) built on earlier testimonies from military figures, including retired Navy pilot Ryan Graves and intelligence officer David Grusch, who had previously shared their experiences with UAPs.Graves, a former F/A-18 pilot, described multiple encounters with UAPs exhibiting advanced capabilities like supersonic speeds and the ability to hover in strong winds. He highlighted an incident in 2014 near Virginia Beach, where he and other pilots observed a mysterious object — a dark grey or black cube within a clear sphere — performing impossible manoeuvres. Graves raised concerns about underreporting and the withholding of critical information on these phenomena.David Grusch, a retired intelligence officer who had worked on the UAP task force, made explosive claims, stating that the U.S. government possessed crashed UAPs and potentially non-human biological material. Grusch revealed that he had interviewed over 40 witnesses and uncovered a multi-decade program focused on retrieving and reverse-engineering UAPs. He also suggested that some individuals had been harmed or threatened to suppress information on these technologies.Retired Navy Commander David Fravor recounted his famous 2004 encounter with a Tic-Tac-shaped UAP off the coast of California, which was later captured in Pentagon-released footage. Fravor described the UAP as having no visible flight controls and performing impossible manoeuvres, travelling at extreme speeds and defying the laws of physics. He emphasised that the object’s capabilities far surpassed anything the U.S. military currently possesses, suggesting it was not from any known nation.Fravor also emphasised that the technology witnessed in the Tic-Tac incident could represent a potential national security threat, given its capabilities far exceeded anything that the U.S. military possessed at the time. Fravor expressed awe at the object's performance but also voiced serious concerns about what it might mean for national security, warning that the technology involved could be far beyond anything the U.S. or its adversaries currently control.The testimonies of these whistleblowers, along with the release of the Immaculate Constellation report, have reignited public interest in UAPs and their potential implications for national security. While many of the questions surrounding these phenomena remain unanswered, the hearing underscored the growing demand for transparency and for the U.S. government to declassify critical data about UAPs. The revelations have set the stage for what could be a significant shift in our understanding of not just UAPs, but also the broader cosmic context in which humanity exists. The truth, as these whistleblowers have insisted, may well be out there—waiting to be uncovered.","The 2024 hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) built on earlier testimonies from military figures, including retired Navy pilot Ryan Graves and intelligence officer David Grusch.
