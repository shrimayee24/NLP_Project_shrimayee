NEW DELHI: Operation Sindoor against Pakistan in May was just an ""88-hour trailer"" without the film actually beginning, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said Monday, warning that the Indian armed forces were fully ready to ""teach"" the western adversary ""how to behave responsibly"" if the need arose in future.General Dwivedi also said relations between India and China have improved a lot since Oct last year after dialogue among the leaders of the two nations to usher in ""normalcy"", with military commanders on the ground also regularly meeting to resolve local issues.Addressing a curtain raiser event of the Chanakya Defence Dialogue, the Army chief delivered a stern message to Pakistan by stressing that as per the ""new normal"" India will continue to consider terrorists and their supporters alike.""Blood and water cannot flow together. Talks and terror cannot go together. India focuses on progress and prosperity. If someone creates obstacles in our path, then we will have to take some action against them,"" he added.Alluding to Pakistan's nuclear sabre-rattling, General Dwivedi said ""India is in a position today where it is not scared of any blackmailing"". India has the political will and military capabilities, which are increasing by the day, for the requisite deterrence, he said.""Deterrence works only when the adversary believes you will act the way you warn them...the other side takes your resolve seriously. Today, our deterrence is working,"" he said. On lessons learnt from Op Sindoor, General Dwivedi stressed the importance of integration among the Army, IAF, Navy and other forces, the need for timely decision-making at every level of the command chain, and ensuring proper ammunition and other supplies for even long-drawn out battles.He said the situation in J&K has improved significantly after the scrapping of Article 370 in Aug 2019. ""After this, political clarity has come. There has been a huge decline in terrorism...,"" he said, adding that of the 31 militants eliminated this year, over 60% were of Pakistani-origin.","General Dwivedi also said relations between India and China have improved a lot since Oct last year.

NEW DELHI: Amid a threat of additional levies for trade ties with Russia, an official on Monday said that countries will decide on trade based on their interests.""...for each country, trade with other countries is based on their bilateral relationship, (it is) based on their economic requirement and these carry on. In addition, every country will have a perspective. I don't think our trade decisions will be guided by that (higher tariffs),"" the official said.The comments came after US President Donald Trump threatened on Sunday to ""very severely sanction"" countries that maintain trade ties with Russia as he sought to mount further pressure on Moscow. Even as it negotiates a trade deal with the US and navigates through a 50% tariff, due to Russian oil purchases, govt has maintained that it will keep the country's economic interest paramount.On Monday, a senior official said India and the US were nearing closure of talks for the first tranche which will focus on the proposed bilateral trade deal, covering reciprocal and other tariffs. ""But it is difficult to put a deadline since final closure is most difficult,"" the official added.India is looking for easing of the reciprocal tariff of 25% imposed on a bulk of its exports to the US as well as removal of an additional 25% secondary tariffs due to oil purchases from Russia.""When you address reciprocal tariffs, you will have to address both, then it will have an impact...The US can decide whether the secondary tariffs go first or are part of the deal,"" the official said.The trade agreement, which is to be signed by Fall, is likely to include multiple packages, with the initial one focused on trade. While six rounds of negotiations have taken place, officials had recently said that now an announcement is awaited as the talks are ""largely complete"".""The idea is to address our tariff issues and their concerns on market access,"" the official said, adding that the part on reciprocal tariffs will be sorted out soon.","US President Donald Trump threatened on Sunday to ""very severely sanction"" countries that maintain trade ties with Russia.

"Mumbai CNG mayhem: After autos, taxis and school buses, BEST fleet might go off roads today — all you need to know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cng-crisis-disrupts-public-transport-causes-commuter-inconvenience-in-mumbai/articleshow/125391564.cms,"CNG crisis disrupts public transport, causes commuter inconvenience in Mumbai

(With inputs from Manoj Badgeri, Richa Pinto, and B B Nayak)

MUMBAI: A day after the damage to a gas pipeline in Chembur, several Mumbaikars faced the inconvenience of not getting autos, taxis, private cabs, and school buses on Monday as operations of several CNG refuelling stations in MMR remained shut.The situation may worsen on Tuesday as 44% of the BEST bus fleet running on CNG could be off the roads too, thereby crippling the city's road lifeline. This is apart from several autos and taxis being unavailable, said transportation sources. The crisis also affected owners of the more than 500,000 private CNG cars in the region.An MGL spokesperson said domestic PNG (cooking gas) would not be impacted though. ""Currently, out of MGL's total 389 gas stations, 225 are operating. The rectification work is in progress, and the restoration of gas supply is expected by Tuesday noon,"" she added.BEST operated its fleet of CNG buses on Monday as they refuelled at Anik depot on Sunday night, but there was no more fuel left for buses on Monday night, an official said. Most aggregator cabs such as Ola and Uber had the option to switch to dual fuel and run on petrol, but riders were impacted by surge fares as high as 2x in many areas.The CNG crisis began Sunday afternoon after ""third-party damage"" to the gas pipeline of GAIL India Ltd at RCF terminal, Chembur, resulting in the supply to Mahanagar Gas Ltd's (MGL) station in Wadala being disconnected.School Bus Owners' Association president Anil Garg said 2,000 school buses in MMR ply on CNG and they were off the roads, due to which students suffered. Several school buses have switched from diesel to CNG in recent years. Andheri resident Suheil Merchant said, ""My wife had a harrowing time dropping my little one to the class, as she had to walk back from Vile Parle West to Andheri West. The school van operator also cancelled today's pick-up and drop for the afternoon school. """"Share autos operating for Bandra-Kurla Complex from Kurla and Bandra stations were fleecing us with exorbitant fares of Rs 50-60 per passenger, citing the CNG crisis,"" said Vijay Bhandari, an office-goer. Autos and taxis, which were plying, demanded excess fares while those outside pumps waited in 1-2 km long queues with other CNG vehicles, with drivers uncertain when refuelling would resume. ""I have been waiting since 5:30am outside a Bhandup pump and it is 1pm, and there is so much confusion, with nobody telling us the timeline when services will restart,"" said Ashwin Surve, an auto driver.Aditi Chatterjee from Chembur said she was among several commuters unable to get an auto on Monday, and she walked 1.5km from where she got public transport. In the absence of autos, the BEST buses ran packed, but many were unable to catch these buses and people walked. ""I stay 7km away from the station and depend on autos for travel. Tuesday morning will be painful with no autos,"" said Mukul Tiwari, a Thane resident.Petrol Dealers' Association president Chetan Modi said on Sunday, gas supply was restored at 70% of pumps around 9-10pm. ""We had a long queue outside our pump after which the police were called and the supply was stopped at midnight. We resumed supply in the morning for some time, but the pressure of gas was low and had to shut completely,"" he said.Mumbai Rickshawmen's Union president Thampy Kurien said the MGL should have arranged for alternate gas supply such as one from Mahape so that in such a crisis situation, they can switch to the second line and keep autos, taxis, and other vehicles running across the city. ""We had demanded this through our petitions in the past."" He added that there was a daily loss in earnings of Rs 400 to Rs 1,500 per driver for autos-taxis, with the city having nearly 20,000 taxis and 300,000 autos in Greater Mumbai alone.Mumbai Autorickshawmen's Union leader Shashank Rao said the crisis affected peak hour commuters the most and the issue may worsen if it prolongs on Tuesday, and may lead to law and order problems outside pumps. Police were deployed in a few areas to keep check at pumps.In Thane, as only one of the four MGL-operated pumps in the city at Khopat was operating, many motorists queued up with few complaining of having waited for several hours with no luck. The Thane municipal transport fleet that has around 25-30% fleet operating on CNG said the situation would be manageable till Tuesday morning.Navi Mumbai faced a major disruption in CNG supply, causing significant inconvenience for motorists over the past two days. Satyam Upadhyay, a cab operator from Ghansoli, said he was unable to work since Sunday while monitoring news about supply restoration. The shortage resulted in serpentine queues at filling stations across the city, leaving many drivers without business.","The situation may worsen on Tuesday as 44% of the BEST bus fleet running on CNG could be off the roads.

What It Means For Indian Workers

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: India remained the largest source of international students in the US in 2024-25, with 3,63,019 students registered on American campuses - a 10% rise over last year. The increase is slower than 2023-24's dizzying 23% jump.Tougher visa scrutiny, longer appointment queues and jitters over work-visa routes have done little to dent India's presence on American campuses. China, once the unchallenged frontrunner, continued to slide for the fifth straight year, this time by 4% to touch 2,65,919 students. Overall, international student enrolment in the US from across the globe dropped 7% and early signals hint at gathering headwinds. The Fall 2025 Snapshot reports a 1% dip in overall international numbers and a 17% plunge in new arrivals.Indian students spent a total of $14 billion for their education, stay and other expenses in the US, almost matching China's spend of $14.6 billion, the highest by any nation. In 2023-24, Indians had spent $11.8 billion.In 2024-25, undergraduate enrolments (see box) from India rose 11%, but graduate numbers, traditionally India's strongest stream, fell 9.5%.Optional Practical Training, that allows graduates to gain practical work experience after academic study, surged 47%. Globally, the number of new international students entering US institutions in the Fall of 2024 fell 7%, with new undergraduates up 5% but new graduate entrants down 15%. Data on Indian students showed that 63% enrolled in public institutions and 37% opted for private institutes. They mostly went to campuses in Texas, New York, Massachusetts, California and Illinois.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan told TOI, ""Wherever Indian students go, they excel - not by chance, but by capability and character."" He added, ""Our youth are driving global classrooms, research labs, and innovation economies with the same confidence with which they are shaping India's own growth story.""""International students come to the US to advance their education and contribute to US colleges and communities,"" said Jason Czyz, Institute of International Education (IIE) president and CEO.""This data highlights the impact international students have in driving innovation, advancing scholarship, and strengthening cross-cultural understanding.""International students account for 6% of the total US higher education population. International students contributed nearly $55 billion to the US economy in 2024, according to the US department of commerce, and supported more than 3.5 lakh jobs across the US, according to NAFSA. The US remains the top destination for international students globally.Twelve of the top 25 countries sending international students reached their largest totals to date - Bangladesh, Canada, Colombia, Ghana, India, Italy, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Spain, and Vietnam.For the upcoming admission season, US institutions are prioritising undergraduate outreach in Vietnam (55% of institutions which participated in the Snapshot survey), India (49%), Brazil (39%), and South Korea (39%).Colleges and universities focusing on graduate recruitment are as follows: India (57%), Vietnam (32%), China (28%), and Bangladesh (28%).The Snapshot Survey of Open Doors 2025 reveals an increase in undergraduates (+2%) and a decline in graduate (-12%) students.

Isro is set to launch seven more satellites, including the liftoff of a PSLV rocket made entirely by the industry in the current financial year.The Isro chief said the Chandrayaan-4 mission will be India's most complex lunar endeavour yet. “We are targeting 2028 for Chandrayaan-4,” he said. Chandrayaan-4 is also called LUPEX (Lunar Polar Exploration Mission) and is a joint programme between Isro and Japan's space agency Jaxa. The LUPEX project is aimed at exploring the Moon for water and other resources and gaining expertise in exploring the surface of the Moon. “Acquiring technologies needed for rovers and landers to operate in the harsh lunar environment is very important for pursuing space exploration,” said Jaxa.Narayanan said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has directed Isro to work towards sending Indian astronauts to the lunar surface and bringing them back safely by 2040. India’s planning for a manned lunar mission comes against the backdrop of the US gearing up to send crewed missions to the Moon under the Artemis programme, most probably next year, and China setting a 2030 target for its first crewed landing on the Moon.On the Gaganyaan mission, Narayanan said only the timeframe for uncrewed missions has been shifted, and there is no change in the manned mission schedule. “The uncrewed mission was targeted for 2025. The crewed mission was always planned for 2027, and we are holding on to that date,” he said.Narayanan said Isro has also begun work on Bharatiya Antariksha Station, targeted for completion by 2035. “The first of the five modules will be placed in orbit by 2028,” he said. The mission, if successful, will make India the third country to operate a space station -- the US-led multi-country station ISS is nearing the end of life and will be deorbited in year 2030 and China's Tiangong station is moving into full gear.",The Chandrayaan-4 mission will be India's most complex lunar endeavour yet.

LUCKNOW/KANPUR: Investigators are racing to close the arc of a Jaish-e-Mohammed project they said was years in the making - one that turned a campus doctor into ""Madam Surgeon"" of a cross-border terrorist blueprint.The alleged architect linking these threads is 43-year-old Dr Shaheen Shahid - ""Madam Surgeon"" in the underground lexicon of the JeM module of medics accused of the Nov 10 New Delhi car blast and preparing coordinated terrorist strikes on six cities, investigators said.Investigators described Shaheen, arrested in Faridabad, as a key asset. Seized digital evidence, handwritten diaries and planning notes - now central to the case - describe a plan for a Dec 6 strike aimed at ""avenging"" the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition The papers outline ""D-6 Mission"", target lists, recruitment pitches, fund movements and secure communication protocols. Investigators also identified roles assigned to Kashmiri doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Umar Un Nabi, alongside Shaheen, who allegedly joined a deeper JeM-backed structure in 2021.The probe has allegedly uncovered an Rs 20-lakh hawala channel routed through a JeM handler for operational use by Umar, Muzammil and Shaheen - money suspected to have funded recruitment, safe houses, secure phones and reconnaissance.Agencies have begun an audit of Shaheen's financial footprint, scrutinising every high-value transfer, cash withdrawal and unexplained deposit across her three Kanpur accounts, two Lucknow accounts and two Delhi accounts. The hunt: any tie to the foreign-funded module.Teams are also reconstructing Shaheen's movements in Kanpur, especially at GSVM Medical College, where she worked until her unexplained disappearance. Officials are collecting entry logs, duty rosters, visitor lists and details of where she stayed between Jan and Oct 2025. Colleagues remembered a soft-spoken doctor from Lucknow who rarely took leave, brought her young child to duty because there was ""no one at home"", and avoided speaking about her divorce. She lived in an L-Block campus residence, maintained cordial ties with women co-workers, and vanished in Dec 2013 after handing over HOD responsibilities, promising to return by Jan 4, 2014. She never did. For nearly a year, official letters went unanswered. In 2016, two staffers sent to her registered address found it incorrect. She was formally dismissed in 2021.Interrogations showed that in March 2022, the module travelled to Turkiye for a meeting with ISI handler Abu Ukasha, allegedly securing a ""green signal"" for the Dec 6 plan. The timeline under reconstruction spans 2010 ideological drift, 2015-16 induction into JeM circles, and structured planning from 2021 as part of a project backed by Pakistan-based handlers.A former GSVM staffer recalled her transformation beginning around 2010 after contact with an Indian-origin doctor abroad who shared ideological videos and literature. She soon adopted new attire, including a hijab, and repeatedly spoke of relocating overseas.According to officials, her ideological shift was unmistakable by 2021. When confronted by a relative about abandoning her marriage, job and family, she allegedly said: ""I have lived enough for myself. Now, it's time to repay the debt of my community.""","Investigators describe Dr Shaheen Shahid, arrested in Faridabad, as a key asset.

By a common order, the IPAB had dismissed both petitions saying there was nothing so similar in the trademarks as to confuse consumers.However, on Nov 7, a division bench of Madras HC ordered rectification of 'Original Choice' trademark for its similarities with 'Officer's choice'. This was challenged before SC, where bottles of various shapes and tetra packs were shown to the bench.With advocates Harish Salve, A M Singhvi and N K Kaul representing Allied Blenders pitted against Mukul Rohatgi and Shyam Divan appearing for John Distillers, the bench asked, ""Despite the ferocious fighting in different forums, is there a chance of compromise?""With both parties agreeing to attempt a compromise through mediation, the bench requested retired SC judge L Nageswara Rao to act as a mediator to reach an amicable settlement over the high-spirited dispute over the label on whisky products of both companies.","The case involved Allied Blenders, which manufactures 'Officer's Choice', and John Distillers, which markets its whisky under the brand name 'Original Choice' Both companies have more than Rs 30,000 crore of sales and that in Karnataka alone tetra packs account for 65% of the business.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125394992,imgsize-929235,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday issued a travel advisory after Iran suspended its visa-waiver facility for ordinary Indian passport holders. The suspension takes effect on November 22, 2025, from when Indian nationals will be required to obtain a visa to enter or transit through Iran.The move follows multiple incidents in which Indian nationals were allegedly lured to Iran on false job promises or assurances of onward travel to other countries.According to the MEA, several Indian nationals were deceived with fake job offers or promises of onward travel to third countries and were encouraged to use Iran’s visa-free entry to make the journey. Once they arrived, many were reportedly kidnapped for ransom.""The attention of Government has been drawn to several incidents of Indian nationals being lured to Iran on false promises of employment or with assurances of onward transit to third countries. These individuals were tricked into journeying to Iran by taking advantage of the visa waiver facility available for ordinary Indian passport holders. On arrival in Iran, many of them were kidnapped for ransom,"" the MEA said through a statement.In response, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has halted the visa-free entry provision to prevent further misuse.The MEA has strongly advised Indians planning to travel to Iran to ""remain vigilant"" and to avoid any agents offering visa-free entry or transit arrangements via Iran.Earlier this year, a 26-year-old man from Karala in northwest Delhi was reportedly kidnapped and held in Iran. The victim, Himanshu Mathur, was detained for a week and released after his family paid a ransom of Rs 20 lakh.Mathur was reportedly kidnapped and held in Iran after being lured with promises of a job and Australian work visa. He initially contacted Aman Rathi, who convinced him to complete a 15-day course in Noida and later arranged for him to travel to Jakarta and then Tehran. Instead of proceeding to Australia, Mathur and Rathi were abducted in Chabahar and held by a gang.In a separate case, a young man from Amritsar, who had hoped to move to the United Kingdom, reportedly fell victim to an international visa scam and was held hostage in Iran.

NEW DELHI: Reiterating the “collective commitment” of the Narendra Modi government to eliminating terrorism from its root, home minister Amit Shah on Monday said culprits of the Nov 10 car bomb blast in Delhi shall be traced from the depths of the netherworld, produced before the judicial system and handed the strictest possible punishment.Addressing the 32nd meeting of the northern zonal council (NZC) in Faridabad, Haryana — attended by chief ministers, Lieutenant Governors and administrators of several northern states — Shah said the zonal councils, which are sub-groups of the Inter-State Council that meet from time to time to resolve inter-state and Centre-state issues, have played an important role in realising Prime Minister Modi’s vision of strong nation made up of strong states. These zonal councils, he underlined, are extremely important for dialogue, cooperation, coordination, and ‘policy synergy’.During the meeting, Shah, along with the chief ministers of Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, J&K, Rajasthan and Delhi; LGs of J&K, Delhi and Ladakh; and the administrator of Chandigarh, observed two minutes' silence as a tribute to the victims of the Delhi car bomb blast and the recent explosion at Nowgam police station in J&K.Emphasising the continued need for all-out efforts to ensure speedy justice in crimes against women and children and also eradicate malnutrition and stunting, Shah called for speedy investigation in cases of sexual offences and rape under the POCSO Act, besides seeking an increase in the number of fast-track special courts.Referring to the implementation of the three new criminal laws, the home minister said that their enforcement has yielded very positive results. He requested all the state/UT governments to employ technology to boost investigation and forensic analysis and achieve online linking of courts.The home minister said that while the original spirit and role of zonal councils is advisory, they have been accepted over the past decade as action-oriented platforms that have delivered results.Shah said that, as compared to 2004–2014, the number of zonal council meetings has risen two-and-a-half times from 25 in 2014 to 64 in 2025. He said this jump reflects “PM Modi’s concept of TEAM Bharat”. He credited the states, UTs, central ministries and departments and the Inter-State Council for having discussed 1,600 issues and resolving 1,303 issues (81.43%) thus far.Among the issues of national importance taken up by the northern zonal council on Monday are urban master planning, power supply system, strengthening of primary agricultural credit societies (PACSs), eliminating malnutrition in children, reducing school dropout rates, and participation of public hospitals in the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.","Home minister Amit Shah said culprits of the Nov 10 car bomb blast in Delhi shall be traced from the depths of the netherworld.

So, this is a continuous process,” Agrawal noted after inaugurating a taxpayers’ lounge at the India International Trade Fair.According to official data updated till November 10, refund outgo has fallen around 18% year-on-year to over Rs 2.42 lakh crore, a drop Agrawal said may reflect lower claims and rationalised TDS rates.The CBDT Chairman said the department is also pushing to reduce litigation in direct tax matters. “Our appellate authorities are working overtime to ensure that pendency is liquidated,” he said.

Visa Breach Ends India Visit for Blacklisted UK Scholar and Hindi Literature Expert Francesca Orsini





: PoK-origin UK home secretary Shabana Mahmood announced Monday that Trump-style visa bans will be imposed on countries unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants, as she revealed further sweeping reforms to tackle illegal immigration.The first countries to face such a ban are Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo whose nationals will no longer be granted UK visas unless their govts rapidly improve cooperation on removals. “These countries face penalties for their unacceptably low co-operation and obstructive returns processes. Thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from these nations are currently in the UK,” the home office said.Non-cooperation includes embassies failing to process removals paperwork in time and requiring individuals to sign their own documentation — allowing them to block their own deportation.India is thought to be one of several other countries most resistant to taking back illegal migrants and could join the list over the coming year, the Times (UK) reported.Human rights laws will also be overhauled to scale up deportations and prevent migrants from “gaming the system”.UK’s govt will legislate to reform how Article 8 (the right to family and private life) is interpreted by the courts to make clear a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child — blocking people from using dubious connections to stay in the UK. It will also work with partners at the Council of Europe to address the “over-expansive application” of Article 3 (protection against inhuman and degrading treatments) which migrants are also using to block their removal and introduce new legislation to crack down on “migrants making last-minute bogus modern slavery claims”. Migrants will be restricted to arguing all legal grounds within a single appeal and, if they lose, they will be forced to leave.New capped work and study routes for genuine refugees will be created who will be referred through partners such as the UNHCR. British people will be encouraged to house them, as they have done for Ukrainians, to end the reliance on asylum hotels, which cost £2.1 billion in 2024-2025.In the year ending June 2025 a total of 5,475 Indian nationals claimed asylum in the UK making them the sixth-largest nationality. Of these, 346 Indians arrived by small boat illegally. The other Indians were mostly on visas, with student visas being the most common. The top nationality to claim asylum was Pakistani; followed by nationals from Afghanistan, Iran, Eritrea and Bangladesh.Only 20 Indians were granted asylum in the year ending June 2025, and 2,691 had their claims refused.","Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo will face visa bans unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants.

Indian-origin venture capitalist Asha Jadeja Motwani claimed she is behind President Donald Trump's changed stance on H-1B, the visa program that allows US tech companies to hire skilled workers from foreign countries, including India.

Her husband Rajeev Motwani was an Indian-American professor of computer science at Stanford University.Asha Motwani said the Trump-Vance administration is open to good ideas but not enough HNI (high net worth individuals) Indian-Americans are pursuing the Indian-American issue. ""I spent the weekend in Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach and got unusual access to the president with very little effort. I wish there were more people doing this alongside me.

This does not fly with me anymore. I have lost respect for some friends who on the pretext of “not liking Trump & Vance” are doing a diddley squat for India or US. It is in American geopolitical and economic interest that India is in the American pocket and not with anybody else. We in the diaspora can make this happen and we must put in our effort,"" Motwani wrote.In his latest FOX interview, Trump said America needs certain types of talent as he was speaking on the H-1B issue.

Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi





Google has announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027, marking one of its largest US infrastructure commitments to date. The funds, the company said will go toward building new cloud and AI infrastructure, including new data center campuses in Armstrong County and Haskell County. Google CEO shared an online post, announcing the investment. “Today, we're announcing a new $40B investment in Texas through 2027 to build Cloud & AI infrastructure and support thousands of new jobs,” he wrote in the post.“This includes new data centers in Armstrong and Haskell Counties and a major investment to strengthen energy resilience and abundance. We're also providing funding to more than double the projected pipeline of new Texan electricians to power the AI era,” he added.“We've proudly called Texas home for 15 years. Thank you @GregAbbott_TX for your continued support,” Pichai continued.As part of the $40 billion investment, Google said it will continue its approach of growing infrastructure responsibly, which includes adding new clean energy resources to the Texas grid and covering the costs tied to its operations. The company also announced a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund to help scale community energy-efficiency projects across the state.Google also confirmed it has secured more than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity through power-purchase agreements with energy developers. One of the new Haskell County data centers will be built alongside a solar and battery storage plant, reinforcing the company’s push toward cleaner, more reliable energy resources.In order to support construction of the new facilities, Google will help expand Texas’ pool of skilled electrical workers. In partnership with the electrical training ALLIANCE, the company will help train existing electricians and more than 1,700 apprentices by 2030, more than doubling the state’s expected pipeline of new electricians.Google said the investment is meant not only to bolster Texas’ workforce and infrastructure, but to help ensure the U.S. maintains “the technical backbone to lead the world in AI.”","Google has announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella quotes Bill Gates to explain what makes a true AI platform; Elon Musk responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-quotes-bill-gates-to-explain-what-makes-a-true-ai-platform-elon-musk-responds/articleshow/125362427.cms,"

Nadella says Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI is an example of zero-sum mindset industry





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently shared a post explaining what he believes defines a real artificial intelligence (AI) platform — and he turned to a well-known idea from Bill Gates to make his point. In a detailed post on X (formerly Twitter), Nadella said tech companies should focus on building AI systems that create more value for the people and businesses using them, not just for the companies that make the technology. He cited Bill Gates to emphasize the same: “A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that creates it.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to Nadella's post with a facepalm emoji.Nadella said this idea matters even more during the current AI boom, where many firms risk giving away too much of their own value to big tech platforms. “The real question is how to empower every company out there to build their own AI-native capabilities,” he wrote.Nadella pointed to Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI as an example of how a “positive-sum” approach can work. “Our investment helped them scale; their research accelerated our own innovation,” he said, adding that both companies benefited by improving each other’s products and infrastructure.Nadella also highlighted the companies involved in building Microsoft’s new AI infrastructure. He said the world’s first “AI superfactory” — recently announced by Microsoft and OpenAI — was developed using learnings from three generations of AI supercomputers and through close collaboration with Nvidia.He added that Microsoft has now integrated AMD chips as well, giving startups and enterprises more options for training and running their AI models.The Microsoft CEO said the real test of the AI era will not be tech valuations but whether industries like healthcare, manufacturing, education and agriculture see real-world gains. “When a pharma company uses AI to bring a new therapy to market in one year instead of twelve… that’s when we’ll know the system is working,” he said.He urged companies to avoid “zero-sum thinking” and warned them to protect their own data and value instead of relying solely on partnerships that may turn “extractive” over time.Nadella concluded by saying the industry has an opportunity to ensure AI benefits are widely spread — a lesson, he noted, that comes from past waves of technology where some sectors, like local media, were left behind.",Satya Nadella says tech companies should focus on building AI systems that create more value for the people and businesses using them.

Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India

Competing with SpaceX's dominance









Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin achieved a historic milestone by successfully landing its massive New Glenn rocket booster on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean, prompting congratulations from rival SpaceX CEO Elon Musk . The successful landing marks a pivotal moment in the commercial space race, making Blue Origin only the second company after SpaceX to master the complex technology of landing orbital-class rocket boosters for reuse.“Congratulations @JeffBezos and the @BlueOrigin team!"" Musk wrote on social media in a response to Blue Origin’s announcement.In a separate post, Musk replied to a post shared by Jeff Bezos who shared a video clip of the New Glenn rocket booster landing in the middle of a platform floating in the ocean.The New Glenn booster, standing over 320 feet tall and powered by seven advanced BE-4 engines, touched down on the droneship Jacklyn just minutes after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 3:55 PM EST. The landing followed the successful deployment of NASA's twin ESCAPADE satellites on a mission to study Mars’s atmospheric loss and solar wind interactions.“We achieved full mission success today, and I am so proud of the team. Never before in history has a booster this large nailed the landing on the second try. This is just the beginning as we rapidly scale our flight cadence and continue delivering for our customers,” said Dave Limp, Blue Origin's CEO.The achievement represents a significant breakthrough in Blue Origin's efforts to compete with SpaceX, which has long dominated the reusable rocket market with its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles. Reusability reduces launch costs by allowing expensive first-stage boosters to be recovered, refurbished, and flown multiple times rather than discarded after a single use.Blue Origin’s New Glenn is designed for up to 25 reuses, promising to bring competitive pricing and reliability to deep space and orbital missions. The company has already secured multiple years of orders from customers including NASA, Amazon's Project Kuiper, AST SpaceMobile, and several telecommunications providers.","The New Glenn booster, standing over 320 feet tall and powered by seven advanced BE-4 engines, touched down on the droneship Jacklyn just minutes after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has declared that the next decade represents a period of immense historical consequence, arguing that the coming 10 years will have a greater determination over the next 100 years than any prior era due to the arrival of non-human intelligence, or artificial intelligence (AI). Schmidt compared the emergence of AI to fundamental inventions in human history, such as electricity or the invention of fire, stressing its revolutionary power.“We are fortunate to be living in a time of great historical consequence,” Schmidt said in a virtual interview recently. He emphasised that the new AI tools are very powerful because they can “equal and, in some cases, surpass human intelligence,"" which is the source of societal growth and innovation.""The countries and companies that embrace this non-human intelligence correctly and aggressively will be the big winners,"" Schmidt stated.Conversely, he warned that companies and countries that slow their adoption or allow others to lead will fall behind, as economic growth and leadership are derived from the application of intelligence to solve new problems.“And the companies and countries that slow or let other people do it, they will lose because the source of excellence, the source of leadership, the source of growth, the source of everything, the source of innovation…everything..ofeconomic growth comes from the application of intelligence to discover new things to solve new problems,” he said.Schmidt also sounded a major geopolitical alarm, naming the potential global dominance of Chinese open-source AI models as one of his “biggest fears” for the future of the technology.Speaking on the Moonshots podcast this week, Schmidt highlighted a growing divergence in the global AI landscape:US Models: Primarily closed-source and costly.Chinese Models: Largely open-source and free.“The geopolitical issue there, of course, is that open source is free and the closed source models are not free,” Schmidt explained. He concluded that this open-source versus closed-source divide is becoming a significant geopolitical fault line in the global AI race","Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has declared that the next decade represents a period of immense historical consequence.

The Labour Commissioner office in Pune has summoned Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in matters filed by the IT industry employees union, Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES). In its complaint, NITES alleged unlawful terminations and layoffs by TCS. NITES shared the same in a post on microblogging website, Twitter. In July, TCS announced plans to fire 2% of its global workforce — or 12,000 employees — over the year amid macro uncertainties and AI-led disruptions.""The Labour Commissioner Office, Pune has issued summons to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in multiple matters filed by NITES concerning illegal termination of employment and unlawful layoffs.

A room full of startup founders and investors at the world's biggest AI conference votes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI among 'likely flops',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-biggest-ai-conference-votes-sam-altmans-openai-among-likely-flops/articleshow/125364076.cms,"Representative Image

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’





OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference.

Jefferies has an underperform rating on Tata Motors PV with the target price at Rs 300. Analysts said the company reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and taxes (EBITDA) loss in the July-Sept quarter (Q2FY26), dragged by cyberattack at JLR. Cyberattack-related disruptions continue in Q3FY26 and should normalize by Q4FY26. Nevertheless, analysts see multiple headwinds for JLR including increased competition and consumption tax in China, high discounts, and BEV transition, while its key models are starting to age. India PV is better placed but is unlikely to offset JLR drag.Kotak Institutional Equities has a buy rating on GMR Airports with the target price raised to Rs 107. Analysts said that in Q2FY26 the company reported a very strong uptick in non-aero metrics, suggesting effects of increased retail area at Delhi and Hyderabad airports. This resulted in 6% of the 12% beat in Q2FY26, with the rest of it driven largely by a transitory factor. Leverage has dropped below 6X and will further come down as non-aero revenues continue to grow in mid-teens and passenger growth returns in H2FY26.Morgan Stanley has Hero MotoCorp to overweight with the target price at Rs 6,471. Analysts said that the company’s market-share declines have bottomed with gains in scooters, EVs and premium bikes. GST-led price cuts reviving entry-level demand with festive volumes up 17%. Improved mix and lower EV losses support margin expansion toward 15.3% by FY28. They also said the stock’s valuations were attractive versus its peers, and a dividend yield of over 3% adds support. They also flagged ABS norms in FY27 as key risk.Nomura has a buy rating on LG Electronics with the target price at Rs 1,900. Analysts said that the company is a play on affordable premiumization in the durables segment. Its Q2FY26 numbers were slightly below estimates while new launches, B2B, export push and localization remain growth and margin tailwinds for the company. They pointed out that the LG management said it has gained market share across categories, and in Q3FY26, premium appliances are leading recovery, especially for large screen sizes. At current valuations the stock looks attractive, given an estimated 24% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for earnings per share (EPS) over FY26-FY28.CLSA has a high conviction outperform rating on Apollo Tyres with the target price raised to Rs 650 from Rs 586 earlier. Analysts said that in Q2FY26 the company’s standalone gross margin (GM) expanded 140 basis points (100 basis points = 1 percentage point) on a quarterly basis (QoQ) led by softening of raw material costs, which are expected to soften further in the coming quarters. EBITDA margin was up 164 basis points QoQ to 15.3%. Analysts are confident that the company could achieve a standalone EBITDA margin of more than 16% in H2FY26. They said the company’s EU volumes grew by 4% on the year despite a challenging environment and EBITDA margin for the EU operations improved by 190 basis points QoQ to 12.7%. They are building in 5%/8% revenue CAGRs for the standalone/EU operations in FY25-FY27.","Jefferies has an underperform rating on Tata Motors PV with the target price at Rs 300.

‘Hidden hints’ in Warren Buffet’s last letter







Berkshire Hathaway has taken a $4.3 billion stake in Google-parent Alphabet, lifting Alphabet’s shares nearly 7% to $293.40 in after-hours trading. The purchase makes Alphabet Berkshire’s tenth-largest U.S. stock holding and marks the conglomerate’s first-ever investment in Google since the company was founded in 1998. The move surprised investors, especially as Warren Buffett has long described Apple — Berkshire’s largest holding — as a consumer products company rather than a technology bet.But the surprise didn’t end there. The recent 13F filing also showed that Berkshire has also slashed its holding in Apple. Berkshire’s Apple position was cut by almost 15%, or $10.6 billion, to around 238 million shares. Despite that Apple remains its biggest holding.Analysts say Berkshire Hathaway’s first-ever purchase of Alphabet shares likely reflects a shift in how the company approaches technology investments as new leaders take on a larger role. According to a Reuters report, the Alphabet stake was likely selected by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, the two investment managers who increasingly shape Berkshire’s $300 billion stock portfolio.Notably, both Combs and Weschler have previously pushed Berkshire toward tech names, including its Amazon investment in 2019.The size of the investment suggests it had Warren Buffett’s approval, even as he prepares to step down as CEO at the end of the year.A CNBC report quotes Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Company, who said the Alphabet purchase may signal that Berkshire is broadening its comfort zone in technology as leadership moves to the next generation.Analysts also point to Alphabet’s financial profile as a major factor. “We think Berkshire likely finds more comfort investing in GOOG over other tech plays given the high free cash flow potential of its core business coupled with an attractive valuation at about 22x 2027 EPS amid a healthy top-line growth trajectory,” said Angelo Zino, an Alphabet analyst at CFRA as quoted by CNBC.Together, these factors—leadership transition, growing familiarity with the tech sector, and Alphabet’s strong cash generation and valuation—help explain why Berkshire bought Google shares for the first time in 27 years.As Berkshire Hathaway makes rare moves into new technology holdings, Warren Buffett is simultaneously preparing shareholders for a leadership shift — but not a complete retreat. His Thanksgiving letter this year read: “I’m ‘going quiet.’” But the next line added an important nuance: “Sort of.”Starting 2026, Greg Abel will write Berkshire’s annual shareholder letter and take questions at the company’s annual meeting. Buffett said he plans to join the directors on the arena floor rather than lead the event. Even so, he told investors he will “continue talking to you and my children about Berkshire via my annual Thanksgiving message.”Another notable part about this year’s message was pages — it was more than a 7-page letter, double than the one in 2024. It also covered familiar Buffett themes: aging, luck, long relationships in Omaha, praise for Berkshire’s shareholders and executives, and clear confidence in Abel’s ability to run the company. He even shared a childhood memory of fingerprinting nuns while hospitalized because “someday a nun would go bad.","Berkshire Hathaway has taken a $4.3 billion stake in Google-parent Alphabet, lifting Alphabet’s shares nearly 7% to $293.40 in after-hours trading.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Telangana high court orders release of Revan land in lieu of bank guarantees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/telangana-high-court-orders-release-of-revan-land-in-lieu-of-bank-guarantees/articleshow/125400833.cms,"HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday ordered release of assets belonging to Bengaluru-based Revan Infra that were frozen in connection with the alleged disproportionate assets cases against former AP chief minister and YSRCP chief YS Jagan Mohan Reddy , in exchange for bank guarantees to be submitted. The cases are currently pending before the CBI court, Hyderabad.Justice J Sreenivasa Rao passed the orders while dealing with a petition filed by Jagati Publications, Indira Television, and Janani Infra, urging the court to allow them to swap the original security for a new one.The assets were initially frozen by ED in 2012 over alleged financial irregularities, but the court previously allowed the bank accounts of Jagati Publications and Indira Television to be reopened to ensure staff salaries could be paid, provided a bank guarantee was furnished. Following this, Revan Infra offered three parcels of land near Bengaluru, totalling nine acres, as security.Meanwhile, in the present petition, Jagati Publications and Indira Television contended before the court that Revan Infra wanted to withdraw their land security and that they were ready to furnish a new bank guarantee instead. The CBI opposed the proposal and argued that the assets furnished by Revan Infra were also part of the crime proceeds and that they should not be released until the trial in the matter was completed.","The assets were initially frozen by ED in 2012 over alleged financial irregularities.

These three factors favour the continuation of the ongoing mild rally in India. ”“FIIs turning buyers also is a positive; but it is too early to say that this is a trend.

"'Heavy debt, rising costs': UK’s largest pub group to sell around thousand sites; eyes deal worth 1 billion pounds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/heavy-debt-rising-costs-uks-largest-pub-group-to-sell-around-thousand-sites-eyes-deal-worth-1-billion-pounds/articleshow/125378123.cms,"Stonegate Group, the UK's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering selling approximately 1,000 of its most profitable ""platinum"" pubs for an estimated £1 billion. This move aims to address the company's substantial £3 billion debt burden. The sale of these separately structured sites would not impact the rest of Stonegate's extensive estate.





Stonegate Group, the UK’s largest pub operator and owner of chains including Slug & Lettuce and Be At One, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds, Independent reported.The move comes as the group seeks to address an estimated 3 billion pounds in accumulated debts.According to Independent, the sites under consideration form a portfolio of the group’s most profitable pubs, often described as its “platinum” collection. These pubs are structured as a separate entity within Stonegate, allowing a sale without affecting the rest of its estate of 4,300 sites. Executives are consulting advisers on options, including selling the pubs in smaller groups rather than in a single transaction.A Stonegate spokesperson told The Sun that no pubs are at risk of closure and all sites will continue to operate under the Stonegate brand. Analysts note that many UK pub chains remain under pressure, with several, such as Oakman Inns & Restaurants, entering administration earlier this year due to elevated costs and reduced revenue.Stonegate’s financial difficulties date back to its 2019 merger with rival company Ei, which left the group heavily indebted just months before the Covid-19 lockdown severely impacted the hospitality sector.Attempts to sell some sites in previous years were unsuccessful, and the group instead refinanced the platinum pubs with a 638 million pounds loan from private equity firm Apollo. The end of a non-call period on this loan in January could allow Stonegate to pursue a potential sale, The Independent reported.Chief executive David McDowall, who joined the company from BrewDog in 2023, had outlined a “transformation plan” to return Stonegate to profitability. Despite these measures, the company posted a 214 million pounds loss in 2024.The wider UK hospitality industry too continues to face challenges from high operating costs, rising energy and food prices, increased national insurance contributions, and the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on customer spending.","Stonegate Group, the UK's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds.

Co-conspirator Kishan Rajeshkumar Patel was sentenced to 63 months in jail in June. Both pleaded guilty to the fraud.Mangukiya and Patel identified elderly individuals whom they contacted by phone, claiming to be officials from the government. They told the victims that they would need to make a deposit of cash, gold or other such items to resolve an investigation or prevent financial loss. A courier would coordinate the pickup of the deposits either from the victim's home or from the parking lot of a local business.In another case, they contacted an elderly woman and told her that they were from the Amazon fraud department. They told her that her social security number had been stolen and multiple bank accounts were opened in her name. Those accounts were used in a money laundering scheme.

The India connection



Will it make Pak army chief Asim Munir's position stronger?



Proposed change to Article 243 Description Why it increases Munir’s power Formal recognition of Field Marshal Field Marshal to be constitutionally recognized as a rank, not just an honorary title Grants Munir secure legal status, enabling tenure extension and legal protection against dismissal or demotion Creation of 'Commander of Defence Forces' (CDF) Establishes a new central position to oversee army, navy, air force Munir may transition to/head this role, consolidating command over all forces, superseding the current setup Shift of supreme command away from president to CDF Reduces President and PM’s operational control over armed forces Centralizes authority in Munir (as CDF or Field Marshal), further reducing civilian oversight Tenure extension via new constitutional language Secures longer term (potentially unlimited) for Munir in his new post Provides Munir greater continuity and leverage in national affairs Centralization of civilian government functions Ministries like education, population welfare moved under federal control Increases central government (and de facto military) power, indirectly empowering Munir Reduction of provincial autonomy Provincial share in federal resources reduced, central government gains more control Weakens provincial challenge to federal/military authority, strengthening Munir’s policy reach

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

Another crisis brewing? Pakistan on brink of food supply collapse as flour shortage deepens; prices hit the roof,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/another-crisis-brewing-pakistan-on-brink-of-food-supply-collapse-as-flour-shortage-deepens-prices-hit-the-roof/articleshow/125183013.cms,"Pakistan Cries Foul At UNSC As India Holds Indus Waters Treaty In Abeyance Over Pahalgam Attack

Prices surge, tandoors punished

Trade paralysis and a deepening food crisis

Water shortage adds to worries – dams running dry

Pakistan’s twin cities are staring at a worsening flour emergency after the Punjab food department halted wheat supplies to mills in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, triggering panic across markets and raising questions over the country’s fragile food security. The sudden suspension has deepened an already tense economic climate, with transport blockades, water shortages and declining dam levels all feeding fears of another nationwide crisis.Dealers say all existing orders for flour, wheat and fine flour were cancelled from Friday night, leaving shops and tandoor owners without stock, PTI reported citing the The Express Tribune.The Rawalpindi Flour Mills Association, which held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, warned that “production will remain paralysed” unless wheat permits are restored immediately. The association described the ban as “ill-considered” and cautioned that shortages could spiral into a humanitarian emergency in the federal capital and adjoining regions.Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers. According to the Pakistan Naanbai Association, the price of a 79-kilogram sack of red flour has doubled to PKR 11,000 since the Shehbaz Sharif–Maryam Nawaz government took office.Fine flour, used widely for bread and bakery items, has risen from PKR 6,200 to PKR 12,600.The association’s president, Shafiq Qureshi, accused authorities of “state oppression”, claiming that dozens of tandoors have been demolished and nearly a hundred sealed for selling roti at higher prices in line with rising flour rates. Many owners have been fined between PKR 25,000 and PKR 50,000. “Instead of fixing the wheat supply, they are taking out their frustration on us,” Qureshi said, warning that families are being pushed to breaking point as bread becomes increasingly unaffordable.While wheat supply chokes Punjab’s food chain, Pakistan’s transport routes are already gridlocked due to deteriorating relations with Afghanistan. Thousands of trucks carrying food items, pharmaceuticals and export consignments for Afghanistan and Central Asia have been stranded at ports and highways.Senior Vice Chairman of the Goods Transport Association Imdad Hussain Naqvi said drivers are stuck without food, water or security. “This is not just a loss for transporters; it's a loss for the entire state,” he said, as quoted by PTI. He further warned that perishable goods are rotting on highways and thousands of workers are on the brink of starvation.The current wheat crisis comes months after India regulated flows from the Chenab following the Pahalgam terror attack. The move had contributed to a sharp drop in water levels at the country’s two key dams, Mangla and Tarbela.Pakistan is among six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use, worsening freshwater losses amid arid conditions, according to the World Bank’s first global water monitoring report, Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future.The study highlights that inefficient irrigation in drying regions—particularly in Pakistan, Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Thailand, Tunisia, and Romania—drives massive water waste, with more than two-thirds linked to water-intensive crops.","Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers.

Ousted Bangladesh PM Hasina Calls ICT’s Death Sentence ‘Rigged’, Says It Denied Fair Trial Rights





Hours after a special tribunal in Bangladesh handed down a death sentence to ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina , India on Monday said it had taken note of the verdict and would continue ""engaging constructively"" with all stakeholders to support peace, democracy and stability in the neighbouring country.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said India remains committed to the welfare of the Bangladeshi people.Hasina was convicted of crimes against humanity by the country's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) and given the death penalty.The Awami League leader has been staying in India since she fled Bangladesh on August 5 last year amid massive protests.""India has noted the verdict announced by the 'International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh' concerning former prime minister Sheikh Hasina,"" the MEA said.""As a close neighbour, India remains committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country,"" it said.""We will always engage constructively with all stakeholders to that end,"" the MEA added.Earlier, Bangladesh's interim government urged India to immediately extradite deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, hours after a special tribunal sentenced them to death in absentia for ""crimes against humanity"".""We urge the Indian government to immediately hand over these two convicted individuals to the Bangladeshi authorities,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement, according to the state-run BSS news agency.It said the existing bilateral extradition agreement between Bangladesh and India marks the transfer of the two convicts as a compulsory responsibility for New Delhi.The ministry also said that granting shelter to individuals convicted of crimes against humanity would be considered an ""unfriendly"" act and a disregard for justice.Criticising the verdicts, Hasina described the process as “rigged” and alleged that the drive for a death sentence was a calculated effort by hardline officials to sideline her and undermine her party, Awami League.""In their distasteful call for the death penalty, they reveal the brazen and murderous intent of extremist figures within the interim government to remove Bangladesh’s last elected prime minister, and to nullify the Awami League as a political force,"" Hasina added.She also defended her record in office, citing Bangladesh’s accession to the International Criminal Court, the sheltering of Rohingya refugees, major gains in electricity access and education, and significant economic growth that lifted millions out of poverty.","India says it will continue ""engaging constructively"" with all stakeholders to support peace, democracy and stability in the neighbouring country.
