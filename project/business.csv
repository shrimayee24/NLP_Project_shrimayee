India and US in Advanced Talks for Co-Production of Combat Vehicles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-and-us-in-advanced-talks-for-co-production-of-combat-vehicles/articleshow/111044765.cms,"Rajat.PanditNew Delhi: India and the US are now in an “advanced stage of talks” for the proposed joint manufacture of the latest generation of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles (ICVs) as part of their defence-industrial cooperation roadmap.With the US also recently offering to demonstrate the mobility and firepower of the eight-wheeled Stryker in high-altitude areas in India, the defence ministry is examining a three-phase plan for the proposed project, sources told TOI. Under the plan, there will be a limited off-the-shelf purchase of the Strykers under the foreign military sales (FMS) programme of the US, which will be followed by joint production in India, and finally there will be co-development of its futuristic versions, sources said.All this, however, is contingent on the Stryker meeting the operational requirements of the Army’s mechanised infantry battalions as well as a high level of indigenisation and transfer of critical technologies to the Indian co-production partner, which could be a defence PSU or a private firm.“If the Stryker project is finalised, the existing Indian capabilities in ICVs will be taken into account. Strykers will have to be customised and technologically configured for Indian terrain, including operations in high-altitude areas like eastern Ladakh and Sikkim,” a source said.With the Army having a huge requirement of futuristic wheeled and tracked ICVs to progressively replace its existing fleet of over 2,000 Russian-origin BMP-II vehicles in the years ahead, MoD is also pursuing indigenous projects. “ Army also needs ICVs capable of amphibious operations in large numbers as well. Strykers are not amphibious,” another source said.The US is hard-selling the Strykers. Ahead of US national security advisor Jake Sullivan’s visit to India, secretary of defence Lloyd J Austin cited the “co-production of armoured vehicles with India” as yet another indicator of the upward trajectory in the bilateral defence partnership during the Shangri La dialogue in Singapore two weeks ago. The US, incidentally, has bagged lucrative Indian defence deals worth around $22 billion since 2007. While the Stryker project is still in the discussion stage, India and the US are conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for inking two mega deals within this financial year.The first is acquisition of 31 armed MQ-9B high-altitude, long endurance drones and associated equipment for $3.9 billion, as reported by TOI earlier. The second is the co-production of GE-F414 jet engines by General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics for the Tejas Mark-II fighters in India, with 80% transfer of tech for around $1 billion.","India and the US are now in an “advanced stage of talks’ for the proposed joint manufacture of the latest generation of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles.

"Doctors, students and activists team up to lead fight against NEET irregularities",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doctors-students-and-activists-team-up-to-lead-fight-against-neet-irregularities/articleshow/111045251.cms,"Three days before the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) on May 5, some students received pop-up alerts on Telegram: ""Leak paper available, price Rs 5000, message to buy @HQPaper.""The Supreme Court has now issued notices to the Centre and NTA on these alleged leaks after PILs piled up. But RTI activist Vivek Pandey says he had posted about these 'leak paper' offers on social media platforms even before the test. ""But it fell on deaf ears,"" he says. On May 5, the day of the exam, Pandey felt a sense of deja vu.But rather than just being happy with his I-told-you-so moment, Pandey has been spending most of his time filing complaints with the Union health ministry on the problems with NEET-UG, seeking updates from Bihar police about investigations into a leak from the state while also petitioning for action against the NTA in the SC. He had earlier filed an RTI seeking clarifications on the grace marks awarded by NTA which later withdrew them.Discrepancies in exams are personal for him. He attempted to pass the pre-medical test (PMT) in Madhya Pradesh for nearly four years but always ended up in failure. It was only when the Vyapam scam-where students cheated on a large scale to pass the state medical exam in connivance with senior officials, teachers and many middlemen- hit headlines that he realised that he was trying to win a fixed match. Pandey eventually cracked NEET but decided to work towards greater transparency in the medical education system , filing around 1,000 RTIs since 2016. Though no one paid heed to his warnings in May, they are paying attention now.""When the 'leak' stories came out, we had a small group of 50 students who were disturbed by the reports. Now our support group has expanded to 4,500,"" Pandey says, adding that there are lakhs who are now up in arms against the NTA.Like Pandey, Kota-based educator and students rights' advocate Dr Amit Gupta regularly posts videos sharing the plight of aspirants, amassing nearly 30,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter). Gupta, who completed his MBBS but decided to become a teacher instead, began his 'activism' in 2015 after the AIPMT paper leak. ""I gathered about 2,000 students, and we decided that enough was enough. Every time the cheaters just get away,"" Gupta says. The group held rallies and dharnas, demanding a re-exam. However, they soon realised that taking the judicial route would bear more fruit. Eventually, the SC ruled in their favour.Since then, 46-year-old Gupta has been fighting for other reforms too. This year, after the NEET results row, Gupta began helping students out to file petitions. Years of experience in fighting legal battles have come in handy as his lawyers help students draft petitions and crowdsource legal fees. ""If students take a single exam on one date with a single question paper in offline mode, there are bound to be leaks. Why can't we adopt the JEE model where multiple question papers are prepared and exams are held on different dates online?"" he asks.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has denied that there have been any leaks calling the allegations motivated. But the turmoil among students and parents has been hard to contain.Students Islamic Organisation of India too has been vocal in its protests on the exam. The group has about 10 lakh students in their network who look to them for career guidance or funds as many belong to economically deprived backgrounds. SIO national secretary Abdullah Faiz says they received 300 complaints from students related to NEET discrepancies. ""Then we saw reports about grace marks being given without a proper explanation, paper leaks in Bihar and Gujarat and six toppers from just one centre in Haryana. We decided to file a petition as we no longer trust the agency conducting the exam."" SIO also conducted a survey among its students and found 64% had encountered problems like delayed start or early finish of the exam while 48% found discrepancies or errors in their scorecard. The most troubling thing, Faiz says, is that controversies surrounding the exam had impacted the mental health of over 70% of students.Desperate students have hit social media, organised street protests and petitioned influencers and politicians. The recent controversies also prompted Dr Dhruv Chauhan, national council coordinator with the Indian Medical Association Junior Doctors Network, to request a re-examination. ""Students have approached me saying they feel helpless. They and their families spend years planning and preparing for a medical career. Their faith has been shaken,"" Chauhan says.Among the other petitioners are coaching institutes such as PhysicsWallah's Alakh Pandey and students like 19-year-old Andhra student Jaripiti Kartheek who took the exam for the third time. Even with the result of 506, he finds himself at a rank of 200520 which makes state medical colleges out of reach. ""So many of the students who sat for the exam are struggling. NTA should change its approach-divide the courses and branches, and conduct different exams for each,"" he says.",The Supreme Court has now issued notices to the Centre and NTA on these alleged leaks. RTI activist Vivek Pandey says he had posted about these 'leak paper' offers on social media platforms even before the test. Pandey has been filing complaints with the Union health ministry on the problems with NEET-UG.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111045367,imgsize-37030,width-400,resizemode-4/111045367.jpg"

With Biden headed to Italy, White House said aboard Air Force One there’s an “encounter” likely between the 2 leaders as the president expects to see the Indian PM there, while reiterating it will continue to raise the foiled Sikh separatist murder plot at very senior levels with India.This is the first time the leaders will meet after their bilateral talks over dinner at Modi’s residence here, on the eve of the G20 summit India hosted last year in September. While a formal bilateral meeting isn’t ruled out in Italy, it’s possible that the leaders might just have a pull-aside because of scheduling constraints.PM Modi , in fact, will have a hectic bilateral schedule at G7 with meetings already confirmed with French president Emmanuel Macron, UK PM Rishi Sunak, Japanese PM Fumio Kishida, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian PM Giorgia Meloni. Modi is also likely to meet Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He had met him at the G7 summit in Hiroshima too last year. Zelenskyy had invited Modi for the peace summit in Switzerland, but India never considered participation at the highest level because of efforts to keep Russia out. There was no meeting scheduled with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau till late on Thursday.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, US NSA Jake Sullivan also said that the foiled murder-for-hire plot against Khalistan separatist and US national Gurpatwant Singh Pannun will be “a continuing topic of dialogue between the US and India, including at very senior levels”. Diplomatic sources did not rule out the possibility of the issue coming up in the Modi-Biden meeting.Biden had taken up the issue during his meeting with Modi in September and Sullivan is himself likely to discuss progress, or lack thereof, in the probe India is conducting into the US allegations that an Indian official masterminded the plot during his visit to India next week. While the visit has not been officially announced yet, Sullivan is scheduled to be here on June 18. He’s expected to meet his counterpart for a comprehensive review of the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET) that Modi and Biden had launched in May 2022.“He (Biden) expects to see Prime Minister Modi here. It's up to the Indians to formally confirm his attendance, but our expectation is that the two of them will have the opportunity to encounter one another. The nature of that encounter is still fluid because so much of the schedule is fluid,” said Sullivan.Asked about the issue by reporters accompanying the president, Sullivan said the US will continue to raise the issue, like in the past, at the highest level with India. “We have made our views known on this issue, and it will be a continuing topic of dialogue between the US and India, including at very senior levels,” added the official.","PM Narendra Modi is likely to meet US President Joe Biden Friday on the margins of the G7 summit in southern Italy’s Puglia region.

A lot hinges on the USA vs Ireland game in Group A of the T20 World Cup on Friday, but the flood situation in Florida and forecast for more spells of heavy rain threaten to wash out the game, which works in favour of the home team.The three remaining matches in Group A are all scheduled to be held at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill, Florida.It is one of the three stadiums in the US hosting some of the group-stage matches of the T20 World Cup. The other two venues are in New York and Dallas.On Friday, USA find themselves on the brink of another history-making moment with a chance to progress to the 'Super 8s' stage in their debut appearance in the T20 World Cup, and the inclement weather in Florida can make the equation even simpler.If the game gets washed out, USA will move to five points and finish at No. 2 to join group-leaders India as the two teams to enter the 'Super 8s'. That will leave the remaining two matches of the group in Florida -- India vs Canada (June 15) andPakistan vs Ireland (June 16) -- meaningless.However, if weather allows a result-oriented game on Friday and Ireland manage to beat the US, it will breathe new life into Pakistan's campaign. The Babar Azam-led team will then have to beat Ireland, which will take Pakistan through to the next stage in the tournament, edging out USA on net run-rate.For the third day in a row, a line of storms spanning from the west to the east coast of Florida brought heavy rainfall and flooding to certain areas on Thursday, increasing the risk of flash flooding into the evening hours -- according to an AP report.Meteorologists have cautioned residents of Florida to brace for more flash flooding following a tropical disturbance that brought up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain to the southern regions of the state. The situation is anticipated to deteriorate on Friday.Heavy rainfall on Wednesday caused flash flooding from Fort Lauderdale to downtown Miami.Forecasters predict higher rainfall totals, with an additional 4 to 8 inches expected and the possibility of some areas receiving over 10 inches.","USA play Ireland in Group A of the T20 World Cup on Friday.

CM Siddaramaiah defends hike in petrol and diesel prices

BJP to stage protests across Karnataka against

fuel price hike

NEW DELHI: The Karnataka government 's announcement of hike in petrol and diesel prices by Rs 3 per litre and Rs 3.02 per litre respectively has garnered strong reactions from opposition leaders and residents.(Inflation has increased exponentially)!"" reacted Union minister of petroleum and natural gas Hardeep Singh Puri. ""After not fulfilling the promises of transferring Rs 8500/month to a woman of each family, Congress ruled Karnataka government has saddled the people of Karnataka with the burden of paying Rs 3/litre more for petrol and diesel in the state,"" the BJP leader wrote on X.""After this decision, people of Karnataka would be forced to pay higher amounts for food items, clothing, medicines and all items of basic necessities as fuel prices directly impact prices of all goods. Such a decision just after elections have been concluded, exposes the hypocrisy of the Congress which talks about mehengai but levies approximately Rs 8litre-Rs 12/litre additional VAT in comparison with BJP ruled states,"" he added.Puri said that Karnataka petrol prices are now Rs 8.21 per litre more expensive compared to BJP-ruled states Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. Comparing Karnataka with BJP-ruled Arunachal Pradesh, Puri said petrol costs over Rs 12 per litre less while diesel is Rs 8.59 per litre cheaper in Arunachal.""During the last three years of global energy turmoil, the NDA government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji deftly diversified India’s crude oil purchases to ensure that petrol prices actually decreased by about 14% and diesel prices fell by nearly 11% during November 2021 -May 2024 period. During the same period, US saw petrol prices soar 29%, while neighbours Pakistan and Sri Lanka faced severe financial stress due to spike in global crude prices,"" Puri wrote.Puri said that while the world was facing fuel price surge due to a war in Europe, India remained the only country during that period where petrol and diesel prices went down. ""To maintain availability and affordability of transport fuels, Modi government made substantial and timely cut in excise duty in November 2021 and followed it up with another cut in May 2022. The Central govt reduced petrol and diesel prices by Rs5 per litre and Rs10 per litre, respectively, in November 2021. Following up in May 2022, petrol and diesel prices were further cut by ₹8 per litre and ₹6 per litre, respectively. Again on March 14 this year, the OMCs played a vital role in reducing prices further by Rs 2/litre.""""The BJP-run state governments aligned with the pro-people policies and reduced sales tax on transport fuels to further cut rates for the public and rein in inflationary pressures. For instance, petrol prices in Congress-ruled Telangana is Rs 12.76/litre higher than in UP. The difference in diesels prices between these two states is also significant at Rs 7.89/litre. Similarly, the petrol prices are Rs 9.29/ litre higher in Trinamool Congress-run West Bengal compared with BJP-run Gujarat,"" he added.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah stood behind the decision to raise petrol and diesel prices, explaining that the increase will fund essential public services and development projects.""The Government of Karnataka has increased VAT on petrol to 29.84 per cent and on diesel to 18.44 per cent. Even after this hike, our state's taxes on fuel remain lower than most South Indian states and similar economy-sized states like Maharashtra,"" the CM said in a statement.""Karnataka's VAT adjustment ensures we can fund essential public services and development projects. The state remains committed to balanced and responsible governance,"" Siddaramaiah emphasised.Siddaramaiah pointed out that despite the VAT hike, diesel prices in Karnataka are still lower than in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. ""We remain committed to keeping fuel prices reasonable for our citizens,"" he added.Karnataka leader of opposition and BJP leader R Ashoka announced that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will organise a protest on Monday against the state government’s hike in fuel prices. The demonstration will involve bullock carts and bikes stationed in front of the Vidhana Soudha.R Ashoka stated, ""We are against the increase in petrol and diesel prices by the state Congress government. Tomorrow, we are going to protest at Freedom Park in Bangalore at 11:30 am. This protest will be led by BJP State President BY Vijayendra and myself. We are going to protest against the Congress government across the state. The Congress government has increased the price of petrol and diesel because people did not vote for the Congress party in this Lok Sabha election.""Ashoka, along with BJP MLC Chalavadi Narayanaswamy, unveiled a poster pointing out that Congress leaders had previously protested fuel price hikes under the prior state government. ""Previously, Siddaramaiah protested during the price hike during our government,"" R Ashoka said.Siddaramaiah's video byte was also released by R Ashoka in which he said that if he comes to power, he will reduce the price of petrol.R Ashoka further said, ""Siddaramaiah is an outgoing CM. He will not hesitate to sell the Vidhan Sabha while leaving the post of CM. Congress has given misfortunes in the last one year after coming to power. The people of Karnataka are being oppressed. He increased the price of milk and stamp duty. Electricity tax and house tax have been increased.

'No attempts to saffronise

curriculum'

'We want to create positive citizens'

NEW DELHI: NCERT 's director Dinesh Prasad Saklani said on Sunday that teaching about riots in school textbooks would not have a ""positive"" impact on the citizens and create ""violent and depressed individuals"". He was referring to the changes made regarding chapters based on Gujarat riots and Babri masjid demolition .In an interview to PTI, Saklani said, ""Why should we teach about riots in school textbooks? We want to create positive citizens not violent and depressed individuals"".Saklani's remarks came after the release of updated textbooks that feature numerous omissions and alterations. The revised Class 12 political science textbook describes the Babri Masjid as a ""three-domed structure"" and has reduced the Ayodhya section from four pages to two. It has also removed specific details that were present in the previous version of the textbook.The recent revisions in the textbooks involve removing references to BJP's 'rath yatra' from Somnath to Ayodhya in Gujarat, the involvement of 'kar sevaks' and communal unrest following the demolition of the Babri Masjid, the imposition of President's rule in BJP-governed states, and the BJP's statement expressing regret about the events in Ayodhya.Responding to allegations of saffronisation in curriculum and textbooks, Saklani said, ""If something has become outdated, it should be updated. There's no reason it shouldn't be changed. I don't see this as saffronisation. We teach history to provide students with factual knowledge, not to turn it into a battleground.""Talking about the deletions made in textbooks that include role of 'kar sevaks' in Babri Masjid demolition, Saklani said, ""If Supreme Court has given a verdict in favour of Ram temple, Babri masjid or Ram janmabhoomi, should it not be included in our textbooks, what is the problem in that? We have included the new updates.""If we have constructed new Parliament, should our students not know about it. It is our duty to include the ancient developments and recent developments,"" he added.""There are no attempts to saffronise curriculum, everything is based on facts and evidence,"" he said.Regarding accusations of saffronisation in the curriculum and textbooks, the 61-year-old told PTI, ""If something has lost relevance, it should be updated. Why shouldn't it? I don't see any agenda here. Our goal in teaching history is to educate students with factual information, not to turn it into a contentious issue.""""If we are telling about Indian Knowledge System, how can it be saffronisation? If we are telling about iron pillar in Mehrauli and saying Indians were way ahead of any metallurigical scientist, are we saying wrong? How can it be saffronisation?"", he added.Suggested that there is not the same level of outcry regarding the absence of the 1984 riots from textbooks, Saklani said, ""Should we teach our students in a manner that they become offensive, create hatred in society or become victim of hatred? Is that education's purpose? Should we teach about riots to such young children ... when they grow up, they can learn about it but why school textbooks.""""Let them understand what happened and why it happened when they grow up.

Under the plan, there will be a limited off-the-shelf purchase of the Strykers under the foreign military sales (FMS) programme of the US, which will be followed by joint production in India, and finally there will be co-development of its futuristic versions, sources said.All this, however, is contingent on the Stryker meeting the operational requirements of the Army's mechanised infantry battalions as well as a high level of indigenisation and transfer of critical technologies to the Indian co-production partner, which could be a defence PSU or a private firm.""If the Stryker project is finalised, the existing Indian capabilities in ICVs will be taken into account. Strykers will have to be customised and technologically configured for Indian terrain, including operations in high-altitude areas like eastern Ladakh and Sikkim,"" a source said.With the Army having a huge requirement of futuristic wheeled and tracked ICVs to progressively replace its existing fleet of over 2,000 Russian-origin BMP-II vehicles in the years ahead, MoD is also pursuing indigenous projects. "" Army also needs ICVs capable of amphibious operations in large numbers as well. Strykers are not amphibious,"" another source said.The US is hard-selling the Strykers. Ahead of US national security advisor Jake Sullivan's visit to India, secretary of defence Lloyd J Austin cited the ""co-production of armoured vehicles with India"" as yet another indicator of the upward trajectory in the bilateral defence partnership during the Shangri La dialogue in Singapore two weeks ago. The US, incidentally, has bagged lucrative Indian defence deals worth around $22 billion since 2007. While the Stryker project is still in the discussion stage, India and the US are conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for inking two mega deals within this financial year.The first is acquisition of 31 armed MQ-9B high-altitude, long endurance drones and associated equipment for $3.9 billion, as reported by TOI earlier. The second is the co-production of GE-F414 jet engines by General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics for the Tejas Mark-II fighters in India, with 80% transfer of tech for around $1 billion.","India and the US are now in an ""advanced stage of talks"" for the proposed joint manufacture of the latest generation of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles.

NCERT chief: Riot lessons in texts can create 'violent citizens',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ncert-chief-riot-lessons-in-texts-can-create-violent-citizens/articleshow/111043771.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rejecting accusations of saffronisation of the school curriculum , NCERT director Dinesh Prasad Saklani clarified that references to the Gujarat riots and Babri Masjid demolition were modified in school textbooks to avoid creating ""violent and depressed citizens"".Textbooks have seen several crucial topics dropped or altered. The assertion that ancient DNA from the Rakhigarhi site rules out Aryan immigration, leading to calls for more research into whether the Harappans and Vedic people were the same, has been removed. Also omitted is a detailed table of Mughal emperors' achievements. Other deletions include BJP's 'rath yatra' from Somnath to Ayodhya, the role of kar sevaks, communal violence after the Babri Masjid demolition, President's rule in BJP-governed states, and BJP's ""regret over the happenings in Ayodhya"".The new Class 11 political science textbook claims political parties prioritise minority groups' interests for ""vote bank politics"", leading to ""minority appeasement"", a shift from the 2023-24 session's focus on the lack of evidence for this idea. Additional changes include dropping references to the Babri Masjid demolition, the killing of Muslims in the Gujarat riots, Hindutva, and tweaking the reference to Manipur's merger with India.During an interaction with PTI, Saklani emphasised that these tweaks were part of the annual revision process and should not stoke a controversy. ""Why should we teach about riots in school textbooks? We want to create positive citizens. Should we educate our students in a way that makes them offensive or creates societal hatred? Teaching about riots at a young age is unnecessary; they can learn about these events as they grow up,"" he said and pointed out that there was no similar outcry over the absence of the 1984 riots in textbooks.Saklani's comments come as new textbooks, featuring several deletions and changes, were released. The revised Class 12 political science textbook now refers to Babri Masjid as a ""three-domed structure"" and focuses more on SCjudgment that allowed the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site, rather than the details of the Ayodhya issue. This judgment led to reconstruction of the temple with the consecration performed by the PM on Jan 22.Responding to allegations of curriculum saffronisation, Saklani said, ""If something has become irrelevant, it must be changed... We teach history based on facts, not to create conflicts. Talking about the Indian knowledge system or the metallurgical advancements demonstrated by the iron pillar in Mehrauli is not saffronisation.

Between Wednesday and June 25, FM Nirmala Sitharaman is slated to meet economists, farm sector exports, market participants, bankers and labour unions, among others.Besides, on Saturday, she will meet state finance ministers to seek their inputs on the Budget, before joining them for the GST Council meeting in the afternoon.While the proposal for expanding PLI to more sectors has been on the table for a while, including to speciality chemicals where European companies are retreating, there have been issues around the size of investment that should be promoted by govt as large global champions are sought to be created in India.The details of the MSME package are yet to be firmed up but the idea is to empower small businesses, which were a focus of the post-Covid scheme too, so that there is enough impetus to create employment in the largest sector after agriculture.Jobs, both in terms of quantity and quality, have been a key concern during the polls and many see BJP falling short of the majority mark as a fallout of the widespread discontent on this count. There have been multiple suggestions to increase income levels for women, and increase their participation in the workforce, including through some tax arrangements. Officials said the proposals will be discussed in detail as women are a key target group for NDA.","Jobs, both in terms of quantity and quality, have been a key concern during the polls.

NEW DELHI: Taking a serious view of the row over National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for admission to medical colleges, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said no one, including officials of National Testing Agency that conducts the exams, would be spared if irregularities were found, and interests of all students who took the test would be protected. Govt is looking at reforms to ensure that such problems do not occur in future.Pradhan, who took charge of the key portfolio last week, noted that ""some irregularities in NEET have come to light from some specific locations"" and assured students that these would not be tolerated.""Some irregularities have come to light in two places. I assure students and parents that govt has taken this seriously. Even if big officials of NTA are found guilty, they will not be spared. A lot of improvement is required in NTA. The govt is concerned about this, no culprit will be spared, they will get the harshest punishment,"" Pradhan said.NTA and the education ministry are looking into allegations of paper leak at some centres in Patna, which has been flagged by local police although govt officials maintained that the number of candidates who cleared the exams from these centres was not significant. Usually, as a matter of abundant precaution, there are two sets of papers, with the final one to be used decided on the morning of the exam.Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said no one, including officials of National Testing Agency, would be spared if irregularities in NEET were found. The assurance came amid attacks from the opposition over NEET-UG, where 23 lakh candidates appeared on May 5. The results were declared on June 4, and NTA has come under severe criticism, amid allegations of irregularities, inflated marks and paper leakin the medical entrance exam.Stating that information on alleged irregularities have emerged from some specific places, Pradhan said, ""Govt is working towards its resolution and reform. Keeping the cognisance of the (Supreme) court, specific action has been initiated. Everything is being done under supervision of the court.""The minister added that the govt was committed to 100% transparency for an important exam like NEET. ""The Supreme Court itself is keeping an eye on the matter. We will not let anything wrong happen .""Earlier on Friday, Pradhan had indicated that scrapping the entire entrance examination was unlikely as the sanctity of the process could not be judged by alleged irregularities in a handful of centres. Some states with a large presence of a powerful lobby of education institutes have been opposing NEET and officials argued that coaching centres were fanning the controversy as the syllabus was aligned with Class 12, helping more students secure high marks.Officials said of the 4,750 centres, concerns were expressed in the case of eight centres as less time was given in some of these centres, resulting in NTA giving grace marks.","Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said no one, including officials of National Testing Agency, would be spared if irregularities were found.

"After terror strikes, Amit Shah reviews scene; Jammu troop levels to go up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-terror-strikes-amit-shah-reviews-scene-jammu-troop-levels-to-go-up/articleshow/111043694.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Jammu division of J&K - which witnessed back-to-back terror attacks in its Reasi, Kathua and Doda districts last week - is set to get a big boost in number of security forces who will dominate the mountain tops to tackle fresh infiltration bids by terrorists from Pakistan. The security forces will also comb the forested and undulating terrain for terrorists holed up there with an intent to create unrest and communal flare-up among the region's mixed Hindu-Muslim population.At a review meeting chaired by him here on Sunday, home minister Amit Shah directed security agencies to use ""innovative means"" and replicate the successes achieved in Kashmir region over the past few years - as reflected in the sharp decline in terrorist attacks and law-and-order-related incidents in the traditional Valley hotbeds, record flow of tourists and high voter turnouts in recent Lok Sabha polls - by rolling out an area domination plan and zero-terror plan in the Jammu division that seems to be the new target of Pakistan-based terror outfits .Shah, in a separate meeting, reviewed security and other arrangements for Amarnath Yatra beginning June 29. Among measures stressed by him to make the yatra secure and hassle-free for devotees were tracking their movement and that of yatra vehicles through RFID tags, deployment of sufficient security personnel, proper sanitisation of routes, fortification of camps and disaster preparedness.Both meetings were attended by NSA Ajit Doval, J&K LG Manoj Sinha and officials from MHA, J&K, Army, paramilitary forces & intel agencies.Pointing to Modi govt's resolve to uproot terrorism in all its forms through ""innovative means and seamless coordination among various security agencies"", Amit Shah said the fight against terrorism in J&K was in a decisive phase. He emphasised on seamless coordination among security agencies, identifying vulnerable areas and addressing the security concerns of such areas. Reiterating govt's zero-tolerance policy against terrorism and commitment to crack down on terrorists through ""innovative means"", he directed all security agencies to work in a mission mode and ensure quick response in a coordinated manner.Sources told TOI that the revised counter-terror strategies for Jammu region shall include returning to the force deployment pattern of the 1990s, with more personnel guarding the mountain tops, resuming and intensifying counter-operations sector-wise and strengthening village defence committees in all districts in Jammu by refining their training and equipping them better to bust future terror strikes .""The deployment levels of J&K police, central paramilitary forces as well as Army troops will be considerably enhanced in the Pir Panjal region,"" a senior officer said.With higher force deployment expected to boost the intelligence flow and reduce response time to alerts on the presence or movement of terrorists in Jammu region - which unlike the flat-floor Valley has a difficult terrain with limited road and communication connectivity - counter-operations will be intensified in the days to come. Any local support to terrorists in Jammu division, like Kashmir, will invite serious consequences.Good flow of intelligence followed by quick response by counter-terror forces helped to curb terrorist activities in the Valley, an officer said and added that the strategy will now be replicated in Jammu.",Security forces will dominate the mountain tops to tackle fresh infiltration bids by terrorists from Pakistan. The security forces will also comb the forested and undulating terrain for terrorists holed up there. The aim is to create unrest and communal flare-up among the region's mixed Hindu-Muslim population.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111043751,imgsize-65658,width-400,resizemode-4/111043751.jpg"

The risk of being hacked by humans or AI, while small, is still too high,"" Musk wrote on X, sharing a post by Robert F Kennedy Jr which cited media reports about hundreds of voting irregularities related to EVMs in Puerto Rico.Chandrasekhar argued that Musk's view may be applicable to the US and other places where regular computing platforms are used to build ""internet-connected voting machines"".""This is a huge sweeping generalisation statement that implies no one can build secure digital hardware. Wrong,' he added.Rajeev Chandrasekhar added, ""Indian EVMs are custom designed, secure and isolated from any network or media - no connectivity, no bluetooth, wifi, internet, ie, there is no way in. Factory programmed controllers that cannot be reprogrammed.""He said EVMs could be ""architected and built correctly"", as India has done, and even offered to run a tutorial for Musk on the subject.Replying to this, Musk said, ""Anything can be hacked.""Chandrasekhar agreed that ""anything is possible"", at least in theory. ""With quantum compute, I can decrypt any level of encryption.

"Russia kept out of Ukraine meet, India doesn’t sign communique",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russia-absent-india-refuses-to-endorse-peace-communique/articleshow/111043270.cms,"NEW DELHI: The issue of Russia ’s absence loomed large at the peace summit in Switzerland, as India joined over a dozen other countries in not signing a joint communique that declared any peace agreement must be based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity. India backed out saying abiding peace isn’t possible in the absence of options acceptable to both sides, as the summit also could not elicit the kind of support Ukraine was hoping for from the Global South.Among others who did not back the communique, which was endorsed by 84 countries and organisations out of the 100 that participated, were important Indian BRICS partners like Brazil, South Africa and UAE apart from countries in the extended neighbourhood like Indonesia and Thailand.Saudi Arabia, Armenia, Bahrain, Colombia, Libya, Mexico and Suriname also didn’t sign on to the document. Given the efforts to keep Russia out, and Moscow’s own reservations about the summit, India was represented, as reported by TOI on Saturday and even earlier, only by a secretary-level official at the 2-day summitthat ended Sunday. India never considered participation at the highest or even ministerial level.Justifying India’s decision to not associate itself with any communique/document emerging from this Summit, MEA secretary (west) Pavan Kapoor, who led the Indian delegation, said in India’s view only those options acceptable to both parties can lead to abiding peace. ``In line with this approach, we have decided to not associate with the joint communique or any other document emerging from the summit,’’ said the official.The foreign ministry said in a separate statement a lasting and peaceful resolution requires ``sincere and practical engagement between the two parties to the conflict’’.``India’s participation in the Summit, as well as in the preceding NSA/Political Director-level meetings based on Ukraine’s Peace Formula, was in line with our consistent approach to facilitate a lasting and peaceful resolution to the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy,’’ said the Indian statement, alluding to Modi’s repeated assurances to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that India would do everything within its means to support a peaceful solution.However, India and others who did not endorse the communique had doubts about whether the peace summit would be able to achieve its objective of ``just peace’’ in the absence of Russia, the main party to the conflict along with Ukraine. The Indian government also said India will continue to remain engaged with all stakeholders as well as both the parties to contribute to all ``earnest efforts’’ to bring about an early and abiding peace.The communique said that the UN Charter and “respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty can and will serve as a basis for achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine’’. Zelenskyy had called Modi earlier this year to seek a high-level participation for the summit. He later also sent his foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba to India to explain the efficacy of his 10-point peace plan. India’s position on any peace process is also in line with the stand taken by China, which boycotted the summit altogether, that it’s imperative for such an initiative to involve both Russia and Ukraine.",India joined over a dozen other countries in not signing a joint communique that declared any peace agreement must be based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

'Robust and credible voting system': EC defends EVMs after Musk's remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/robust-and-credible-voting-system-ec-defends-evms-after-musks-remarks/articleshow/111042425.cms,"NEW DELHI: Reacting to Elon Musk ’s post on X about eliminating electronic voting machines ( EVMs ), a senior EC functionary said it was unfortunate that EVM methodology in India was being doubted when “it has systematically evolved and is accepted here, with the highest court having ruled in its favour time and again”.“Also, the electoral system in the US does not provide for a watchdog at par with the Election Commission of India that has its duties clearly laid out in Article 324 of the Constitution,” the functionary said.The EC functionary explained that each state in the US could choose its voting methodology and these ranged from paper ballot to direct recording electronic (DRE) systems with or without a paper trail. “Electronic systems are used variedly in the US systems, but none partakes the technical characteristics of Indian EVM. EVMs in India are standalone machines with mandatory voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) and are not connected to the internet. The EVM methodology is carefully ensconced in a rule-based operating procedure, providing for very robust and continuous disclosures to all stakeholders including political parties and candidates,” the functionary said.The functionary underlined that EVMs and VVPATs created an immutable audit trail for post-incident forensics. “Thus, the system finds validation not only in the successful conduct of national and state assembly elections since 2004 and more than 20 transition/transfer of power among political stakeholders. It has rightfully been validated through several court rulings, the most recent being the Supreme Court ruling after a very unusual ‘direct evidence’ being provided in open court by the EC,” he explained.The DRE systems in the US are varied and most rely on internet platforms, which distinguish them categorically from the Indian context. “Each voting methodology finds credibility among the electors in its respective country contexts. India has a robust system which heralded significant improvements over the difficulties and questions on credibility of the paper ballot system and thus has been accepted by the electors at large, as reflected in ever increasing voter turnouts,” the EC functionary said.","Senior EC functionary said it was unfortunate that EVM methodology in India was being doubted. “It has systematically evolved and is accepted here, with the highest court having ruled in its favour time and again,” he said.

"Prosecute Nestle for Cerelac 'scam', NGOs tell Swiss government",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prosecute-nestle-for-cerelac-scam-ngos-tell-swiss-government/articleshow/110977844.cms,"NEW DELHI: Food giant Nestle India is in spotlight again over its widely-sold baby food Cerelac . Global civil society organisations, Public Eye and IBFAN, have submitted a formal request to the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), urging legal action against Nestle “unethical and unfair business practices” in low- and middle-income countries.

Accusing the Swiss major of “double standards”, the NGOs had in April said the company’s two best-selling baby food brands sold in developing countries, including India, have a high content of added sugar, which is prohibited under WHO guidelines. Nestle’s misleading and aggressive marketing and its double standard over added sugar are unfair business practices that affect hundreds of thousands of people in poor countries, they said. The cessation of unethical practices is important not only to protect children, but also the reputation of Nestle’s home country, they said.

When contacted, a Nestle India spokesperson said: “We understand that the authorities are conducting analysis of infant cereals and infant formulas sold by all companies in the country.” It maintained its commitment to compliance and highlighted a reduction in sugar content by up to 30% in its baby food products in India over the past five years.

In April, days after the issue became public, Nestle India’s chairman and managing director Suresh Narayanan had said Cerelac complied with local food norms, saying added sugars in the baby food are much lower than what India’s food regulator permits.

The food giant controls 20% of the baby food market, valued at nearly $70 billion. With over $2.5 billion in global sales in 2022, Cerelac and Nido are some of Nestle’s best-selling baby food brands in low- and middle-income countries.

""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

SpinLaunch revolutionises satellite launch with kinetic energy technology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/spinlaunch-revolutionises-satellite-launch-with-kinetic-energy-technology/articleshow/111040576.cms,"NEW DELHI: SpinLaunch is revolutionising satellite launches by utilising a massive rotating arm that harnesses kinetic energy to propel 440-pound satellites into low Earth orbit without the need for rocket fuel . The company has already conducted successful tests, with founder and CEO Jonathan Yaney saying, ""This is not a rocket, and clearly our ability to perform in just 11 months this many tests and have them all function as planned, really is a testament to the nature of our technology."" SpinLaunch aims to launch constellations of satellites at altitudes below 600 miles by 2026.Satellites play a crucial role in monitoring Earth's health, including the detection of polluting methane leaks. A more environmentally friendly method of launching them is an exciting development for the scientific community.The concept of using kinetic energy to launch objects has been employed by humans for centuries, with trebuchets and siege machines being historical examples. Today, pumpkin chucking contests, also known as Punkin Chunkin , continue to be a popular way to demonstrate the principles of kinetic and potential energy physics.SpinLaunch's device resembles a giant upright disc with a cylindrical barrel pointing skyward. The 108-foot-long rotating arm spins at an impressive 5,000 miles per hour to achieve optimal launch conditions, with the vehicle reaching speeds of up to six times the speed of sound. The company attributes its success to advancements in low-cost, high-strength carbon fibre and miniature electronics, which enable satellites to withstand the kinetic launch environment, including a vacuum and rapid acceleration.Since its founding in 2014, SpinLaunch has raised tens of millions of dollars in funding and collaborated with organizations such as Nasa , Airbus, and Cornell University. The technology has demonstrated its resilience by enduring forces up to 10,000 times Earth's gravity. If proven reliable, SpinLaunch's system could significantly reduce the amount of fuel required for spacecraft launches, which is particularly important given the growing concerns about the impact of increasing launch frequencies on the ozone layer.Looking ahead, SpinLaunch plans to establish a coastal orbital launch site to further develop its technology. Yaney expressed confidence in the system's reliability, saying, ""It has proven that it's a system that is repeatedly reliable."" As the company continues to innovate and refine its approach, it has the potential to revolutionise the satellite launch industry while minimising its environmental impact.","SpinLaunch aims to launch constellations of satellites at altitudes below 600 miles by 2026.
